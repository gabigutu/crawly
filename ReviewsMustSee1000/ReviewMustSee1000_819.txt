		<shortDescription>Not just a prison film, but an excellent film about not being able to conform in a world that requires it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having had the advantage of reading Donn Pearce's novel about a year before seeing Cool Hand Luke, it was with great anticipation that I awaited it's transfer to the big screen. I was not disappointed.Cool Hand Luke could easily be classified by the misguided as just a prison yarn, but it is so much more than that. It is the story of a man who refuses to be nailed down or conform to the rules and regulations of a society that he has never craved to fit into. When Lucas Jackson is arrested for cutting heads off parking meters, his explanation to the prison captain(Strother Martin) is "Small Town, not much to do in the evening", which would have us believe he was just being drunk and stupid. Later, to one of the other inmates he mutters the same answer, but importantly adds "just settlin some old scores". It is a brief but important point in helping to define the character of Luke beyond just being drunk and damaging public property. As a service man, we also discover that Luke won a bronze star, achieved the rank of sergeant but came out as a private. Again, early evidence that Luke is unable to conform to any body's rules but his own. Yet, we are given clear evidence that Luke knows what is right in principal and what is wrong. At one point in the film when they are putting Luke in the box under less than reasonable circumstances, he tells the boss, "calling it your job don't make it right, Boss." In a visit from his mother Arletta(Jo Van Fleet), Luke says plenty about his own character by telling her, "A man's got to go his own way" or as he also puts it, "I tried to live always free and above board like you but I can't seem to find no elbow room". As Luke enters the prison that will supposedly be his home for the next two years, we meet the other inmates. Some of them wear chains, some of them do not. It is a point early in the film that director Stuart Rosenberg, emphasizes. We understand quickly that sooner or later you conform. You either walk the line the way the bosses tell you to, or they will find the means to get you to walk the line. As the Captain reiterates, "for your own good, you'll learn the rules" A point driven home often.What we discover about their crimes is minuscule. One is jailed for manslaughter after hitting a pedestrian with his car, another is a paper hanger, another new inmate is charged with breaking, entering and assault. The nature of their crimes is unimportant to us. It enables to view these prisoners as men, and while we don't feel any genuine sympathy for them, feeling disgusted by their crimes would have been a distraction from the true purpose of Pearce's story, and Luke as the focal point.Because of his individuality, it doesn't take Luke long before he unexpectedly becomes a hero to the other inmates. It is not a role he chooses, or even wants. It unexpectedly imposes the burden on him of having to live up to the expectations of others. He never truly understands the nature of this hero worship, and would be just as happy if he didn't have to deal with it. He is still trying to find his way in the world, and if there is any real purpose for his existence.Another principal character is Dragline(George Kennedy). It is he who finally establishes the fact that Cool Hand Luke is a man who can not be beaten. Dragline's admiration for Luke seems to extend from the fact that he(Dragline)has learned the rules on how to get by, but yet regrets having lost some of his own individuality in the process. He is the rest of the inmates in microcosm. I can't remember a role that George Kennedy has ever been better in, and he deservedly won the best supporting actor award.Cool Hand Luke is not without it's humorous moments especially in the early going. It is these moments that help move the film from the early stages to the darker more despairing later stages. Perhaps, for that reason alone we are even more effected by Luke's dilemma.In translating his novel to the screen Donn Pearce along with Frank Pierson, has managed to bring the heart and soul of his nove to the big screen. Lalo Shifrin's memorable score emphasizes often the repeated drudgery of working on the chain gang. Director Stuart Rosenberg made more good films after Cool Hand Luke, but in my opinion never achieved the same degree of perfection that he does here. As Cool Hand Luke, Paul Newman give one of the most memorable performances in a long distinguished career. It is not an easy task portraying a man who travels the road from being a sincere individualist, to a man who may be beaten and defeated, yet in the end is still unwilling to accept that fate. Although Rod Steiger won the best actor award that year, one could argue that Newman's role was more difficult, as it required substantially different subtle ranges in character. As for the failure of Cool Hand Luke to achieve a Best Picture nomination, I'm at a loss to explain that malfunction, especially when the likes of Doctor Doolittle and Guess Who's Coming To Dinner, far lesser efforts than this were nominated.Cool Hand Luke is a true classic in every sense of the word. It is a film that will long be remembered.My grade: A+ </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Luke" is a character Newman was born to play - and this is one hell of a beautiful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film got me from the first frame to the last. It's not even because of the story (which I love, of course) - it's just so very well made. And so modern. The kind of angles and perspectives the camera uses, the way it zooms in and out or even allows itself (literally) to get dirty - the way this whole picture was shot is just something I haven't seen in an American film released prior to this one. And yet, although it is considered a classic, when people talk about the "New Hollywood" somehow 'Cool Hand Luke' is hardly ever mentioned - despite the fact that it came out only a couple of months after 'Bonnie and Clyde' in 1967 and before 'The Graduate'. I look at this film mainly as a character study but the story arc also works very well and it hasn't aged a bit. This is one of those rare films that was way ahead of its time and which has simply everything: great acting, iconic characters and scenes, wonderful music - and the cinematography is just unbelievable. Funny, tragic and moving, 'Cool Hand Luke' is one hell of a film. What we've got here is NOT failure to communicate - but a 10 star masterpiece.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The anti-hero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the reasons that the late 60s/early 70s was such a powerful era in filmmaking is the emergence of the anti-hero (defined as an individual with heroic qualities, but not in a position we would usually find a hero). This is symbolized greatly in `Cool Hand Luke'. We can identify with Luke because his crime is venial and his concerns over the great questions of life are ours. It is because of this and his persuasive charm that the other prisoners (played remarkably well by Kennedy and a host of others to include Wayne Rogers, Ralph Waite, Dennis Hopper and one of the actors who played a crewmember on `Alien') live vicariously through him.Filled with memorable scenes (the boxing match, 50 eggs, the fealty of his fellow prisoners who help him finish his food after his stomach is shrunk in solitary confinement, `shakin' it here boss', the sneezing dogs, and of course the carwash part) and outstanding character development (created by what is said and what is not said, i.e. the visiting brother), one of screen history's most repeated lines and the great acting of Newman, this movie deserves to be called a classic. Released the same year as `Bonnie and Clyde', it makes one long for the days when you needed a real script to make a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The rebel character in Hollywood after the death of James Dean went through a period of transition and did not gain definite new characteristics until the late sixties...The three established rebel/anti-heroes in movies were Paul Newman, Warren Beatty, and Steve McQueen...In 1967, screen audiences were exposed to two new rebel hero characters, Clyde Barrow, a rebel without a cause with enough guts to strike out against any bank, and Luke Jackson, an anti-hero 'born to lose,' but a man full of pride and dignity..."Cool Hand Luke" resumes Newman's career as another rebel, a non-conformist, a perfect hero who beats the system wherever...Superbly directed by Stuart Rosenberg, Newman exhibits a complete arrangement of emotions invading every nuance and implication... Resources of his true command of his technical acting are breathtaking in their impact... The motion picture (nominated for 4 Academy Awards) won him his 4th Academy Award nomination... Newman is again a cynical loner, but he's also charming, and everything is calculated to involve us with him; like "Hombre," the film begins and ends with closeups of his face, but here, appropriately, he has an engaging smile? The opening, where he drinks beer, unscrews tops from parking meters and mumbles to the arriving cop, recalls Dean's drunken incoherence at the start of "Rebel Without a Cause"?an apt title for Luke? He breaks rules for no apparent reason, wherever he is, including the chain gang to which he's sentenced? Unlike Paul Muni in "I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang," who steals only to eat and is turned by society into a hardened criminal, Luke is a criminal from the start, and his crime isn't motivated by hunger? It's a meaningless anti-authority gesture?the existentialist "gratuitous act," committed purely for the sake of committing it? Luke engages our sympathy not because he is economically deprived or the product of an unhappy home, but because for him the act of rebellion is its own justification: he's the perfect sixties hero?Initially, Luke alienates the prisoners by his indifference and sarcasm, and the top dog, Dragline (George Kennedy) picks a fight with him? Luke is severely beaten but keeps fighting, and this?plus his continual defiance of the guards?wins him the men's respect? Their admiration grows when he proves he can eat 50 hard-boiled eggs, one after the other, in only one hour, another gratuitous act ("somethin' to do"). But Luke gradually becomes a victim of the excessive admiration, rebelling because they expect him to, which leads to a pattern of escapes and captures? As the warden says, "What we got here is a failure to communicate. Some men you just can't reach." Even though Luke becomes subservient after torture, he again escapes? Dragline admires the way he fooled the guards while planning all along to escape? But Luke says he really did break down, and asserts: "l never planned anything in my life." Even his last act is motivated not by heroism but by impulse?The physical punishment Newman's characters often undergo reaches an extreme here, as Luke constantly invites pain (in his fight with Dragline, he says, "You're gonna have to kill me."). Underlying his sometimes vigorous rebelliousness is despair at a cruelly indifferent world? But the men need a hero, and Dragline perpetuates the myth, telling them that he had "that Luke smile" to the very end? We last see a montage of shots of Luke smiling?the men's vision of him as unbeaten and almost immortal? Newman's performance is among his best, and Luke is one of his definitive studies of non conformism? As in "Hombre," he underplays, but in a loose, relaxed, "cool" manner? He's affecting in a wide range of moods: quiet detachment, wry contempt, raw courage, exhaustion, exuberance, gentleness, anger, resignation? There's a superb1y understated scene in which Luke's dying mother (Jo Van Fleet) visits him? Like Rocky Graziano, he says he tried to live cleanly, but could never find a way? But the mood is quite different here: instead of intense emotion, there are on1y ingenious expressions of uneasiness, regret, sadness, acceptance? Newman conveys his unspoken affection entirely through his glances and reactions, as she wistfully remarks that she once had high hopes for him? The actor even survives the film's pretentious attempts to make him a mock-Christ figure? Besides the obvious sacrifice-resurrection parallel, he's even shown in the exact crucifixion position following his fifty-egg (Last Supper?) ordeal? There are two badly conceived dialogs with a God he doesn't believe in?after which he realizes, "l gotta find my own way," a rather unconcealed statement of existential despair?but Newman performs them with quiet conviction?. His mock religion is better suggested by the bottle opener he wears in lieu of a religious medal? And the despair is effectively dramatized in his reaction to his mother's death? The men leave him by himself, and he sits on his bed, playing the banjo? With a sad, breaking voice, he sings a religious parody: "l don't care if it rains or freezes, long as 1 got my plastic Jesus?" He looks down and begins crying, but sings faster, obsessively, withdrawing into himself and expressing his utter loneliness in a world that has no God? It's one of the most moving scenes in all of Newman's work?Paralleled to "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," "Cool Hand Luke" is a character study, which works beautifully, very well-made with sense of graphic imagery and cinema view, a good-looking film with superb photography in Color, extremely good as an entertainment...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truly a memorable movie, and more than just a documentary about southern road gangs. It's a study on the theme of the indomitability of the human spirit in the face of oppression. I was about to name this as Newman's finest performance until I thought of Eddy Felsen in "The Hustler" and Frank Galvin in "The Verdict"; it's impossible to choose among such a cornucopia of acting achievements, but Luke is right up there (the analogy to Luke as Christ becomes a tad heavy-handed when we see him, at the close of the egg-eating scene, stretched out, arms outward, feet crossed, as if crucified; none the less, it's a powerful image). There is no doubt, however, about George Kennedy as Dragline; it is his finest achievement, and fully deserves the Oscar he got for Best Supporting Actor. It is also fascinating to find so many familiar faces among the inmates - actors such as Dennis Hopper, Harry Dean Stanton, Joe Don Baker, Ralph Waite. and Wayne Rogers - who would go on to fame in their own right. This movie can unquestionably be called a classic. American Movie Classics just started (11/2000) showing a beautifully restored letterbox version which shows it in all its glory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sticking it to the Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"For the secret of man's being is not only to live but to have something to live for. Without a stable conception of the object of life, man would not consent to go on living, and would rather destroy himself than remain on earth, though he had bread in abundance." - Fyodor Dostoyevsky. Stuart Rosenberg directs "Cool Hand Luke". The plot? Paul Newman plays Luke Jackson, a young drifter who returns home after WW2. Luke's been dealt one bad hand after the next, and, no matter how he plays his cards, always seems to lose. The film opens with Luke, drunk and shameless, knocking the heads off parking meters. The authorities try to cash in on our everyday movements, and this lack of freedom ticks Luke off. The poor guy just wants to be free, man.After being arrested, Luke is sent to a Florida prison. What then unfolds is one of the greatest existential movies of all time. Luke's experiences, his conversations with God, his isolation and alienation, and a pair of profound scenes, both involving his mother, elevate "Cool Hand Luke" above most prison-break movies.Of course this period saw a number of strong prison flicks ("The Great Escape", "The Bridge on the River Kwai", "King Rat", "Birdman of Alcatraz", "Papillon", "Cuckoo's Nest", "The Hole", "Escape from Alcatraz", "A Man Escaped", "Riot in Cell Block 11" etc), but "Cool Hand Luke" takes a far more mythical stance. We don't know much about Luke. He's held at a distance, never looks anyone in the eyes when speaking and always has a sly grin on his face. And yet behind his smile we sense deep pain, though its a pain matched by a dogged spirit to continue fighting. Interestingly, whilst a film like "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest" had a system that despite its flaws genuinely tried to heal and help others, Luke's social institution is corrupt and in many aspects pointless. Still, for a while Luke abides by it. He goes about the state's business with a smile, cutting grass and paving roads. He only has 2 years in chains. He can make it. And like he says, he has no place else to go. No plans. He plays his cards with cool, detached ambivalence.In one beautiful scene, Luke's dying mother comes to visit. What follows is a touching conversation, she informing us that tried her best with Luke, giving him nothing but love. And yet, no amount of motherly affection has helped her family. Because of this, she says, she "wishes mankind were like dogs". She wishes she could abandon her children and forget about them, never having to worry or fret about how they are, what they'll do or where they'll go. Of course she loves Luke, but hates the agony he puts her through. And yet we sense that she understands him intimately. Perhaps she admires him because she too has been dealt a life of bad hands.Luke's outlook changes when his mother dies and the prison warden locks him in a box for no particular reason. When the Boss says "Just doing my job", Luke replies "That don't make it right." From here on Luke begins to fight back. He refuses to spend his life on his knees and refuses to submit. The film then becomes a tale of resistance and idolatry. The other inmates quickly begin to idolise Luke, worshipping his never-give-up spirit. But rather than fight themselves, they sit back and exalt Luke, relying him to personify their own desires. Luke begins to resent this. "Step feeding off me!" he yells. But they're content to sit on the sidelines. He's a one man revolution, and like many revolutionaries is praised for his stance from afar but never actively supported. Why do men have to die for causes before we take notice?The film ends on an ambiguous note, in which Luke may or may not be riddled with bullets. Does Luke smile? Does he die? Does he survive? If he does survive, is his survival merely wishful thinking on the part of his fellow inmates? Note that the film's final image is a brief shot of a photograph. It was established in an earlier sequence that this idyllic photograph represents a lie. We also know that the photograph's image was staged and that the photograph itself was torn to shreds earlier in the film. The ending thus suggests that though Luke has died and the system utterly beaten him down, the men nevertheless choose to believe in him. They believe he has risen - indeed, the film is filled with Christian imagery) - that he's survived death and still fighting the fight, sticking it to the man for all of mankind.But like that photograph, the inmate's belief is an illusion. Luke is dead, and though his fighting spirit remains in the hearts of these men, it will take something larger to wake them up and shake them out of weak surrender. In the end, "Cool Hand Luke" suggests something almost contradictory: that hope must be held onto lest we submit, but that such hope, fuelled by a kind of mythologising and shared delusion, is precisely what engenders submission. 9/10- An accidental masterpiece. The planets really lined up for this one. The only flaw is an overly silly (though iconic) car wash scene.Worth multiple viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Failure To Communicate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:As an earlier excellent reviewer wrote the film is about conformity and Luke's inability to fit in the role cut out for him. He says,"I tried Arletta...," but it is much more than this: it is the voice of the counterculture whose hero Luke is. Like Dirty Harry, Luke looks at 'the man's world,' and sees nothing that interests him. A modern, much lesser parallel is Coppola's RUMBLE FISH. Rourke is like Luke; he just cannot find anything that is offered that appeals to him. His rebellion is existential; he simply has a being in the world that will not work anywhere. So, he becomes nihilistic like Motorcycle Boy. Both Harry, Luke and Motorcycle Boy have great courage but they were born in the wrong place and the wrong time. Boredom consumes Luke; the egg eating contest, besides providing the only levity in the film, delineates the depth of Luke's nihilistic rebellion. He vents at the Deity; on the road and in the church daring Him to let me have it," you there Old Man?"It must be seen for what it is at its core; like all films it is a product of its zeitgeist. Here, it is the 60s, get the man. Like Harry, the system is stupid, broken and cruel. Luke sneers contemptuously at the boss and says,"saying its your job don't make it right boss." The other target is the hypocrisy of his keepers protecting their tender consciences from the cruelty they are subjecting the prisoners too. I love,"I wish you'd stop being so good to me captain." This provokes Strother Martin because they all need to hide in the 'man's game' of putative rehabilitation instead of sadistic punishment which is what it is. Luke's strength that wins the hearts of all the others is also his fatal flaw. Luke cannot stop his rebellion; it is inherently nihilistic like Motorcycle Boy's. He wishes to die; after Arletta goes the last tether to existence is cut. He goes down a death spiral. Dragline looks at him befuddled; why does he not stop?: because he can't. Yes, like both of Rosenberg's prison movies this and BRUBAKER they are about the cruelty of prison. Yet, COOL HAND Luke is a study of an existential drop out; the world simply has no place for him. It is an error to attack the movie as not really a movie but a series of episodes. These episodes: egg contest, dragline fight, escapes, all function to reveal Luke's Dasein or being there. Luke is escaping but from life; he does not really grasp it himself. Arletta's death is the final straw; as he sings PLASTIC Jesus, that is how the world is to him; an empty, phony facade full of rule making hypocritical liars. He wants no more of it; they break him, but the pull downward is ineluctable. He cannot help himself. The last sneering mockery that brings about his death is the quintessence of Luke: he vomits back their lying hypocrisy. We see astonishment on his face; the world he never really was in destroyed him. It is a sad, dark often sacrilegious film; it may deviate from my beliefs that does not make me honor it any less. PAUL NEWMAN'S BEST MOVIE. Watch what society does to deviants; it is not a pretty picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the top ten films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an absolute perfect movie in every way.Storyline,acting,settings---everything is perfect.Hollywood used to make great movies like this before it became the special effects driven computer generated movie making schlock capitol of the world.The great Paul Newman plays a prisoner locked up in a Southern jail after a night of petty crimes.His constant struggle to be free even while locked up makes this one of the greatest roles ever seen in a movie.Newman is at his absolute peak playing the cool Lucas Jackson.I was so struck by Newman's performance in this movie I was determined to name my son Lucas Jackson,but alas,I only had daughters and my wife wasn't too thrilled about naming either of them Lucas.Oh well.George Kennedy plays Jackson's enemy turned buddy and he is absolutely perfect also.His portrayal of Dragline is Kennedy at his finest.The sublime Strother Martin plays the prison captain and damn is he ever good.He was always so underrated as is Kennedy too,I think.In fact this whole movie is full of familiar faces that would go on to other big time roles in TV and movies.In this movie everyone meshes perfectly to create an unforgettable movie that will stay with you long after many other movies you've seen fade from memory.You must see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now that it has become sort of fashionable to speak or write badly about the films of the 60s and 70s, saying that people stopped going to the movie theatres during that fruitful period (which is not true), we must -more than ever-rate a flick as "Cool Hand Luke" as it really deserves. The rebel spirit of the lead character (played to perfection by the excellent Paul Newman) against that brutal and -most of the times- unfair "establishment" represented by the prison guards is a subject that remains as topical as ever. If this picture had been made today, it could also probably be good, but it would undoubtedly be much more unpleasant and filled with four-letter words. Besides, who could match the performances of Newman, George Kennedy (the deservedly Oscar-winner who has kept on making a brilliant career -do you remember him as "The Blue Knight"?), Strother Martin, J.D.Cannon, etc.? Jo Van Fleet압 character as Luke압 mother seems a sort of slightly-aged version of her role as James Dean압 mum in "East Of Eden", and it is really worthwhile. The scene of the hard-boiled eggs is a classic and a gem, but my favourite scene in the movie is that of the car-washing girl so wonderfully played by Joy Harmon (who is really a Joy for any man압 eyes); that character truly says a lot of things without speaking -her gorgeous body speaks for her! I must say that it압 not only one of the sexiest scenes I았e ever seen in a film but also a very significative one: there is an enormous contrast between the image of the lass moving and shaking in complete and absolute freedom (even in her way of dressing) and the imprisoned men-at-work who watch her as something extremely desirable but, alas, completely out of reach. (The viewer can really feel like a prisoner too!). All in all, this is a fine film of the 60s, but also of the 70s, the 80s, the 90s, the 21st century and whatever God wants it to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh Luke you wild beautiful thing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Luke (Paul Newman) lands himself in a Deep South prison farm for drunkenly cutting the heads off of parking meters. Once at the farm Luke refuses to be ground down by the system and its grinning warden (a brilliant Strother Martin). As things role by Luke becomes something of a hero to his fellow inmates and this is not lost on the authority in charge of the farm. Things are sure to come to a head as Luke rebels to the point of no return...Division of Corrections. Road Prison 36.The close examination of Cool Hand Luke over the years has rightly thrown up the fact that it's a Christ allegory. Which is just fine given that Stuart Rosenberg's film is one of the finest films that the 60s had to offer. It also boasts, arguably of course, the Paul Newman signature role (yes even better than The Hustler). As the title suggests, Cool Hand Luke, both the film and character, there is a great deal of cool here, in fact for a great deal of the first half of movie it's laced with comic touches as we warm easily to the "rebel - against - the - system" machismo and charm that Newman provides as Lukas Jackson. But the film shifts considerably at the mid-point to give us something far more potent and dramatic to alter any preconceptions the audience had of this just being a movie about a macho loner earning our sympathy.Calling it your job don't make it right Boss.Much in the film has been firmly ensconced in the memorable moments department: 50 eggs, tar that road quickly, the "Kick a Buck" poker game, "still shaking boss", a mountain of rice to be eaten, sneezing bloodhounds, the boxing match and one of the greatest and most iconic of tag-lines ever; "what we got here is a failure to communicate", all forming part of a truly great whole. However, revisiting the picture often brings the realisation that so much more is on offer than at first thought. Luke is a real war hero whose crime is pretty tame for the sentence he finds himself faced with, the Dragline (George Kennedy kicking up a storm of acting quality) and Luke friendship that builds with grace and thunder, sexual frustration of the incarcerated male and a mother and son arc that attacks the soul and lets Newman show many of his acting peers just how grief should be acted out on screen..."Well, I don't care if it rains or freezes, Long as I have my plastic Jesus, Riding on the dashboard of my car. Through all trials and tribulations, We will travel every nation, With my plastic Jesus I'll go far"With Newman, Kennedy and Martin holding court with every scene they are in, it would be easy at first glance to ignore the supporting roles, but Rosenberg ensures that supporting players make telling marks. It's a roll call of sweaty and twitchy character actors that features the likes of Anthony Zerbe, Joe Don Baker, Clifton James, Harry Dean Stanton, Dennis Hopper, Morgan Woodward, Wayne Rogers and J.D. Cannon. Filmed in Technicolor and Panavision, Rosenberg and cinematographer Conrad Hall do an amazing job of making Stockton, California feel like the actual Deep South. Film unfolds to the backdrop of a sun- drenched land inhabited by life's unfortunates and the supposed upstanding face of American officialdom...Iconography and martyrdom unbound, Cool Hand Luke is a slow-burn classic of deep thematic worth. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"He's A Rebel And He'll Never Never Be Any Good"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Cool Hand Luke Paul Newman shows us what the underside of what life is like as a rebel. Picture James Dean doing this part had he lived to do films like these.Newman plays his usual non-conformist rebel type, but he's really a rebel without a cause. He's in his early forties, a Korean war veteran who just hasn't found his place in civilian life. He gets himself busted for no great cause, just on a drunken spree in some Southern town he decides to knock the heads off a bunch of parking meters.That lands him a stint in a county jail with a lot of outdoor work on a road gang. He fights with, but later wins the respect and becomes friends with George Kennedy the head honcho in his barracks.The real tragedy of Cool Hand Luke is that Newman is a failure in life, it's why he's in prison. He gains the respect of his fellow convicts for those ways, but that involves going against the penal system and in the end that gets you nothing. Can you picture James Dean as a forty something doing what Newman is doing? It would have been his kind of role for sure.Newman does a fine job playing the non-conformist Luke who seems to be just going on the path fate has decreed for him. George Kennedy got his Oscar winning career role as Dragline. Other men in Luke's barracks are Wayne Rogers, Robert Drivas, and J.D. Cannon and they fill their roles well.Strother Martin as the warden of the place is the guy with the film's favorite line, "what we've got is failure to communicate." Martin and his correction officers have many interesting ways of getting their point across.Cool Hand Luke may very well be the saddest role Newman ever undertook in his long career.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amazing movie....watched it for the first time three or four years ago. Seen it plenty of times since......this, along with "One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest", is one of my favorite films of all-time. Luke is a truly memorable character; funny, tragic, inspirational.....a lot like Randle Patrick McMurphy. Paul Newman once again proved the Academy to be full of idiots, giving a great performance deserving of an Oscar. How he only won once, when Sally Field is the owner of two statuettes, is inexplicable. His run of classic films and touchstone characters from the 60s-70s (Luke, Fast Eddie, Butch, etc) is unparalleled. George Kennedy was good, too......I mightn't be good at critiquing, but I know what I like. And I like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cool Hand Luke is perhaps Paul Newman's most memorable character. He was outstanding as Hud, but he seems to have topped that performance in this 1967 classic.Newman plays a man named Luke. After cutting the heads off some parking meters, he is thrown into a prison system where he's forced to do some hard time tending to country roads. This character has to be one of the biggest enigmas in film history. Luke is likable enough. His mother points out to him that he's even had some good jobs. The viewer is left to ponder why in the heck he can't stay out of trouble.Not much is told about his past. We know he fought WWII, and even won some medals. He has no wife or children to care for. He has a mother who appears to be dying of lung cancer or some such ailment. His other family members seem to hold a grudge against him. We never really learn why he feels the need to cut the heads off the parking meters, but he's caught red-handed. The prison he's sent to makes its inmates work their tails off, but it looks like they'll treat you fairly if you follow their rules. Luke has no intentions of following any rules laid down by the warden or the "bosses" that watch over the road work, though.After taking a tremendous beating from the toughest inmate (Kennedy), Luke quickly begins to win the admiration of his fellow prisoners. His spirit catches on with the others, and they begin to get their work done more quickly and effectively than ever before. Things begin to go downhill for Luke once he learns of his mother's passing. He repeatedly tries to escape, and soon the warden and his cronies are out to break his spirit and make him conform. The film becomes a test of wills, and a fascinating character study.The biggest question the viewer is left with is "why?". Luke could have simply served out his time and then gone on to a more normal existence. That seems to be out of the realm of possibilities for the character, however. He isn't simply out to impress the other prisoners. At one point he even demands they stop trying to feed off of him for all their strength. Luke seems like a man who simply cannot allow others to tell him how to live. There are a few moments where he openly questions the existence of God, but that angle doesn't go very far. It merely makes the guards want to abuse him even more, but that's about it. It becomes almost frustrating to see this man keep digging a bigger and bigger hole for himself. At one point Luke is forced to literally do just that.What exactly is the film trying to tell us? It doesn't seem to be advocating disobedience. We cheer for Luke when he's causing trouble for the guards, but we feel his pain when they punish him. The film's conclusion is more somber than inspiring.Rosenberg's direction is outstanding, and the supporting cast shines. George Kennedy earned an Oscar for his performance. Overall this is an excellent film not to be missed! 10 of 10 stars from The Hound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 'Anti-Hero' Emerges In Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps one of the last of the chain-gang movies (until it was briefly shown in the beginning of 2000's "O, Brother Where Art Thou?), this has always been (1) an interesting film (2) a wonderfully photographed movie.You hear more about the story and about Paul Newman than you usually hear about the cinematography, but it's good and this movie should be seen in widescreen. It was offered as such even on VHS.When I looked at this film sometime in the '90s, I was surprised that the famous line from it: "What we have here is a failure to communicate," was only used twice, and the second time being the last sentence uttered by Newman. I had thought that Strother Martin had said it several times. Boy, Martin was one of the more effective villains in some 1960s film, a mean-talking sadistic guy.This movie was another of the pioneers in promoting a new thing on screen: the "anti-hero," so it was popular in the protest decade of the '60s. Newman's character fit right into the period where the rebel is the hero and the authority figure is the bad guy. You've seen this repeatedly ever since, although filmmakers have always loved rebels.George Kennedy gives Newman memorable support as "Dragline" and was aptly awarded for his performance. Someone who I always remembered was the prison guard who said nothing, just stared through his sunglasses. I can always picture that guy and those reflective glasses. That, and eating 50 hard- boiled eggs have stuck with me for over 40 years!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What we have here is no failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. I went way too many years without watching this movie again, so when Cinemark included it in the summer classic film series, I was in my seat nice and early. Mention this movie and the first thing people do is quote one of the most famous lines in movie history: "What we have here is failure to communicate." No question that's a great line. But there is so much more to this movie and it holds up beautifully 45 years later.Based on the novel by Donn Pearce, who spent two years on a chain-gang, this is the story of Luke (Paul Newman) who just can't bring himself to conform to the rules, regardless whether those be the rules of the military, society, prison, or those self-imposed by the convicts. We are introduced to Luke as he drunkenly cuts off the top of parking meters on main street of a small town. Later, in a throw away line, we learn he was gaining revenge on someone. It's the clear indication that while he doesn't always want to fit in, Luke clearly knows right from wrong.There are so many terrific scenes in this film, that it's not possible to discuss each. Every scene with the prison warden, played by Strother Martin, is intense. Each of the Boss guards are frightening, especially Morgan Woodward as the sharpshooter behind the mirrored shades. There are numerous impactful scenes featuring the group of convicts. Even though we learn little about the individuals, we realize the fragile male psyche is on full display. Despite the power of all of these characters and scenes, the real strength of the film is the relationship between Luke and Dragline (George Kennedy). Watching the early cat and mouse game, and the subsequent transfer of power, feature two amazing actors at the top of their game.George Kennedy rightfully won the Best Supporting Actor award and continued on to become one of the most successful and prolific character actors of the 70's and 80's, and his career culminated with his iconic role in the Naked Gun series. As for Paul Newman, this is one of his best performance in a long line of standout performances. This one is in the middle stage of his career and he exuded manliness with a touch of sensitivity. He and Strother Martin would meet again in one of the best sequences of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.Watching Luke win over all the convicts, including the previous leader played by Kennedy is stunning, yet gut-wrenching when offset by the scenes with the guards who are hell bent on getting Luke to understand his place. They understand the risk he poses to the systematic rhythms of the prison.The supporting cast is downright incredible. This was the feature film debut for: Ralph Waite (4 years later he became the beloved paternal figure of TV's The Waltons); Joe Don Baker(Buford Pusser from Walking Tall); James Gammon (later the crusty manager in Major League); and Anthony Zerbe, another iconic character actor of the 70's and 80's. Also featured are Dennis Hopper, Harry Dean Stanton (singing a few songs), Wayne Rogers (from MASH), Richard Davalos (James Dean's brother Aron in East of Eden), and Rance Howard (Ron's dad as the sheriff). In a brief, but truly great scene, Jo Van Fleet (also from East of Eden), appears as Arletta, and we quickly understand Luke's background.Often overlooked by film historians, "Lucille" putting on a show for the convicts as she washes her car, is a scene that is meant for more than titillation. As she creatively buffs the windows, the reaction of the convicts reminds us that these are still men and no amount of humiliation and degradation can change that. One of my friends argues that Joy Harmon was clearly cheated out of an Oscar for this scene.The score is the handy work of Lalo Schifrin and expertly captures the moment ... especially in the black top scene. Director Stuart Rosenberg was known only for his TV work when he got this script. He went on to direct another prison movie in 1980 called Brubaker. Starring Newman's Butch Cassidy co-star Robert Redford, the film was a decent prison drama, but not at the level of Cool Hand Luke ... which by the way, was installed into the National Film Registry in 2005.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sin of the Angry Believer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is set in America's Deep South in the years after the Second World War. Luke Jackson, a down-on-his-luck war veteran, is arrested for vandalising parking meters while drunk and sentenced to imprisonment in a brutally tough prison. At first his offhand, seemingly arrogant, attitude alienates not only the prison governor and guards but also his fellow-prisoners, and he is soon challenged to a fight by another inmate named Dragline. The tall, powerfully built Dragline is an easy victor, but Luke's determination and fighting spirit, never knowing when he is beaten and refusing to quit, arouse the respect of the others, especially Dragline who becomes his close friend. Luke becomes a hero to the prisoners because they see him as a rebel who refuses to be beaten by the system. (His nickname stems from the cool way in which he plays a hand at poker, but it also refers to his remaining cool in the face of persecution). Luke makes two escape attempts, but on both occasions he is recaptured and brought back to the prison for punishment by the guards who are determined to break his spirit. It seems that they have succeeded, but then Luke and Dragnet make one last break for freedom.On one level this film is a critique of the inhumanity of the American prison system, part of a tradition going back to "I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" and continuing more recently with "Brubaker" (also directed by Stuart Rosenberg) and the less successful "The Last Castle". The regime in this jail is particularly inhuman. The prisoners are put to work all day digging ditches in the hot sun. (It is never made clear whether the ditches need to be dug and the prisoners are a useful source of free labour, or whether putting them to demeaning and useless work is seen as a means of keeping them under control and of giving vent to the sadistic impulses of their jailers). There is a long list of petty regulations, breach of which is punished by "a night in the box", a tiny cell used for solitary confinement. The guards take a perverse delight in tormenting and humiliating the prisoners. Strother Martin's governor (who prefers to be called "the Captain") is a particularly frightening figure, a little man with a grating, high-pitched voice who can even make a piece of bland management-speak like "What we have here is a failure to communicate" sound like a terrifying threat.The film is more, however, than a social-realist exposure of conditions in America's jails. It was made in the sixties, the decade when the times they were a-changing and when traditional concepts of authority were being challenged everywhere. Like a number of films from the sixties and seventies, "Cool Hand Luke" reflects this popular mood. The film with which it has most in common is "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" in which Jack Nicholson does for mental asylums what Paul Newman does here for prisons. Newman's screen persona was often that of the cool, detached outsider. This may have had the effect of narrowing his range as an actor somewhat- he could often seem too laid back in more traditional types of film, such as Hitchcock's "Torn Curtain"- but it meant that he could be excellent playing anti-heroes in films of this nature. ("Hombre" is another example). Here, in one of his best performances, he makes Luke a symbol of the little man standing up against authority. We learn that he was a hero in the war and was decorated a number of times but that he finished the war as a private after being demoted from sergeant. The implication is that military discipline was as uncongenial to him as prison discipline and that he lost his rank for some act of insubordination. Even his crime can be seen as a protest against the petty tyranny of rules and regulations of which parking meters are a symbol.There has been speculation about the possible religious implications of the film and whether Luke is intended to be a Christ-figure. Certainly, the shot in which he is seen in a crucifix-like pose after the egg-eating contest is derived from standard Christian imagery, but in my view this is not a deliberate Christian allegory along the lines of "Whistle Down the Wind" or "The Omega Man". In orthodox Christian thought, Christ is much more than a rebel against authority or even a man unjustly persecuted; he is also the Son of God and the Redeemer of mankind. One scene does not an allegory make. Nevertheless, there are undoubted religious overtones to the film. If Luke is an allegorical figure, the allegory is not with Christ but with Everyman, a man in search (sometimes a despairing search) of God. He claims not to believe in God, yet has long conversations with Him. The song he sings after the death of his mother is irreverent, possibly blasphemous, but blasphemy is the sin of the angry believer, not of the unbeliever. A true atheist cannot blaspheme, because there is nothing for him to blaspheme against.Newman was nominated for "Best Actor" and George Kennedy won a well-deserved "Best Supporting Actor" for his portrayal of Dragline, but I was surprised that the film was not nominated as "Best Picture", especially as the nominations in 1968 included a film as weak as "Dr Doolittle". Whatever the Academy may have thought, however, "Cool Hand Luke" is a film that has matured well. It is a multi-layered film that works well on each of its several levels of meaning. With "I am a Fugitive?." and "The Birdman of Alcatraz", it is one of the greatest of all prison dramas. This was Stuart Rosenberg's first feature film, but like Orson Welles ("Citizen Kane"), Sidney Lumet ("Twelve Angry Men") and Bryan Forbes ("Whistle Down the Wind") he made a great film on his first attempt. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unforgettable Paul Newman as a cool prisoner in a Southern chain gang who flees and is recaptured</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Interesting flick about the deprivations and subhuman conditions of a chain gang and a rebel prisoner to whom wardens will attempt to break his free spirit . Based on a real story by Donn Pearce who wrote the novel on which the movie is based , he spent 2 years on a chain gang for safe-breaking ; Pearce makes a cameo appearance in the movie as a convict named Sailor . It deals with Luke (Paul Newman ) who is sent to a prison camp , where he gets a reputation as a hard man . He becomes a prisoner on a Southern chain gang , there the head of the gang hates him , and attempts to break him by beating him up . It doesn't work, and he gains respect and not even the deprivations of these wrong conditions will break his spirit . Irrepressible Luke even manages to win the admiration of his rival (George Kennedy) in the chain gang . Luke is visited by his ill mother (Jo Van Fleet was only 11 years older than Paul Newman , Bette Davis was first offered the role of Luke's mother, but refused the bit part) ; after that , Luke refuses to conform to life in a rural prison and he getaways , but is caught, but escapes again .Modern slant on chain gang sub-genre with one of Paul Newman's greatest interpretations from his prestigious and long career , here as an obstinate , stubborn prisoner . George Kennedy's acting was equally excellent and deservedly won him a supporting Academy Award . Rosenberg's magnificent direction that underlines the strength of personalities involved , undercutting the less pleasant aspects and putting the focus squarely on Newman's tough performance and including the memorably unforgettable egg-eating contest . Top-notch secondary cast who gives splendid performances as Strother Martin , Lou Antonio , Wayne Rogers , J.D. Cannon , Dennis Hooper , Harry Dean Stanton , Morgan Woodward , Joe Don Baker , and Ralph Waite , Anthony Zerbe's film debuts , among others . Good sets and fine scenarios , as a Southern prison camp was built just north of Stockton, California , a dozen buildings were constructed, including a barracks, mess hall, warden's quarters, guard shack, and dog kennels . Colorful and glimmer cinematography by Conrad L. Hall . Atmospheric musical score by Lalo Schifrin in his usual style .Stuart Rosenberg was one of the best TV directors of the 50s and 60s and subsequently realized segment of crime and mystery series . In 1967 directed his first film , Mystery Inc , and subsequently the successful Cool Hand Luke with Paul Newman . Rosenberg and Newman attempted in vain to repeat the formula in three further movies together as WUSA movie, Pocket money and The drowning pool . However he achieved other two hit smashes , in the terror genre with The Amityville horror and again with a prison film titled Brubaker. Since then Rosenberg's output has been unsatisfactory and sporadic as The Pope of Greenwich village  a Mickey Rourke vehicle . Rosenberg directed 5 actors in Oscar nominated performances: Peter Falk, Paul Newman, Lee Grant, Geraldine Page and of course George Kennedy with his top-drawer performance as Dragline . Rating : Above average , wholesome watching . Essential and indispensable seeing for the Paul Newman's fans .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About nonconformity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sentenced to a stint on a chain gang for a minor offence, a disillusioned former soldier becomes an unexpected role model for his fellow inmates due to his unwillingness to conform in this iconic prison movie starring Paul Newman. Often cited as one of Newman's finest performances, 'Cool Hand Luke' certainly provides him with one of his most complex and dynamic characters as he has to balance pretending to be subdued by the wardens and actually feeling subdued by their harsh treatment. It is also easy to relate to Luke's uncertainty with what he wants to do with the rest of his life, which surfaces in a touching scene in which he is visited by his mother who is shocked that he has no plans for the future. As the film progresses though, Luke becomes bent on escaping captivity, and the way he is treated, it is hard to blame him. On the same note though, his wanting to escape goes directly against his characterisation as a man with no plans for the future. It also never quite gels that he would escape given that he was serving a quite minimal sentence. Prison escape movies are almost always interesting though, and Luke's ingenuity is remarkable in itself. The entire film is also buoyed up by the genuine sense of camaraderie that radiates between the prisoners throughout; they are not out to attack one another, but rather share a strong bond similar to POW inmates. The film has several memorable scenes too beyond the famous "failure to communicate" exchanges and Lalo Schifrin's slowly swelling score is a blast, especially during a pivotal boxing match.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a classic and deservedly remains an icon and one of Paul Newman's best roles by far. However on this viewing and having lived in this country now for almost five decades, I have to point out the inaccuracies in this movie...From what I have learned, the prison system in this country jails disproportionately much more black and Latin men, in this movie, I don't think I saw any evidence of that little nugget. The other interesting thing about this movie, is the most memorable scene with the hot blonde woman played by Joy Harmon...in my memory, she really grinds herself into that car's window while wet and soapy for awhile, on further review, the scene only lasts about three seconds!!! I think they should probably do a remake and extend that scene and play some really great hot and heavy music, or maybe somebody should just make a cool music video with the scene and play it in slow motion for the greatest effect!!! But over all this movie stands up to time and I am actually amazed that they haven't done a remake with Denzel Washington or Will Smith playing Paul Newman's part and Forest Whitaker playing the big dudes part...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Cool Hand Luke" is a crime movie in which we watch a man who is a cool and gutsy prisoner in a Southern chain gang. There we watch him refusing any authority and he does not care about anything except himself. This has as a result the other prisoners to admire him and see him like their hero. Although the camp staff has an another opinion about all of that and they do their best to destroy and break him.I liked this movie because of the plot which I found simply magnificent, also the cast was well picked and these choices had as a result this great result. Of course the direction of Stuart Rosenberg was for one more time very good. I also believe that the interpretation of Paul Newman who played as Luke in this movie was one of his best interpretations ever. Another great interpretation that has to be mentioned is George Kennedy's who played as Dragline and he was simply outstanding on it (won the Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role).Finally I want to say that "Cool Hand Luke" shows us the truth behind the rural prisons on that times and how this influence all of the people who are getting involved with it. Also this movie wanted to make us think about the choices that we make in our lives, how important are and if were correct or no. Also I believe that it wanted to show us the fight of a man who wanted to be free and indented from anyone and anything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true anti-hero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The anti-hero is a term that is often misused. Here, it is perfected. In fact, Paul Newman during this brief period, perfected the anti-hero in this film and in HOMBRE.This film deals with a very shallow man, Paul Newman's Luke, who goes to prison for a very sill reason. He goes with the flow, and as he states later, never plans anything. He just does what he does.As soon as he is in prison, he is one of a group of new inmates who get the lecture from the warden, the one who gave us the famous line about "failure to communicate".The warden wonders if "Luke" will be a problem child. Luke instantly assures him he has no such intention. But he does become a "working class hero", not by planning, not by trying, but just by being.Luke never imagines he'll be the hero of the prison. The role just comes to him. He does nothing magnificent, but everything he does is magnified, chiefly by the hulking inmate portrayed by George Kennedy.And that is how the working class hero is in real life. I've been there. The center attraction doesn't try to do it. He just becomes it. The anti hero is one who is not the traditional demi god who bravely starts trouble. Luke just answers when trouble comes to him.This is the story of how legends are formed. In this case, it is a legend of a prison inmate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Sometimes nothing can be a pretty cool hand."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Cool Hand Luke (1967)' was and remains one of Paul Newman's most iconic performances, with the image of Luke Jackson ? with his piercing blue eyes, blissfully carefree smile, dogged determination ? forever entrenched in the minds of all who see the film. Having experienced a lifetime of difficulty and oppression, Luke is one man who never learned to conform to society, and who is willing to sacrifice himself in order to avoid compromising his own integrity. On many occasions, the motivation behind Luke's actions are dubious at best {his numerous escape attempts appear to have been orchestrated for the mere sake of rebellion}, but this all adds to the lure of his enigmatic personality. Many critics have noted the film's scattered Biblical references, with some proposing that Newman's character is an allusion to Christ, who mentored a group of "disciples" before offering his own life in the face of tyranny. Directed by Stuart Rosenberg, and wonderfully captured by cinematographer Conrad L. Hall {whose final film, 'Road to Perdition (2002)' is among the most beautiful of the new century}, the story of "Cool Hand Luke" remains one of cinema's most definitive prison dramas.Influencing, in some way or another, just about every prison movie that followed, and bearing more than a passing resemblance to Milos Forman's masterpiece 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975),' the film's legacy has continued to stretch into the present, and the Captain's (Strother Martin) memorable line "What we've got here is failure to communicate" continues to be quoted often. Of course, it is Cool Hand Luke whom we shall always remember so vividly, his nickname representative of his independence, individualism and unwillingness to conform. Newman's superb performance was nominated for an Academy Award at the 1968 Oscars, but he was beaten by an equally-memorable Rod Steiger for 'In the Heat of the Night (1967).' Unthinkably, the film itself was denied a Best Picture nomination, presumably to make way for the epic musical 'Dr. Dolittle (1967),' a childhood favourite of mine that nonetheless should never have been nominated. The picture's single award went to George Kennedy, who is marvellous as Dragline, a tough, imposing but supportive inmate who strikes up a very close friendship with the prison's resident "messiah."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Less than the sum of its parts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Cool Hand Luke' is the (long) story of a charismatic misfit in a Southern segregated convict road gang. There is an interesting turning point in the film where Luke (Paul Newman) refuses to shelter from a deadly(?) rainstorm with the rest of the gang, and defies God to do anything to him; his character is defined by this sort of bravado. In the next scene, he learns that his beloved mother has died and the famous 'Plastic Jesus' song scene follows. Luke then simply becomes reckless and hurtles towards his doom.The problem with the film is that this interesting pivotal moment - his mother's death and how Luke might feel he had provoked God - is all but obliterated in the corny dramatisation of the convicts' lives. Clich乶 abound; apart from the effective depiction of the back-breaking work of the gang, the compound seems to be more like a frat house. Perfect hairstyles, no fights except on Saturdays, plenty of food and booze, and basically everybody manages to keep their chins up, play poker and have a good laugh most of the time. Other reviewers have cited the 'Hogan's Heroes' and 'Bilko' similarities. They're right.So what could be a really affecting story just turns out to be a series of upbeat and downbeat setpieces, with a 'modern' nihilistic ending. Actually, there's a completely irrelevant bit tacked on after that where George Kennedy tells the gang what a 'world-shaker' Luke was. No he wasn't, he was possibly a complicated character but we learn nothing about what he really feels or why he did what he did. Whether that's Paul Newman's or the script's fault I can't tell, but Paul Newman does his overblown 'Hustler' performance, chewing more scenery than eggs in the process. A curate's egg, even - a few parts of this bad egg are excellent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Set in the rural south, a man serves time on a chain gang after vandalising parking meters. When inside, he stubbornly refuses to bow down to anybody, be it the prison authorities or his fellow inmates. Soon, though, he becomes a symbol of hope to the other prisoners and his rebellious nature teaches them that their integrity is the most important thing they have.This anti-authoritarian film is very much in a similar mould to Bonnie and Clyde which also came out in 1967. In both of these films the establishment are shown to be the bad guys and the criminals anti-heroes deserving of our sympathy. With this in mind it would only be fair to say that, like Bonnie and Clyde, Cool Hand Luke could be regarded as one of the very first New Hollywood movies. It certainly is a film which indicates that the cinematic norms were changing. It's also one of the first of a new type of prison drama which tried to reach for more authenticity. In many ways it is a precursor to the classic incarcerated-man-against-the-system movie One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975). For me, it's not in the same league as that one but it's pretty obviously a very influential work. It benefits from a good ensemble cast, with Paul Newman leading the picture very well, with impressive support in particular from George Kennedy who would go on to win an Oscar for his efforts.</fullReview>

I regret not taking the chance to pick up a parking meter head that a woman was selling at a garage sale. What better inside secret that I am a "Luke" fan. Luke becomes Christlike. This was an interesting prism to look at the film through when teaching at a religious school. It also speaks to the culture that crated it, in the 1960s.

		<fullReview>I first saw "Cool Hand Luke" the first week it came out. Went to see it with my father at a theater on the Upper East Side in Manhattan. We were just a few blocks away from the hospital where my Mom was dying of cancer and we just needed a break. It was cathartic. Feeling as beat up and left for dead as I was at the time, I came across a character who knew how to take the punches. "Luke" is a beautifully crafted film. Not one wasted frame or moment. Donn Pearce and Frank Pierson's screenplay is nothing less than a working man's parable of a truly good soul who just couldn't seem to get a break. In ways, it could be said he truly didn't let himself. But the strength within Luke that would not let him compromise who he was for who he was told to be, the resilience to fight back against those who tried to fight him on that was inspirational. Whether it was a carefully chosen remark or just one of them Luke looks, They knew They couldn't knock him out no matter how badly They knocked him down. Seems he handled life like that, and it was an example I've clung to and have tried to follow in the almost fifty subsequent years. Conrad Hall's cinematography was breathtaking, providing the scope of all the integral parts of the story with the immediacy of all the most intimate moments. Any single frame could hang on your living room wall as the centerpiece. The cast: Dennis Hopper, Strother Martin, Lou Antonio, Ralph Waite ... and George Kennedy. Academy Award Winner George Kennedy. "Dragline". The most unforgettable "gentle giant" I believe I've ever seen on the silver screen. Each and every one of them, in all their glory and in the simplest of nuances, helped raise Paul Newman's masterful portrayal to an ever higher level, maybe his best work ever. The character is very much the story in "Cool Hand Luke" and the ensemble brings it to life. Frustrating, challenging, confusing, pain- in-the-ass life with just enough of that rebellious spirit to bring hope to those facing some of their tougher times. I saw the film four more times that first year, and probably twice each year since whenever I could find it. Check in with Luke and the boys for a breath of fresh air and some world-shaking hope. Can't speak for anyone else, but Luke is right up there with Atticus Finch for me when it comes to celluloid heroes, these are the two whose stories got me through some really, really bleak times. And for me, "Cool Hand Luke" was ultimately a story of hope. The story of a man who never gave in. Never gave up. And never stopped grinning. All that they piled on him, all they tried to bury him under ... just wasn't worth his getting worked up over. Wasn't gonna get to his spirit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The power of non-conformity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One problem with society is its tendency to marginalize those who are different or don't fit in and, to a degree, this is what "Cool Hand Luke" is about. Luke is a loner who is picked up by the cops one evening for cutting the heads off parking meters while drunk. However inconsequential this crime might seem, it gets him two years on a chain gang and what transpires over the next couple of hours shows how one man resists a system which seemingly has no place (or use) for him. Despite the overall downbeat tone, the film still manages to have a sense of humor which is heavily derived from situations that one might find while in prison. It also helps that Paul Newman as Luke is so likable and "cool." The title of the film comes from a scene in which Luke is playing poker with the other guys and wins by bluffing the other guy into folding. He says that "Sometimes nothing is a cool hand," and from then on is called "Cool Hand Luke." Aside from Paul Newman's excellent performance, Strother Martin gives a great turn as the prison captain who, while seemingly easygoing on the surface, is quite authoritarian and does everything in his power to beat Luke into submission. He also gets an awesome quote which has become quite famous: "What we've got here is a failure to communicate." Not only is that a great line, but the way in which he delivers it suggests a weariness with the way that Luke has thus far managed to resist being broken. It was also nice to see Harry Dean Stanton, Ralph Waite and Dennis Hopper in supporting roles. Lastly, the cinematography and score by Lalo Schifrin were also excellent. My favorite element was a repeated closeup of a guard's sunglasses which showed the reflection of what he was looking at, and in general, the on-location shooting gave a very palpable sense of what the characters were feeling whether it was the scorching sun or pouring rain. Overall, this is an outstanding entry in that latter days of Hollywood's golden age which has been extremely influential on the films that have come after it. Whether you feel like you fit in or not, "Cool Hand Luke" tells a great story with fine performances from its cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rebel movie for everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(93%) One of the finest films ever made about the rebellious spirit of man, which is perfectly cast by both super cool Paul Newman and George Kennedy in the lead roles. Newman's low dialogue, yet not exactly silent role, is filled with subtle brilliance as you know exactly what the guy is thinking and feeling every single time he appears on screen, which is something beyond the control of both the writer and director, it's just 100% Paul. The movie is one of great memorable moments such as the mass egg eating scene, the road sanding scene, and the brilliant part in which Newman sings a few lines of plastic Jesus that shows exactly how he's feeling more than normal spoken words ever could. This is a superb film, and anyone who considers themselves even a small fan of cinema should watch this at least once in their lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the cloth from which all jailhouse films are cut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wanted to see this in ages; a total classic, much quoted and copied (as well as the much emulated 'scantily clad girl washes car knowing there are men watching' scene). Brilliant performance by Paul Newman as the titular Luke who's put in prison and endears himself with the rest of the guys with his can-do, jokey attitude and willingness to do stupid stuff as well as his aloof and singular need to break the rules. The egg scene was really funny. Humour, drama and quite a lot of heart, and an interesting study in human behaviour and dog psychology. Really enjoyed it, didn't know what to expect but can see shades of every other jailhouse drama in this. Shows how a film can be honest and psychologically affecting without resorting to graphic violence and brutality. This is a clever film, and his character is intelligent and crazy - dangerous because he just doesn't care and is somewhat damaged and at odds with God. A young Dennis Hopper puts in an appearance. George Kennedy is good as the crazy using sycophantic "big brother" of the jailhouse, who's not so bright. Incredibly watchable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Before "Shawshank" there was "Cool Hand Luke"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's a thought: would "The Shawshank Redemption" have ever happened without "Cool Hand Luke?" Both films examine prison life in a tall-tale sort of way. Heroes of questionable morality perform valiant acts in defiance of cold and rigid prison wardens and life is at its most fragile, balancing between the joy needed to stay alive and rock-bottom depression.However you choose to compare the films, there's no doubt both are on greatest film lists. "Cool Hand Luke" simply has the distinction of being first.Paul Newman's Oscar-nominated performance is one of his very best, or at least one of my favorites to this point. I have not seen "The Color of Money," but I have little doubt that Oscar was rewarded to him for having been screwed over so many times.As Dragline (George Kennedy, who won an Oscar) so perfectly points out in his ending monologue voiced over a montage of Luke, Newman's smile alone makes Luke such a magnetic character. There's always a sense that he knows something you don't, that he has mastered some secret of life that makes him impervious to hardship. His tacit contempt for authority makes him much more likable than your typical anti-hero (if he can even be considered one), and it also primes us for his few dramatic scenes, which are soft but moving.Lucas Jackson is an honored war vet who is thrown somewhat needlessly into a prison work camp in the south after beheading parking meters while drunk. Compared to the crimes of some of the others, it's a bad deal. Luke quickly falls out of favor with the prison guards with his subtle defiance, and it takes him some time before he's initiated with his fellow inmates.There are so many memorable scenes in the film because the most pivotal moments are also the most visually appealing. Director Stuart Rosenberg and writer Frank Pierson appear to be on the same page in really emphasizing scenes such as the "Lucille" scene in which a local woman erotically washes a car as the men look on from their work post, the subsequent boxing fight between Luke and Dragline and the egg-eating scene. Prior to Luke trying to escape after "getting some rabbit in his blood" when a personal tragedy befalls him, the plot doesn't have a whole lot of places to go, so the scenes become entirely about character development, which pays off for the rest of the film. The escape attempts have an underlying strength because of the entertaining first act or so.The sense of camaraderie amongst the inmates is another thing you can't help but take notice of. Sometimes scenes are designed that way, but even when the focus is elsewhere, the extras and supporting actors are enhancing the environment, creating a mood for the film, one that expresses how caught in a bubble they are and gives you the sense of how prisoners will insist on life even in rough conditions."Cool Hand Luke" eventually evolves into a story of leadership, the qualities that make a man great, or "an original" as Dragline says. Luke becomes an inspiration for his inmates through his attitude and his actions, though more an ideal to aspire to as opposed to a role model to emulate. Newman's performance hammers that home as truth for the audience too, which makes "Cool Hand Luke" a classic.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Booze and parking meters don't mix apparently. At least it didn't work out too well for Luke played by Paul Newman.I got really attached to the character of Luke as the movie progressed. It felt like a real person. Even though he made a mistake which landed him in prison, he is not a bad guy. His shenanigans don't hurt anybody but constantly make things worse for himself. That doesn't stop him though.They made an excellent decision to have the character of the guard who doesn't speak. One of the characters called him the man with no eyes due to him always wearing mirrored sunglasses.This is a good movie to watch on a warm summer day while drinking a cold beer. Even though it may be a hot, miserable day at least you are sitting back watching a movie and not working in the sun on the side of a road.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Newman.....He Really Was A Cool Hand Luke</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Newman is fantastic in the title role..Cool Hand Luke. He was given his only Oscar in 1986 for one of his less great performances in The Color of Money. He had starred in movies like Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, The Hustler, Hud, Butch Cassidy, The Sting, The Verdict and Cool Hand Luke (all of them Oscar performances). In Cool Hand Luke..Newman gives an outstanding performance as the laconic "anti hero" who really doesn't like anyone ....particularly those in Authority. He ends up in prison where..eventually he becomes a hero to his inmates. Luke knows they are intimidated by the villainous Warden (brilliantly played by Strother Martin) and that means he cant be friends with any of them. Luke shows no fear....and continually aggravates the hard--line Warden. There have been many parallels drawn about the Vietnam war Etc. Etc. , and his close resemblance (in behavior) to Jesus Christ. Luke sees defeat in the eyes of his fellow chain gang members..a willingness to toe the line. That is not the Cool Hand Luke way, so he goes it alone. It has to end in tragedy (this is Hollywood !!), and it does.....after the Cool One takes us on a wild and emotional ride. Stuart Rosenberg directs this wonderfully. Lalo Schifrins music score fits perfectly. A great motion picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can definiely relate to newman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the reasons that the late 60s/early 70s was such a powerful era in filmmaking is the emergence of the anti-hero (defined as an individual with heroic qualities, but not in a position we would usually find a hero). This is symbolized greatly in 'Cool Hand Luke'. We can identify with Luke because his crime is venial and his concerns over the great questions of life are ours. It is because of this and his persuasive charm that the other prisoners (played remarkably well by Kennedy and a host of others to include Wayne Rogers, Ralph Waite, Dennis Hopper and one of the actors who played a crewmember on 'Alien') live vicariously through him.Filled with memorable scenes (the boxing match, 50 eggs, the fealty of his fellow prisoners who help him finish his food after his stomach is shrunk in solitary confinement, 'shakin' it here boss', the sneezing dogs, and of course the carwash part) and outstanding character development (created by what is said and what is not said, i.e. the visiting brother), one of screen history's most repeated lines and the great acting of Newman, this movie deserves to be called a classic. Released the same year as 'Bonnie and Clyde', it makes one long for the days when you needed a real script to make a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ain't nobody eat fifty eggs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Memorable tale of rebel without a cause (Newman) whose life of frivolity is halted when he's incarcerated for reckless destruction of public property. Inside, his continued recalcitrance earns him a legion of followers among the career criminals, particularly the gormless but physically imposing and influential George Kennedy character who becomes Newman's 'manager' and minder while he ponders escape.Defined by an array of memorable characters and dialogue, Strother Martin is a scene-stealing prison warden with a ruthless streak, while the mirrored aviators worn by speechless "boss with no eyes" Morgan Woodward creates one of the cinema's quintessential villains. Future stars Anthony Zerbe and Joe Don Baker have minor roles and the always entertaining Clifton James is a sympathetic prison guard.If there are criticisms, the Jesus Christ inference during the egg-eating contest is trite and unnecessary and the Kennedy character's lucidity occasionally belies the supposed lack of intellect on which his character is built, but these are fairly minor contentions. This was the film that inspired me to eat fifty eggs in a somewhat daft emulation of a childhood hero; alas I made it to eight and puked.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my favorite Paul Newman film. I saw it at the theater several times when I was a teenager. He plays the cool, fearless rebel who is obviously at odds with society. We also get to see the film that brought George Kennedy into prominent view, and Strother Martin too. Both were excellent in their roles. I also liked J.D. Cannon as the slippery, paper hanging, rubber check writer.But my favorite part of the film was the music, including Paul Newman singing "Plastic Jesus". Even better, Harry Dean Stanton singing "Just a Closer Walk with Thee". Wow!This is a story set in the deep south and filmed in 1967.Aside from the acting and music, there are definitely some social issues in there but they are just in there, not put in there if you understand what I mean.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Luke: A Man Like No Other</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe the key to understanding this movie is to see our life in the life of the prisoners. Like the prisoners we are made to do work against our will, we are made to live around certain people, and submit to unyielding authority. If there is a God, like the guards, he can only be distant, judgmental, and utterly unwilling to listen to us. Like the boss with the reflective sunglasses, we can only see ourselves and our inability to please God when we approach Him, while He always hits the mark perfectly in his own holy righteousness.Into this prison, into this all too familiar world, comes Luke, a man who's only crime is that he has never really been given a decent chance in life, a decent 'hand.' It is clear from the beginning that Luke is really innocent, essentially a good man who was never put in a position to succeed at life or find his purpose in life. This is proved by the fact that he won medals serving his country at war, but is never given credit for that service. It is striking that he explains that the chains of prison aren't medals but represent bad mistakes after his nephew asks why he isn't wearing chains. This innocence and respect for morality sets him apart from the other inmates from the start.There are several other strange and almost startling things about Luke. For one, though he knows what terrible hands he's been dealt, he fully uses that nothing hand, making it a 'cool' hand and smiling as if in spite of his own fate. And the truly miraculous result of this is that it works. Using nothing beside a courageous unwillingness to give in and a joy unspeakable Luke beats Dragline in a fistfight, wins a poker game, eats fifty eggs, and escapes prison three times. Through all this Luke teaches the others (and us) about real freedom, real hope, and real courage. Freedom that comes like a breathe of fresh air when you are least free, hope like a fiery lighthouse when things are most hopeless, and courage like a rock no matter how bad the odds. And how does he do this? Though the movie doesn't admit it, its obvious that the real key is humility, or as Luke puts it 'nothing.' Luke takes himself lightly and that is the secret to his success midst suffering. Life will always give us nothing, but humility will give us the power to both recognize and use that nothing to its full potential.It is clear that the presence of Luke both physically and in spirit (the magazine) is an enormous comfort and inspiration to the prisoners. But they take this for granted and bask in Luke's glory while continuing to let him suffer at the hands of the bosses. I may be misinterpreting Luke's character, but I think there is a real compassion in Luke for the inmates that transcends mere camaraderie, he is angry at them for 'feeding off him' because he sees them simply using his sense of freedom, hope, and courage instead developing their own, and not living out the sheer independence that he embodies and suffers for.But besides the story between Luke and the other inmates, there exists the story - or more accurately the battle - between Luke and the bosses. It is a battle that he fights on his own and that he freely admits that he lost. The bosses did break him as he fell into the grave he had dug himself, moaning his apology and declaring allegiance to the bosses and the God which he had once mocked. But that is not the end, if it were than we would be back where we started. In a prison with no respite from the powerful justice of authority. Luke rises again, he escapes, a final triumphant miracle.But Luke knows that life outside is little different from that within the prison, that no matter where he is he will be dealt his hand of nothing. He brings his conflict to the God the bosses finally forced him to believe in - he prays, asking in extreme humility what the purpose and meaning of his life is. The lack of response prompts Luke to reinforce what he'd always found true - 'he'd have to find his own way.' Or in other words, he'd have to be his own God. But God does answer. Dragline enters with the bosses right behind him. And that's when Luke realizes the purpose of his life, what he was meant for, and what he was meant to do. As a fellow prisoner he could never really help the others, but as a martyred hero he could inspire them to find their own hope, freedom, and courage through humility. And even more than that, work out a communication with the bosses that is no longer a failure,that there can be peace between inmates and the Captain, between us and God.This may be a bit of a stretch, but I think Dragline is the first to latch on to the lasting significance of what Luke did. It is Luke which gave him the opportunity to shatter the guard's mirror glasses so that he would no longer see himself in those judgmental lenses, but the eyes of the judge; and though it is physically impossible, I sincerely believe those eyes were actually the eyes of Luke, looking in defiant grace and mercy at Dragline. That is when he realized just how much Luke was indeed a world shaker - that he shook even the guards to the point of acceptance. That God at heart has the independent spirit of Luke. Or maybe that Luke was right when he called on God to find he was talking to himself. That may come as a shock, but no more shocking than a 2000-year-old carpenter who also shook the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Yeah, well, sometimes nothing means a real cool hand".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Newman had so many great performances in his illustrious career that it would be hard to pick a 'best' from the bunch. But certainly, that of Cool Hand Luke would have to be a contender. In actuality, Newman speaks very little in the picture when you come right down to it, but he accomplishes more with his looks and attitude than a lot of actors do with a lot more dialog.The strength of the film lies in Newman's portrayal of Lucas Jackson, a non-conformist who under most circumstances wouldn't even be considered a criminal. But he's paying the price for a drunken jag resulting in some damaged parking meters, and without trying, ingratiates himself with fellow prisoners following a physical beating at the hands of fellow prisoner Dragline (George Kennedy). That confrontation sets up the story for Luke's repeated attempts at escaping not only from the work farm, but from his own restless sense of being a prisoner in his own skin. Director Stuart Rosenberg magnifies Luke's struggle for redemption in the strongly imaged fade out right after the egg eating contest, showing the prone Newman in a crucifixion pose with arms outstretched and legs akimbo.Newman's not the only standout in the picture though. George Kennedy earned a Best Supporting Actor trophy for his portrayal of Dragline, the nominal head of the prisoners who is so inspired by Luke's work ethic and integrity that he eventually comes around to calling him 'my boy'. Strother Martin also makes an impact as the prison captain, and I wonder now if his signature line in the picture, which is now a staple of middle managers and parents everywhere, was the first time it was ever used - "What we have here, is failure to communicate".To be sure, there are a lot of great scenes in "Cool Hand Luke" - the fight, the car wash, the egg eating contest, the escapes. I myself could watch Carr the floor walker (Clifton James) over and over again as he explains what it takes to earn a night in the box. But for all of it, it's Newman's performance that pulls the whole thing together, as he keeps on swinging and smiling, inspiring the viewer to root for the underdog while he's thumbing his nose at the face of authority.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cool Hand Luke, released in 1967, is about a rebel character, Luke, that is incarcerated for cutting off the tops of parking meters. Luke is played by Paul Newman. As punishment, he is placed in the southern penal system in which he is housed with other inmates in a dormitory style building and works all day long on a chain gang. The film makes a strong statement against our penal system and those that challenge authority and the system. At the beginning of Luke's incarceration, he is a non- conforming loner, somewhat of an underdog, but soon earns the respect of the other inmates via a boxing match, card games, and a challenge to eat 50 hard-boiled eggs.Luke challenges and boxes one of the films other main characters, Dragline, played by George Kennedy. Luke is out matched, but refuses to give-up the entire length of the match. The match is brutal and the effects and camera shots enhance every striking blow. Luke earned the name "Cool Hand" when he skillfully won a poker match by bluffing the other players. During the egg eating contest, once all the bets were placed by the other inmates, Luke wins the bet and accomplishes the task of eating 50 hard-boiled eggs. At this point in the film, Luke has earned the respect of the other inmates and is idolized by many of them. Later in the film Luke makes two escape attempts and is subsequently caught. During his final capture, while trying to give-up, he is shot and killed by the officers. The film concludes with a scene where the inmates are recollecting, with great admiration, their time spent with Luke. The film realistically portrays what it would be like working on a chain-gang cutting grass alongside the roads from dawn to dusk. The cruelty and harshness of life "behind bars" is expressed throughout the entire length of the film via consequences endured by those that go against the system. We all like to root for the underdog and in this film; you are apt to root for the underdog, Cool Hand Luke, for the entire length of the film. Paul Newman's portrayal of Luke was masterful and George Kennedy's portrayal of Dragline provided an equally outstanding supporting role. If you liked The Shawshank Redemption, Cool Hand Luke is its 1967 count-part with the exception that our hero loses in the end.</fullReview>

But Newman seizes the role with relish, arguably making more of it than it deserves. A scene involving an egg-eating contest is firmly ensconced in film lore. In 2005, the United States Library of Congress deemed the film to be "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my second favourite movie, even though its hard to even pick "favourite" movies. But this is definitely second( Butch Cassidy is first :) ) I don't think I really need to say much about this film. It is just amazing!! All you have to do is just see it for yourself. People say how the mid-60's movies are pretty bad, but this one just proves them that not all the movies in the mid-60's were terrible. My favourite actor is Paul Newman and he always pulls off a great performance. I'm not sure if George Kennedy deserved an Oscar for this, but I'm absolutely certain Paul Newman did (even though he didn't win it). Luke is one of the greatest characters of all time; he never gives up!! I love the scene where he eats 50 eggs in one hour, that was incredible, I can barely eat 2 eggs in one hour!! I'm a girl but that car wash scene was so funny and agonizing at the same time, I could feel their pain! Although I love the fact that Luke doesn't really seem affected by it.Another actor that did a superb job was Strother Martin delivering a merciless performance and I will never forget that famous line he spoke.Anyways if you take a look at this movie yourself, you'll understand why I love this movie; its a real "Cool Hand".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic film featuring a square peg not fitting into a round hole</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this film was made over forty years ago it stands the test of time and in my opinion could have been made last year. I am glad it wasn't because I suspect that vested interests would have messed with it in one way or another for commercial reasons. Thankfully it was made when it was and the cast and crew deserve a collective congratulations on a job really well done. I have met people like Luke in my life on a few occasions and although I briefly warmed to their respective personalities I was also aware that they were not destined to be be around very long for at least one reason. Luke was a square peg trying to fit into a round hole and no matter how hard he and they tried he and they never actually make it work. In another country at another time he may have survived but not in this state and not at this time. Whatever it was that Luke wanted he was never going to get it because the people who ultimately had the control in this case a prison but it could easily have been out on the streets, were not going to relinquish that control for nobody or nothing. I understand that rehabilitation can be a wonderful thing but I suspect that the word was not in the forefront of the training if there was any for a job in that prison. If you were strong enough and intelligent enough to survive the heat, the monotonous work, the beatings and even the mind numbing boredom then I suppose you would leave at the end of your sentence and try and get out of that state as fast as possible. If you weren't strong enough you perished and ended up in an unmarked grave. For all his strength of character and trying to 'live life free and above board' Luke doesn't make it and fortunately the film is a lot more than just about how and why he fails to survive. Some square pegs eventually fit into round holes with luck and support from family and or friends, Luke had none of these and although his defiance was admired by the other inmates the guards broke him and eventually killed him. For me it was just over two hours well spent watching a very good film and I would recommend anyone watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superlative, gripping prison drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Newman stars as eccentric war veteran, Lucas Jackson. Luke lives in a tiny southern town. And he gets himself sentenced to a chain-gang, after he gets drunk and destroys some parking meters one night. The chain-gang camp, is run by a seemingly fatherly, yet ruthless Warden, called the Captain. Luke and his fellow inmates, are forced to perform back-breaking chain-gang duty, in the scorching southern heat every day. Under the directive of the Captain, brutal punishment is meted out by the prison guards, to any inmate who disobeys the stringent prison rules.Luke, rebellious soul that he is, refuses to knuckle-under to the sadistic guards. Luke's steely determination, wins him the reverent admiration of the other inmates. After two failed escape attempts, Luke is subjected to vicious torture, by the guards. The Captain, with the help of the monstrous guards, makes it his mission to break Luke's spirit.Paul Newman is amazing in his role as Luke. I couldn't imagine any other actor portraying the character of Luke, as deftly as Newman did. George Kennedy plays Luke's burly inmate pal, Dragline, with consummate skill. Jo Van Fleet, gives a wonderfully poignant performance, as Luke's dying mother, Arleta. And Strother Martin, conveys the obsessive resolve of the Captain character, with a frightening intensity.Other members of the supporting cast shine too. Dennis Hopper, Lou Antonio, Ralph Waite, and Harry Dean Stanton, all give moving performances as prison inmates. Bob Woodward gives a hideously chilling quality, to his mute, blind, sharpshooter road-boss character. In summation, Cool Hand Luke will always remain a classic of American cinema, for generations to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spend a night with this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie in the late sixties at a neighborhood theater. The Park Theater in Gardena, CA was the world's most expensive movie theater...50 cents to get in and 50 dollars for new clothes! Back to the movie...this was one of the best movies of its type and its year. Paul Newman gave one of his greatest performances (Oscar nomination) and had one of the best supporting casts of any movie of any kind. George Kennedy won his Oscar after years of journeyman work; Oscar winner Jo Van Fleet gave a great cameo performance as Luke's mom; and that ensemble of fellow prisoners and prison officials...?! Just watch the movie, pause at intervals and look at that cast (Wayne Rogers, Joe Don Baker, Harry Dean Stanton, Strother Martin, on and on and on). Great scenes and/or quotes (who can forget the floor walker explaining what will get someone "a night in the box," the girl washing the car, the egg eating challenge or the warden's legendary statement to Luke toward the end of the movie, etc., etc.). The IMDb section on Goofs said this movie showed 60s era money when it was set in another era...??!!... this movie, from all indications, was set in the 60s. Leonard Maltin said in his book of movie reviews that this film shows that "chain gangs haven't changed much since Paul Muni was on a chain gang." Amen. Again, this is one of the greatest movies of its type and should be in every film buff's collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool Hand Luke</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Stuart Rosenberg (The Drowning Pool, The Amityville Horror), I had seen and heard plenty of reasons to try this classic film, and I wasn't going to miss it when the opportunity came along. Basically Lucas 'Luke' Jackson (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Paul Newman) is sent to prison camp after cutting heads off parking metres, and gets a reputation as a hard man, and he gains an enemy with leader of the prisoners Dragline (Oscar winning, and Golden Globe nominated George Kennedy). Luke is very competitive, and not afraid to prove himself in a challenge, whether it be boxing, a game of poker - where he gets his nickname, or eating fifty boiled eggs without puking. He seems to be used to the prison camp life until his mother dies, and that is when he begins a constant attempt to escape. He manages to escape twice and get quite far, but they catch him both times, and the final time, joined by now friend Dragline, he is shot. Also starring J.D. Cannon as Society Red, Lou Antonio as Koko, Robert Drivas as Loudmouth Steve, Strother Martin as Captain, Jo Van Fleet as Arletta, Live and Let Die's Clifton James as Carr, Morgan Woodward as Boss Godfrey, Luke Askew as Boss Paul, Marc Cavell as Rabbitt, Dennis Hopper as Babalugats, Harry Dean Stanton as Tramp, Licence to Kill's Anthony Zerbe as Dog Boy and Joe Don Baker as Fixer. Newman is superb is the leading role, I can see reasons why Kennedy got the Oscar, and there are plenty of influential moments to be enjoyed, a great prison drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Music for Lalo Schifrin and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium. Paul Newman was number 16 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Luke Jackson was number 30 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes &amp; Villains, "What we've got here is failure to communicate" was number 11 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes, the film was number 11 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments for the girl washing her car, and it was number 71 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Summary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cool Hand Luke is a film adaptation of the novel by the same title written by Donn Pearce. Paul Newman plays the title character Lucas Jackson. We first meet the man as he drunkenly walks the streets cutting the heads off parking meters. The viewers get a sense of what kind of character Lucas Jackson is when the policemen approach him. When asked what he thinks he is doing, Newman has a huge smile on his face and simply replies "Small town, not much to do in the evening." This little moment holds great meaning into who Lucas Jackson is. As the film progresses you get a sense of the lack of respect for authority that Luke has. His persona could easily be taken as the student in class that always causes trouble (that is to say if this were a high school movie and not a prison movie.) When Luke first arrives at the prison he is no more than new meat and someone new for the old guys to push around. Quickly, however, Luke climbs right up to the top and has his fellow prisoners conforming to how he acts and thinks within no time at all. Paul Newman really makes you believe who he is playing. It was once said about Newman that you could never come away from seeing a movie with him in it where you disliked him ? this is no different. Even though a person would not want their child to hang out with someone such as Lucas Jackson, but you come away from Newman's performance loving him. Even after he runs away multiple times from the prison and is forced to dig and fill in a grave sized hole multiple times until he breaks down and begs for forgiveness from the guards. You can feel nothing but sorrow for the guy even though what he did was very outside of the law.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that cool hand Luke had a profound effect on the camaraderie men show toward one another and the ability of good men who do bad things to be redeemed, or to continue to rebel in an effort to show folks that some behavior "aint all that bad" and that some of us in power just don't get it and have a misplaced sense of entitlement. The film seems to show, if compared to today, a republican point of view, shown by the great Strother Martin and his cronies, versus a democratic point of view, shown by the chain gang inmates, who fight and resist at first but ultimately come together through egg eating contests and never ratting each other out. even race relations were fostered, as Luke stopped off at a black family home to knock off his chains, a clear reference to the opposite of the way things used to be and the good nature of blacks, who could have easily been mad and turned him in. If only the stolen truck had resulted in a clean getaway, this would have been my favorite film, but they caught Luke, and for that I am eternally angry, meaning the film served its purpose.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Newman was excellent as was George Kennedy and the rest of the cast. It was nice seeing a very young Ralph Waite,Waltons patriarch, very young Dennis Hopper and of course Strother Martin, who teamed up with Newman in Slapshot. I digress. This movie was basically about an impish 30 something guy that got bored easily. Thus his antics that got him in jail also got him in trouble while he was in jail. Newman was a thrill seeker . The fact he was a military man further shows he is a man that likes to take challenges in life whether they are acceptable of society or not. He is not a sociopath ... more like a goof ball if you ask me. The fact that he had 2 year prison sentence is irrelevant. He tried to escape for the challenge more than anything else. He seemed to enjoy the camaraderie of the cell . The cell was more like an army barrack anyway where everyone slept in one big room. Thus the fact he kept fighting when he clearly lost , also he got involved in that lame egg eating challenge. Attempt escape of prison with year and half or so to go is on the surface a very stupid thing to do, most of us can agree. Especially in a prison that , truthfully , did not seem all that hardened to me. Again, Luke was a thrill seeker and had no choice in his mind. When they showed that picture of Luke with the debutantes looking completely different that was another example of that being the case. Luke was the type of guy that would sneak into a super bowl, attempt to do Evel Knievel type stunts or even Harry Houdini type stunts. The plot was that simple. The ending was awesome and always look for LUKES smile. That is telling . Great movie and great acting . If they do one thing to properly memorialize Mr. Paul Newman , I ask they do nothing... in other words , no remakes of this great piece of film writing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>success at communication</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the many 1967 movies that defined the new direction that cinema was taking - along with "Bonnie and Clyde" and "The Graduate" - "Cool Hand Luke" has stood the test of time. Paul Newman shines as the title character, put in jail for breaking into parking meters. No matter what happens, he refuses to yield to authority. One important aspect is the guard wearing sunglasses: this character is the supreme representation of authority. When Luke dies, he dies while smiling, and then the sunglasses get crushed; ergo, Luke broke authority.All in all, this is definitely one that I recommend. Also starring George Kennedy (who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar), Strother Martin (who co-starred again with Newman in "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid") and Jo Van Fleet. And I think that we can agree that, watching the woman wash the car, any man would think what the prisoners were thinking!PS: Stuart Rosenberg also directed "Voyage of the Damned", about a ship allegedly carrying a group of Jews from Nazi Germany to Cuba, but it turned out that it never planned to let them go.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have watched this movie many times and it gets better each time. At the end of the movie when George Kennedy comments that Luke was a world shaker, it becomes quite obvious the plot line is meant to remind us of a similar story of Jesus Christ. The moral of the story: Well, sometimes prophets are more successful than other times. Sometimes their message changes humanity and sometimes they just get dead, as was the case for Luke. This is one truly great movie. To think that movies like "The Departed" and "No Country for Old Men" are winning best Picture awards while this picture did not, mmmmm what's the message here. Hollywood does have it's moments such as "Crash" of 3 years ago, but seems to be rewarding mediocrity more often these days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We got a Lucas Jackson on board, and he's ready to shake the world.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"What we've got here is failure to communicate." Paul Newman plays the title character of Lucas Jackson, a washed out army soldier who has nothing else better to do than get drunk and cut off the heads of parking meters in downtown. He gets sent to a local prison farm in the south where like all prisons and reserved places (army, marines) he must be do as told.Lucas has no trouble following the rules or making a few friends including the hillbilly incompetent Dragline (George Kennedy in an Oscar winning performance) who sees that the new fish is not cut out to be such a bad guy after fighting him. Lucas tells Dragline that he's nothing but a cool hand kind of guy in which everybody gives Lucas the nickname of "Cool Hand Luke." Figuring he's got to be in prison, why not make the best of it by pissing off the guards by doing things his way from working fast in tasks to even escaping the prisons where all the bosses want him dead.I was first introduced to this movie in my high school class about cinema where I never thought i would fall in love with Paul Newman's portrayal of the rebel. This is also one of the best films about prison next to "The Shawshank Redemption."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Before America was ready...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In '67, this country was still content and happy. No MyLai or murder of MLK, no riots at the Dem Convention, or assassination of Bobby. Life was good...so we thought. This was a movie about a rural chain gang prisoners and how he and his buddies passed time. Sure, Luke was a hero, but not the model of resistance that he truly was revealed to be in little of the next couple of years. Today, Lucas Jackson is still the coolest, far cooler then Dean, Travolta, or Cruise. No character since has personified "cool". He makes DeNiro look like high school! Luke was fearless because we was right, not to mention very righteous, because he knew he was going to die someday, and he didn't exist simply to justify being alive. The end parts of the film are painful because we see that authority will try to break resistance, kill what it cannot break. Yet dying is a part of resistance. Today, we need a Luke Jackson; but to be like Luke, you gotta know that NO ONE gets out alive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seminal 60s movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A work prison serves as a setting for a showdown between rigid established authority and anarchic rebellion. By extension, this is a social metaphor for everything that happened in the 60s - Kent State, the Chicago 7, etc. The 60s were about rebelling against and trying to change the established order and having those in power strike back, usually with excessive force, and Cool Hand Luke is all of this in miniature. Here Paul Newman plays Luke, the essential rebel without a cause, butting heads with prison warden Strother Martin, who tells him, in a perfect encapsulation of the Establishment's attitude toward the youth of the 60s, "Boy you need to get yourself right in the head..." Martin gets the script's best material as the spokesman for Law and Order, warning the new cons, "Man tries to run, he gets hisself a set of leg-irons. He runs twice, he gets two sets. Don't nobody get a third set." In his world, as in the button down world of LBJ and Nixon, the most the individual could hope for was to be ignored. To raise a fuss was to get slapped down. The supporting cast is superb, especially George Kennedy as a tough, none-too-bright convict who becomes a reluctant admirer of the cool, anarchic Luke, marveling how "He just kept coming back with nothing." The script is a marvel, wonderfully memorable and full of ideas and attitudes about society, the value of and need for regulations, the place of the individual etc. and very entertaining, despite a bleakly existential message: there is no salvation or redemption, no reward for virtue, merely consequences for getting out of line. Also significant is the fact that the picture is firmly set in the humid, sun-scorched Deep South with its backward looking traditions and entrenched unwillingness to modernize. A rebel is not only slapped down, he is dragged backward in time against his will. So much here is watchable, meaningful and resonant that even 40 years later it deserves an audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Working on a chain gang! One of the better old fashioned prison films of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At it's time in 1967 "Cool Hand Luke" was clearly a masterpiece a work of art in it's time frame with it's main theme being to learn to adapt to the rules of conformity. Set in the rural south classy Paul Newman plays Luke a southerner who's rebellious and a loner. So upon his arrest for another petty crime it's off to a camp that's rural just like a work style road prison. The work is harsh ranging from digging ditches, shoveling dirt, and cutting and chopping hay. Along the way for Luke learning to adapt is a struggle, yet help is provided from fellow prisoner Dragline(George Kennedy)I must say that George gives a fine and likable performance by showing his character could be such an anti establishment role model. Very memorable is the accent and performance of camp captain played by Strother Martin who chills Luke with one of the most memorable and famous lines in cinema history "What we've got here is... failure to communicate" Though the film is not a modern day prison film and seems outdated to some the film is with rich humor and clever in it's own way. Especially during the chase scene when Luke uses pepper to throw off the smell of the chasing dogs. And the storytelling is powerful with the scenes of the inmates communicating by folk music and hymns. Overall a powerful film about trying to adjust to conformity, and it shows at the same time it's so hard when a strong detached and indifferent character like Luke is just so prone to the crime of non conformity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"He's a natural born world shaker"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Stuart Rosenberg's COOL HAND Luke in 1967, Paul Newman completed a series of five films, including THE HUSTLER(1961) by Robert Rossen, in which he provided audiences with an extraordinary hero/anti-hero unparalleled (bar Marlon Brando) in cinema history. As Luke, the former war hero turned social misfit imprisoned for chopping the heads off parking meters despite claims he has "a score to settle", Newman gives a striking and unforgettable image of a man that just won't lie down, no matter what treatment he endures. Whether it be the seemingly endless torture by the guards, treating him as a dog in order to discipline him after his second escape attempt, or the stomach-churning scene in which he upholds his bet to eat 50 eggs in the space of one hour, Luke always proves his doubters wrong and grows to become a hero for the others prisoners. His bravery, "more guts than brains" as states the incarcerated lawyer, and downright stubbornness leads all the others, even the ultimately naive tough guy Dragline (played by George Kennedy in an Oscar winning role), to silently worship him as their hero...the guy standing up for the things their cowardice won't allow them too. Newman's role became iconic, and this is down to some legendary scenes that have turned this movie into an all-time great. For instance, the Saturday afternoon fight scene with Dragline, in which Luke just won't "stay down" despite the barrage of punches coming his way, concluded by him muttering: "to keep me down, you gonna have to kill me!". Or the scene where Luke is able to push the other members of the chain gang to work at twice the speed, thus giving them more free-time and puzzling the guards. The film is also filled with memorable one-liners, such as: "What we have here, is failure to communicate." This in a way sums up the entire film, Luke is a rebel, someone who won't be repressed by the rules set down, whether it be those of the guards or of his inmates. His incarceration is due to his nonacceptance of the rules set down in the outside world, his reason for his crime being that it was "a small town, not much to do in the evening". But the world to which he is introduced represents many more "limits" which, every time he breaks, imposes increased and harsher punishment. He pushes the Captain, played with a peaceful but easily ignited rage by Strother Martin, into demonstrating to the full extent his "mean son-of-a-bitch" side, whose wrath parallels Luke's vision of the "Old Man" up above who sees him solely as a "hard case".As he says, "You've got to admit, You ain't dealt me no cards in a long time". The spectator may or may not like his character, but what's sure is that definitely dosen't give a damn whether we do or don't. And that's what makes COOL HAND Luke such a powerful movie."You run one time, you got yourself a set of chains. You run twice you got yourself two sets. You ain't gonna need no third set, 'cause you gonna get your mind right", the other characters, the other members of society are doomed never to comprehend him, leading to his actions being completely unpredictable. But as he says himself, "I never made a plan in my life". The movie may not be beautifully filmed or as exciting as other prison escape movies such as Steve McQueen's THE GREAT ESCAPE and PAPILLON, but that is not its point. COOL HAND Luke represents a cultural and historical milestone, with Newman's performance up their with the very, very best. 18/20</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remember Mad magazine's send up of Cool Hand Luke, Blue-Eyed Kook? While CHL skewered authority, Mad skewered the iconic anti-hero sensibility of Paul Newman and his character. I'm not dissing Luke at all, but the writers at Mad must have been almost clairvoyant in their ability to see the cultural landmark that Stuart Rosenberg's movie would become.What a magnificent snapshot of what popular entertainment was in the late 1960s! Like MASH, the story takes place at another time, but the message fits the generation perfectly, and beyond. I have shown Luke to high schoolers in this decade, and there is a resonance, a "getting it" that works forty years after the fact.I can't think of a major flaw in this film. Cool Hand Luke isn't rocket surgery, but it is the simple story of a malcontent's pushing back at the powers that be. From Newman's hearty Luke, who quietly begins drawing his personal line in the sand at the start of the film, to George Kennedy's heartbroken bully, who decides to destroy Luke for his impertinence, then joins him when he can't be defeated, to the heartless automatons led by Strother Martin, who cannot be budged in their desire to make Luke kneel (and will not accept defeat), there is a raw, basic power here, a struggle between individualism and communitarianism.Probably the only problem with Cool Hand Luke is its commercial slickness. It plays out with just a bit too much glycerin for sweat; it's possible that the movie looks slick now because it has become such a cultural icon. Big, mirrored aviator sunglasses are an instant prompt for cruel authority figures, and ask yourself how many times you have heard, "What we have har is . . . failure to communicate!" Oh, well. I'm picking nits here and we all know how powerful the basic story of a Cool Hand Luke is in our culture. I tried to think of another character like Luke and, strangely enough, Ferris Bueller came to mind. Instead of Martin's "Failure to communicate" line, we get Ben Stein's "Anyone, anyone, anyone?" Not that similar, but raging against the machine sure does sell.And communicate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Death is the only possible way to end a story about a man who refuses to conform. Isn't it sad to see that any attempt to break the rules are predestined to be a failure. The rules are what bring us together and it's not an easy task to change them. In the short run the rebel is doomed to defeat. Change may come further on, but then the hero is dead. Just like Jesus died for our sins according to Christian mythology.This story has been told many times and one of the most beautifully filmed versions is "Cool Hand Luke" with Paul Newman as the non-conformist hero. Another story about rebels wanting to lead lives of their own is "Easy Rider" with Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper made two years later. Take the opportunity to see that one at the same time when you are in the mood for suffering with rebels facing defeat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A Natural Born World-Shaker"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Luke Jackson (Paul Newman), a dissident in mini-size, has to serve a sentence of two years in one of the American road prisons. Through his bullish, but cordial kind, he gains respect from his fellows prisoners. When he hears of the death of his mother (Jo Van Fleet), he tries to escape several times, but always gets caught. To scotch Luke's rebelliousness, the guards try to break his will with abasements and random beatings."Cool Hand Luke" works quite well as a metaphorically hedged political film, due to the seemingly naive screenplay, which, in principle, prostitutes the blatant worship of heroes. The inhuman rap system, which is established on dictatorial bedrocks, symbolizing any form of government in a way, tramples on every dignity of man, nips the free spirit in the bud and tolerates no protest. It begins immediately with the prologue, when we watch the drunk and incapable Luke demolishing parking meters. For that, he gets sentenced to two years. Being questioned on his motivations, he utters, that he comes from a small town and has "not much to do in the evenin'". Later he becomes a rebel with a cause, idolized by his jailbirds, who entrench themselves behind their own lethargy.Rosenberg's film also has some of that spurious adventure theme. Everyone remembers the egg scene, the dusty country road reflected in the sunglasses of the main guard, and we remember Luke's smile, exactly described by buddy Dragline (George Kennedy) at the end: "You know, that, that Luke smile of his. He had it on his face right to the very end. Hell, if they didn't know it 'fore, they could tell right then that they weren't a-gonna beat him. That old Luke smile." With that role, Newman became the idol of so many little boys and young men, and set himself a lasting monument. This is probably the most important forerunner of the modern prison movie and a true representative of New Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film can't help in a way draw subliminal comparisons to the life of Jesus Christ for me. I love the film without this comparison but also because of it. There are so many examples Luke makes juxtaposed to what both experienced as teachers, miracle makers, and risk takers. Those who doubted lived vicariously through them.Luke is, because of is character, doomed to die from the beginning, never giving up trying to be free from the rural prison and it's brutal guardians. It is as if it was time he was put there for those who needed someone to taunt and scorn but trying to show others opportunities they could take if they chose.We get, in the initial scenes of the movie, how loved he is by his mother and an unspoken feeling by Luke of his feeling for her which is the same. He is searching for something and someone to believe in him. He has that in her but as the movie moves forward also in the inmates who follow him and his earthly exploits.He shows a miracle to his peers by eating 50 hard boiled eggs in an hour letting those who thought him a fool and those he impressed or thought he was just running on dumb luck and borrowed time increase their wealth by betting on whether he could perform this feat, especially Dragline, George Kennedy, his protector and ultimately Luke's Judas. It is not without forethought that this brilliant screenplay by Donn Pearce has him placed on his back in a crucified position after accomplishing his mission of eating all the eggs.When word gets to the prison that his mother is dead, Luke immediately mourns her with a song sung tenderly and quietly from his bunk about the "plastic Jesus" on the dashboard of is car. He is never the same after losing the one person who loved and his rock escaping from the road gang and prison at every opportunity. The risks he takes to remove himself from the rural prison and life itself are almost careless yet brilliant, the last successful attempt at escape driving away in one of the bosses trucks after taking the keys to the other two so they could not immediately chase him.A total failure to communicate his need to educate the men in the prison to "stop feeding off of me" and take their own risks with their consequences in this life which is an everyday risk is the message I am left with ringing in my ears after Luke is shot and carried away bloodied from the shot entering is body.The director, Stuart Rosenberg, and Pearce have given a clear message to all who view this classic. "Down Here on the Ground", (the main title song), live your life for yourself not through the beliefs, success or pain and loss of another.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The emperor of the losers...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Luke (Paul Newman) is a guy that's angry with God and with the whole world, he has nothing to lose and nothing to win. One night he gets drunk and he destroys some road signs and gets imprisoned in a hard labour Texan jail."Cool hand Luke" is one of the most popular movies about convicted, and maybe idealizes a little what it means to be in jail.Paul Newman's work is just awesome (as usual), he was the perfect actor to play a rebel-charismatic-stubborn hero. An emperor of the losers. "Cool hand Luke" is a piece of cinema mythology itself, and the answer to a big question: can anybody eat 50 eggs? *My rate: 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've known this movie for a while, but I've only come to fully appreciate it recently. This movie used to have heavy rotation on free TV in the 70's, so I've been familiar with it since early on. Cool music and a cool anti-hero story probably influenced the initial fondness for it, but after my recent viewings I think I'd safely put it in my Top 20 Faves. Don't let the low profile mislead you - 'Cool Hand Luke' might be one of the most influential movies of the 60's. Great script, one I'm sure the Coen Brothers would bear witness to. Paul Newman is a natural in this role - he's got a great smile and he knows how to bottle up the angst. Little things used to bug me about this movie, like the jazzy editing style in a southern hemisphere drama but now it seems fine. A classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had vague memories of seeing this movie years before and was keen to relive it.There are more iconic moments in this film than most people remember and it has one of the all time great movie lines. 'What we have here is a failure to communicate.' Oft quoted but who would remember where it came from. Iconic moments include the egg eating bet (not sure why the director chose to leave the Christ on the Cross pose as the last image in this scene - I don't see Luke as Christ figure - although he has disciples and his NO. 37 are biblical references - Luke.37 )and the hot and sweaty scene stealing car-wash girl - again often copied ( One Night at McCools comes to mind) but again who remembers its origin.Cool Hand Luke is one of Newmans best parts - he gets to draw on a range of emotions - but as the film draws to a close i still see him as a loser not a rebel not a hero but a man out of time and out of options. A desperate man in need of something he can never find - happiness. When at one point he is visited in prison by his mother he his chided by her for once being 'sensible' and making them worry at his attempt at normalcy. It seems he tried to settle down but it just wasn't for him.Right from the outset we know Lukes destiny - he can't be seen to win but by being the anti-hero he brings a little hope to those he leaves behind. Watch out for a young Harry Dean Stanton and Dennis Hopper. Small cameos also to the Council Leader from the Matrix -and Pa Walton.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>His crime: nonconformity. His sentence: the chain gang. Paul Newman plays one of his best-loved roles as Cool Hand Luke, the loner who won't ? or can't ? conform to the arbitrary rules of his captivity. It recalls other hallmark Newman performances: Luke is "The Hustler" without a dream of victory, "Harper" without a moral mission, "Hud" without a father to defy."Give an actor a good script and he'll move the world," Newman said when pronouncing Cool Hand Luke on of the best scripts he'd read in years. "Luke is detached and indifferent, but he can't beat the system he scoffs at." There's good reason for the scripts authenticity: co-author Donn Pearce spent two years of his own life on a chain gang.A cast of fine character actors, including George Kennedy in his Academy-Award winning? role of Dragline, gives Newman solid support as fellow prisoners. And Strother Martin is the Captain who taunts Luke with the famous line, "What we've got here is...failure to communicate." No failure here. With rich humor and vibrant storytelling power, Cool Hand Luke succeeds resoundingly.?1967: Best Supporting Actor.?From the Cool Hand Luke DVD box</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paul Newman in one of his landmark roles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Newman plays Lucas Jackson, also known as Cool Hand Luke, a man who just couldn't live by the rules or actually didn't give a damn about them. As we soon learn Luke had a history of sort of rebellions (Listen closely as the captain goes over Lukes file and amazed to learn that despite of being a war hero, Luke got out of the army in the same military rank he was first recruited - private. According to Luke he "was just passing time" and now Luke got himself 2 years in a tough southern prison for cutting off the parking meter heads or "maliciously destroyed municipal property". The movie has excellent dialogs delivered perfectly by the actors sometimes with sense of cynicism. Most notable scenes are the sexy blond (Lucille!!!) chick whose washing her car in order to arouse the poor prisoners ("She knows exactly what she's doing, driving us nuts and loving every minute of it"). another scene is the boiled eggs meal where Luke eats 50 eggs! this scene is priceless. the cast is top notch: Newman is perfectly suited to this kind of role and his acting is flawless. He really makes the character of Luke unforgettable. George Kennedy in his Oscar winning role as the prison's tough guy who befriends with Luke. also watch for a young Denis Hopper as one of the inmates. This movie is a prison drama at it's best. Don't miss this classic, it's a must see for anyone who consider himself a movie fan. Recommended 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Stay down!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I picked that short but memorable quote as my one-line summary because it perfectly encapsulates the internal, rather than outward conflict that runs right throughout the movie. If you "Stay Down!" then you can eke out an existence, but you become a 'leech' rather than a solid example of humanity.The price for cementing your own presence saps your energy just as crucially, though, if less tangibly...Paul Newman is perfect for a role like this; because he seems to be the bearer of such a quiet dignity as a man anyway, let alone an actor. We're left to ponder whether it is in fact PRISON life which has imbued this kind of grace and dignity within Luke. He arrived there for some trivial misdemeanour, but in his current environment, even trivial undertakings eventually take on an extra symbolism all of their own. Things MATTER more, and how you approach them matters greatly, also. What exactly would such a man amount to in the open world, without the influence of oppressive and restrictive forces?Is the way to survive an institution to draw strength from others and yet not allow to be drawn from oneself? These are complex questions deriving from a basic theme; but there is a far simpler slogan that can become a 'byword' for handling your troubles...Luke would doubtless not be presumptuous enough to push it forward using the unwelcome 'leader' status he attains, but it goes thus: 'Know your limits, keep within yourself, and above all, be cool!' 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this movie today and despite being released almost 40 years ago it still blew me away. Paul Newman showed his acting chops like a champion, a flawless performance by Newman playing a crafty and congenial prisoner in the south.On the surface of this movie you see how one man repeatedly pays for the mistakes he makes. Look closer at what is going on with the main character and you will see Luke struggling to understand human idealogy and his own spirituality. The songs played in the movie do a lot to reinforce the theology struggle.Spoilers: The fight scene where Luke is forced to fight Dragline is a moment of brilliance. Something Coppola borrowed from heavily to make Raging Bull with.The car wash scene is unfadable. Sir Mix A Lot! We know now who was the first to "Put em on the glass" on camera!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's the holy grail! A movie about a loner, where the whole story ISN'T about drawing the character out of his shell. Instead, Newman gets to withdraw and simmer, and the supporting players come to represent the tug of war between different aspects of his personality. I can appreciate movies that never seeks to explain their main characters; they let the audience soak in the meaning from the details surrounding him. Left with nothing but inferences (and the exotic behaviors of everyone else), we have to insert ourselves into the part to sort out Luke's feelings.The end of the song gives us a glimpse, but even that moment is fleeting and shrouded, so the title character remains a mystery to us forever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whenever this film is one TV, I always seem to find myself watching it. I think I must've seen this movie a hundred times over the years. And I never grow bored with it. The director weaves a seamless story that's absolutely riveting. I think it's one of Paul Newman's best, most truthful performances. The film was made during his heyday as an actor, but he doesn't let his star quality supersede his playing a character for all it's worth. Newman peels away the veneer from his beautiful looks and reveals the underbelly and darkness within. And I think that darkness he lets us see makes his character even more physically beautiful. There's no great morality tale here, but that isn't necessary. The film manages to be entertaining, fun, dramatic, and wonderfully sincere. It's certainly one of my all-time favorite films.</fullReview>

It's another one of those films that you have to stop &amp; watch all the way to the end when you stumble upon it changing channels. Newman (and all the great supporting actors) were at their best. Special kudos to Strother Martin. The guy made almost 70 movies, of which I've seen only a handful (including UP IN SMOKE, HARD TIMES, THE END, THE FLIM-FLAM MAN, and of course SLAP SHOT). But if there ever was a Hall of Fame for character actors, Strother gets elected on the first ballot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whether or not you have any interest in `old' films, this is a film that cannot be missed. Paul Newman is so indescribably cool in this movie, so mysterious and rebellious, that his performance can and hopefully will inspire non-conformists for generations to come. Put simply, it does not age. He's only a man, and can be beaten, but his spirit is never broken, and his focus never lost. As for the rest of the movie, from end to end it's nearly flawless. Arguably the best script ever written, amazing cinematography from Conrad Hall, and a solid supporting cast gives the viewer the feeling that this is the definitive rebel movie. Surrounded by inmates who have forgotten to think for themselves and believe in themselves, he gets the whole prison believing again. It seems as if the one thing those inmates needed was the hope for freedom, being stuck behind bars and fences can quickly kill a man's will. Luke enters, and is the embodiment of all these hopes, and revels in the trust and camaraderie he is given. If you have the time to be reading reviews about it, use your time wisely and go rent ?Cool Hand Luke' tonight, you'll be very happy with the outcome. Rating: 37/40</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely Paul Newman's best film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this classic film Paul Newman gives his best performance ever in a film (although the Academy Awards failed to think so). While I'm upset at the Academy Awards snubbing Newman's performance, 1967 would've been a hard year to choose a winner (Rod Steiger in In the Heat of the Night, Spencer Tracey in Guess Who's Coming To Dinner, Dustin Hoffman in The Graduate, and the icing on the cake, Warren Beatty in Bonnie and Clyde). All the performances were Oscars caliber, and I guess they couldn't have a five way tie....but Rod Steiger? Oh, well, that was many many years ago. Newman's performance finally got some attention this summer as his character of Lucas Jackson appeared on the list of the top 50 heroes of the movies of the last 100 years. It made me very happy seeing as AFI failed to list the film in the top 100 movies. But your favorite film can't win everything I guess. If you're a Paul Newman fan definitely check this one out, you won't be disappointed. If you don't check it out you're a "Failure to Communicate."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool Hand Luke has got to be one of the best movies I've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen a lot of movies, and Cool Hand Luke is one of the few that I gave a 10. The movie was very well made, well acted, and well casted. I couldn't see anyone else as accurately playing the parts in the movie, except maybe Denzel Washington if they made a new version of the film where Luke was black, because Paul Newman is old now, and he's not even black. Anyhow, not only was the movie awesome and very well made, it was made from a novel. They say that books are hard to turn into movies (watch "Sphere" to see for yourself {the book "Sphere" was good but the motion picture sucks!}) and that you have to start from scratch when moviemaking- obviously not with Cool Hand Luke. Luke is copied for heroes in many other movies, books, and even video games (Metal Gear Solid), as is the mysterious warden ("Holes"). Cool Hand Luke is a movie about a man arrested for something he did while intoxicated, then makes every effort to escape a labor camp. Special appearance by Dennis Hopper when he was young. A must-see. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rusalka's twenty-eighth film review: A Failure to Communicate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's face it, if there was no Cool Hand Luke, there would be no Shawshank Redemption. It's as simple as that. For its day, Cool Hand Luke took plenty of risks in its depiction of the brutality of the southern-style work farm (an easier way to say Prison) and of a Chain Gang.All the men here are rough and tumble, save for Paul Newman's Luke, a loner who was sent there for "busting the heads off of parking meters" as he so eloquently puts it. He is thrown into this pile of self-effacing, self-deprecating men with only his own standards and basic moral code to help him stay aloft, but of course they all want to break him and will use any means by which are available to them to do so. In every prison film that you see, the man (or woman) in prison always believes that he (or she) doesn't belong there. That is also true for Luke, however we never hear him utter one word of contempt towards his captors at all. Instead he tries to show his fellow inmates and "bosses" the human side of a man. But, when all hope appears to be gone, Luke attempts to do the next best thing. I won't tell you what that is, you have to see the film for yourself to understand it.Cool Hand Luke was nominated for four Academy Awards (Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Score) with George Kennedy winning Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of "Dragline", the self-appointed leader of the inmates who shows Luke a thing or two about life in captivity.My rating: 3 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cool Hand Luke is a great picture that demonstrates to us how a movie can be made simply. I love this movie for the fact that it doesn't try to lure you in with flashy effects or stylish editing. The characters in this movie are great to watch as they learn to like good ol' Luke. Even the chef and the security guards sympathize with him! The movie might be slow for those with a short attention span. But for movie fans looking for a nice and well though out drama, this movie shines. Paul Newman plays Luke like no other could, rascally and smug, yet oh-so likeable. George Kennedy does a good job as his big, bodyguard jailmate. And Strother Martin plays another great character as the prison chief. The acting gets a 9. Directing gets an 8. Cinematography and visuals get a nice 9. The story gets an 8. And the music gets an 8 as well. So, overall I give this movie a 9. ***A little trivia fact for Angelinos*** The music played when they are trying to pave the road as fast as they can was used for ABC's local Los Angeles affiliate ABC7 at the start of their Eyewitness News program back in the 1970's and 1980's.</fullReview>

If they followed up that question with "Have you ever heard of COOL HAND LUKE?!" I would be dumbfounded. I watched this movie in film class, which I was very fortunate for, because this movie is one of the best, or the best movie I've seen in my life.Paul Newman is a perfect fit for the character of Luke, a quiet, witty man with a smile that makes your knees give. The cast of this film is utterly magnificent, with a chemistry that adds a notorious charm to this film that attracted me to it.The religious imagery is a strong theme, and makes the film so interesting. Imagine, Paul Newman portraying a Jesus-like character. Who woulda THUNK?! Not to mention George Kennedy as Luke's large chum, and even smaller roles, like Jo Van Fleet's portrayal of Luke's coughing and gagging mom, all of which are legendary. If you havent seen this movie, you are truly missing out on one of the best movies in the history of film, and now every time I see my Ol' friend Paul Newman on a bottle of creamy ranch, I think of the charm of Luke, and the impact this film had on me.</fullReview>

He WAS Lucas Jackson!George Kennedy was born to play Dragline. He won the Oscar and deservedly so.

That is pretty much why he was in trouble in the first place and why he never really got out of it. This picture isn't full of explosions and hi-tech special effects, it's full of real life action. Guys sitting around makin' bets about off the wall kinds of things and those same guys drooling like boys over a woman that they will never get the chance to even talk to.

When I watch it now, those "best parts" still stand out, but now that I'm older, I'm catching on to the other ones: this tormented man who could never deal with authority, the "fair-weather friends" who stick by him only as long as he remains their hero, Luke's tortured search for God (the ultimate authority figure). Kennedy's performance is wonderful, Newman is superb.... I recommend this to anyone who wants a good cry and some good laughs along the way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyaable guy film, also modern retelling of Christ story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Absorbing, enjoyable guy film, like a more depressing "Mister Roberts." Also a rather forced retelling of the Christ-story via plot, dialogue and visuals: Luke is "bored in Eden" and vandalizes some parking meters(didn't Christ upset the tax collectors?); eats 50 eggs (40 days in the desert and lays on a table like a crucified Christ, escapes and appears to go to paradise in a photo(aka heaven); tells his 'disciples' to stop feeding off his rebellious spirit, has frequent one-way talks with god(something you don't see much in movies); gets handed over, sort of, by his oafish John the Baptist side-kick. Film also seems to have an erotic view of the male form. The big drawback to the film: George Kennedy, not unlike Stuart Margolin, is one of the most unconvincing actors to hit Hollywood. He's like Lon Chaney Jr, only sometimes more menacing and less sympathetic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real cool hand of a movie. Nothing but 10s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I scored it a real cool 10. No bluffing as it holds a royal flush of cinema magic. A real cool hand.It is centred on a rebellious character named Luke. Remember this movie was made in the 60s when rebellion was in the wind. These tendencies land him in a prison sentenced to hard time and performing hard labour for the big boss man. These days lawyers would buzz like hornets knocked from a shaken hive and screaming about infringement of civil liberties of a prisoner who was forced to sweat while incarcerated. These guys had no air conditioning, no weightroom, no TVs with 40 channels and no legal sharks to protect them. Just mean bosses, hard work and time. Life seemed a little more innocent and simple. These boys were all criminals, but yet they had some scruples of their own. They all had a line drawn in their conscience and if not society would draw it for them. In this prison, which is a common theme for a Hollywood venture, there is no F#*^# this or F^%#&amp;!n that, no sodomy in the shower fiasco, and no gangs. Everyone knew and remembered that any man playing grabass or fightin' in the building spends a night in the box.Luke is a lovable character and has a grin like a baby. He is a carefree spirit who never plans anything. He shoots from the hip and is fountain of hope for the other inmates. Luke is a crazy handful of nothin and is stubborn as a plow pullin mule. He is not dangerous to anyone except himself. Paul Newman will always be a real Cool Hand Luke to me. One of the great performances ever. The surrounding characters are great. George Kennedy plays Dragline and wins some awards for his performance. Dragline is Lennie from `Of Mice and Men' with a rap sheet. I love the blues gospel of Harry Dean Stanton ringing out of the bunkhouse while raindrops fall on the boss's dirt. Those songs set the mood like Johnny Mathis and candlelight, but its not love that's in the air. The music sets the tone for gettin ones mind right. Captain, played by Strother Martin, has one of the most memorable quotes in movies. His line is a classic. His performance is a classic. Many of the quotes are always on the tip of my tongue. I love it when ole Luke tells Captain to stop being so nice to him. The eggs and wager scene is great. The car washing is a sexy scene without showing any flesh. She is a true Lucille!I have watched this movie several times. This film is a world shaker. I have the tape and I watch the reruns on TV. I will buy the DVD. Anybody who does not like this movie.. Well...What we've got here is failure to communicate. Some movie viewers you just can't reach.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prison life in the late 1940s is brought vividly to life in Cool Hand Luke, the story of ones man's fight against authority. Paul Newman gives one of his finest performances as Luke. George Kennedy just about steals the scenes with his award winning acting. Strother Martin is perfect as "Captain". Jo Van Fleet is seen only for a few minutes but is memorable as Luke's mother. Look for Ralph Waite who is excellent as "Alibi Gibson". Waite would go on to be cast as the father of John Boy in The Waltons. Great work by Wayne Rogers who went on to co-star in M.A.S.H. Much credit must be given to director Stuart Rosenberg. The film is visually stunning with an amazing amount of effective close ups.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Newman is Cool Hand Luke in "Cool Hand Luke", the story of a rebel prisoner with "rabbit in his blood". This movie delivers excellent performances from Newman (always great) and many supporting players, notably George Kennedy's Oscar turn as Luke's comrade Dragline. Paul Newman's character Luke Jackson is someone that people feed off of. The prison guards feed off humiliating him. His fellow prisoners feed off his resolve and gameness for every challenge. And we see, as the movie progresses, how they will feed off his legend long after he is gone..."Cool Hand Luke" manages to be funny, touching, and shocking all at once, and boy, you will not forget those images in a hurry.

He's not only a loner to his cell mates, but also to the audience. Strother Martin is excellent as the Captain, while he sounds rather tame is actually brutal. Its a little melodramatic, but it ultimately is about the result of alienation. Great if you are in a rebellious mood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you could only rent one Paul Newman movie, this would be the one. A film that is great on so many levels, it covers all the great literary themes: redemption, alienation. In fact, the film follows the book very closely. It almost seems as if the book was written for Newman and George Kennedy in mind. Newman is a convict, a war hero sent to a chain gang for cutting the heads off parking meters because "it seemed like a good thing to do." A loner, yet an unintentional leader, the gang looks up to Luke as he starts a series of break outs. Newman's portrayal of the charasmatic Luke is arguably his greatest role (for which he was nominated for an Oscar, but didn't win). George Kennedy did in fact win an Oscar for his role and in the film, you'll see a whole crowd of actors you'll recognize, including a young Dennis Hopper and Wayne Rogers.This film is a classic and I highly recommend you check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Small town misfit Lucas Jackson ends up in a road prison for 'criminal damage against municipal property'. Despite the rather unusual crime he committed and his standoffish attitude he eventually gains the respect of prisoner and guard alike. This is a neat little film which showcases Newman's undoubted talent. His excellent performance as the non-conformist 'Cool Hand' Luke lends much to a film which has been eclipsed repeatedly as best prison movie. What the film lacks in the depth of it's characters it makes up for in audience feeling towards Luke and his desire to find his place in society yet not change his ways. You can't help but love his stubborn arrogance as he goes up against the system and many of the films ideas can be found in better and deeper movies like 'The Shawshank Redemption'. It's sad to think that it is better remembered for the egg-eating scene than for it's symbolism and regard to those who choose to live as social drifters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Newman's Luke Jackson is imprisoned for 2 years for tearing up parking meters in a small southern town while on a drunken spree. He is sentenced to a chain gang and passively challenges the guards and some fellow inmates with his cooly indifferent and rebellious ways, such as eating 50 hard-boiled eggs, defying the self-styled "leader" of the gang (a great performance by George Kennedy), and running away after being locked up in solitary for a week that was ordered by the warden to keep him from attending his mother's funeral. Great performances all over, Strother Martin as the slimy soft-spoken warden, Jo Van Fleet as his emphysema-ridden mother, and small roles by Dennis Hopper, Harry Dean Stanton, and The Walton's Ralph Waite. However, two of the guards, especially the one who never talks and always wears sunglasses, really irritated me, and I would have loved to have seen Luke have it out with them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Newman is just so damn cool in this movie, even if I never really do understand his motivation. He ends up in the pokey, and on the chain gang, for destroying public property, after one helluva bender where he decided to cut the heads off a couple dozen parking meters.So he ends up in a badass southern prison with George Kennedy (who is so good in this movie, it's still a mystery what happened to his acting ability--he won an oscar for this role) and a very young Dennis Hopper, who even at this age, smokes up the screen.But Newman owns this film. He plays a guy whose sole purpose in life, even in prison is just to be cool--to take every dare and to risk it all every day of the week.And of course, I can't go through this movie without mentioning the car wash scene, where the chain gang boys happen to be working across the street from a lonely southern girl who gets her kicks by teasing them with her sexuality. Wearing a very thin, very tight sundress, she gets all soapy and wet while washing her old Chevy. George Kennedy just about goes mad trying to decide if he sees better with or without his prison-issue sunglasses: "Puttin' 'em on, boss!" "Takin' 'em off, boss, they're blocking my view!"Anyway, Newman does a great job showing us one too cool for this earth. You know from the get go that he's not meant to make it to the closing credits.By the way, it is in this movie where the warden makes famous the line, "What we have here is a failure to communicate!"</fullReview>

He has the respect of all his colleaques and some of the prison guards as well. He is trouble whether the "bosses" knows it or not. An outstanding film that shows the tolerance one man can withstand.

I feel Newman could have done very well in that movie as well. I get a little something more from the plot each time I watch this movie, and enjoy it most when I am feeling lost. In the end, he is consumed by the others feeding on him. Until he got his mind right......boss. A failure to communicate goes way beyond words.

		<fullReview>In 67 I was on a military base heading for Vietnam when I first saw Cool Hand Luke. The Armed Forces got first release on the movies back than, even before they were run in the civilian theaters. There were no reviews, nothing in the papers or anywhere else because the movies were so new. All I had to go on was Paul Newman's name. I was mesmerized by the acting, script and production values of this film. The film taught me a number of things I used in my military experience i.e. 1) importance of comradeship 2) being able to stand up for ones self and 3) being a nonconformist when it counts. Newman was ex Navy and he devoted a good portion of his time and money helping veterans. He was also of course a very charitable man (all "Newmans Own" profits go to charities) and an accomplished race car driver. I have only a few of his movies missing from my DVD collection and I never tire or get bored watching his movies. Cool Hand Luke is one I've watched at least once a year for the last 10 years. I wish more Hollywood actors would follow his style. Newman was Cool Hand Luke in style, flair and coolness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What an Incredible Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not very old. I grew up in the Nineties, not the Sixties; "Cool Hand Luke" had been out for nearly three decades by the time I saw it. And man, oh, man, is it a powerful film. I recently revisited it, as much for kicks as anything else, and I was surprised at how much I had missed when I first saw it. This film is heralded as a nonconformist film and a social commentary. Well, it may be a social commentary, but calling it a nonconformist film is like calling the Hope Diamond just a gem. It is so much more. Luke is a stubborn guy, and when he's shot at the end, it's affecting. But Luke isn't the type of guy who is stubborn to be a nuisance, it's just how he is; he can't help it. He became a hero to the men, compromising their own dreams of freedom just to get a glimpse of Luke's, but he never chose to be. He partakes in horrible acts of self-destruction, like eating fifty hard-boiled eggs in one hour or boxing against the makeshift leader of the men, and his does so willingly, until he's battered and broken beyond repair. The film is about what it takes to break a man. The psychological and physical torture put upon him by the guards cause him to question himself, and then God for having made him as he is. When he runs to an old church and asks God what to do with the hand he's been dealt is a haunting and indelible piece of cinema, from his soliloquy to his death. It's unforgettable. George Kennedy plays the leader of the prisoners, and a friend of Luke's. His character is deep and complex, not as strong as he lets on, nor does he understand Luke, but he is a wonderful character and a good man. This film is more bleak than other social commentaries, like "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" a decade later, but Paul Newman as Luke is a more likable, sympathetic character in a significantly worse situation. Nobody else could have pulled off a role like Luke.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paul Newman, back as a rebel without a cause.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Only a few years after his role in the movie "Hud", Paul Newman is back playing a rebellious character again, only this time set inside a prison. And not just an ordinary prison; a chain gang prison, somewhere in the rural, southern part of America.This movie has a very simple and very straightforward approach really but some movies really don't need much more than that. It's simplicity is actually what helps to movie forward and the reason why you remain glued to the screen. It's s true compelling movie, about real characters, kicking against authority.You could say it's a slow moving movie but it actually never really feels that way. There is always something happening, whether it be on the screen or in the character's heads. It's what really gets you into the characters and make you care about them. Yes, they are small time criminals but only because society regards them that way. You could also say that they are free minds, who don't simply want to life by the moral standards of modern society and don't want to play by the rules. People who say that the movie and its story is just pointless because they don't see what exactly message the movie was trying to get across should really watch this movie again, with a clear and open mind. With all respect but there is so much in this movie and to its main characters that it's really ludicrous to call this movie a boring or pointless one.The way the Luke character is set up and gets portrayed by Paul Newman makes him such a great and true rebellious character. By being different he actually slowly start to gain the respect of his fellow prisoners and as a viewer you can also really understand why. You'll slowly start to understand the character better and why he does the things the way the does. Unlike the authorities, you don't condemn him for the things he has done and does in this movie.But really the movie still would had not been as compelling and great to watch, if it wasn't for its directing approach as well. Even though its 1967 movie, it has '70's style written all over it. I really loved some of the movie sequences and was really impressed with the movie its look as well. It has some great cinematography in it by Conrad L. Hall, who lets the camera move a lot and gives us some great looking compositions as well. I was disappointed to learn that it didn't even got nominated for an Oscar but perhaps that was also due to it that Conrad L. Hall was already also nominated for a different movie that year and the other acclaimed cinematographer Robert Surtees got nominated for two different movies already. Having only three different cinematographers compete would perhaps had been a bit too measly. But having said that; this movie its cinematography would had totally deserved to win and is worthy of all of its praise.But luckily the movie did not got completely ignored by the Academy. It did receive 4 nominations but George Kennedy would be eventually the only one that also got to take the statue home with him. Quite funny, I never looked at George Kennedy thinking he was an Oscar worthy actor but after having him seen in this movie, I can't really complain about him winning.Perhaps the biggest surprise remains that this was more or less a one hit wonder from director Stuart Rosenberg. Prior to this movie, he had only mainly worked for television and after this movie, he never really delivered a movie of the same grandeur and stature again. It's why his name also probably won't ring a bell, unless to those who have seen the original "The Amityville Horror" perhaps. But it should tell you enough already about his career that the only movie people are still familiar with now days, next to "Cool Hand Luke" is the '70's horror production "The Amityville Horror". A real mystery and surprise to me, since this movie shows so much class and talent, it is hard to understand why he never came close to that same level again.A real must-see movie, in my opinion.9/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool Hand Luke - 2 thumbs up!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great movie and once I saw it I completely understood why Paul Newman was such a huge star. The fight scene with George Kennedy was difficult to watch but impossible not to. Luke's spirit brought a lump to my throat. Kennedy also did a great job as Luke's eventual side kick and greatest admirer and the sunglass wearing sheriff did a superb job of portraying "the man" with body language and the sunglasses as a prop. I enjoyed watching a movie in which today's Hollywood guaranteed happy ending was not for sure as it is today. Movies such as these make you think and really feel for the character. On a fashion note, no one can rock prison garb like Paul!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whatever Luke Jackson communicated, he didn't fail ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"What we've got here is ? failure to communicate" : one of the most representative quotes of the sixties' free-spiritedness, incarnated by Lucas Jackson, Cool Hand Luke, Paul Newman's most enigmatic role. But I don't know if I'm the only one, but whenever I hear Strother Martin's unique nasal voice delivering this line, I immediately complete it, with "? some men you just can't reach" And I think this part of the quote best defines Luke's character."Failure" is a word I can't associate with Luke. He's not a loser, nor a winner; he wouldn't care about how you'd call him anyway. In fact, he cares for nothing, except for his mother, who dies early in the movie, as a God's will to kill the last meaningful thing still remaining in his life. With the death of Lucas' mother, begins the incessant cycle of escapes and returns that'll build Luke's legend. The Captain senses "a failure to communicate" where the other inmates, on the top of them, Dragline, superbly played by George Kennedy, see a man whose spirit can never been unchained. One inmate admits though he doesn't have Luke's guts, but not his chains' either.But ironically, these chains are Luke's freedom, because they're the most eloquent expression of Luke's personality. The more they unchain him, the more he rebels, the more he's loved, the more he makes himself less lovable. Chains and chants, their ticketing acts as a reminder of a useless presence, useless because Luke has basically no memory whatsoever, for his spirit never looks behind. Luke is one of the most detached cinematic characters ever, in a sort of nihilistic way, not suicidal, but masochistic with a reason. His pain is his freedom, when following the rules is the best way not to be hurt or to spend a night in the box. Luke doesn't want safety, nor security, he wants freedom. No rule to define him. Why? The point is not why, but why not.This "why not?" attitude is Luke's detachment, expressed through Paul Newman's beautiful blue eyes and boyish smile. This Iconic smile that freezes during the opening credits best defines the character. Even Dragline, his number one fan, informs the chain-gang, that Luke was smiling at his death. Luke's smile is his weapon, the true expression of his free spirit. No message, no ideal, he just believes in not being guided. God is his only master and only He knows where this is leading. Luke is not guided but inspires the gang against his will, he's almost a God-like figure at a point he even tries to make himself less sympathetic.But it's just as impossible to hate Luke, just like to 'get' him, in all the meaning of the words, and what to get anyway? Luke has nothing except himself to show, the rest is just a nickname won with a hand full of nothing, a fake photography, a constant disobedience to the rules and an impressive insistence to take the hits with never giving up. That's all? That's everything. It's all about moral resistance. As long as he has the legs and the heart to run, he runs, where to, who cares? Who cares? Why not? The eggs challenge is another illustration of this "why not?" attitude. He eats the eggs, he takes all the hits, all the challenges, all the shots.After he finishes the eggs, there is a symbolic Christ pose of Luke. He's a Christic figure with no message other than to free your spirit from meaningless rules, that nobody should decide for your fate. Basically, Luke's character is bigger than his ideal, and the failure to communicate is a moral victory, they can touch his body but never his spirit. Luke is a Christ in his martyrdom, he takes the hits, the humiliations, the punishments and harassments, but never gives up, he still wants to find the road, the meaning of all this. He doesn't know where to go, but he knows he must go. He's a prophet with no verbal message, but the message is there anyway. When Dragline declares, with his eyes full of love : "Oh Luke. You wild, beautiful thing. You crazy handful' of nothing" you can see eyes of love and fascination. The message is clear, because it's not expressed by words, but by a smile, and blue eyes so pure the rest would be hard to express, due to the eternal problem of communication. Whoelse than Paul Newman could have played such a charismatic character?Luke doesn't want to be followed, as he doesn't even know where his road will lead him. He believes in God, and believes God abandoned him, he addressed him during the climax wondering what the meaning of this is? We wonder too. What was wrong from the start? He was arrested for cutting heads of parking meters, how did this lead to such an extreme situation? Maybe because, he's an extreme character, a man whose eyes look at the future in such a proudly detached way, they can't admit to pretend. How ironic, that he's killed by the fearsome never talking Man-With-No-Eyes, the blind one, who killed Lucas, whose last look is not a smile, but a shock, as to implicitly beg God to forgive them, because they didn't know what they did.Luke's demise is his last victory because they killed but never reached him. The last shot in the cross-roads symbolizes this victory, as he still inspires the working chain-gang who'll believe that no chains are solid enough to stop them. Dragline, talks like Luke's apostle, reminding us of his legendary smile. The last shot with Luke and the two girls, whether it was a fake or not proves that whatever Luke's character communicated to the inmates, to us, he didn't fail.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The quintessential Paul Newman movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like Paul Newman, he is very likable while being suitably brooding and intense in his films. To me, as much as I do like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Cool Hand Luke is my favourite movie of this great actor. What of Newman himself? Well he is just superb here, very cool and charismatic as well as the skills he is best at. The cinematography is also a delight, the Technicolour is just stunning, and Stuart Rosenberg's direction is a career-best. The dialogue is crisp and memorable, and the story is beautifully constructed. As for any memorable scenes, the prologue and the egg-eating scene are classics, the film succeeds adeptly at being a character study and I for one had no problem with the religious symbolism. Lalo Schifrin's music is very nice too. So all in all, if you love Paul Newman, you will love Cool Hand Luke. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The comment angles seem to have all been covered here, but I just saw this great movie again on TCM and as an intro they had about a five minute talk by George Kennedy in regards to the scene with "car wash girl", Joy Harmon. By the look of it, it was recorded some time in the last year. Great story which I thought I'd add here. George said that Joy was going to be brought in for a half a day of shooting by director Stuart Rosenberg. The male cast was given the half day off for this shooting and were told they would be called when the crew were done shooting with Joy.A half day turned into a full day, and the guys were not called to set. Then two, then three days, and the male actors did not get called. Rosenberg shot Joy washing that car for three days (although she had no dialog and was only on screen for under 80 seconds). Then the male actors were brought back to shoot their side of the scene. For their inspiration for this scene, Rosenberg brought in a teenage girl who just walked around the car wearing an overcoat.George said two things about this. First, it was the toughest acting he ever had to do. And second, somewhere out there is about 28,000 feet of unseen film footage of Joy Harmon washing a car.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a term one uses to state with admiration, anyone who challenges authority. In films, audiences have great respect for this individual who displays courage against a superior force. In this film, we get a first hand look at the Southern prison system otherwise known as 'The Chain Gang.' Although the system was deemed cruel, abusive and flagrantly torturous and eventually outlawed, it has returned. The movie is called " Cool Hand Luke " and stars one of the most beloved movie actors of all time. Paul Newman plays Luke, an unemployed, lack-luster ex-soldier who occasionally gets drunk, finds himself arrested, tried and imprisoned in a chain gang system. His crime? Malacious mischief. It earned him two years incarceration. Here Luke defiantly adapts to the 'Boss' system of authority. The cons he's imprisoned with are unimpressed with him until he fights the biggest and strongest to a admirable loss. There after, due to his motto, " Sometimes nothing, can be a very Cool hand " he is christened " Cool Hand. " The Warden of the prison seek to crush his independent spirit so when Luke's mother dies, he is unexpectedly placed into 'The Box'. Unfairly punished, Luke accepts the challenge and retaliates. There after it's a question of time before, Luke is beaten or he makes good his escape. A number of notable stars can be seen in featured parts who also make this film the Classic it has become. Men such as George Kennedy, Strother Martin as the Captain, Morgan Woodward, Luke Askew, Dennis Hopper, Wayne Roger, Harry Dean Stanton, Ralph Waite, and Anthony Zerbe are the strength of this very serious film. The question lingers, is it Luke or the Captain who is responsible for the remark, "what we have here, is a failure to communicate." Is the law guilty of provocation when one is punished unjustly for a minor infraction? Only the audience knows. This movie is easily recommended to all Newman fans. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is definitely a classic! The movie follows cool and gutsy Luke Jackson (Paul Newman) who is sent to a prison camp and quickly gains the respect of the other inmates. After learning that his mother has passed away, he decides it is time to break out of prison. He escapes, gets caught again, escapes, gets caught, and each time the camp staff attempt to break his spirits. Newman is his usual amazing self, with his famous wit and charm he brings to most rolls. George Kennedy was also another standout in this film earning an Oscar for his performance. There are many classic moments in this film, such as the infamous moment where Paul Newman eats 50 hard boiled eggs in the space of 60 minutes to win a bet. This really is a great film, looking at a man's determination and will, that gets taken to the limits. RIP PAUL NEWMAN! My Rating: 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The title character of "Cool Hand Luke" is perhaps the definitive anti-hero in film. His nonconformist stance lands him on a chain gang where he is predictably at odds with the guards. However, his fellow inmates idolize him. A battle of wills ensues, with Luke tirelessly striving for freedom and his jailers trying to break his spirit.Paul Newman landed an Oscar nomination for his performance; one which I think ranks among his best. George Kennedy won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar in the role of a gregarious fellow prisoner. The rest of the cast is solid, including Strother Martin and Jo Van Fleet in small but memorable roles.The script was nominated for an Oscar and contains more depth than I had previously realized. There are allusions to Luke as a Christ-like figure which are subtle and thought-provoking. However, the script's greatest triumph may be that it effectively makes us root for this anti-hero despite the fact that he does little that is heroic in the usual sense.The direction by Stuart Rosenberg is well handled and, combined with the cinematography by Conrad Hall, gives the film an attractive yet authentic look. Also worth noting is the Lalo Schifrin score, which was nominated for an Oscar.Today this film is deservedly regarded as a classic; one which I recommend wholeheartedly. However, I would caution that it's probably best considered as a 'guy' movie, so I don't know if it will hold as much appeal for women.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Real Cool Hand</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cool Hand Luke retells the archetypal struggle of hope in the face of adversity. It tells of defiance in the face of overwhelming pressure to conform. It presents to us an injudicious judicial system, whose wanton brutality and heartlessness confronts the audience. Vicariousness (which we all to some degree can identify with) is examined, in the most depressing of circumstances, namely, imprisonment. Much meaning is conveyed throughout the film and the film's overall message remains as relevant today as it did when the film was made. Luke says in the film, 'sometimes nothing can be a real cool hand.' That, in a sentence, embodies what Cool Hand Luke is about. The director is trying to say that there can be victory, regardless of circumstance and that hope, persistence and optimism can prevail against all. It is Luke's hope that keeps his smile on his face; it is hope that typifies him as a hero to his inmates, it is hope that continues to fuel his escape attempts and, above all, it is hope that keeps his spirit free. It was Thomas Carlyle who said, 'he who has hope, has everything.' The truth of these words is personified in Luke. An air of invulnerability surrounds Luke throughout the film and it is hope that acts as his protection. Even on the doorstep of death, Luke is seen smiling. From beyond the grave Luke tells those who lived vicariously through him 'keep Hope alive.' It is also this that the director is telling us. Ultimately, Cool Hand Luke tells us that freedom of spirit is of far greater importance than that of the body. It is a reminder to us; we who are 'free' to ensure that we do indeed, lead truly free lives. That we should not live our lives in a vain effort to conform to our bureaucratic systems but rather, live our lives in the way they ought to be lived. The director is telling us to be free and to hope and it is that that Cool Hand Luke so skilfully imparts to us.</fullReview>

The screenplay was superbly written, loaded with excellent quotes, whilst the direction of the movie is most notable for its ability to really make you feel the thirst and humidity of working in a chain gang.As for the title character, Luke remains the ultimate anti hero, Paul Newman(RIP) was born to play this kind of role, and boy did he play it well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Newman's Brilliance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cool Hand Luke (1967) **** (out of 4) Paul Newman plays the title character, a man who just can't reform to the rules in life and can't reform to the rules when sent to a chain gang. This is certainly without question one of my favorite movies and it certainly had a large impact on my life when I watched it as a teenager. I hold this film very close to my heart and especially the character of Luke but even without the personal feelings this remains one of the better movies out there. Some have called it a prison movie but I think that's really an insult because the film is so much more than that including one of the best character studies out there. The film has so many laughs, so many painful moments and so many dramatic moments but I think the true heart of the film is in its honesty towards Newman's character. There are countless great scenes including the legendary egg eating contest but one of my favorites has always been the ending with Newman talking to God inside the church. Needless to say, Newman is brilliant in the role and while it's hard to say which one performance of his is his greatest this one here is awfully close. You can really see Newman sticking his heart and soul into the role and you really can't imagine anyone else playing the character. George Kennedy also deserved his Oscar and Strother Martin makes for one great villain.</fullReview>

Over-all the film is very good.The only thing that is lacking is the sequences With Newman being tortured sometimes seemed a little stretched- especially the hard boiled egg sequence. This film like many of Paul Newman's career tries to mix some light comedy and drama.Newman is one of the first top movie star actors to start out more on television rather than in live theater. It shows in the way he plays to the camera more effectively than some of the actors from the other back ground. What we got here is a good film that doesn't quite make the grade as a great film. We are a few eggs short of sealing the deal here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There was a scene that popped out at me in Cool Hand Luke. It comes relatively early with his arrival to prison. While he works the ditch, his large adversary Dragline is watching a young country girl as she wash's a car. While she Wash's the car, she presses her breasts against the wet window. The shot is brief, but I have seen it in so many other movies. This was the first to use the shot. Another thing worth commenting on is the wardens high pitch souther accent. I have also seen this portrayed in some of the goofy Naked Bullet type movies and shows. Also the guard who is known as 'No Eyes.' He wears his reflective sun glasses at all times and has no lines in the movie. He remains a main character by his position and being a great shot with his rifle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is so full of symbolism and is a literary genius. Many people who watch this movie at face value simply seeing Luke as just some guy who went to prison (chain gang) and would not conform do not get this movie at all. I've read many comments on IMDb about this movie and even those who really liked it do not hint on the meaning of this movie. Luke goes to prison for a simple crime of destroying government property by cutting heads off of parking meters in a drunken stoop. He truly cares less about life in general demonstrated by what he did in the war. In the war he earns medals that he downplays which relates directly to the respect he earns of his fellow prisoners. If you saw this as some kind of male bonding movie, then you aren't looking far enough into it. Consider that Luke eats 50 eggs which represents the rebirth of the 50 prisoners there. Eating the eggs bloated him which is what a pregnant woman looks like. You see Luke laying on the table with both arms straight out and one leg folded over the other and he's wearing only white shorts. If you didn't get the Jesus Christ symbolism at that point, then you didn't get the movie. This is NOT male bonding. Luke is emulating Jesus Christ in a rough manner taking their pain into himself. He escaped 3 times not because the author wanted you to see him keep getting caught, but 3 is a prominent number in the bible. For those who questions him dying at the end, it's obvious he dies if you follow that symbolism. He died for them. This movie is such a literary genius that it almost upsets me to even hear it compared to the likes of The Shawshank Redemption, a movie I also like. It doesn't compare. It's unfortunate that so many people do not see the comparable difference of a great literary work to that of another great movie. While the Shawshank Redemption was entertaining, it doesn't have that deep literary content that fills Full Hand Luke. This is why you don't hear great quotes from it like you do Cool Hand Luke. Probably the greatest thing about Cool Hand Luke is we all can relate to wanting to be like that, but most people do not have the nerve to be that strong. That's what makes him different. All the religious symbolism only strengthens this movie into what I feel is the greatest movie ever produced.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Religious Allegory (Symbolism)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this film. There is apparently some debate whether there is Christian symbolism here. There is unquestionably so.The clarion example, of course, is the Crucifixion-like posturing of Luke following his eating the 50 eggs. The movie ends, interestingly, in a church. Prior to entering the church one sees 2 crosses (one on the steeple of the church; the other formed by a utility pole). Two crosses obviously leaves something missing. Where is the third cross from the Crucifixion of Christ? Well it is found in one of two possible places, one is following Luke's prayer in the church, he then folds his arms in a cross-like manner. The other possible cross citing is in the final scene of the movie as the camera pans out the crossroads forms an obvious cross?this is not coincidental.Is it coincidental that Luke escapes THREE times vis-?-vis the Trinity? Is it coincidental that Luke is assigned the prison numeral 37? From that, one is invited to explore what is the Bible's wording of Luke 3:7. It is of interest that Luke 3:7 contains "?flee from the wrath to come?" Then of course there is the request from Luke to God to "just show me a sign, love me, hate me, kill me, just let me know you're there" Of course in the following scene, Luke gets his sign?the notice of the death of his mom.This film is deeper than it can be perceived.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Featuring a wonderfully heart-warming story about a man who would never conform or give up, "Cool Hand Luke" is a very enjoyable film, although not as great as it's ranking here may suggest. The story, although a simple one, works on the base level but fails to completely overwhelm...me. I realize many enjoy this film and consider it a great one, but for me it was a little too simple for my tastes. Simplicity works when that's all that is needed, but unfortunately it wasn't enough here to be truly "great". But enough of that ruckus, I enjoyed this film quite a bit. It is really good. I'm just trying to talk it down a bit so you won't get your expectations up to an impossible level.Paul Newman plays his part marvelously, and although it's a simple role, he fills it more than adequately. Essentially, he is Luke and probably had no problems filling the role. Another good acting job comes from George Kennedy, who plays Dragline, the most prevalent supporting character and leader of the prisoners before Luke's arrival. He nailed the Cajun accent for the most part and that is no easy task for anyone outside of Louisiana. And although the prison setting and filler characters are for the most part, not realistic, I enjoyed watching Kennedy interact with Luke. Another enjoyable character is the lead guard, a man who always wears aviator sunglasses and never speaks.Basically Luke has never been one to follow the rules, and never will be. This attitude has the ability to inspire and enlighten. That's the jist of the story.My main qualm with the film is the fact that it's somewhat repetitive. It could've been shortened considerably if certain events happened only once. I won't say what these events are, but after the second time I was getting a little annoyed. Another qualm I have is the ending, while good, I feel it could have been better. That is simply my opinion.All in all a really good film but not a great one, and a little overrated, but don't let that stop you. This could end up being one of your all time favorites. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where prison was located that movie was based on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The local newspaper in Leesburg, Fl. had a story in it during 2003 that the prison that the movie was based on was located here (near Tavares, Fl.). The books author was an inmate at that prison in the late 1930s and early 1940s. There are still some of the old buildings from that prison work camp still standing on Hwy 19 just south of Tavares, Fl. From what I have been told from some older people in the area, the movie is pretty close to the actual environment at this prison camp. The local Sheriff in the area back in those days took no pity on any prisoners unless prisoners family had money to pay him on a monthly basis. This is one of the best "attention holding" movies I have ever seen. Worth watching many times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Cool Hand Luke' is my all time favourite movie, and one which has been a big part of my life ever since I first saw it on TV back in the 1970s as a kid. Since then I have watched it too many times to mention. First on TV reruns, then on video, and now I'm really pleased to own it on DVD as it has FINALLY been released here in the region I live in. Every time I watch it I enjoy it. It never gets stale for me. Paul Newman is just perfect as Luke. It's easily my favourite performance by him. Stuart Rosenberg isn't a name director (though he later made another pretty good prison drama 'Brubaker' starring Robert Redford, and also the underrated Mickey Rourke/Eric Roberts drama 'The Pope Of Greenwich Village'), but I don't care. He made this film, and it is PERFECT. I can't fault anything about it. The script is excellent and has an authentic air (writer Donn Pearce actually served on a chain gang), and the performances by the ensemble cast are flawless. Even George Kennedy is great! I also love Strother Martin ('The Wild Bunch') as the Captain, and Luke Askew ('Easy Rider') who plays Boss Paul. The inmates are full of familiar faces and character actors. I won't list them all but this is still one of the greatest ensemble casts ever assembled. Let me just mention three of my all time favourite actors Harry Dean Stanton, Dennis Hopper, and Joe Don Baker, and also a couple of actors who later became well know from their TV work: Wayne Rogers ('M.A.S.H.') and Ralph Waite ('The Waltons'). Then there's Dogboy (Anthony Zerbe) and Luke's mother Arletta (Jo Van Fleet)... I'd better stop before I type the names of the entire cast! This movie is just full of great acting, unforgettable sequences and quotable dialogue! I'm not saying 'Cool Hand Luke' is "the greatest movie ever made" but it's up there with any contender you care to name, and it could well be the most ENTERTAINING. I love this movie so much I find it hard to know what to say about it! I think I'll go and watch it again. And again and again and again...</fullReview>

This is a great movie for teenagers who may be asking some fundamental questions at that age - this film raises many such questions and let's each of us resolve things ourselves.Humor is everywhere - many kinds of humor. The value of humor and how it helps...Leading and following. Participating in these roles and how much of yourself you surrender in doing so. How do the leaders and followers learn and grow? What about those of us who choose to not participate, like the guards?Religion - sure Luke, a Biblical character, seems to represent Jesus at times. Is that OK? Did he have an ultimate success, like Jesus, despite his physical demise?I've bored you with thoughts on the movie, but I figure you've already seen it and you are pumped and want to talk about with someone. With that in mind, and I last saw the film 10 or more years ago, there are some GREAT scenes and moments. The hound dog sneezing from the red pepper - 'ahh WOOF'! The majestic asphalting scene where they all 'beat the man' - what inspiration, what power! George Kennedy's laughing and grinning when Luke takes the pot on a total bluff!I hope every young adult can see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you analyse this film there is not much to it. A simple story about conformity and rebellion. There are no great set pieces no amazing stunts and no special effects. It is just a supreme example of a star, and his presence on the screen, being entertaining. This is not to demean the other actors in the film who all give good performances and the writing and screenplay are also good, but I doubt if the film would have been anywhere near the cult classic it has become without Paul Newman in the lead role. He is the ultimate anti-hero. He does not seek the attention and the adulation but cannot help but receive it. His role is one of passive rebellion right until the end. He accepts his fate at the end and becomes an inspiration and a myth to the other prisoners who do not have the strength to emulate him. Even though he dies at the end this is a feel good movie. It leaves you uplifted, but not in the crude way today's films often do it is a very subtle film. Paul Newman is that rare thing a true film star who can truly act.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Newman definitely should have won the Oscar for one of his 1960's performances in either 'The Hustler', 'Hud' or the stylishly impressive 'Cool Hand Luke'. Newman's good friend Robert Redford was directed in another prison film in 1980 entitled 'Brubaker' by the same man who called the shots on 'Cool Hand Luke', Stuart Rosenberg. Rosenberg's style is a heavy handed reflective symbol of the attitude of the 1960's when individuality began to stand out more and more among society's people and the rebellious attitudes demonstrated by the populous are illustrated by Newman's performance.George Kennedy's Oscar winning performance in the supporting role was a perfect blend with the rest of the players in the film. A victim of the so-called Oscar curse, Kennedy didn't really do much after this film and that's a shame.One of the most important things that may be derived from this film is that its message is so simple that it may be overlooked, and that is that the punishment doesn't always fit the crime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rabble-rouser from the 1960s isn't as fresh (or as hard-hitting) today as it must have been in its time. Hell-raising ne'er-do-well with nothing to lose winds up on a prison chain-gang, setting a new pace for the guards and other inmates. Fairly straightforward crowd-pleaser, though with odd flickers of melodrama, heightened by Stuart Rosenberg's overeager direction and Lalo Schifrin's mercurial score. In its latter stages, the overlong film appears to aspire to loftier meanings, but for the most part it's Chain-Gang 101--though well-played by Paul Newman, Oscar winner George Kennedy, and a solid, sometimes funny and colorful supporting cast. The central character's sunny rebellion turns serious by the midway point, and director Rosenberg overdoses on inmate clich乶, but one is so apt to be drawn to Newman's characterization that the sour residue the movie leaves behind is not likely to catch up to viewers until later. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over-aged rebel without a cause</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Cool Hand Luke" is one of those iconic movies; by that I mean its hero has become iconic. When I first saw the film way back in 1967 we were quick to recognize its iconic status and it has become something of a cult in the intervening years. It's certainly entertaining and well-made and well acted but I feel as if something is missing. There may be a clue in the title, 'Cool Hand Luke', and it isn't just the character who is cool, it's the film. Of course, 'cool' used to describe Luke means he is 'hip', cool in the way hip people were cool back then, but the film is cool in that it never generates the necessary heat, the necessary excitement, to hold us.Luke is arrested and put on a chain-gang for what seems to me to be a misdemeanor. He's a rebel in the way Jim Stark was a rebel but he's an already over-aged one. You really think he ought to know better. And being a rebel he won't let the prison hold him so he escapes and is re-caught, so he escapes again and is re-caught and so on. 'What we have here is failure to communicate', the Warden tells him, the prisoners and us, (Strother Martin in a wonderful performance). And he's right. Luke fails to communicate with the other prisoners, (althought they elevate him to sainthood), and with us.Paul Newman's performance has an easy-going charm but at times he is insufferably smug. (The film makes a virtue out of rebellion but it doesn't gives us a rebel we can identify with). Still a great many people did and still do and to some people this is the definitive Newman performance. Nevertheless, I think its best scenes are somehow divorced from Newman's role in them and the buzz we get is the old-fashioned buzz we get whenever we see the underdog turning the tables on their oppressor. It's terrifically well photographed by the great Conrad L Hall and the supporting cast are top-notch. But finally there is less to it than meets the eye.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceptional prison film with wonderful Newman at the helm, aided by a stellar cast.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The "men in prison" genre is one that has been done to death from "The Big House" on up to the premium cable series "Oz", but this entry has to rank as one of the all-time best. Newman plays the title character, a rather aimless ne'r do well who gets drunk one night and decapitates several parking meters. This lands him in a labor camp for two years (!) where he alternately aggravates and inspires the other inmates and the guards. His chief aggressor upon arrival is hulking, dim, loud-mouthed Kennedy who challenges him in several ways. However, in true movie fashion, they eventually become best buddies. The prison is populated by a huge array of other types such as sensitive Waite, meticulous Cannon, mentally-challenged Hopper and over-eager Antonio, to name a few. After a while, the authorities begin to resent the influence Newman has on the other inmates. When he attempts escape, he is given "the treatment" and is ground down to total subservience. Or is he? Newman gives a performance here that is nothing short of brilliant. His charm and charisma are on full throttle, but so are his sensitivity and insightfulness. He looks great and turns in a heavy-duty portrayal. Kennedy, who won an Oscar for this, is also very strong. His not-too-gentle giant is somewhat infectious and engaging. It's a fully realized characterization. Note how, even though it is never directly mentioned, he can't read. A better array of supporting actors from this time would be hard to find. The inmates are all good, but the guards and officials are even better. Martin is unforgettable in his fairly small role as the warden and spits out the iconic catch phrase, "What we have here is a failure to communicate!" Woodward is super-imposing as the rifle-toting (and wordless) chain gang boss. Best of all is a brief cameo by Van Fleet as Newman's chain-smoking, beaten-down mother. Bette Davis was foolish to turn the role down, but the film is better for the incredible authenticity and lack of obvious acting that Van Fleet brings to the part. It's interesting to note that Davalos, who beat out Newman for his role in "East of Eden" is now relegated to that of a virtual extra, barely getting an opportunity to say or do anything of note. The film boasts many memorable vignettes including the famous, nausea-inducing, egg-eating contest, a scene involving the pavement of a road and the classic one in which a scantily-clad, buxom lady teases the inmates by washing her car as they look on. It's interesting to watch this viewpoint of a southern prison/chain gang with the inmates mostly getting along very well, affectionately interacting, betting, dancing and so forth (Drivas' little go-go moves on the front porch are, perhaps, a bit much, though.) Of course, it's practically science fiction now as there is not one minority in sight within the prison camp and someone convicted of Newman's crime would be (un)lucky to serve any time at all nowadays! Fans of beefcake are in for a treat with the tan men spending huge amounts of time shirtless and in their underwear. Newman even does what is the closest he ever came to a nude scene - a dimly-lit glimpse of his bottom as he's changing into a nightshirt outside. ("Pa Walton" Waite goes even further, stripping down in broad daylight and showing a remarkably fit rear end for his age.) There's also a terrifically evocative and pleasing score by Lalo Schifrin. If this nicely-directed film has a flaw, it is probably that it's just the tiniest bit too long. However, the pleasures it yields make that seem like carping.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a chain-gang for God's sake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Spoiler warning**--If you haven't seen it, be aware that I do divulge some details of the movie in order to explain what I like about it. I won't reveal the ending, but to get into what interests me about the movie I have to get into the plot and symbolism...This movie works on many levels. On the surface it's about the harsh world inside a chain gang, made easier when Luke becomes a part of it. The other members of the chain gang live vicariously through Luke, who, in his easy-going nature, represents an alternative focus for the chain gang. Luke wins his fights and poker hands with, as Dragline says, "a whole lot of nothing." That smiling, unassuming, unrelenting demeanor makes Luke a free-spirited hero to the prisoners. Cool-Hand Luke plays against the wrathful hand of the warden, who sees Luke as a threat to his authority.Most people who talk about this movie stop here at these obvious themes of individualism and non-conformism, but there is heavy biblical symbolism all throughout the movie. Luke represents Christ for the other chain gang members. His loving easy-natured resistance to the anti-hero warden gives the chain-gangers a saviour to live through. There is a lot of "soul" symbolism. Note the number of eggs equates to the number of members of the chain gang. Remember that Luke tells the other prisoners to "stop feedin' off me," and in a subsequent scene the prisoners help him avoid punishment by actually eating off his plate. There are numerous scenes with cross symbolism, my favorite being the position Luke is laying in after eating the eggs.I have read the book the movie was based on looking for the Christ symbolism, but it's not in the book. The book was based on the writer's actual experiences and observations in a Florida chain gang. The movie goes way beyond that and vastly improves on the book. The direction was inspired (both ways). If you watch this movie enough times you will begin to appreciate how little is wasted in it. I personally find it easier to understand Christ's impact watching this movie than reading the bible.As for the performances in this movie, George Kennedy definitely deserved that Oscar, and Paul Newman was wonderful as the reluctant hero.</fullReview>

But it was made, keep in mind, in an era when assembly line symbolism was all the rage, and mainstream American movies were often hard pressed to express some kind of 'heavy' relevance. The film is actually a good deal less pretentious than it sounds, with attractive photography, several notable performances, and a lively sense of humor helping to offset the lazy pacing and obvious emphasis on subtext. But it deserves to be seen in a theater, on a big screen, because any movie filmed in wide-screen Panavision is bound to have its impact crippled when viewed on television.</fullReview>

Are you kidding me!Let me school you a little...to play a role a subtle as Newman did is acting at its highest level. He couldn't hide behind words but only use the squint of an eye or slight smile to communicate an entire scene. To not understand this reveals how many Vin Diesel and Keanu Reeves movies you've purchased!This movie is a classic in every area. There is NO sense of commerciality here and selling out of anykind.

		<shortDescription>When Nothing Is A Real Cool Hand</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Newman may have one of the silver screen's richest careers, but it's hard picking a single film of his that shows off his star power in better light than "Cool Hand Luke." Co-star George Kennedy got the Oscar and Strother Martin delivered its most famous line, but this is a Newman film through and through, maybe his best one, and along with "Lawrence Of Arabia" maybe the most perfect movie of the 1960s.Newman plays Lucas Jackson, a decorated war veteran who has a hard time adjusting once back at home. After he is arrested for cutting the heads off a row of parking meters, perhaps inspired by Bob Dylan, he is sent to a prison work camp for two years to "get your mind right," as the prison's Captain (Strother Martin) puts it. Only Luke has different ideas, after living his life the way the Man wanted only to be rewarded with violence, guilt and heartbreak.Luke has come through this crucible with breezy bravado and an indomitable spirit that gives the film much of its power. When he faces another inmate named Dragline (George Kennedy) in a boxing match, Luke quickly gets the tar beaten out of him so bad the other inmates lose their appetite for carnage and tell Luke to just stay down so Dragline will win. Luke won't quit, though: "You're gonna have to kill me," he grunts."Let him draw some blood, maybe the guards will break it up," says one of the smarter inmates, a check-kiter named Society Red (J.D. Cannon)."I wouldn't want to frighten him," Luke grunts back.The film actually works as something of a comedy for the first half, with Newman's lovable-loser persona on a par with his role in "Slapshot" years later. We sense a deeper pain, but Newman brilliantly keeps us at bay with his killer grin. Then as the film develops, Luke's uniquely unbending character and his popularity among the other inmates ("You're a genuine original," Dragline notes) make him a target of the camp bosses, especially after Luke addresses the chief screw, Boss Godfrey a.k.a. "No Eyes," with less than the requisite amount of humility after No Eyes shoots a snake Luke is holding. Luke winds up locked in a box, a ridiculously excessive punishment made worse still when the Captain announces it's being done because Luke's mother just died and they want to keep him from getting ideas about "paying his respects." The only worse thing one can do than incarcerate a man wrongly is proclaim it is being done for his own good. After that, Luke really has no choice but to rebel, a role he seems reluctant to take, alternately blaming God and the other inmates for "feeding off me".Like another institutional inmate flick, "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest," there is an interesting Christian subtext that runs through "Cool Hand Luke." Luke becomes a figure of compassion and inspiration for the camp's other inmates, performing miraculous feats and challenging their spirits to believe in their own greater power. Actually, the message seems less orthodox than one you would get in church, rather more in line with the philosophy of Christian existentialism, where one is left to do what he feels best in a hostile environment and God comes in the form of a quiet voice inside rather than thunder from on high.You could make "Cool Hand Luke" today and it would be just as impressive, but something about the time the film was made adds to its relevance. Questioning authority became quite the thing to do by this time, but few films raised those questions as entertainingly and intelligently as Luke.And what a rich ensemble! Kennedy, Cannon, Joe Don Baker, Dennis Hopper, Anthony Zerbe, Ralph Waite, Wayne Rogers and the other actors playing the inmates mesh superbly, as do the authority figures played by Martin, Luke Askew, and Clifton James as Carr the floorwalker, who sets down the rules of the camp in a terrific speech. Harry Dean Stanton shows off a fine singing voice, while two other actors give powerful performances without delivering a line; Morgan Woodward as No-Eyes and Joy Harmon as a girl who washes a car in one of the most memorable torture sequences ever put on screen.Make no mistake, this is Newman's film all the way. He laughs, he screams, he prays, he fights, he even sings and plays the banjo and shows some skin. And he earns our devotion every bit as much as Luke does his prison comrades, giving us a figure of inspiration to hold onto long after he's gone.</fullReview>

The egg eating scene was so well created that it ranks as one of the most memorable scenes. The scene were Joy Harmon is washing her car has to be one of the most erotic, yet somewhat minimalistic (in terms of showing body parts) scenes in film history. And who can forget the famous line, "What we got here is a failure to communicate."

		<fullReview>Paul Newman can sleepwalk his way through a movie. Don't bother seeing "Torn Curtain," for instance. But give him the right part, engage his interest, catch him in the right mood, and he delivers a performance as good as anyone could provide. As good as Brando, Olivier, as good as anybody. In my estimation he has given at least four performances that reach asymptote: "The Hustler," "Hud," "Cool Hand Luke," and "The Verdict." Others may have been almost as good, "Hombre", maybe, or "Harper", but they restricted his acting to a stereotype or else the story wasn't worth much effort. Early in his career, he was socked solidly into a super-macho sort of position, his nasal, abrasive, Southern-tinted remarks dripping with synthetic testosterone. But beginning with "The Hustler," he found his true m俸ier. "Luke" was one of his finest. The plot is utterly believable. The locale -- near Bakersfield -- evocative. You can feel the shimmering heat. The entire cast is superb, and what a cast! Strother Martin is always good but here he outdoes himself. Harry Dean Stanton, Joe Don Baker, Anthony Zerbe, a veritable pantheon of fine character actors. There have been many movies about charismatic outlaw heroes. The kind of guy who says, as Robert E. Lee Pruitt did in "From Here to Eternity," "If a man don't go his own way, he's nothing'." Or the kind of guy who, wittingly or not, is enacting a nascent social movement, like Ghandi. The best of these stories don't build themselves a moral explanation around the essentially unknowable. Who knows why Ghandi or Cool Hand Luke did what they did? Who knows why any of us does what we do? We can justify our acts, but only through post-hoc reasoning. In sociology this is called "accounting." I account for my acts by buffing logic in such a way that I come out on top . Sometimes underlying themes are necessary to hold an otherwise uneventful story together, as in Joyce's Ulysses. No such subtext belongs in "Cool Hand Luke," because the events we witness can stand on their own two legs, but the subtext is there nonetheless. Not only is it there, but it's blatantly there. Luke addresses God as "old man," from time to time, and has an extended conversation with him towards the end in an abandoned church. After eating his fifty eggs he is left sprawled on a table in an attitude of crucifixion. The very crossroads shown in a helicopter shot just before the closing credits is cruciform. The Christian symbolism is irrelevant and distracting in an otherwise memorable movie. Luke's conflict is not with God. For that to be true, there would have to BE a God. His conflict is more profane. He's at war with rules and regulations, which of course means society. Strother Martin's captain is right when he says about Luke's punishment, "This is what he wants." And, by the way, this movie shows the corrections officers as at least semi-human, some of them, but also absolutely irresistible. You cannot win with these guys. They can't be outwitted. And they are unsubtle. They will beat the crap out of you until you yield, and we all eventually yield. Don Pierce's story was autobiographical. What a guy he must have been. In one of his articles he is sent to North Africa to interview Timothy Leary, then in exile. Refused an interview he climbs on top of the roof of Leary's hotel, half drunk, and leans over the edge trying to peek through a window, during which exertion and in this awkward posture, he releases a blast of intestinal gas. Would you reveal something like that about yourself? George Kennedy won the Oscar for supporting actor and deserved it. The only other time he displayed any energy in a part was in "The Dirty Dozen," which didn't place nearly such demands on him as this role. You're not likely to forget this informative, wildly comical, and ultimately tragic movie once you've seen it.</fullReview>

Some people have written of this film as a Christ allegory, but I just didn't see it, aside from some of the sardonic gospel music in places. In any case, everyone should see this film. Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that has more than aged well... it has gotten better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film a treasure trove.Starting from a script (Donn Pearce and Frank R. Pierson) that not only captures life in a Southern prison camp, but also the characters in it, this film tells a rich rollercoaster of a story. Even the smallest characterizations like Society Max and Bobaloogats (young Dennis Hopper) are human and wonderful. And that's not even mentioning the superb work of Paul Newman and George Kennedy, who won a Best-Supporting Oscar as Dragline. Unforgettable lines delivered... unforgettably.The acting only scratches the surface of what is lovable about this movie. While the story is entertaining it is also richly nuanced, sometimes suggesting the story of Christ, sometimes acting as a primer for Existentialism. I myself lean toward a more Existential interpretation -- but the greatness of the movie is that this does not distract a first-time viewer from a compelling story. It adds depth, not pretension.Director Stuart Rosenberg keeps the action moving. The pace and overall construction of this movie could be a textbook for aspiring filmmakers. His work with legendary cinematographer Conrad Hall on this movie is gorgeous. Watch this one on DVD in widescreen if you can.The great visuals are backed up by the music, especially the simple but versatile Lalo Schifrin theme, which is alternately melancholy, menacing, and ecstatic.This movie never gets old to me, and I've seen it many times. The filmmakers have created a rich world, full of human characters and a dense symbology. Look for motifs of stoplights and stopsigns, crossroads and bridges. This is one film that is top-level in nearly every department, especially the one that really matters: it is a story that just gets better and better as it gets older. And I'm not "just standing in the rain, talking to myself."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heavy themes, but lifted to joy by Paul Newman, and a playful script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cool Hand Luke (1967)A movie famous as an anti-establishment send-up and for the charming, smiling Paul Newman. Worth seeing for either reason. It does have comic moments to talk about--egg eating among them--and it has an especially low point for the treatment of women, even though it is justified internally by the characters. Most of the time it's a well paced, well acted chain gang movie, with one getaway (that's no spoiler--all prison movies have getaways) that is an homage or ripoff of the 1932 LeRoy chain gang movie to beat all chain gang movies.Because the movie is clearly set in the past, it doesn't indict the prison system directly, but does critique the problem of authority, and of what exactly is a punishment suitable for petty crime. I don't know if the title character (played by Newman) is an anti-hero exactly (he lacks any true badness) but there is no doubt by halfway through who the true good guy is. And by the end, the Christian symbolism is overwhelming. If Cool Hand Luke the man isn't quite what you think of as messianic, he still does at least show what it means to be good in very ungood circumstances. It's a complicated thing to be a hero, and to survive those who are threatened by those better than them, and in the end, that's what the movie is about. Compelling if never amazing, and most of all enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prison As The Establishment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never really thought much of Paul Newman's acting until he played Cool Hand Luke. When I was growing up in the 1950's, I viewed Newman as sort of a poor man's Marlon Brando. Even his glorious role in "Cat On a Hot Tin Roof," I viewed as mainly an attempt to emulate Brando's magnificent performance in "A Streetcar Named Desire." I was impressed by his role in "Hud," but thought that was due more to the excellent script and direction than to his performance. But with "Cool Hand Luke" I came to realize what a truly gifted actor Paul Newman is. Like any great actor, Newman actually becomes his character, a nonconformist of a prison community who would rather die than surrender his individuality. He captures the essence of the protagonist who is rebelling against the system or as it was termed in the 1960's, the establishment. Without Newman this film would have gone nowhere, not even with the brilliant performances of the rest of the cast, especially those of Strother Martin, George Kennedy, J.D. Cannon, and Jo Van Fleet.Though Strother Martin is most remembered for what became a catchphrase in the counterculture movement, "What we have here is a failure to communicate," I like the line he throws at Luke when they first encounter each other, "Cuttin' heads off parking meters! Just where'd you think that was going to get you?" because that line epitomizes the diametrically opposed personalities of a Hitler-type authoritarian monster who appears harmless to the naked eye and that of a rebel who is determined to crush tyranny in any form that threatens the freedom of mankind. This tension and antagonism is also central to another movie classic, "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," based on a novel written during the same time period, where we discover it between McMurphy and Nurse Ratched. This is indeed high drama and it takes the likes of Paul Newman and Jack Nicholson to pull it off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly a `man's man' movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers`Cool Hand Luke' is a film I have wanted to see for over a decade, and I was not disappointed when, this weekend, I finally did. `Cool Hand Luke', the story of a fairly ordinary man named Luke (Paul Newman) who does one stupid (and pretty harmless) thing that ends up being his eventual downfall, is definitely a film that is a lot deeper than it may initially seem to be. Luke's evolution is like peeling away the layers of an onion; one mistake begets another, then another and so on. `Cool Hand Luke' also challenges the viewer to possibly question their own moral fiber; `Is what he did that bad?' `Does he deserve what he is getting?' `Cool Hand Luke' sports some pretty interesting shots (I never thought I would see an extreme close-up of Harry Dean Stanton's singing mouth, nor do I ever think I want to again), pretty great acting, (George Kennedy won an Oscar for convincingly playing a real cracker) and a veritable `who's who' of virtually as-yet-undiscovered young male actors. I managed to spot Joe Don Baker, Dennis Hopper, the aforementioned Harry Dean Stanton, and a couple of other actors that I was convinced I'd seen in subsequent films or television. Probably the most obvious theme that I noticed in `Cool Hand Luke' is that it is definitely a `man's film'. There are exactly two women in the film and they are each featured for less than five minutes each ? one being Luke's dying mother who comes to visit him in prison, and the other is the oft-imitated (and completely objectified) woman washing her car and taunting the road gang. `Cool Hand Luke' is a film that on the onset is a fairly straightforward film, but upon reflection, even during the course of the film itself, is quite layered and thought provoking. In addition to being hailed as a film classic, there are several films that have obviously used it as an inspiration, the most obvious being `The Shawshank Redemption' and `Oh Brother Where Art Thou'. Nothing is black and white in this film, which I think is one of the factors that make `Cool Hand Luke' a classic.--Shelly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He fought the law...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Highly rated film that I don't rate that highly, if truth be told. There's plenty to savour, particularly in the acting stakes but I was ultimately confused and disappointed by the resolution to the various themes at play here.The enigmatic opening, with Newman's Luke character casually vandalising the state's parking meters amusingly recalled to me the famous tag-line from Bob Dylan's near contemporaneous song "Subterraneaen Homesick Blues" - "Don't follow leaders and watch the parking meters", (both parts of the line are relevant - at one point he screams "Stop feeding off me" to his "follower" inmates) as Luke gets incarcerated in a brutally-run Southern prison work-house and becomes the unlikely and from his point of view, at times unwelcome talismanic figure representing to his fellow inmates a focal point of resistance to authority and in a wider sense, general conformity.And yet this self-effacing persona which Luke adopts more than once however doesn't square, with me, to the self-publicising acts he does elsewhere, most famously the fight scene with the prison's "Big Daddy" inmate, Dragline, played by Arthur Kennedy and of course the egg-scoffing scene, where he deliberately draws attention to himself. I also didn't get Kennedy's character's change (adapting Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men") from George to Lennie, when after punching Luke to a pulp and establishing one would think once and for all superiority over him, we see him by the end almost acting as his lackey. Add to that an admittedly revisionist minor revulsion at the blatantly sexist soft-porn episode of the tongues-out chain gang ogling a scantily-clad nymphet foaming up a car and you can tell I had some issues with the movie, although a minor counter-case against the latter could be made for the insertion of the very mild homo-erotic and played for laughs sub "Jailhouse Rock" scene of the prisoners dancing with each other, dressed only in their shorts, on the 4th of July.The ambiguities in the narrative however threw me off-kilter and while I can see that I was expected to cut Newman's character a lot of slack as a societal misfit whose "different-ness" is accentuated further after his beloved mother dies, ultimately, again to paraphrase Dylan, nothing has been proved. As to style, director Rosenberg certainly captures the heat and sweat of the workhouse but even then a lot of his imagery seems second-hand, lifting from the likes of Leone and Sturges. Lalo Schifrin delivers a satisfactory if occasionally blaring soundtrack.The acting is great though, yet I'm sure I can see Steve McQueen playing the Newman role better. Arthur Kennedy is robust enough until he's reduced to a simpering wimp by the conclusion. Strother Martin, with that enervating southern drawl gets most of the best lines (especially the well-known "What we have here is a failure to communicate") and his underlings similarly exude cruelty and inhumanity, especially when breaking Luke over the pointless digging of a ditch. Amongst the inmates, by the way, it's interesting to note emerging actors of the television screen like Wayne Rogers ("M.A.S.H."), Ralph Waite ("The Waltons", "Mississipi") and Anthony Zerbe (everything else...) plus the young (Harry) Dean Stanton and Dennis Hopper.Grandstanding scenes notwithstanding, by the conclusion, the film hadn't held me as it should have done and further weakened its case as an expose of the working methods of jail-masters of the recent past with a sentimental collage of Newman's smiling image set before us with all the integrity of an episode of the afore-mentioned "The Waltons".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool Hand Luke great movie to watch during Oscar month</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Newman (Old Blue Eyes) stars as Cool Hand Luke Jackson, a war hero, who gets himself in trouble with the law, and is repeatedly beaten both mentally and physically savagely by the main boss of the prison he is in.The main boss hates Luke for several reasons: Everyone likes Luke. He is the typical rebel , yet he has a certain aura around that people love. Even the people working in the prison like Luke.The boss also hates Luke, because he keeps escaping out of prison, which makes the prison's security and himself look bad.The movie from beginning to end, is one of the entertaining and powerful movies by Newman.Throughout the movie, we see Luke's exploits including his status as "Cool Hand" which basically says that he can do anything.There is no better scene that shows this that Luke's bet that can he eat 50 eggs in one hour. This scene is terrific and humorous to watch, time and time again. George Kennedy plays Greg Dragline, Luke's best friend and prison inmante.Dragline's love of Luke is evident through the whole movie. Whenever, Luke is mistreated Dragline is there to try to pick up his spirits. Whenever, Luke is beaten severely for trying to escape the prison, Dragline is one of the first friends that is there to pick him up and attend to him.Then of course, this Oscar worthy film has the memorable tunes and lines that all audiences all familiar with:"What We Got Here is a familiar to Communicate" is Paul Newman, legendary and household line that critics and audiences remember. This line has also been used in over a hundred, movies and tv shows including comedies, crime drama movies and much more. The line is a piece of cult phenomena and America which symobolizes a bad situation.Paul Newman was nominated for Best Actor for this film, but didn't win.Newman over his career has been nominated over 10 times for this award: "Cat On A Hot Tin Roof" , "Malice", "Nobody's Fool", are several of the great movies that NewMan has been nominated for."Cool Hand Luke" stands as one of the American movies ever made. It represents the abusive and mistreatment that a couple of prisons have.It also represents an intelligent and popular fellow who all through his life had one bad situation after another, yet like Greg points "Ah Luke, always had that great smile."Luke's character in a way is a reflection on individuals like himself, whose life have been filled with pain and aggravation yet people like these never give up.An Oscar worthy film, during this month of oscars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool Hand Luke - Period Piece with A Message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie Cool Hand Luke captures the spirit of the period in which it came to the big screen. Luke the main character is a larger then life person in one respect and yet, he is a loser. He is at the same time fiercely independent and yet he still is boastful and looks for ways to build himself up. Research will show the interested that the daily life of the prisoners were true to life. Luke's message to others is to live life to the fullest and do not meekly take dirt from anyone. You can't help but like Luke. Almost anyone can look into Luke and find bits and pieces of him (her) self. I think Luke is not a child of the 60's, 70's or 80's but rather is a character that is ageless. Luke took risks and accepted the consequences. I like Luke, but feel sorry for him too. In the end his greatest victory was a defeat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I had written an enormous blurb about how great the ending of this film was and how the ending is a film's most important part, but I think we all understand that well enough. I am going to talk about something else:George Kennedy's Oscar winning role. Wow, is he awesome! I, like I assume many people of my generation are, am only familiar with Kennedy through his role as the police Captain Ed from the Naked Gun series, in which he was hilarious, and his stint selling breath mints on infomercials. I never expected that he ever won an Oscar! And it was entirely deserved. He created a very complex character in this film. Bravo!I loved Paul Newman, too, of course. I just looked at who else was nominated that year, and I have not seen either the winner of that year's best actor Oscar (Rod Steiger in In the Heat of the Night) or one other nominee (Spencer Tracy in Guess Who's Coming to Dinner), but of those I have seen (Warren Beatty, Bonnie and Clyde and Dustin Hoffman, The Graduate) I would personally have picked Warren Beatty, seeing as Bonnie and Clyde is one of my very favorite films, and I love Beatty in it. Anyway, Cool Hand Luke was a masterpiece itself, and I do give it a 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pointless Movie About an Anti-Hero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie tries hard to convince you that right is wrong, black is white, up is down, and most importantly, that the antagonist is the protagonist.The main character is Luke, a jobless deadbeat who is arrested for sawing off parking meters while drunk. He is sentenced to two years in a chain gang. Despite the fact that he is apathetic, rebellious, irreligious, selfish, and totally deserved to go to jail, we the audience are asked to root for this person.The law-officers are portrayed as evil, and somehow rules are "bad" and those who defy authority are heroes.The plot is long, drawn-out, and boring. We simply watch two hours of this man Luke smart off and try to escape the chain gang, until he finally dies at the end during his final escape. Then he is called a "world-shaker." What? This man contributed nothing to his fellow human beings except to be a deadbeat rebel, and yet he's some kind of hero? The most Luke ever does in his life is eat 50 eggs. How inspirational! Don't waste your time with this movie that tries to warp the rules of morality, logic, and good-movie-making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a classic anti-hero and a near-great Hollywood prison movie of the 1960s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read another comment on here that said that this and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest are two films which are pretty much identical. While I was watching Cool Hand Luke I did recollect the other classic (to me still much more extraordinary) guys-locked-up movie Cuckoo's Nest, as it did have its hero knocking an authority as tough as a ton on bricks. But there's a big difference between the two films- in Cuckoo's Nest, you had in Nicholson a rebel-rouser who didn't mind getting some real words across to people with his plight, and the people he was locked up with are actually, to a basic degree, sane. Newman is, much as the title suggests, 'cool', as he really doesn't have that much dialog for most of the picture, and the system he's bucking isn't supposed to be "helping" him and the people he's with. They're there on the chain gang to bust ass and do the work that nobody in their right mind would do unless pointed by a gun to do so. Though on the other hand, this dynamic from Newman, amid a very good prison movie, still makes Cool Hand Luke quite memorable for its ways of bucking the system.It's also by turns an often funny movie, with the centerpiece of the 50 egg bet being one that is just sheerly, unabashedly entertaining. And it's the kind of scene that does almost remind someone of that scene in Cuckoo's Nest where they all get riled up during the 'baseball game' on TV. But sometimes the filmmakers doing Cool Hand Luke do perhaps push a wee bit much allegory on such a simple set of events, less a story, than necessary. At the end of the 50 egg sequence, Newman is basically laid out on the table- and I'm sure it's meant to be intentional- in the form of Christ. This is played up for a lot of the rest of the film, as it's perhaps really intuited that he's suffering for the other prisoner's sins, and may even perhaps someday die for it all. This side ends up becoming a little preachy, even if its meant to be subtle, which I don't think it is, and it detracts from the greater pleasures of watching a picture like this.Because really, aside from the allegory, this is just good old prison picture, and one that pushes the boundaries of the prisoner-escape angle, such as that Newman's Luke escapes for the whole second half of the movie! It's also kind of bittersweet that the filmmakers decide not to show how Newman gets captured, but leaves it at first on the prisoners- who after getting beaten up by Oscar winning George Kennedy's rily character, and getting them to fix a road like its some competition- and then just suddenly he's caught again. At one point this even leads to the now classic line, once sampled in a Guns n Roses song, "what we've got here is failure to communicate" by the always great character actor Strother Martin. Though if you're not really looking for message or allegory, it's also just a really neat 'guy' movie, in the best sense of the word, with scenes like the torturous girl-washes-car-in-front-of-chain-gang scene, and of course ones that just show them acting like real guys. It's populated by a plethora of acting talent, with Kennedy, Dennis Hopper, Luke Askew, and even a guitar strumming/singing Harry Dean Stanton! (Which is a hoot if you've seen as mant Stanton films as me).And then finally there's Newman himself, definitely in one of his seminal roles even if it's not a full-on total masterwork. Here he actually does create a character out of someone who is really sort of a nobody with no real aims. He doesn't even know what do to when he breaks out of prison, even as he gets as far as Chicago. "I never planned anything in my life", he says at one point. That the character only has maybe 15 lines in the film isn't a problem for Newman either. He makes such a thin character, ultimately, likable and strong, and fulfills such an anti-hero very believably, especially when he's most needed to put up his acting chops towards the end of the picture. Even if you're not too much into prison movies- and this one does have in it the kind of spirit that speaks back to the films of the 30s (in a good way for the old-school fans)- it's worth it just to see what Newman does, alongside the other actors. It also holds up pretty well decades later, which is a credit not just to Newman but to the screenwriters and director Stuart Rosenberg, probably the highlight of an otherwise journeyman filmmaker career.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cool Hand Luke is a nice and entertaining motion picture with a new taste of prison life depiction. It would be better to look at the good and bad sides hand in hand.The movie shows the life of a decorated war veteran in prison where he finds and dislikes the lots of rules, regulation, bosses and captain. He meet other prisoners and soon win over them. He always wishes to escape but one brutal act by the authorities during his mothers death makes him to escape. The third and final escape turns out to be fatal for him.It starts with rather unclear reason of Luke getting in prison. Now when its Paul Newman as Luke, certainly his acting was enjoyable with feel good events. Even then the script didn't seem going together and fit with his acting, yet both script and acting were good. The plot is new, entertaining and enjoyable with few beautiful depiction of human behaviour in fine manner and tough circumstances. Dialogues, were just good and fun to hear. The escape sequences were special attractions. Supporting actors were weak and not to the match with Newman yet don't know why Oscar awards saw it differently. The film is certainly not the greatest or good movie, here no doubt it got no Oscar nomination except for acting performances, but nevertheless Cool Hand Luke can be liked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stuart Rosenberg's Cool Hand Luke is one of the most inspirational movies ever made and has one of the most memorable lines in cinema history "What we've got here is a failure to communicate". The movie stars Paul Newman as Luke a man who refuses to conform to prison life, this movie goes on a par with some of the best prison movies ever made such as Birdman of Alcatraz, The Green Mile, and The Shawshank Redemption. This movie is not only great it also has a huge emotional impact because when Newman's mother dies the guards wouldn't even let him go to the funeral, including the scene where he talked to his mother for the very last time. This would probably be the most emotional prison movie I have seen in my entire life. No one would have played the character of Luke Jackson better than Paul Newman in one of his career defining performances. There was a lot of other good performances especially from George Kennedy in a great supporting performance, including a young Dennis Hopper in an excellent portrayal. Not only this movie is touching and equal parts great but it is funny at times as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cool Hand Luke. I was surprised by how this film aged well. It has a really modern narrative, cinematography, and is always a pleasure to see a 'classic' like that so well conserved. Of course, not that i loved it. There are some things that I don't liked about it, the studio kind of lightning for example, is way too obvious in supposedly external sets, what makes the things a bit weird. The ending is not fully satisfactory either, in my opinion.The most interesting thing about this film is how it depicts the situations. There is an irony in every event in entire film. The reason of why Luke was arrested, as main example. A critique to the judiciary system. There is also some interesting philosophical questions risen. A man can really change his 'personality'? A theme that was explored better in the excellent A Clockwork Orange(Stanley Kubrick, 1971) but both films are worth anyway. You can't go wrong.Recommended. 8.3/10</fullReview>

There is the iconic line "What we got here is .. failure to communicate." It's a great anti-establishment hero just in time for its volatile era. The only minor problem is the flow of the movie.

		<shortDescription>Newman at his coolest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not really sure where the origin of the word "cool" can be traced back to, but as far as I'm concerned it starts with Paul Newman.Nobody is cooler than Paul Newman in Cool Hand Luke. Paul Newman gives a wonderful, yet subdued performance as a prisoner doing time for cutting the head off parking meters. At first, Luke is even too cool for prison. Nothing seems to bother him. He quickly becomes a favorite of his fellow prisoners and some of the guards by taking a beating in a boxing match. He never stays down and keeps getting up. This shows the kind of heart Luke has that comes in to play later in the film. Unfortunately for Luke, he soon discovers that he is not meant for prison. The film touches upon what it's like to lose ones freedom and what a person will go to to get it back. Newman is not the only reason to see Cool Hand Luke. George Kennedy won an Oscar for his portrayal of Dragline, a loud, somewhat dim good ole' boy who becomes Luke's closest friend. The cinematography is also spectacular. The images literally jump off the screen. And when Newman cracks that smile of his and flashes those blue eyes, it's easy to see why he is one cool dude.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Version I watched: UK Bluray releaseActors: 7/10Plot/script: 6/10Photography/visual style: 6/10Music/score: 6/10Overall: 6/10Paul Newman is a screen icon, and this is one of his early roles, before he grew his trademark moustache. It's a pretty seminal film, being referenced and drawn from by generations afterward.The problem is that those generations have actually pretty much surpassed it. Newman is certainly the epitome of cool as the main character Luke, and George Kennedy deservedly won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role as the supplanted prison top dog who ended up Luke's best friend, true. However, when you combine the fact that The Shawshank Redemption took the framework of this plot and made it better in almost every way, and the fact that O Brother Where Art Thou borrowed the setting and many of the characters for what amounts to a farce and arguably an outright parody, the two leave not much left to recommend Cool Hand Luke. It's not that the film is bad, it isn't. It's just been done so much better elsewhere that there's not much point to it any more.For my full review, see my independent film blog on Blogspot, Cinema Inferno: http://cinemainferno-blog.blogspot.co.uk</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After a drunken night vandalising parking meters, aimless individual/war hero Luke Jackson(PAUL NEWMAN)is sentenced to 2 years hard labour in a chain gang prison. Luke soon makes an enemy of Dragline(GEORGE KENNEDY),ringleader of the other prisoners, but after Luke beats another prisoner in a card game by bluffing with a hand worth nothing, the other prisoners begin to warm to and respect him, calling him "Cool Hand Luke". They soon begin idolising Luke and treat him as their leader due to his independent, rebellious nature, sense of humour and refusal to conform to life in the prison.However,Luke's mother dies, which prompts him to make a couple of escape attempts, each time he is brought back, punished and warned that if he tries to escape again, there will be greater consequences. Will the prison be able to break Luke's iron spirit...The best thing about the film is the character of Luke and Paul Newman's stellar portrayal of him. The film appealed to me greatly simply because of Luke, as a teenager I felt as if I could relate to him in so many ways, his humorous,independent nature, his rebellious attitude, his feeling of crippling emptiness, his unbreakable,superhuman spirit and willingness to keep trying, his craving for acceptance and longing to be someone and his constant, undying determination to spit in the eye of the establishment and give it hell resonated with me in such a powerful way that is rare for any other film character to do so.I could see parallels to my own life and in most scenes felt his pain, which at times nearly moved me to tears. The film has a handful of truly poignant and remarkable scenes, the scene in which Luke eats 50 eggs in an hour was just incredible and an absolute pleasure to watch. It was beautifully filmed and amazingly directed, the camera-work makes the scene quite tense and as it progresses, I found myself cheering Luke on, it's a monumental scene in movie history. The scene shortly after Luke's mother dies and he sings the song "Plastic Jesus" was dazzling and I was completely engrossed by Newman in this scene. As he sings, tears begin running down his face, which nearly moved me to tears.The film really packed a bruising punch with it's religious symbolism and Christian allegory, which gave the story a fascinating and powerful dimension. As the film goes on, the other prisoners begin to follow Lukes example and treat him as a God-like figure, a factor which ultimately leads to his death, the most powerful and hard hitting scene in the film comes when Luke is forced to dig a grave-like hole. He is repeatedly beaten and forced to dig whilst his fellow prisoners watch and sing gospel songs, with the scene culminating in Luke crying out to God for mercy and begging the guards not to beat him anymore. This scene was fantastic and chilling ,it's packed with brutal emotion and Luke's raw desperation completely blew my mind, another religious undertone is how Luke appears to be broken, but in the end, even though he dies, he beats the system and wins. Also note the scene in the church at the end of the film in which Dragline persuades Luke to give himself up to the authorities who are waiting outside, an act which results in Luke's death, this scene is similar to Judas betrayal of Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane. The final scene was electrifying, it gave me Goosebumps, Luke mimics the Captain's "Failure to communicate" line and is shot, but dies with a smile on his face, this scene was handled excellently and beautifully shot. Overall I was impressed with the allusions of parallels made to that of Jesus, the director handled this in a delicate and adult way,the film highlights how massive an impact faith can have on the human spirit even when it appears broken and also how good will always prevail over evil.The camera-work was brilliant, I loved the shots of the prisoner's toiling under the unrelenting sun and the shots of the dry, vast landscape reflected onto Boss Godfrey's sunglasses were superb and do not compare with any other camera shots in modern cinema. Some of the quotes in the film were amazing, thanks to a remarkable script, Paul Newman is exceptional as Luke and is legendary in the role, with his blue eyes and immortal smile, Newman was born to play the role.George Kennedy is superb in the supporting role an definitely deserved the awards he got.COOL HAND Luke is a potent, modern classic which tells a monumental,compelling story, it has an outstanding script with a mind blowing performance from Paul Newman and the Christian imagery is evoked in a strong and powerful, yet sensitive way which makes the film relevant, significant and appealing, it should definitely be shown to every film student in every film college.The film will always be special to me due to the immortal personality and undying human spirit of the main character.10/10."sometimes nothing can be a real cool hand".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of my favorite film of this genre. This Luke guy played by Paul Newman is one of my favorite movie characters,who intended to break out of the prison over and over again. To him,it's not just a matter of freedom,cause what's the freedom. All that he did is just a attempt to fight against the so-called fate,that's what made him alive and forever.It's not just some kind of self-free declaration&#xff0c;the director made this film meaningful both in content and the story itself.What we saw on Luke is not only a problem that out of himself alone,it's also a feedback of the whole 1960s.the control of the society calls for more freedom.Although the end of this story is a little bit sad.But it means a lot,and it's also doing a great help in our current life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suddenly Prison Doesn't Seem So Bad With Paul Newman Around.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"What we got here is failure to communicate".Another famous line from an American classic. "Cool Hand Luke", was a film said to have captured the spirit of the anti "fall into line" lifestyle of the 1960's. Featuring stunning performances from the always charming Paul Newman, George Kennedy and even Dennis Hopper worked his way into the cast.Luke (Newman) is imprisoned for 2 years for destroying public property. Incarcerated he slowly yet eventually begins to earn the admiration of the "top" inmate (Kennedy), and eventually everyone else follows. Soon they begin to idolise Luke much to the dismay of the lawmen as Luke constantly escapes through cleverly timed plans.Though the film suffers an incredibly slow pacing, those who can sit through it will utmost definitely how it influenced the later (And indeed greater) "One Who Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest" (1975). Nevertheless it's hard not to enjoy Paul Newman's upbeat attitude and his performance as Luke brings a strong level of character and charm, regardless of the many situations and flaws he brings upon himself.Final Verdict: Considering its age, it still holds up well enough to entertain. Not really one to look out for anytime soon, but most definitely deserves some more modern day recognition. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes Nothing is a Pretty Cool Hand</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have watched a lot of movies over the course of a short lifetime. If I were to take all the movies I have watched and approximated their running time at about 100 minutes, I would be looking at about three years worth of movie watching at least. And that's just from watching each of them once. I've become accustomed to movies and what they do, how the stories and characters are formed, how the cinematography relates to the sights, sounds and lighting etc. and while I won't be presumptuous enough to say I know everything about film, I have become harder to surprise and even harder to please.It certainly becomes harder to surprise second or third viewing let alone multiple times. Yet sitting down to refresh my memory of Cool Hand Luke (1967), I was actually astounded by the intricacies of the story that I have previously overlooked. I have always believed it was an inspiring movie; an entertaining movie and the gold standard for prison-themed films. Now not only do I believe it is all those things, it is also one of the best religious allegories in American cinema.For the benefit of those who have not seen Cool Hand Luke I will summarize the plot. Luke (Paul Newman) is a former war hero turned drunken vagrant who is arrested for taking the heads off of parking meters. He's taken to a work-camp where he slowly by surely wins the respect of the prisoners to the chagrin of the warden and prison guards.The character of Luke is meant to exemplify the words, body and mind of Jesus Christ. His name Luke is taken from the New Testament; one of the Gospels about the life of Jesus and one that most characterizes the humanity of Jesus of Nazareth. The book of Luke is also the only book that covers the parables of the good Samaritan, the prodigal son, and the unjust steward. A story about an undesirable person helping and gaining the respect of another, the story of a son who finds redemption and finally a parable about a man being dishonest for a greater good.Each parable represents a part of Luke. He gains the respect of the other undesirables in the prison by sacrificing his pride during a boxing match with Dragline (George Kennedy). Outmatched by the larger, stronger Dragline, he stays standing. Later during a poker game he gains the respect of the others including Dragline by bluffing in a hand holding absolutely nothing of value. He comment; "Sometimes nothing can be a very cool hand." Thus his name.In the middle of the movie, Luke's mother Arletta and his distant but above board brother John come to visit. John is coincidently the name of another New Testament writer. While he never speaks to Luke, he does seem to fit the description of a doting son by toting his mother around. Arletta bemoans her role in Luke's hardships while all but admitting he is the favorite of the two; the prodigal son.After her death, Luke is unjustly forced into the prison hotbox for a night. It is from that point on Luke starts to disobey and attempts his escapes. While Luke 16:1-13 is mostly about mammon and avarice, It still relates. For those unfamiliar with the verse, a disobeying steward forgives the debts of his debtors without his permission. "And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light." If interpreted more liberally, the parable is an endorsement of disobeying unjust masters. In this case of Cool Hand Luke, the warden and guards are the masters and Luke is the unjust steward.In addition to the parables, Luke does other things to exemplify the life and times of Jesus. There is a scene where Luke challenges himself to eat 50 hardboiled eggs at a time. When asked why 50, Luke replies "Seemed like a good round number." It is also the same number of prisoners in the camp. The scene can be interpreted as Luke symbolically consuming the sins of the men. There is another scene where Luke goads the prisoners to shovel seed on a tarred road; a reminder of Luke 8:1-15, the parable of the sower. Finally, Luke speaks to God, referencing him as "old man," much like a son would address a father.Now I'm not a religious person, nor am I deranged enough to think this is all one big conspiracy, but I can appreciate the universality of the many stories imbedded in religious literature. Even if the religious symbolism of Cool Hand Luke is coincidental, the prevalence of religiosity in our culture must have had an influence on the filmmakers. The writer of the novel Donn Pearce was himself an inmate of the Florida Department of Corrections and when he wasn't digging ditches he may-well have been reading biblical passages.The famous line "what we have here is a problem to communicate." comes from the movie Cool Hand Luke. In many ways this film has struggled for years to communicate with me. It is only now that I can appreciate the symbolism, the beauty and the elegance of Cool Hand Luke. Here's to hoping you can appreciate it too.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Newman gives a fine performance in director Stuart Rosenberg's tale of "born loser" Lucas 'Luke' Jackson, who is sentenced to a southern chain gang after he, in a drunken stupor, cut the tops off a row of parking meters. The captain of the chain gang(Strother Martin, superb) tries to tell the new men that he doesn't want any trouble, so he wont give any trouble. The overseer of the chain gang at work is called "Boss"(Morgan Woodward, memorable in his shaded sunglasses, and never says a word!) George Kennedy plays "Dragline", the veteran of the group who dislikes Luke at first, but later changes his mind when he sees how defiant Luke is, with his repeated escape attempts and eating 50 eggs. The captain is determined to break Luke, in order to make an example of him, and squash this "cool hand" talk.Fine character study with solid performances and an insightful script that deals with defiance of authority, and one's fate as a consequence, and whether such a thing is even wise in the circumstances. Luke is no saint, though sympathetic, and certainly no role model, which is the central point I think...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent but Overrated Prison Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cool Hand Luke is a film about a man who is sent to a rural prison for taking off the heads of parking meters. At the prison, he becomes part of the chain gang dealing with hot, back-breaking road work. As this man lives in prison, he becomes the short-talking, cool inmate that can either get under your skin or become your best friend. Of course as time goes by, his cool personality gets him into trouble by constantly breaking out of prison and being put back in. At the end of the film once you this his "cool" mind is put to rest, he breaks out of prison again to see what the Almighty has left for him to live for; and that is nothing can get you a pretty cool hand. This is a well-made film although it does have some minor flaws including over-dramaticism and unrealistic situations. Cool Hand Luke is a decent prison film but it surely is no Shawshank. But watch this movie and receive some sentimental, witty laughs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the great mood the music sets for the movie, to classic one-liners "What we have here is a failure to communicate.", to the excellent acting, this movie is a classic. This movie will never get old. Classic scenes like the convicts squirming while watching the car getting watched, to everyone's favorite (and mine)...the egg-eating contest, to the iconic way they ask for permission: "Getting water, Boss!" "Taking my shirt off, Boss." Hopefully, Hollywood never ruins this movie by attempting to remake it, as seems to be the case during this era of movie-making. It was done exactly right the first time, and I hope it stays that way. Dim the lights, grab some popcorn, and enjoy this movie again; for those that have never seen it, a special treat is in store for you. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For anyone having missed this tour de force by Newman, what a TREAT to recommend. There's enough symbolism, strength &amp; edge to make this movie last a lifetime. It never grows old. The egg swallowing scene is up there with "are you talking to me" in Taxi-drive or other legendary movie. And GOD is Paul easy on the eyes. Of all the amaaazing films he compiled in his tremendous film career, to me, this is his finest accomplishment. And the character actors surrounding him only benefit &amp; heighten its measure along the way. One not to be left out of any film aficiando's portfolio!

		<shortDescription>A classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For all you non conformists out there, take a look at this little film. I think you might enjoy it. In it, Paul Newman plays the epitome of rebellious and non conformist, Luke. Luke is serving two years in a rural prison on a chain gang and he absolutely refuses to conform to the prison way of life. The other prisoners admire him for his gustiness and his smooth coolness, hence the title of the film, and the audience admires him in much the same way. At least I did. He has got a lot of spirit, attitude, and life in him to make him an extremely likable screen character. It also helps that he is Paul Newman.This film is an excellent insight into chain gang life. It conveys a perfect mixture of laid back ease as the prisoners go about their day to day work. There are a lot of fun moments that give the film a very cool and easy going feel, but then other moments appear out of nowhere that change the tone of the film instantaneously. Reality bites back hard in this when just as things start to look up, the harsh reality that this is still prison life comes down hard on Luke and his friends. Luke tries multiple times to escape and every time he is caught and brought back to the prison. There, the prison staff have no choice but to break his spirit any way they can so he won't try to escape again. This is where the film becomes its harshest, but also its most compelling. The film flows very nicely and is a slow crescendo to the riveting end.Perhaps one of the best things about Cool Hand Luke is its great effect as a character study. Paul Newman plays Luke extremely well and keeps him a steady hero to the audience as we root for him during anything he does. But what is also very interesting about his character is the relationships he builds with the other prisoners and how they morph and change throughout the film. George Kennedy plays Dragline, a fast talking rough and tough prisoner who Luke grows closest to. Their relationship is very compelling and developed incredibly well. Dragline, along with the rest of the prisoners, idolize Luke for his spirit and determination to escape, and seeing how this admiration develops on both sides of the equation is very interesting. As Luke grows more and more discouraged his adherence to the admiration dwindles until he is tired of it, making for some very interesting confrontations. The film is a very well rounded and interesting character study from start to finish.Cool Hand Luke is indeed a classic that will be remembered forever and revered as one of Paul Newman's finest roles. It is a very interesting look into chain gang life and the minds of those who work endlessly on the chain. It reflects a golden age of cinema and exemplifies what good filmmaking is all about. There's no BS here. Cool Hand Luke is a very well made film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A levelheaded script and capital performances overcome some uneven directing and make "Cool Hand Luke" an instantly memorable classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I admire greatly in pictures like "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and "The Shawshank Redemption" is how they merely place their settings in a conformity-based location such as a prison but instead focus on themes of nonconformity and rebelling against what may be a not-so-perfect system. For the same reasons, I really enjoyed "Cool Hand Luke" a 1967 Paul Newman classic based on a book by Donn Pearce. Author Mr. Pearce based the novel on his own experiences as a chain-gang prisoner.The protagonist, somewhat based on the author of the book, is a war veteran-turned-vandal named Luke (Paul Newman), who is sent to work hard labor a rural prison for cutting the heads off of parking meters. Luke is informed by the steel-faced guards and captain (Strother Martin) of all his expectations and the rules he must follow. But after conforming to these guidelines for a while, he begins to rebel against the system, and inspires several of his fellow inmates to do the same.I think one of the reasons why people tend to avoid movies about people in prison is because when one tends to think of a "prison picture" they imagine a dirty, sickening, and unhappy experience. Maybe a realistic one, but depressing. That's not what movies like "Cool Hand Luke" is about. The prison is nothing more than the setting. What this movie is about is nonconformity. I sure hope it does not inspire real-life prisoners to rebel against the systems of our correction facilities, but that it will get lawful folks to take nonviolent action against systems that do not work. Like Luke himself. Luke does not club a guard over a head or hurt or kill anybody; he's still transgressing against the rules and trying to inspire change. And admit it, if you knew a man who could shove fifty hard-boiled eggs down his throat one after another in an hour, you would have some great level of admiration, too."Cool Hand Luke" does a fantastic job of telling a great story. First it starts off introducing the protagonist (and audience) to a routine. Once he (and we) adjust, then it starts to give notes of inspiration and then it takes those inspirations to the next level. What's also very good is the way the film tends to sort of switch protagonists midway. At first, we follow Luke as he adjusts to rural prison life and then starts to rebel. When he does, we switch over to George Kennedy and other inmates. And we watch from their point-of-view as Luke begins a sort of self-sacrifice, like the crucifixion of Jesus as the movie continually parallels. The fact that these characters are so wonderfully-written with such memorable, and yet natural dialogue, and well-portrayed by Paul Newman and the cast enforces our interest in the outcome, which is notably affecting.Now there are some problems with the picture, however, they are sporadic. They all tend to revolve around the direction by Stuart Rosenberg. I must confess I am not particularly affected by his style. Two core moments in the movie are almost rendered static by hampering long takes that would seem lifeless if Paul Newman were not such a great actor. Rosenberg is clearly also a director willing to experiment and while I appreciate that, sometimes, I think, as he may have discovered, his experiments don't always work out. But he knows how to make a good picture, and most the time he does a good job setting up his camera.Despite some uneven directing, "Cool Hand Luke" has deservedly gone on to become a classic. I can't sincerely throw my fullest support behind director Stuart Rosenberg, but I can for the screenwriters Doon Pearce and Frank Pierson for their dialogue, characters, and themes. I must also commend the actors, who are indelible in their roles. Newman and Kennedy (who won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor the following year) are fantastic, as are J.D. Cannon, Strother Martin, Jo Van Fleet, Clifton James, and Morgan Woodman."What we've got here is failure to communicate." - Paul Newman as Luke</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Non-conformist Paul Newman (as Lukas "Luke" Jackson) is sentenced to two years on a southern chain gang for the crime called "maliciously destroying municipal property while under the influence," or, as Mr. Newman explains, "cutting the tops off of parking meters." His ho-humming of chain gang leader George Kennedy (as "Dragline") gets Newman in trouble with the inmates, but he eventually gains their respect and admiration. Newman continually tries to escape, and fights "sumbitch" captain Strother Martin's attempts to "break" him. Finally, it appears Newman has succumbed to his captors, or has he? With so many classic sequences - a car wash with busty Joy Harmon (as "Lucille"), Newman's fist-fight with Mr. Kennedy, the laboring to Lalo Schifrin's "Eyewitness News" score, the egg-eating contest, and Newman's final walk with God - director Stuart Rosenberg, writer Donn Pearce, and adapter Frank Pierson deserve a lot more credit than received.It all ends up being another retelling of the Christ story, and it's definitely one of the better ones. Interestingly, the allegorical, unlikely-placed Jesus Christ stories that became so popular in the 1960s capture the spirit of the character (man, God? take your pick) better than the reverentially conventional epics remembered (but not exclusively) from the 1950s. "Cool Hand Luke" also connects its hero the then current counter-culture; and, this is what the film does extraordinarily well. The line, "What we got here is a failure to communicate," defines its generation. And, "Sometimes nothing can be a real cool hand." ********* Cool Hand Luke (11/1/67) Stuart Rosenberg ~ Paul Newman, George Kennedy, Strother Martin, Jo Van Fleet</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Essential Paul Newman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Luke has had a bad drunk night, and ends it by cutting the heads off of parking meters. This doesn't go well with the police, and he is given two years on a chain gang.While Paul Newman's career was long and memorable, I think that "Cool Hand Luke" possibly ranks as his most memorable. Newman is something of an anti-hero, where we love him despite his faults and hope to see him escape from his captors, though we know full well that he is guilty of the crime for which he is interred.The most memorable scene? Of course, the egg-eating scene with fifty hard-boiled eggs in one hour. Amazing (though far from any sort of record). I have read that this scene is supposed to have some sort of Christian symbolism. I'm not entirely convinced, and won't be until I hear it from the creators, but it's an interesting theory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Increased my respect towards Newman as an actor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you consider that The Shawshank Redemption, Dead Man Walking, The Green Mile etc are the best examples of prison movies recently, then I suggest you to watch this movie made decades back and can be considered easily in the list of top 5 prison movies ever. Cool Hand Luke is the story of Luke (Newman) who has to face the prison sentence for a small crime . The prisoners before the arrival of Luke are not united and have lost all the fighting spirit within them. Luke who is a born rebel and a guy with a "Never Say Die" attitude brings about a great change in the mindset of the prisoners. With his mere guts, he becomes a hero for them . He escapes from prison many times but is re-captured again. After the escape acts, his respect among the prisoners increases many folds. This movie can surely be called an Anti-Hero prison movie with an underlying message.Some Great Scenes Still lingering in my mind : 1) The Sexy Blonde Car Wash Chick seducing the prisoners. 2) The Boxing Fight Between Newman and Kennedy 3) The Tarring of the Road 4) Luke's all escape scenesI have watched many Paul Newman movies, but this movie increased my respect towards him as an actor. Kennedy as the leader of the prisoners - Dragline was also impressive. Special mention to the 'Man with No eyes' who has not spoke a word in the movie but still creates a visual impact. Highly Recommended.Rating : 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was 14 when they made this movie and it was not received well by the critics. By the time I was able to see the movie I was shocked. This was a darn fine movie and reflects a time in history that is all but forgotten now, the chain gangs. I loved this movie, Strother Martin gives his finest performance here and so does George Kennedy. Also Wayne Rogers &amp; the whole cast is just excellent. I have the movie but never fail to watch it again when it appears on the TV. I have encourage all the young people &amp; my own kids to watch this one, time will never destroy this important saga in history. Paul Newman is at the very height in his carrier here &amp; I do not think he has ever topped Cool Hand Luke. Ever since i saw the movie I have been a huge Wanyne Rogers fan although he has only a small part here as the "gambler" I love it when he says "ace gets a slap in the face" I have to say this every time I play cards. The movie has a morbid side that portrays to me true life in the deep south prison system back when &amp; should be watched by all movie buffs. Thank you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like most people, I love excellent movies and the actors responsible for making them excellent. Graced by a stellar cast, this is the epitome of one of those excellent movies. Strother Martin had a never failing genius when it came to portraying southern cads, regardless of what level of society he represented. And as the cruel warden in this film he is just as wonderfully entertaining as his fans have learned to expect. Casting the amazing Jo Van Fleet in the cameo role as Luke's mother in failing health on a last visit was a thoughtful touch, adding depth and understanding to Luke's personal turmoil. Anyone who has seen her brilliant effort as the defiant elderly landowner (Van Fleet was actually 46 at the time) in Elia Kazan's Wild River would expect no less. George Kennedy turns in his usual stellar performance as the big tough, but not too bright prison ringleader. His best-supporting Oscar was well deserved. The only disappointment I have as I watch and re-watch this great movie, is the fact that the utterly fantastic performance by Paul Newman as the born loser who throughout the film was called upon to exhibit the extreme highs and low of human emotion, and did so with amazing realism, went home without the Oscar. He truly deserved an Oscar for this role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What we have here is a failure to put me to sleep...Cool Hand Luke is a one-of-a-kind movie. Nowadays all prison bound movies of the sort are boring and violence-oriented. Cool Hand Luke is not. Cool Hand Luke tells the story of Luke, a man who has nothing better to do than get arrested and make rules of his own.The acting was all great. The best being Paul Newman as Luke, our lovable protagonist here. There's George Kennedy as Dragline, the unofficial leader of the bunch incarcerated. There are also great performances by Lou Antonio, Robert Drivas, JD Cannon, Harry Dean Stanton, and a young Dennis Hopper.With plenty of unforgettable moments and lines, Cool Hand Luke is a movie that is sure to last through the ages.9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burning the brightest hurts.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is in my opinion one of the greatest ever made. To sum it up in short, recall the clich that "the brightest flames burn the quickest".Lucas Jackson is just that, he is nothing but a ball of passion, living life as his heart tells him to do. He has lived, he has done horrible things, he has loved, and all with nothing more than an innocent smile on his face. He did only what he felt was right.But, burning with such passion has it's own negatives... even though he inspires everyone around him, for every ounce of passion he inspires, it seems that twice as much passion is ripped from him. As he creates life, his own life is drained...It is a story about selflessness. It is about a man who gives all of himself despite the toll taken upon himself. It is a story about a man doing whatever he has to do, no matter what the risks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful metaphor for Christ.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This expertly written story of a rebel playing by his own rules, no matter what anyone else says, was a lot different than what I had expected but definitely worthy of the classic status it has come to receive in the forty years since it's release. The story is timeless, incredibly powerful and ultimately uplifting and the cast does a great job at putting it all together. Most impressive, of course, is Paul Newman who gives a very likable, well-rounded performance that exceeded my high expectations that I had built up. I'm kind of surprised that it wasn't nominated for Best Picture.The most interesting aspect of the film for me was the metaphor for the life of Christ that was displayed throughout. At the beginning of the film we see Luke engage in a boxing match where he is badly beaten, but he refuses to lay down and give up. As a result of this, his fellow prisoners in the camp become his followers. They praise him and look towards him as a leader for the rest of the film. He leads them up against the guards; not in an act of rebellion in order to overthrow the camp, but rebellion just for the sake of rebellion. Luke doesn't ever ask to become the leader of this group or to be anything more than himself. He just does things in order to pass the time, in order to entertain himself, and as a result everyone else in the camp projects these Christ-like qualities upon him. The film itself makes direct references to him being a religious symbol; his camp number 37, is a reference to the bible and after the scene where he eats fifty eggs he lays on the table in the form of a crucifix. Most interesting for me, though, was the story of his resurrection. After his second botched escape attempt, he comes back and the guards begin to beat him over and over again. They torture him for no reason other than to break him and when they finally do, they push him down into his grave, literally. But then the warden, as god, lifts him back up out of the grave and puts him back into the camp. His fellow prisoners think he is broken and that he has abandoned them, but instead he rises back up and escapes once again. I'm not a religious man by any means, but the metaphor for Luke as Christ throughout was something that I found very intriguing.The ending itself was great. Luke was finally killed but the impact of his life lived on through Dragline. The most powerful moment of the film for me was when he rose up and attacked the man with no eyes, who had served as this haunting figure looming over the prisoners for the entire film. Seeing those ominous get crushed under the tire was such a powerful anti-establishment statement. The final montage of Newman's beautiful smile could have come across as overly sentimental, but instead further served the uplifting message that the film carries all the way through. A great story highlighted by a sensational performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool Hand Luke- In the Spirit of the anti-Hero ***1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Newman gives still another fabulous performance as the anti-hero in this wonderful chain gang film of 1967. Newman proves that Paul Muni of "I Am A Fugitive on A Chain Gang," did not have a monopoly over these types of pictures.Ready to tow the line, Newman is literally boxed in following the death of his mother, Arletta, played in a one scene phenomenal performance by Jo Van Fleet. Fleet made a career of playing elderly women despite her younger years. In her brief scene, she brings out some of the character of Luke.As the bully who later befriends Luke, fellow inmate George Kennedy, won the best supporting actor actor award that year for his performance.Strother Martin is excellent as the nightmare warden of the chain gang. His famous line, when Luke is captured, is to say" "What We Have Here is A Failure to Communicate." What we have here is a terrific, memorable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool Hand Luke and Existenialism.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Existentialism has been part of literature and movies ever since it was popularized by the likes of Jean-Paul Sartre and other French Philosophers.I've seen many movies which can be interpreted as having existentialist or postmodernist (Nihilistic) tendencies. I myself can't stand movies having nihilistic themes such as 'Pulp Fiction',although these movies have been quite a success at the big screen and no body feels reluctant to call them 'Blockbuster'. Existentialism on the other hand is not as hopeless a philosophy (If you consider it a philosophy) as Nihilism.Existentialism in a nutshell is philosophy 'individualized'.Its emphasis on human freedom and liberty is such that it has attracted many creative writers and film makers.The influence of existentialism spreads beyond the realm of philosophy. 'Cool Hand Luke',staring one of my favorite actors Paul Newman stands up as a movie which can surely belong to existential genre.The movie surrounds around one man's defiance against authority .The protagonist from start of the movie till its end ,struggles to get himself free.The problem with the most of the people is that they give up pretty quickly but the problem with our hero is that he never gives up.He can be described as a person who consciously makes all those efforts to get himself free,but is unconsciously aware about his futile efforts.Any person who have special affinity towards 'Existentialism' must see this masterpiece.Had Sartre reviewed this movie he would only have used one sentence to end it all,the sentence would surely have been ,'Man is condemned to be free'.But I will end my review with the tag line of the movie,'What we've got here is a failure to communicate'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another great performance by Paul Newman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Newman is "Cool Hand Luke" in this 1967 film that co-stars a lot of familiar faces: Strother Martin, George Kennedy, Wayne Rogers, J.D. Cannon and Ralph Waite. It also has a scene between Newman and one of my favorite actresses of all time: Jo Van Fleet, who gives another brilliant performance. Just watching these two on camera makes the film worthwhile.However, "Cool Hand Luke" is worthwhile for a lot more than that. It's the vintage Newman antihero, coming along during the era of protest and noncomformity. Luke is a man put on a prison chain gang for vandalizing parking meters. He wins the admiration of his fellow inmates with his refusal to conform to the rules.There are many famous scenes and lines, one of the most famous being when Luke casually announces that he can eat 50 eggs. Newman's take on this role is fantastic - he underplays, speaks with a measured tone of voice, betraying his emotions in his eyes and his bemused smile - but when he lets loose with the goods - look out! One of the most poignant scenes is Luke playing guitar and singing when he learns of his mother's death. Even when you want to cry, you can't help but smile and admire him - when he prays in the church, for instance, turns and sees Dragline, and yells up to God, "THAT'S YOUR ANSWER?" - you just know what's going to happen, what he'd rather do than go back to prison.In the fight scene, though his opponent, played by George Kennedy, tells him to stay down, Luke refuses and keeps getting up. So we know that even when he begs for mercy, even when we see him stay down, he won't really do it. It's not in his nature.It's hard to choose Newman's greatest performance because he's had so many. But George Kennedy was rarely given an opportunity as he was with the role of Dragline, and he delivers. It's his best work. Strother Martin is mean as dirt, and the rest of the inmates, several of whom went on to star on popular TV shows, are excellent.Fortunately, what we have here is NOT a failure to communicate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How can one film be so emotionally powerful, intellectually stimulating, and entertaining? "Cool Hand Luke" is truly one of the best films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How can one film be as philosophically deep and yet as enduring and entertaining as this one? "Cool Hand Luke" is a classic because it juggles several different tones (some sequences are hilarious, whereas others are some of the most heart wrenching put on film) into one unified whole. No matter what your political or social affiliations are, you'll relate to Luke's struggle to find absolute freedom in a world that only wants him to conform. He's the ideal anti-hero, because he embodies the (often futile) search for freedom. Such a complexly written character is further given life by Paul Newman's seminal portrayal. Newman manages to make Luke a completely likable protagonist.The film, which couldn't have been released at a better time (right on the verge of the counterculture coming into national prominence), is difficult to fault from a technical level as well as an emotional one. Everyone in the cast gives powerhouse performances. In addition to Newman, both Strother Martin and especially George Kennedy are embedded into the public conscience. Stuart Rosenberg's direction isn't anything groundbreaking aesthetically, but is perfect for creating powerful entertainment. The screenplay by Donn Pearce needs to be mentioned also. Few films manage to work on so many levels (repeat viewings reveal the fascinating amount of symbolism) and this is largely due to Pearce. The ending for the film is one of the best ever, both incredibly tragic yet spiritually affirming. "Cool Hand Luke" is one of the best films ever made. (10/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rosenberg dead at 79</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stuart Rosenberg, a hard-working director of series television and theatrical films who captured the simmering anti-authoritarianism of the late 1960s in the widely popular Paul Newman prison drama "Cool Hand Luke," died on Thursday at his home in Beverly Hills, Calif. He was 79.Paul Newman projected a grinning indomitability as the instinctive and irrepressible rebel Lucas Jackson, an inmate of a Southern prison who locks horns with a sadistic overseer played by Strother Martin. Mr. Martin pronounced the film's most famous line: "What we've got here is failure to communicate." George Kennedy won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar as his sidekick and part of a totally unfaultable cast. This film was characterized by ruthlessly realistic and plausible staging and directing by Rosenberg.One of the absolute best films of the 60's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Newman as the ultimate non-conformist is brilliant...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is such an engrossing prison drama from start to finish that its most famous line: "What we have here is a failure to communicate!" is certainly not true of the film itself. As a matter of fact, by the time it winds to a rather sad conclusion, the viewer feels as though he's been harshly imprisoned along with Luke.As the title character, PAUL NEWMAN gives what has to be one of his finest performances--full of cockiness, swagger, and the kind of macho stubborness that gets him in so much trouble in the first place. He clearly has an attitude problem that the guys in charge do their utmost to change--to no avail. His struggles to escape are met with defeat at every turn--but does he learn his lesson? Hell no.GEORGE KENNEDY's is the other great male performance, excellent as Dragline, who at first bullies Luke and then comes to respect him. The only female performance in the film (aside from the curvaceous car-wash gal) is JO VAN FLEET as Luke's mother who also has plenty of attitude and has only a couple of brief scenes that she makes the most of. She's almost playing the same character she did as James Dean's mom in EAST OF EDEN.But it's Newman's film all the way and he's brilliant as the self-absorbed n'er-do-well whose confrontational attitude with authority is the whole raison d'etre for the plot and his whole reason for ending up on a chain gang. There's a moral there, but I'm not quite sure what it is. Still, it's an engrossing film, both gritty and humorous and sometimes powerful.Summing up: Well worth seeing for Newman's greatest performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great script, excellent acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If writers Don Pearce and Frank Pierson set out to emotionally overpower moviegoers by creating a character that not only inspires admiration and adoration as a crafty and charismatic individualist but also evokes feelings of compassion as a complex and sometimes tragic loner, then they realized their plan with me.Despite my experience, though, I understand why for some people "Cool Hand Luke" amounts to little more than a typical prison tale. After all, the viewer sees intermittent acts of cruelty, unappealing living conditions and a tedious daily routine, and the usual attempts by inmates to escape. Nevertheless, the story has moved me each time I have seen it.The first time I watched "Cool Hand Luke," I felt so enamored of the protagonist, Luke Jackson, that at the end of the film I felt a loss that stayed with me for weeks. When during the following year another cinema presented "Cool Hand Luke," and when months later television broad-casted it, I again found myself engrossed in the story, then teary eyed as the curtains closed and "Down Here On The Ground" played a final time.When I have seen "Cool Hand Luke" more recently, I have noticed the allusions to Christ which at least a couple of critics have mentioned -- the eating of all of those eggs now seems to border on the miraculous -- but the movie still entertains me because in Luke Jackson I continue to see a real person who, though self-defeating, has the unique ability to transcend the drudgery of prison life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Newman in his prime years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this during it's initial theatrical release and have seen it many times since. This is a great Paul Newman vehicle in one his his most memorable roles. He was nominated for the Academy award for Best Actor as Cool Hand Luke for 1967 but lost out to Rod Stieger in a field that also included Spencer Tracy, Warren Beaty and Dustin Hoffman. The film received three other nominations for Supporting Actor which George Kennedy won, and for Screenplay from Donn Pearce and Frank Pierson adapted from Pearce's novel and Original Music Score from Lalo Shifrin. Novelist Pearce had himself one been a chain gang convict which inspired his story. It would be his first and only screenplay for a theatrical release. Director Stuart Rosenberg would go on to direct Newman in a couple more movies had just made the leap from television director to the big screen with Cool Hand Luke as his first theatrical feature. Rosenberg would enjoy continued success with Brubaker, The Drowing Pool, the April Fools and The Amityville Horror. Kennedy won the Supporting Actor Oscar but more people probably remember the remarkable performance by Strother Martin. Cast members also include Dennis Hopper, Harry Dean Stanton, Wayne rogers, Ralph Waite and Joe Donn Baker. Cool Hand Luke thumbs it's nose at conformity, establishment and oppression which made it very popular in 1967 with audiences. I'm generally not a big fan of prison movies but I would give this an 8.0 out of 10.</fullReview>

Maybe the carwashing scene is a bit corny, but it sure is funny in a manly way. "I've never planned anything in my life" What a line! And the song Plastic Jesus, I have started singing it to my daughter when she is about to sleep. When I saw Cool Hand for the first time, I saw some of myself in the character. And who do one want in the leading role in the movie about yourself? Paul Newman of course! (annoying that I just could eat 22 eggs)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Viewed this film in 1967 and did not appreciate at the time the great acting of Paul Newman(Luke),"Nobody's Fool",'94 who gave a outstanding performance as a hard headed young man who would not conform to conditions set by society. Luke tried to find God but the chains around his legs seemed to tie him down. His mother visited him in the back of a truck because she was too gravely ill to walk, this scene was very dramatic. George Kennedy,(Dragline),"Bayou Ghost",'97 had to beat up Luke in a fight that never seemed to end because Luke refused to just lay down on the ground. Kennedy gave a great supporting role to Luke right to the very end of the picture. Chain Gangs were a very real thing in the 30's and 40's, mostly in the South where I would often see them working in the hot sun and was told by my parents NOT TO FOLLOW IN THEIR FOOTSTEPS!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>..."Cool Hand Luke" stars Paul Newman as Luke, the cool, funny and independent vandal who gets sent to work in a chain gang for destroying public property. When he arrives he meets the Captain (Strother Martin) and learns of the countless harsh rules and punishments of the gang. He also mingles with the other prisoners, including "leader" Dragline (George Kennedy). But after months of staying in the gang, Luke attempts to escape numerous times, and the question is: can the Captain of the gang finally break him?"Cool Hand Luke" is an amazing movie. The acting from Newman, Kennedy and Martin is great. The script is memorable. The direction is admirable. The blend of humor and drama is also impressive. But in the end, nothing beats the acting.Newman does very well, I'm new into old cinema, so for me its hard to believe that this young man is the same old, frail mob boss in "Road to Perdition". He is a very versatile and impressive. But, believe it or not, Newman isn't the highlight of this film. Kennedy steals the show as Dragline, the dim-witted but honest, good heated and tough leader of the inmates. He starts off intimidating Luke, but as the movie goes on he grows to appreciate and love Luke, and even becomes his partner in an excitingly fun escape scene.Watching the progression of Newman and Kennedy's characters is highly entertaining, a must-see for all who like good cinema.8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably the best film ever played by the extraordinary actor Paul Newman. Nearly the whole film is played in a prison in a rural area, where the prisoners have their ways of living, and obviously a kind of boss among them (Dragline= George Kennedy), but once Luke is placed in prison, his way of resisting anything around him attracted the sympathy from many of his colleagues. He was never afraid of anything, he did not know why he was living in this life, and he had serious doubt about the existence of God. Probably he had a heavy childhood although he loved his mother very seriously. Prison in many parts of the world, not to say everywhere, instead of being a place for educating persons, it is just a place for punishment without any mercy. Many of the prisoners due to this was of living normally become more dangerous than in the past. This film shows an injustice, Luke's mother died, and the bosses of the prison put Luke in a hole just to avoid him to escape, So where is the logic? the man did not do anything wrong and is punished. Obviously, Luke became a hard rebel and escaped anytime he could. At the end of the film, there is an interesting scene when he tried to talk with God, whom he called the Old man. God did not reply to any of his questions, and suddenly a bullet reached him and is killed.</fullReview>

And with COOL HAND LUKE, Newman was cool to the point where being grimy became cool! The star plays Luke, a convict in a rural prison who becomes the center of abuse by the slam's sadistic higher powers. But, as with enough collective smoothness to charm the pants out of any- body, Luke refuses to bend down to his superiors, even if it meant enduring the most punishing abuse. George Kennedy also wins as Luke's goofy buddy Dragline.</fullReview>

He brought change to the daily grind, in attitude and belief. He actually gave his fellow prisoners hope. Luke's prison buddy, Dragline, played by George Kennedy, rides Luke's coattails like a fumbling, bumbling idiot. I believe he actually won a Academy Award for this part, when the true star of the movie was Paul Newman. Many scenes and characters from the movie are still vivid. The "man with no eyes", who plays a shotgun toting guard, the chase scene where the blood hounds run themselves to death trying to catch Luke. And Strother Martin is memorable as the warden, especially when he utters the famous line to Luke, "Now, what we have here is a failure to communicate." Newman's character, Luke DOES communicate, but it seems no one is really listening. This is one of the great movies from the 1960"s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grotesque Egg Eating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that the characters of Newman and Nicholas (one Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest) are very similar in the way that they both have knowing smiles and beaming confidence. I think that Nurse Ratched is the Manager with the sun glasses in this film just like her hat showing power and both Newman and Nicholson don't like authority heads. I feel that they are both really just rebellious unlike what they are made out to be which are a whack job and a very bad criminal that have really done minimal damages apart from the under age sex ordeal with Nicholson. With the scene with the eating of the eggs the scene with the voting to watch the game is when they really are both accepted and both scenes are equal bringing all of the characters together.The main scene that stood out to me was the escape scenes as you really wanted him to get away and for the film to end for his safety. But my favourite scene was the egg scene. He ate 50 of them, I liked the scene as it was when he was accepted into the group, it also had some humour not only eating 50 eggs he was bloated with an over-sized stomach, this also made me feel sick just the thought of an eggs makes me feel sick, I literally start gagging, yuck. I think the ending was very when he was shot, although was killed but also escaped from the enclosure but not the way he wanted to. With his smirk on his face maybe also realising.There are stars and then there are actors like Paul Newman who is iconic for this role and many others like Butch Cassidy. The cocky motion of Cool Hand Luke may wobble from time to time but Newman's magnetic personality lends the film some weight. I love that is shot in widescreen. The story is quite straightforward with a anti-authoritarian story to a macho tall tale and winds up ultimately as somewhat of a curious and incomplete Christ tale. Luke represents man's journey from Genesis to Jesus' death. He was living in a perfect world, or eden, where everything was free and such, but Luke decides to leave by doing a very stupid act in retrospect. When Dragline questions Luke about this, Luke replies, 'Well you can't stay in Eden for too long.' Luke doesn't feel too bad about being sent to camp until he realises that it is unlivable once his mother dies; the only way out? to escape, but in the bible, the way for individuals to escape the restrained world was for Jesus to die, just like Luke. Also, Luke is able to motivate a great number of people to finish tarring the road quite easily. Dragline represents Judas, turning Luke in. But all the same stay very engaging. The film is filled with quotable lines such as 'What we've got here is a failure to communicate.' and memorable scenes. It is light in meaning but is full of cultural significance. A great deal of Cool Hand Lukes greatness is the supporting roles from Dennis Hopper and George Kennedy as Newmans Rival turned right hand man. But Luke doesn't clarify his motives, he seems as if he was put there for a challenge, inviting a conflict with the system to see if he can win. It isn't till the conclusion that the rebellion seems to be more free-spirited. The thing that makes one certain character quite dominant is the use of the sun glasses by the manager hiding his eyes; eyes are the doors to the soul.Unlike the other prisoners Luke rejects the prison conformity's that come with the enclosure and his unco-operative stand leads to tradegy. If Cool hand Luke is about how far one man can push the system, it's also about what happens when the system pushes back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A straight-forward film that has more than meets the eye</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cool Hand Luke is an engaging movie with symbolism, about one of the great characters of cinema. Throughout the whole film there is symbolism, which supports the things that have been said earlier by characters. I like the inventive and fitting camera work that supports the messages and lends more power to the film. I also like the sound design, which especially in the beginning often has a dazzling effect, in combination with the cinematography, like, when the camera closes in on the ventilator.It's the kind of film with symbolism that doesn't get much appreciation from the art-house crowd (you know you're one of them, don't lie to yourself), since it could be dangerous to acknowledge the symbolism in a film that is easy to understand for everyone, with characters that are emotionally engaging. People could falsely believe that you like it for those reasons, which could lead them to doubt your intellectualism.In the film things are often told twice in two different ways. Usually within a few minutes, in the same scene or in two successive scenes. Like in the scene when Luke bursts out: "Get out there yourself. Stop feedin' off me. Get out of here. I can't breathe. Give me some air." Oh, how right Luke was when he yelled those words to his fellow inmates. A few minutes later they are literally feeding off of his plate when he has to clear his plate but apparently has no appetite, putting this line into a completely different (more positive) light.Notably, the initiator for him to yell those lines is that when they show him his picture with the two women, they don't want to believe him when he says it was staged. The movie closes with this very picture. To me this said that we, the audience, have fed off of him. We let the film be our catalyst for our wishes to have the guts to fight for a boundless world, our wishes to have enough of a will to shake the world. Oh, how right the film was with that.Some folks may wouldn't call this symbolism. Well, I do. Other than some of the art-house stuff it's symbolism with an intention behind it. It's not just thrown in there so that the audience can find some meaning in it, just so that we have something to think about, while the filmmaker failed to do so himself. No, this symbolism supported the story and our understanding of the characters.Needless to say that the Luke character spoke right out of our hearts. I love the fact that he essentially stayed a loner till his last breath, since films with a main character like that usually end with the guy being very social and as a functioning part of society. Sure, it's depressing that in this world there seems to be no place for good ol' Luke, but then again, I think there ain't a place for good ol' Perception de Ambiguity either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prison</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forty years ago. When I first saw this, I was completely captured by it. I was a simple soul who believed in simple situations. It was a bad time, a time of evil politicians and a bad war. This resonated, as a strong soul, casually defiant. It mattered in an affirmative way, to the emerging counterculture (what we thought was such, anyway).Twenty years ago, I saw it again and was struck by the genre nature of it. The 30's was the previous era where the powerful establishment was distrusted and people suffered as a result. In that time prison movies formed a strong genre that has all but disappeared now. But the then it was a subgenre to have an innocent, good man, often a war hero, sent to prison to suffer at the hands of the man. By simple dint of Biblical-quality goodness, he wins in some way. The viewers silently celebrate, and then left the theater to fight their own fights with the system.It struck me how similar this was to that template, and how similar the reasons. The only difference was that in the 30s the audience would be swept toward socialist ideals and in the sixties the war was against some disembodied notion of domino communism. And the genre had to be hidden by setting it in the south, then as now evoking a backward people.But I just saw it again. Since the last time I have heard Paul Newman speak of it. He is annoyed because he can see himself obviously acting. His character works when the character is acting a role ? and we see him do it. Its an unintentional fold, the sort of acting that Paul could pull off in later years, starting with "The Verdict." But because the job is bigger than his chops at the time, you can see how poorly he does when his character isn't creating a self: when he comes back to the barracks beaten. When he speaks to God. Even when he says that famous last line. He is inadequate, and the idea that a lessor self could be so attractive kept him drunk for decades.Its really not a very good movie: a collection of templates put together at the right time and striking a nerve.A pretty remarkable phenomenon. Now, I wonder, where is the modern equivalent of this film, one that seems to be about charm, but which depends on dishonest politicians who destroy us? Will it be a jail movie, or does that reference not carry the same weight today?As I write this, Paul is ill.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Essence of Cool in "Cool Hand Luke"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is one of Paul Newman's most poignant performances. Newman plays "Luke," a southern convict and loner who shines through his tough exterior, humor, and smile. The film concentrates on a chain gang set in post World War II (1940s), yet has a strong appeal towards the 1960s. Released in 1967, the film depicts modern day conflicts, which are conveyed through the camera transitions, directions, music, and screen play. The film also offers an excellent opportunity to see fine performances from Jim Jeter who played "Hans Dorfler," the blacksmith on "Little House on the Prairie," Ralph Waite and Robert Donner who played "John Walton" and "Yancy Tucker" from "The Waltons," and Morgan Woodward who portrayed the role of "Punk Anderson," (Jock Ewing's friend) on "Dallas." This is a wonderful film worth the attention of all who enjoy movies that deal with conflict, the criminal justice system, and themes from the mid-20th century.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah, I know I'm gonna get sh|t for this, but I still don't know what the hell I just watched. No pun intended, but I went into Cool Hand Luke almost completely and utterly cold. Like 98% unaware of anything about it. Yes, I knew of its communication "speech" having loved the Guns N' Roses classic Civil War (though I always thought that was a woman's voice!!), I knew of the egg eating contest and that it had Paul Newman in it. That's it. I had no idea on the setting, plot, drive, other actors, year it was set in, nothing else.And yet, I still bought the Bluray because I've heard about it my whole life and thought: well, it's a classic I must see and it was on sale and??at least I got it on sale. On the positive, it's well shot. I liked the score and the acting was believable. Paul was a looker back then, definitely. And the nice shot of male butts for a "PG" film was welcomed.But, other than that, I can't see the appeal. The main "hero," or I suppose, "anti-hero," wasn't so fun to watch. I got where his arc was going and where it had to end. Unfortunately, since that was established early, at least for me, and I kept thinking he'd finally be "cool," but wasn't, and hence, he also wasn't much interest to me. As a matter of fact, since I got Luke's storyline early on, I kept wondering about the rest of movie was about. Well, it's obvious, but not too interesting. Unrealistic, despite the year this was made. Reminded me of the musical South Pacific I saw live. Sadly, or at least not for me, I wanted to laugh out loud throughout the play?but, thought better of it since that might be considered rude to others.I wanted to laugh (at both that play and here) because I didn't believe that's how men act, no matter the timeframe or book it's based on.Surprisingly, from all I wrote above, I didn't hate the movie, I just expected more. I thought something would stand out. (Sadly, I waited the whole movie for that "female" communication speech due to hearing it most of my adult life, and it didn't have the same impact had I not been expecting it. That's not the movie's fault, however.) But nothing really did. It concluded as I thought it would, though I really hoped for something different.Enough ranting. Now, anyone want to buy a one-time used Bluray copy of this? Free shipping!</fullReview>

Paul Newman is at his best, and so is George Kennedy! Dennis Hopper holds a small part but is quite good. The movie captures you from the first minute till the last. And you are easily attached with the characters. i really want to describe many scenes that i consider magnificent, but i respect the no spoiler rule, so i would just say that the scene with the eggs is more than hilarious!! Overall, i highly recommend it obviously! For your info, unlike what others might say, this is not so much like the Great Escape. It is far more emotional and less funny!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Conjectures on What's Behind the Cool Hand</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No need after so many reviews to echo consensus points. Luke's one of the more enigmatic lead characters in movies. So, I'll try a few revealing conjectures. Newman's easy smile is a perfect cover for what Luke's thinking or what he'll do next. He seems aimless in civilian life, having found no particular purpose. Mom (Van Fleet) appears not to have been much help, with issues of her own and two fatherless boys to raise. But in the work camp, Luke appears to find some purpose? that is, by not giving a darn. He gets beaten to a pulp by Dragline (Kennedy) but keeps coming back for more, then stuffs himself with 50 eggs and drags his belly around. He seems oblivious to pain, thereby becoming something of a "cool hand" to his fellow convicts.Now, with his new reputation, he's got a purpose just by being himself. So what if he keeps getting caught while escaping, it just adds to his status. Of course, the guards do eventually manage to break him?but only temporarily. Then there's that last scene in the church, bringing him face to face with what he's sensed all along?that it's an empty, purposeless universe, with the cops waiting outside. His only recourse now is to submit once more to capture and return to who knows what kind of punishment. So, standing by the window, he's become a lonely man in a lonely world. But at least he's managed, thanks to an enraged Dragline, to strip the mask (glasses) off prison brutality and become even cooler than before. Perhaps that's why he smiles at the end.Anyway, this is just my conjecture on one of filmdom's more elusive and interesting characters. For Newman, it's a perfect piece of casting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes A movie of nothing, Can be really cool</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's probably like 100 reviews that start out with the famous quote from the movie or raving about Paul Newman. I'd like to talk about some different things with this review.Plot is simple. Paul Newman gets arrested and sent to a southern prison and refuses to conform to the prison life. It's a very bare bones film altogether. Few characters, small soundtrack (1 theme and a couple of blues songs sung by the inmates are all I remember), and a simple plot sometimes make for a boring movie. But this movie is lighthearted and enjoyable. Paul Newman and George Kennedy put on good performances along with the other cast. And that's about it. This film is more a vehicle for Paul Newman to push it than a really great movie,Overall this is a good film but nothing special. Besides acting and partly the script, its kinda an average film. But this film does have is heart and maybe that's enough to make me like. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool Hand Luke is Beyond Cool!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cool Hand Luke revolves around a unique character name Luke Jackson, who is played by Paul Newman. In short, the plot involves a small time criminal who removed heads from parking meters which resulted in him being sent to prison working on a highway road gang. Set in the sweltering heat of the South, the action is both dramatic and humorous as Luke continues his penchant for challenging authority, which is the recurring theme throughout the entire movie.Luke gets his nickname "cool hand" in a prison poker game that he wins by bluffing. When it is revealed that Luke's cards amounted to nothing, Luke responds "sometimes nothing can be a pretty cool hand." Cool Hand Luke also has an excellent supporting cast lead by George Kennedy as Dragline, Strother Martin as the Captain, and Clifton James as Carr (also known as "the floorwalker"). Their strong acting performances combined with Paul Newman make the viewer feel they can hear the crickets and the broken down fan as if they were in prison themselves.Luke through a combination of boredom and the need to challenge authority constantly does the unexpected. For example, Luke challenges a much larger Dragline to a boxing match. Dragline continues to knock Luke down, but Luke keeps getting back up to an extent that is almost painful for the audience to watch. The refusal to quit results in Dragline and Luke becoming best friends in the film. The scene where Luke bets he can eat fifty hardboiled eggs in an hour is humorous and indicative of the lengths the inmates will go to distract themselves from the grinding boredom of prison life.Additionally, the ongoing theme of challenging authority is exhibited through a series of escape sequences that ultimately result in Luke being returned in chains that helps him become a legend in the minds of his fellow prisoners. It is both funny and sad when one of Luke's escapes causes the Captain of the prison to explain, "What we got here is failure to communicate." Eventually, Luke challenges the ultimate authority, God, and is unsurprised when his prayer for a sign from goes unanswered.Cool Hand Luke has similarities to the newer movie Shawshank Redemption. Both movies deal with the theme of escape from prison life, with protagonists who become loved and respected by their fellow inmates. In contrast between the two films, Cool Hand Luke has a blue-collar feeling as Luke is an unemployed misfit, while Andy in Shawshank has a white-collar tone as he is a banker and tax accountant. Also, the Cool Hand Luke subplot is failed redemption, while Shawshank exhibits fulfilled redemption.The cinematography in Cool Hand Luke is stunning. The audience can almost smell the tar on the road resurfacing projects and the palpable fatigue of Luke digging and refilling a deep ditch. The strong backlighting and close-up camera work is present in many emotional scenes included in this movie. Also, the grainy rough film techniques give the film a gritty and sweaty tone to it, something that is expected for life in prison.If good acting, compelling storyline, and a great script are appealing, Cool Hand Luke is strongly recommended. Although prison movies can be depressing, this film takes prison life to a somewhat humorous and heroic level of a man trying to beat the system. With little to no flaws, this film is really an example of great communication, not a failure to communicate!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would honestly consider myself a film buff. I have seen many movies over the years. Even after seeing all those films I still would say that the 1967 classic film Cool Hand Luke is still one of my personal favorites. Luke Jackson is played by a great American actor Paul Newman. Luke is a funny, memorable and I think it has a "cool" storyline, and it isn't one of the films that uses a boring story line that you see in every other film, this has one of its own. I think casting for it was good, none of the actors didn't play their role well, and they all added their own little finesse to the movie. This is the type of movie I would recommend to everyone. This film covers a lot of genres, from comedy to drama to action. Cool Hand Luke is a movie I've watched many times, and will definitely watch many more times.This film has had some films that have attempted the plot once or twice but none are able to match up with the Stuart Rosenberg original</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tough And Honest Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cool Hand Luke is a prison drama that features Paul Newman in the title role together with George Kennedy, Strother Martin, J.D. Cannon and Morgan Woodward. The screenplay was adapted by Donn Pearce and Frank Pierson from Pearce's novel of the same title.It was directed by Stuart Rosenberg.Luke Jackson is sentenced to a stretch on a southern chain gang after he's arrested for drunkenly decapitating parking meters. While the avowed ambition of the captain is for each prisoner to "get their mind right," it soon becomes obvious that Luke is not about to kowtow to anybody. When challenged to a fistfight by fellow inmate Dragline, Luke simply refuses to give up, even though he's brutally beaten. Luke knows how to win at poker, even with bad cards, by using his smarts and playing it cool. Luke also figures out a way for the men to get their work done in half the usual time, giving them the afternoon off. Finally, when Luke finds out his mother has died, he plots his escape; when he's caught, he simply escapes again. Soon, Luke becomes a symbol of hope and resilience to the other men in the prison camp and a symbol of rebelliousness that must be stamped out to the guards and the captain.Paul Newman gives one of the defining performances of his career, and cemented his place as a beautiful-rebel screen icon playing the stubbornly tough and independent title character in Cool Hand Luke.Along with stellar performances by Newman, Kennedy, and Martin, Cool Hand Luke features a superb supporting cast.And before he became familiar as a sidekick in 1970s disaster movies such as Earthquake and the Airport movie, George Kennedy won an Oscar for playing Dragline, the brutal chain-gang boss who tries to beat loner Luke's cool out of him. It's a classic rebel-against-the-repressive-institution story in the line of One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest or The Shawshank Redemption.A tough, honest film with backbone to say the least.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Sometimes Nothing Is a Real Cool Hand"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Luke, played by Paul Newman, is a one of a kind character constructed solely of free will and originality. A man like this is a shining light for others who obtain the pleasure of meeting such a refreshing spirit. The inmates of Division of Road Corrections Number 36 received an opportunity to live vicariously through such a natural born world- shaker. This drama classic takes place in the 1960s Deep South, where brutal encounters between a chain gang and "the man" with no genuine values of mankind occur. Luke brings his winning smile and lucky-go- attitude to make the best of the hell he finds himself in. Once in a while, a nonconforming personality is just what this chain gang facility needs to break up repetitive routines the strict warden enforces on a diverse group of felonious young men.Serving time is an age-old event for individuals to work out what to do with that time. It can merely slip by, or what Luke portrayed, exist in the moment. The ultimate freedom, answering to nobody but yourself, is a high price to pay. Once one becomes a number in the system, beautiful wings are removed and one turns in to property of the state. Sequentially, this produces a whole slew of dilemmas, which must be tackled or swallow one's pride to survive another day. Learning these character defects can be quite difficult to the defiant man, but rest assured those demons will eventually catch up with this careless lifestyle. Watching rehabilitation of deceitful men fifty years ago will have one silencing his cell phone and glued to his sofa right through to the end. Passing this original classic down to the next generation is a must to keep this film alive. Understandably, Paul Newman states "Cool Hand Luke" was the finest script he had ever read. May he rest in peace, Paul Newman. All viewers should make time to enjoy a timeless classic of this caliber.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You got yo mind right, Luke?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think it's safe to say Paul Newman helped define the contemporary American male that emerged between WW2 and the androgynous 60's (most of which occurred on a mass, mainstream level in the 70's). A transformation that morphed the male ideal to one of feminine beauty. But in between the laconic, rugged individualist (Gary Cooper, Humphrey Bogart, John Wayne) and the cute, physically non-threatening boy toy (David Cassidy, Paul McCartney, Mick Jagger) was the charismatic outsider (Marlon Brando, James Dean, Paul Newman): beguiling yet dangerous, clean cut yet anti-authoritarian--refusing to give in to the societal polemic that demanded conformity. And this post-modern male persona, established in many movies (ON THE WATERFRONT, FROM HERE TO ETERNITY, REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE to name only three) was perhaps best exemplified in the movie COOL HAND Luke.We fall in love with Luke during the opening scene, I think: The utter stupidity of a grown man, drunk &amp; alone, cutting off heads of parking meters is, well, damn satisfying to watch. There's something Dostoevskian about it (from NOTES FROM THE UNDERGROUND: "What about the millions of facts that show that men, deliberately and in full knowledge of what their real interests were, spurned them and rushed in a different direction? They did so at their own risk. . .refusing to follow the safe, well-trodden path and searching for another path, a difficult one, stubbornly working their way along it in the darkness). And our love of Luke is sealed?after he opens the beer he'll never drink?at the beginning on that beautiful freeze-frame of him laughing at life: her struggles, her injustices, her seeming insistence that we conform, or else.And that is also why we loved Paul Newman. He deflected (or more accurately Fast Eddie, Luke, Butch, &amp; Henry Gondorf did) the slings and arrows life through at him with a grin and a twinkle in his eye that couldn't help but win us over to his side. We are so rooting for Luke to connect with his mother, to escape the chain gang, to achieve the miraculous feat of eating 50 eggs. And speaking of miracles, you may or may not know that this movie is a retelling of the story of Jesus (complete with disciples, miracles, persecution, doubt, prayer, crucifixion, and resurrection).The last image we see is of a photo in a magazine Luke had sent the chain gang showing him living the good life. When they find out the picture is a phony and that Luke is not the man they thought he was, Dragline rips it up. At the end of the movie, the photo has been resurrected: the repaired rips forming a Cross after faith in Luke has been restored. But however you chose to interpret COOL HAND Luke, it is Paul Newman whom we ultimately respond to. With all the lives he impacted, he was--on and off the screen--one of the quintessential American males of his times. I mean, think about it. Is there anything more irrelevant than a movie star? Has there ever been a movie star more relevant than Paul Newman? He was a natural born world-shaker.</fullReview>

Luke is a strong willed, humorous and colorful fellow who is not afraid to challenge anyone. The film is almost a Biblical tale of the last years of Jesus Christ's ministry from the New Testament.

		<shortDescription>Plastic Jesus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another modern analogy of a Christ like martyr. He is a philosophical prisoner of the establishment sacrificing himself and showing "the way" to the downtrodden and the social rejects.Some of the symbolism is heavy handed, like the crucifying position on the supper table and the "disciples" living from the shedding of "His" blood. But generally it is portrayed as nothing more than a depression era depiction of the system corrupting the spirit and the soul of the less fortunate looking for light to brighten the darkness.He did shake up the world the "old man" put him in, but whether he made a difference beyond the boundaries of the box is left up to us. What is clear is the communication of consent was indeed a failure. Was he a messianic man or just a plastic Jesus?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can see why in the old days the crime rate was lower, if this film represents the prison system. This is a powerful movie, and maintains an entertaining pace throughout. The beginning, the egg scene and the boxing match, make it a classic. The Newman, Kennedy, and Glasses characters will never be forgotten. In conclusion, a 30 year old film that still entertains, is a true piece of Americana.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In My top 10 movies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just recently started watching Paul Newman's movies and this one was an great start! It's my 7th favorite movie and my 2nd favorite Paul Newman movie (the first being The Color of Money). I was suprised when I looked on the Awards list and saw it hadn't any oscars but Best Supporting Actor, Which George Kennedy fully deserved. What was perhaps best was his subtle spiritual side. Throughout the movie his is either ranting at God, or taking a more subliminal approach, like how he was positioned on the table after eating fifty eggs, which I thought was the funniest part. Paul Newman usually did more ahead of it's time movies in the sixties, such as the Hustler, which was maybe a little ahead of it's time. I think the same way about Cool Hand Luke, and they still did a perfect job. When I first sat down to watch Cool Hand Luke, I was expecting a dry, boring movie, but I was pleasantly surprised! This is an excellent movie that got it's deserved credibility, and will always be one of my favorites! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic film, Paul Newman is great, George Kennedy won an oscar.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A motley crew of prisoners, living in a deep south prison dormitory with strict rules, and working on the roads 5 days a week, "Cool Hand Luke" is a great character study of prisoners. Newman plays Luke, who is in for "cutting heads off parking meters." During a poker game early in the film, when Luke wins the hand with 'nothing' but a good bluff, he says, "Sometimes nothing can be a real cool hand." Thus the name of the movie.George Kennedy plays 'Dragline', the large, tough guy who can't read, and who befriends Luke after their fight. It appears that he simply has a lot of respect for Luke, who isn't intimidated by anything, even prison. I just saw "Chicken Run", and Luke's approach is like "Ginger's" - escape, get caught, get thrown into solitary, then back to the prison yard, then escape again.The first escape, sawed a hole in the dorm floor and slipped out at night. The second, got permission to go behind a bush to relieve himself then ran for it. The third, after becoming totally 'compliant', he drives off in a state truck after retrieving the snapping turtle just shot by one of the guards. This film also coined the familiar phrase, "What we have here is a failure to communicate", after Luke's second capture. Then , at the end, when they had him cornered for a third time, in the church doorway, he repeats the line to the cops, with a big grin, then he gets shot, and dies in the police car on the long ride back to the prison hospital.There is a short ending scene, the crew working near the church, and Dragline telling them that's where he and Luke got caught. Luke in his death became a legend to them, the prisoner who wouldn't accept his plight.The film also has lots of humor. During the first escape, the police car comes back, they solemly open the trunk, and pick up a lifeless bloodhound, "run to death chasing Luke" who still had not been caught. During a day digging roadside ditches, the prisoners are treated agonizingly to a cute blonde bimbo in a gauze dress washing her car right in front of them, praying that the one safety pin holding her dress over her busom would pop open. Then there was the bet that Luke couldn't eat 50 boiled eggs in one hour, including the second-by-second countdown with only one egg to go!If I were rating this film in 1967 when it came out (and my college graduation year), I'd probably give it a 9 or 10. Today, comparing it to so many great films of the past 20 years or so, I rate it a solid "8" of 10. Paul Newman is such a good actor, you almost forget he is acting. The whole film reminded me also of the fairly recent "Life" with Eddie Murphy, a movie that also focuses on the lives of the prisoners in prison.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paul Newman as a "plastic Jesus"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although in this age of "director's cuts," it's not as true as it once was, one of the most appealing aspects of film is that it is unchanging. The "Cool Hand Luke" that I recently saw on video is, with the exception of the widescreen aspect ratio that was lost in the panning and scanning, the same movie I saw several times in theaters in the late 1960s. I, however, have changed, and see things in "Cool Hand Luke" that I hadn't noticed before.What really stands out are the allusions to Jesus Christ. Ol' Luke, the decorated war veteran who never rose above the rank of private and is now serving a two year sentence on a Southern chain gang, is apparently meant by director Stuart Rosenberg to be a Christ figure. After the contest in which Luke downs 50 hard-boiled eggs, he is photographed lying on his back on the table, his legs outstretched and legs crossed in such a way as to suggest the way Jesus is depicted on the crucifix. Later, Luke moans his way through the song "Plastic Jesus" while accompanying himself on the banjo. At the end, the photo of Luke with two beautiful women that his fellow cons ripped in half after learning it was a fake, is shown taped back together and superimposed over an intersection in the road--a cross. I assume that the repaired photo is meant to suggest a resurrection in the sense that the cons believe in him once more. "Luke is detached and indifferent," Paul Newman is quoted as saying on the back cover of the video, "but he can't beat the system he scoffs at." Perhaps the religious symbolism in the film is meant to suggest that Luke, though providing his fellow cons with a vicarious taste of freedom through his repeated escapes, is no savior at all. He is merely a "plastic Jesus" just like the one in the song.Whatever the imagery is meant to suggest, "Cool Hand Luke" remains an excellent and thoroughly satisfying film. Paul Newman's performance is one of his best, and the rest of the cast (including such then obscure actors like Wayne Rogers, Ralph Waite, Dennis Hopper, and Harry Dean Stanton) is excellent. And let's not forget that terrific score by Lalo Schifren.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"For with God, nothing shall be impossible." - Luke 1:37</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lucas Jackson is sent to prison after cutting off parking meter heads while drunk one night. Upon entering the prison, he eventually gains respect from his peers because of his laid-back, cool attitude and his unrelenting fighting spirit even when he has nothing. Thus, he receives his nickname "Cool Hand Luke" by winning a round of five card stud with a hand of nothing and a few bluffs delivered with such cool ease.I can talk about Paul Newman's spectacular performance all I want-- about his perfect execution as this non-conformist in a prison camp-- but what makes this film special to me is something more than the terrific acting and interesting storyline. That something, which hits home to me, is the idea of spirituality.One who is well-versed in the story of Jesus knows that His story and Luke's share many similarities (after the egg eating, make sure to look at how he lays on the table). The question of spirituality then, in my case, is the most powerful message of the movie. "Does God exist?" Luke questions numerous times. By the end of the movie, Luke gets his answer (you'll have to watch it to see what he finally figures out). In this way, he and I, two men both on the same road trying to figure out 'what of God?', are alike. I relate to Luke and to this film. And to relate so personally with a film or character or for either to have such an affect on me is an achievement in a film's own right. The power and the message effectively conveyed to evoke the audience's emotions makes a film great in my book.There's more to it than that though, I'm afraid. There is more reason to watch this classic than being able to relate to this flawed, yet surprisingly admirable character, whether it is his beliefs or character with which you relate or admire.The acting by Paul Newman and George Kennedy is superb. I apologize for mentioning it once more but I have to reiterate Paul's effective portrayal of Luke. I just can't let an amazing performance fly under the radar when I list reasons for watching films, though I realize one can make his or her own judgement and can easily spot a terrific performance. Paul Newman is among my top four favorite actors and number one still living. Every time I watch one of his films, I do not think of him as Paul Newman, but of his characters. He makes Luke seem so appealing, heroic, strong... very admirable traits indeed. And George as Dragline, the leader of the pack before Luke comes in and an idolizer of him upon learning of his sheer determination. Both of them perfect.On top of it all, many scenes from "Cool Hand Luke" remain so vividly memorable. The egg eating, the church, Boss Kean's ditch... and of course, "What we've got here is a failure to communicate." I recommend this film to absolutely everyone and anyone. Watch Newman in one of best films portraying one of the greatest movie characters. That old Luke smile will charm you, make you feel good, shake up your world. No doubt, the classic "Cool Hand Luke" is not something to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched Cool Hand Luke as part of my Existential philosophy class I was taking this past spring. While I had heard of the movie, I never took the time to watch it before this class. What a great movie with a lot of symbolism. I watched this movie and immediately saw the character of Luke as Freidrich Nietzsche might have seen him, an overman type that had come as close as maybe anyone to using his own "will to power" if you will. While I am a fan of Nietzsche, I also saw other points of other philosophers as well, even Nietzsche's opposite Kierkegaard and others like Heidegger and Camus. Maybe this movie was intended to be philosophical and maybe it wasn't, but I enjoyed it either way and recommend it to anyone regardless of their feelings of life or philosophy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely Boring, Slow-Moving, Disjointed, Histrionic, Episodic Movie with Lots of In-Your-Face Playacting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this movie was a massive letdown for me. It was supposed to be a gem of American cinematography -- instead, what we've got here is a failure to enjoy even a few minutes of it. I'm sorry, but the direction seemed particularly weak to me -- and only afterwards, I learned that this was Stuart Rosenberg's directorial debut. Oh heavens, but it showed! It took me literally four attempts to get through this turgid movie; it couldn't possibly be moving slower; there is no clear narrative line -- only disjointed episodes, and once you've seen the first 5 of them, you know that the remaining two dozen or so will be just more of the same.This movie is affectation from start to finish. Sorry, I did not see it as realistic -- rather, as a movie *playing a game* called "Let's be brutally realistic." But that's exactly what's wrong: you can see, the whole time, that this is just a movie *affecting* realism. The actors appearing here, led by the super-handsome Paul Newman, are *not* real prisoners. Sorry, but they're just too clean-cut, their hairstyles are more admirable than this reviewer's hairstyle has ever been... and when Paul Newman is supposed to look disheveled, you can see that it's just make-up artists at work.Imagine an ugly actor playing the part of Luke -- would this movie have been such a huge hit? I'm certain it wouldn't; Newman carries the movie on his shoulders, with his boyish charm, yet he is just as affected as everyone else.The most annoying character, to me, was the one played by George Kennedy. Sorry, I couldn't picture Kennedy as a real prisoner for a single minute. He was an *actor* playing a prisoner -- that's all. I just didn't buy his portrayal and couldn't buy it, no matter how much I strove to suspend my disbelief. Awarding an Oscar for such a histrionic performance is something I can't possibly fathom -- perhaps, as sometimes happens with Oscars, it was awarded to Kennedy as a summary appreciation for all of his work in all his other previous movies.There is no doubt that _Cool Hand Luke_ features lots of great actors -- so the blame for the movie's failure to impress must be assigned to the director. It's primarily the director's job to ensure that actors don't fall into that trap of appearing to be just theatrical actors, not real persons.Don't get me wrong: it wasn't the movie's unsavory milieu that put me off. Although I'm no fan of prison movies, I have great regard for a true classic like _The Shawshank Redemption_; I also quite enjoyed Stanley Kramer's similarly themed (prison escape) _The Defiant Ones_, or _The Green Mile_ with Tom Hanks. But no matter how much I tried, and how much I appreciate Paul Newman as an actor, I just couldn't enjoy _Cool Hand Luke_ one bit.Oh yes, _Cool Hand Luke_ features a classic quotation about the failure to communicate -- but one such catchphrase is not enough to rescue such a monumental bore of 2 hours' length. If one wished to be sarcastic, one might say the catchphrase is so good because, as the screenwriter admitted, it appeared "subconsciously" in his mind as he was writing the script -- without him intending to use the phrase at all. Seeing as those things that the movie's creators apparently *did* intend to accomplish, didn't pan out, it's probably good he did not intend to create a classic catchphrase -- because that conscious intention would probably have misfired like the rest of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazed At How Few Oscar Nominations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every time I watch this film it amazes me how few Academy Award nominations it received. Although it got the nods for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor (George Kennedy - win). It did't receive any other nominations. How it missed out on Best Picture, Best Director and Best Cimenatography is amazing. There are so many great camera shots. The one that stands out the most is after the "Walking Boss", "the man with no eyes", as Kennedy's character says, shoots the snake Luke is holding up in his hand. The camera moves to a close-up of the Boss' mirrored sun glasses and we can see and hear Luke talking in them. The religious symbolisms are many. Just to name a few; Luke spread out just like Jeasus after easting the eggs, the scene when Luke talks to God in the bad storm and even the way the roads form crosses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool Hand Luke: One of Hollywood's Greatest Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"What we have here is failure to communicate"So says the captain about the inmate called "Cool Hand Luke" in the film of the same name. In the movie, Paul Newman plays a man who lives in a small town. He personifies the very individualistic mindset.Having nothing to do and no friends, Luke (Newman) decides to do a little drinking while cutting the heads off of parking meters. When confronted by the police, Luke acts like he is drunk (either he is actually acting or he actually is drunk) and finds his way into prison .Once in prison, Luke joins a chain gang. All goes well and, despite a rough start, the inmates begin to like him. He even makes a friend in the form of Dragline, an illiterate man played by George Kennedy. Luke is just about to get out of the prison. Then fate deals him a bad hand.Luke learns about his mother's death. In his sorrow, Luke breaks out of prison, only to be caught. He escapes again, only to be caught and beaten. Then, he takes a prison truck and escapes along with Dragline, only to be shot by a very accurate prison guard.This film comments on society's treatment of the individual. In the beginning of the film, Luke's attitude equals the epitome of self sufficiency. He is a loner who considers rules and regulations, as he puts it in the scene with the famous "Night in the Box" speech, "nothin' worth listenin' to." As he lives on in the prison, his attitude of I don't need you frustrates the prison officials who try to get his "mind right" repeatedly. They take their dismay, and persist in doing this despite it's lack of effectiveness, to the point that they beat Luke. Luke fights them at every turn. They lie and beat him, showing this most sadistically in a scene where they tell Luke to get his dirt out of the captain's ditch. They make him get the dirt out, then complain about the unavoidable effect of having that dirt on the lawn when he is done. He has to put the dirt back in. Right after that, he is forced to take the dirt back out again. This cycle continues until Luke reaches the point where he lashes out in frustration, only to be beaten to the point where he falls into the ditch. He comes back out, wrapping his arms around the nearest guard, crying about how his mind is now right.Then there is the climactic scene with Lukein a church. Dragline comes in and tries to get Luke to give up peaceably. Here, Dragline represents society's desire to get everyone to just mindlessly conform to its ways. Luke refuses, and ironically gets shot. This shooting is interesting if nothing else for the fact that the authorities not only have no reason to believe Luke is armed, but also for the fact that he gets shot for impersonating a prison official. Luke's soul has refused to conform to society's rules and ends up needing to get extinguished.Thus, "Cool Hand Luke" becomes a comment on society. Luke dislikes the need of his fellow inmates to latch onto him so tightly. Luke dislikes rules, becoming a non-conformist. Society has constantly tried to extinguish the non-conformists. Examples include the Civil Rights Movement, the Feminist Movement, and the homosexuals. Like them, Luke is also a non-conformist. Like them, society clashes with Luke. Like them, society tries to kill Luke. Too bad society has not learned to deal with other people's views.</fullReview>

The titled character (Paul Newman in an Oscar-nominated role) gets sent to prison and does not wish to conform to any of the rules and regulations. He gives his fellow inmates a glimmer of hope and dignity, but at what cost? Oscar-winner George Kennedy is the greatest asset of this film as he steals every scene as the leader of the prisoners who tangles and then comes to love Newman's character like a brother. A good film, but not Newman's best and not near as great as some would lead the audience to be. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Cool Hand Luke" is a classic cult film. Lots of people love it and it's ranked very high in the IMDb Top 100 list. While I, too, like the film I can't say I am quite as sold on the film as the crowd--I think it's very, very good but wonder if perhaps it's a tad overrated. But, there certainly is a lot to like about it as well.Let's first talk about the good. The acting is exceptional. The fellow chain gang members are made up of LOTS of very familiar faces--as is like a Who's Who of character actors. Additionally, the stars of the film (George Kennedy and especially Paul Newman) are great--and at the top of their game. Additionally, the writing and especially the dialog are great. But, the writing, while very, very good also left me a bit cold at the end with its vague ending. Additionally, the film is very episodic and seemed a bit disjoint. Still, it is a heck of a good film--and one that probably would appeal most to guys (I have NEVER met a woman who loved the film, though I am sure there are plenty who will read this and take exception).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm Italian and I've see that in the film summary the year of the production is not correct because "Cool Hand Luke" is of 1976 and not of 1967...But this is a very good film and Paul Newman is once of my favorite actors. An American classic, Cool Hand Luke (1967) is as much a product of its time as any important movie ever made. CHL marks the beginning of the end of the cycle of American movies about rebels standing up to authority. In many ways it is the apotheosis of such movies, providing in one fell swoop both one of the most appealing of the rebels, while at the same time fundamentally questioning whether the "establishment" is at all vulnerable to rebellion. It is, at its core, a pessimistic film... pessimistic about the possibility of justice, of reform, and of individualism. In the end Luke dies for his sins, and to an outside observer, his reification as a folk legend among a small band of convicts seems like a hollow victory at best. (Although obviously, the parallel to the founding of Christianity is striking.)</fullReview>

Luke is the favorite of all the inmates because of his resilient spirit, but the warden and his chief guard with his mirror sun glasses remain determined to break him. Methods such as the warden ordering Luke to make a hole in the ground which Luke does, when he is done the warden asked him "What is this dirt doing here? Put it in the hole!"; then when the hole is filled the warden asks him why is there dirt in his hole and makes him dig the hole again. A really annoying warden. Luke ends up dead, because he would rather die than change. Famous quote: "What we have here is failure to communicate!" Men tend to like this movie more than women do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those films I managed to not see for decades. When I finally saw it recently, I was left at quite a loss. What is it that draws people to watch bored characters make themselves into losers for no good reason? In Cool Hand Luke, the main character, Luke, played by Paul Newman, ends up in prison for a short sentence he earned by destroying public property (parking meters). For anyone with any shred of common sense, serving the short sentence would be enough. Get in, get out, lesson learned.But, to make the story interesting, Luke manages to create friction where there was none, for no good reason other than tendency to self-destruct. He is not an anti-conformist, not very smart, and not really having much of a goal. He is healthy, and perfectly capable of earning a living. But he decides to go down in flames, albeit with questionable style. I found it torturing to watch dumb character doing dumb things. In few instances we see Luke trying to talk to God, but the "conversation" is lacking, uninspiring and pointless. Those moments make Luke sound like a spoiled, self-absorbed, angry teen.Perhaps the book's author and filmmakers would like to believe that Cool Hand Luke is a story about someone who was wronged, or searching for God, or inspiring others to be different, but it is none of those. This film falls flat on its face in all departments, and earns only high marks for its shallowness and decent performances. For a truly great story about anti-conformism, one should watch One Flew Over The Cuckoo's nest. Cool Hand Luke is nowhere near that.All in all, this depressing, pointless story is the best way to ruin your evening. I gave it 2 stars only for Paul Newman's performance, otherwise, it would be a firm zero.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do you know (and do you care?) that this highly-praised, much-beloved, "Rebel-Without-A-Cause" prison picture is actually a bit of a Bible story in disguise? It's true! With deliberate intent, director Stuart Rosenberg saw to it that Newman's Lucas Jackson character was viewed as being something of a Christ figure. That's right. Throughout the story Lucas was portrayed as being an anti-hero saint who first wins over his fellow man and then is ultimately crucified.After Lucas wins the egg-eating bet this Christ-like persona is made even more apparent when he is left lying out on the table in the position of Christ at crucifixion. As well, Luke sings the little ditty "Plastic Jesus" after learning of his mother's death. And near the end of the film Luke "talks" to God. This moment was meant to evoke the conversation that supposedly took place between Christ &amp; God at the Garden of Gethsemane.All-in-all - I found this whole religious angle to the story to be very unwelcome. To me, Lucas was nothing but an apathetic loser who deserved to go to prison for foolishly cutting the heads off of dozens of parking meters. And this religiousness just rendered this 1967, Florida, chain-gang picture as being even more of a dim-witted dud than it already was.As I understand it, Cool Hand Luke is considered by many to be a glowing, glittering gem of classic, American film-making. But, hey, that's certainly not how it struck me! Cool Hand Luke was, pretty much, just an over-long tale about an unlikable, smirking loser. Its underlying message was as pretentious as a frickin' plastic crucifix.Containing endless "filler" scenes that were clearly meant to showcase its big-name star, Paul Newman, this picture seemed to be more interested in giving the viewer endless opportunities to admire our star's baby-blue eyes, rather than anything else.Personally, I thought that, at 42, Newman was way too old for his part.It struck me as really peculiar that throughout the story it was repeatedly insinuated that Newman's character was a very complicated individual. But, time &amp; again, I never learnt anything worthwhile about him, at all.I also found this film had a really annoying tendency to deliberately warp the rules of morality. This was particularly so when it came to the belligerent conduct of the prisoners and their clear defiance and disrespect of those in the position of authority.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bilko in prison!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Cool Hand Luke' is an odd film in terms of tone: on one had, it serves as a kind of prototype for 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest', a story of individual free spirit being worn down by authority; on the other hand, there are times when it seems like a remake of 'Seargent Bilko'. A group of prisoners work on a chain gang, one of whom (Luke, played by Paul Newman in what is not his greatest performance) refuses to bow down to the system. But at first, he is not especially defiant and his antics seem more like pranks, played to test his own character and to give him something to do, but there's never a sense that too much is riding on them; and the soundtrack seems to emphasise the comic over the grave. Then his mother dies, he attempts to escape, the guards turn nasty and eventually he is engaged in a fight for his life and integrity. The disconnected nature of the two halves of the film means that neither is especially effective; some scenes are entertaining but the whole does not cohere, and Luke seems too simplistically nice to really convince as a prison hard-man. It's still fun to watch, especially for the famous egg-eating episode.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I still don't understand what the point of it was. Paul Newman plays the "cool" Luke who's sent to a prison to serve time for a night of drunken mayhem. He soon gains the admiration of most of the inmates just for being "cool", nothing else. He escapes, repeatedly, and is caught, repeatedly. That's about it. There's a long list of well-known actors in this, but that's about the only good thing I can say about it. See "Shawshank Redemption, 1994" or "Bad Boys, 1983" instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one pretentious movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I stumbled upon Cool Hand Luke while watching Spike Lee's 25th Hour (2002). In a scene with the main protagonist the poster for Cool Hand Luke hanged on the wall. Knowing how carefully the directors choose these details and being sort of movie buff myself, i wanted to see it. Needles to say, it's position on IMDb Top 250 movies of all time was an additional motivation.Up to a point this movie confirmed my expectations. On the one hand, the main protagonists of Cool Hand Luke and 25th Hour are hardheaded guys who don't fear going against the grain. On the other hand, this is where any similarity or any possible symbolism end.Luke is a type of guy who hits the wall, doesn't learn form that mistake and goes hitting the wall again. And the audience should feel sympathetic, because the wall is so mean to Luke. Not sure what the intentions of the authors were...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An American movie (of those years)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A repetitive and uninteresting narrative about a pretty uninteresting guy who just seem to be stubbornly and stolidly provocative, without much interest for his own health, to the point of becoming hyperbolic and unrealistic in many places, or at least to lose all sympathy by the viewer.The way the movie starts is the right promise for the entire movie: random incidents that put to test his endurance and show off his hard head. The ending is in no way more telling, it actually just looks like a way to escape the storyline which by that time had pretty much nothing else to say. If you put the movie in the historical context of the years it came out, you can understand it might have had an appeal, but that appeal is pretty dumb to meA few nice touches are blues musical references here and there.Otherwise boring storyline and annoying Paul Newman</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "Hogan's Heroes" of prison movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Neither the prison, nor Luke's decision to try to escape from it, makes much sense and, for me, that spoils the rest of the movie.NOW, I don't think it's any fun to be on a prison road gang, nor to spend any time in prison, no matter what the conditions. But up until the first time Luke tries to escape, it seems that, as a prison goes, this one is pretty mellow -- all the prisoners seem to get along, the guards (while clearly not nice guys) don't seem to bother anyone who follows the rules and, while you spend your days doing awful road work, everyone still seems to have lots of free time to play cards, strum the guitar, sing, have silly egg-eating bets (apparently it's no big deal to have the cook prepare 50 eggs to settle a bet) and chat. In many respects the place comes across as a really really strict summer camp. Even when Luke is put "in the box" after his mother dies, it seems unpleasant but not horrific.So all-in-all the prison feels a little too much like Stalag 17 on Hogan's Heroes -- where the camp seemed like a pretty mellow place to pass the war.Therefore, given that Luke seems to fit in well with his fellow prisoners and that he ONLY HAS A TWO YEAR SENTENCE, it seems a complete surprise when he makes a run for it. Part of the surprise is that Luke doesn't seem like an idiot (why run when you haven't got a lot of time left), nor are we shown or told of any frustration to get out that he's feeling.Now, of course, I don't believe that prisons were or are anywhere near resembling the relatively tolerable world we're shown here. And once Luke does start bucking the system, I believe what happens. But I find it hard to believe the central character's initial motives when there doesn't seem to be much to be running from and, from what we know of his backstory, he's got nothing in particular that he's running to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jon Monsarrat review: depressing and slow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think I get it. Like "A Simple Plan" and "Leaving Las Vegas", Cool Hand Luke is a well-done well-acted, fantastic film that will send you into a bleak depression. The theme basically is that if you're pig-headed and do stupid things, life will smack you around.How much cooler Luke might have been if his unflappable pig-headedness had been aimed in the right direction by some brains. Maybe he would never have ended up in prison. That made it hard for me to identify with the protagonist.So I think I get it, but in 40 years films have seen a lot more pizazz. The pace was pretty slow and I have to admit I was bored. Unlike One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest there isn't a lot of colorful personalities or plot twists, it's pretty straightforward.Who should see this film:-- People who love classics only.-- It isn't safe for people like me who are curious but don't normally go for classics if they're too arty. See "One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest" or "Catch-22" instead.Since I use ratings to decide what to see, I think they should reflect the impact a film has today, not when it first came out. I'm sorry, I felt Cool Hand Luke was aging and will give it a 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe I missed the point of two hours of shirtless, sweaty men doing the same things over and over again. Perhaps the 23-minute (I wasn't exactly counting) egg eating scene had some sort of life-altering resonance. But I'm wagering the filmmakers had a bet as to how long they could show a grown man eating a particular foodstuff before people started trying to slit their wrists with the thin edge of their movie tickets. Watch the movie in fast-forward and you'll get the gist, and miss none of the nuance. (Alternate title: "Rebel Without a Competent Editor.")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't get this film at all, man.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems like Paul Newman was trying to outdo Steve McQueen in 'The Great Escape'.Both actors competed for similar roles.Acting is decent, but honestly Newman was much better in other movies like 'The Sting', 'Butch Cassidy', etc.The script was what hurt this film.Scene after scene goes nowhere. The writers should have focused on plot development, but it's so straight forward.Newman gets captured and beaten. Escapes. Gets captured and beaten. Escapes. Gets shot in the end and dies. How remarkable is that?He eats 50 eggs. So what?He plays the banjo when his mom dies. So what?He prays to God in the end and winks. So what?The only good scene (and there were almost none) is the poker game where he bluffs that he had a hand. I kid you not: This is the only good scene.The same people who love 'Pulp Fiction' would love this film. They've been brainwashed into thinking this is a great film. ('Back to the Future' is so uncool, but 'Cool Hand Luke' is rad, man!')</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good rebel movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very good movie about a lost suicidal rebel in a southern USA chain gang setting.Production style is ahead of it's time setting a trend for more of the same later on in late 60's all through 70's,particularly the cinematography and directing styles.The Luke character here is a good representation of failures of the Justice system,incarcerating an obviously traumatised war veteran instead of more suitable Psychiatric/social treatments.Still,a lack a clear statement in the movie leaves too much room for different interpretations which may lead to a true clear message which the story's atmosphere demands.If not for this indirectness,this movie would have made the highest classic rating I can give for a drama......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All About Losers.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently shown on cable tv I had in my mind this was meant to be a "classic". The tale is of a man put in prison and trying to escape. The 'good guys' are the prisoners; the 'bad ones' of course the gaolers. Try to convince the victims of such criminals that such a scenario is justified. Not only is this picture extremely dated, and it shows, but the movie is wholly unconvincing. And quite frankly, Paul Newman in the lead gives a performance of utter blandness. The most laughable thing about this picture is how the likes of the individual who wrote the headline comment here (titled 'the evangelist') can write such twaddle and pretentious nonsense. Surely he must be joking? Lets face it this movie is about losers and will appeal to the like-minded. 2 out of 10.</fullReview>
