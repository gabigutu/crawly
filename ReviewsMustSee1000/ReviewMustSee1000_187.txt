		<shortDescription>Sick of people writing things that make no sense !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I went to see this movie, just left as a matter of fact and I think the movie was very well done. For the people saying that the movie was anti-climatic, what was the climax supposed to be ? We all know how it ends, or should they have added more to the story for dramatic effect so we could then talk about how fake it was, and how it didn't really happen that way ? They told it the way it happened It seems that many people are forgetting that this was a movie about someone's life, not somethingfabricated or concocted simply for the purpose of entertainment. It is supposed to tell a story,his story and if you are a true fan of B.I.G. then that should be the reason you went to see it. What good would that have done to his legacy to fill the movie up with speculation about who did what, if anything it just would have reignited the war between east and west for trying to implicate people in the shooting. The purpose was to show that behind the persona of Big Poppa was a real person, a person that loved and was loved by many people. Honestly its silly to be upset about the fact that it doesn't tell you who shot Pac, or B.I.G.,why diminish from the memory of either by using Biggie's life story to speculate on something that no one but those responsible, knows the answer to ? Also Pac, though I am a huge fan of his music as well, is just a supporting character, this movie wasn't about him, it was about Christopher Wallace, the man, the son, the father and the husband. I get sick of people making comments with no basis or foundation. Of cours things are going to be left out, it's inevitable,seeing as how you can't fit 24 years of someone's life into 2 hours of film, they put in the parts that were relevant to the story of how he came up, his brief career which introduced him to us all, and his tragic ending. I for one was touched, I bobbed my head, I laughed, I reminisced and I cried, and for 1 movie to evoke that many emotions, I say it's a job well done. I for one think B.I.G would be proud, so if you are one of those people that don't even like rap music, then here's some advice:don't even post a comment, better yet don't go see the movie, keep your negative comments to yourself. For those that loved B.I.G he was special to us, and deserving of his story being told just like anybody else who has left us and had their story touch our lives. He left a void, and hip-hop hasn't been the same since he left us. I loved the movie, and would gladly pay my $6.50 to see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never was a fan until now</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in the 90's as a teen, I never really got in to Biggie's music or lyrics. I never knew the correlation between he and all these artists like "Puff Daddy" Faith Evans, Lil Kim all came up together. I never understood how the East Coast West Coast feud got started.This film gave me a new respect for Christopher Wallace. His intelligence and how he tied that in to his passion for music and lyrics. He had a dream as a child and in the end he achieved that dream of not just becoming a success as a performer, but a success as a father to his children, a good son to his mom, and a good man to himself.I love that line in the move "If you wanna change the world, First you've got to change yourself"Inspirational film, even if you're not a fan of his music or hip hop, you can still appreciate the story behind this man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Looks good and covers a lot of ground but doesn't work as a dramatic film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opinion on IMDb on this film seems to be pretty split and the reason appears to be because many are not writing their opinions of the film so much as they are reviewing Biggie and/or hip-hop itself. So the unquestioning 10* reviews rave about the man and his music, while the 1* reviews talk more about the aspects of the music and culture he represents than they do about the film. I was curious to see what the film was like on its own merits so I made an effort to see it recently. The truth of the matter that the film is "ok" but not anything more than that ? and I say that as a hip-hop listener who likes more east coast than west coast.The problem with the film is that it is far to driven by ticking boxes of people and events. As a result it doesn't flow so much as it does introduce people and things in a way that the audience will recognise. This is all well and good but it breaks up the film as a dramatic piece ? for example with Lil' Kim, she is not allowed to just be part of the story, no, when she is introduced we even get a shot of her name badge so we can all be sure from the start as to who she is. It is like this with events as well, and the dialogue is surprisingly expositional in its nature with far too many characters seemed to be talking just for the sake of filling in blanks or moving to the next scene. As a sort of summary of Biggie's career this is fine I suppose but when it comes to caring about the characters then it does hurt it quite bad.Not that the film is overly concerned with the characters because the events-driven script doesn't really have any. Before anyone messages me with insults, I can see that there are physically people on the screen there, doing and saying things as these people, but in terms of character development and depth there is none. Nobody ever feels real ? partly because of the dialogue but also because the material doesn't give anybody room to develop. This is best seen in the "second-tier" characters such as Puffy and the many women in Biggie's life but it comes over differently with Biggie himself. Contrary to his musical personae, the film does not play up the negative side of Biggie's life too much. It cannot completely hide it though and we do get lots of infidelity and things like him happily selling crack to a pregnant woman. However all of these things tend to be deliberately cancelled out later on in some daft and unnecessary scenes. For example we get to see the crack user years later, fine and playing with her child (also fine) and of course much is put right by conversations, commitments and phone calls on the night that he gets killed. Such things damage the film further as both a record and as a dramatic film ? I didn't want "warts &amp; all" but an edge of realism and criticism (where warranted) would have been good.It might be them or it might be the material but either way, the cast are not that great. Woolard does a solid impersonation of Biggie and deal well with the material but he has nowhere to go with his character other than the specifics of the scene ? there is not a man inside his performance so much as an image of a man. Luke and Bassett are both very talented actors but neither gets to showcase that here ? indeed Luke is only memorable for how well he nails Puffy's dancing style. Naughton's Lil Kim sticks in the mind for reasons other than her performance (although again as an impression it is good enough for here). Smith, Ringgold, Mackie and others just do the basics as the film gives them no other options.The end result is a film that looks good and covers a lot of ground but doesn't work as a dramatic film. The people and events are there but they are only ever names and things that happen ? never real people or events that come from the story. The cast turn in solid but not that good performances accordingly but nobody can raise it beyond what it is. Not "bad" generally but just really lacking over what I would have expected from a biopic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie for Biggie fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That should have been the title of the movie. Everything about this movie glorified Big..... if he was a nerdy student - he's gonna the nerdiest student.... if he was a drug dealer - he was gonna be the biggest drug dealer - complete with him sitting in a dark room with that one light that shines down on the table (classic).... if he didn't know anything about Tupac's murder - then he's gonna appear as if he was absolutely oblivious to that entire situation.... not to mention one of the supporting characters in this movie, Kim.... if Kim was gonna be a ho - she's gonna be the dirtiest ho ever.... If I didn't know any better, I would assume the only way she came up was by f'king Biggie.... This is a one-sided, shallow view of a person's life. Biggie fans want to remember his legacy flawless and that can be understood. Sure why not? This movie was made for you..... It's a story told as though a mother is speaking of her lost son who could do no wrong.....Recommendation: Why not learn who Biggie was by beefing up the content of the supporting cast.... his first baby's momma for starters, and what about other artists that he interacted with? We could have seen a more developed, well-rounded and truthful character. Possibly even learn something about him that hasn't already been discussed in magazines or on TV....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Notorious' is the story of Christopher Wallace aka Biggie Smalls who became one of the most popular rap artists in the 1990s until he was gun downed at the very young age of 24. Biggie is played by newcomer Jamal Woolard who does a decent job playing Wallace, considering he never acted before.The first 45 minutes of the film are the most interesting as it focuses on Biggie's early career as a drug dealer. He's constantly arguing with his mother (played by the always solid Angela Bassett) who finally throws him out of the house after he won't give up his drug-dealing ways. Eventually he lands in jail where he starts writing rap lyrics which he eventually fashions into full-fledged songs in the recording studio. The era is ably recreated as we're given a sense of how rap music developed during the 1980s and early 90s.After his release from jail, Biggie starts building a reputation as a talented rapper in his Brooklyn neighborhood. He becomes a protégé of up and coming producer Sean "Puffy" Combs (one of the producers of the movie) who takes him under his wing. When Puffy is fired, Biggie goes back to drug-dealing only to find himself arrested again. This time however, a friend offers to take the rap on a gun charge and Biggie has a second chance to resume his career.The rest of the movie chronicles Biggie's eventual rise to the top. I was a little uncertain as to how Biggie actually got there. At one point he's 'paying his dues' playing college gigs at places like Howard University. The next thing you know he's got a number one hit record.If one is to believe the screenwriters, despite Biggie's involvement in the violent world of rap music, he was really a big Teddy Bear at heart. He's a character who can basically do no wrong. Even though he cheats on the three women he's closest to (the mother of his child, his wife and Lil Kim, fellow rap artist and lover), they all forgive this Teddy Bear despite his boorish behavior.Notorious lacks a central external antagonist who Biggie is pitted against throughout the movie. If there is an antagonist, it's got to be Tupac Shakur, the West Coast rapper who had a falling out with Biggie after he was shot outside a NYC recording studio. There are few dramatic scenes between Biggie and Tupac in Notorious and the relationship is mainly fleshed out through the use of an off-screen narrator. While Biggie admires Tupac as a philosopher and activist, he also perceives him as a loose cannon. According to Biggie's version, after Tupac was shot for the first time, he became completely paranoid and believed everyone was after him (including Biggie).As Biggie tells it, he made attempts to reconcile with Tupac but it never really worked out. Meanwhile the media played up the "East Coast-West Coast rivalry" which may have eventually led to the assassination of both Tupac and Biggie. The 'rivalry' is explained through a montage sequence which made me feel I was watching a documentary and not a feature film.The second half of Notorious mainly involves Biggie's internal struggles, particularly in the area of becoming a more responsible adult. Again, if you believe the screenwriters, despite acting irresponsibly with women and immersing himself in the thuggish, materialistic world of rap music (an involvement in a world which eventually led to his death), Biggie managed to stay 'above the fray'. The point is made that his second (and last) album revealed a more 'sensitive' side and that he was turning away from violence right before he died.One gets a feeling that the writers of Notorious have little information as to Biggie's dealings in his behind the scenes business world. Certainly they offer no theories as to who did him in. Instead, we're treated to all the histrionics of his volatile relationships with women (which basically proves that he was a 'ladies man' and nothing much else). By focusing mainly on his relations with women, we only get to see one side of Biggie and I didn't feel this was a complete, rounded picture.Probably the weakest character in the film is Puffy Combs. Since he's one of the film's producers, it's not in his interest to suggest anything controversial about his own character. Thus, Derek Luke has little to do in this film except act the part of a glorified cheerleader.Notorious touches on all the bases of Christopher Wallace's life. For those unfamiliar with all the details, it's a modestly interesting and somewhat entertaining story. Nonetheless, the filmmakers chose to place their protagonist on a pedestal. By doing so, they imply that Biggie was detached from the violent world which he was a part of. That somehow he was an unsuspecting victim who had nothing to do with his own demise. The truth was probably somewhere in the middle?that at times he could be Biggie the Teddy Bear and at other times, Biggie the Thug. Instead of a hagiography, Notorious needed to present more of a balanced portrait but it settled for an excessively sentimental and by the numbers treatment which earns it an average "5" in my book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No, No, No</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film reminded me of The Sopranos, and not in a good way. David Chase's seminal mob opera only ever put its foot wrong twice, the most jarring and inexplicable instance of which took place in its fourth season, when Junior Soprano went on trial for his life. Rather than pursue this riveting (and pivotal) plot line, the writers instead chose to completely ignore it, focusing instead on Bobby Baccalieri's constant whimpering over his recently deceased wife's frozen pasta dish. When something of genuine interest happens in Notorious - for example that first, mysterious assassination attempt on Tupac Shakur that ignited the whole East Coast/West Coast feud in the first place, and ended up leading to the deaths of both Tupac and Christopher Wallace - the film treats it as just another bit of plot to plod through. Why exactly was Tupac so convinced that he was sold out by his own people? Did he alone nurture his subsequent affiliation with Suge Knight? And was Lil' Kim's transformation from prim office drone into sex-obsessed, vampish diva really as banal as it appears here?None of these questions are even fleetingly addressed by the film's screenwriters, who are far more interested in depicting Wallace's turbulent love life to zero compelling dramatic avail. These sequences (including a brain-frazzlingly clichéd groupie indescretion in a hotel room) are so toothless and bruisingly manipulative that the only real comparison to be made is with a network TV movie.The storytelling, in both structure and content, is simplistic and trite. But more fundamentally, as a biopic; as something designed to celebrate its subject and educate the uninitiated on the intricacies of their life and work; the film is almost entirely worthless. The reliance on meat-and-potatoes genre plotting, coupled with the lifeless musical performances (an area in which a film like this should soar, surely) result in a film that appears to have been designed only to satisfy the whims and demands of those involved, leaving Wallace's questionable status as a giant in his field as the preserve of the easily persuaded and previously converted only. And the final twenty minutes, in which Wallace's posthumous cultural identity is broadly painted as being akin to that of a latter day saint, quite frankly made me feel like throwing up. On that score, much as with any other, Notorious is crass, calculating and compromised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>notorious, not "notorious" enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While "Notorious" is a solid biopic of the life of East Coast rapper Christopher Wallace (better known as Biggie Smalls or Notorious B.I.G. because of his girth), the movie suffers ultimately by its one-sided, fawning portrait of the talented rapper, who was shot and killed at the age of 24 in 1997. Ironically saying, all the highly anticipated hype (and also luring the naive crowds, intriguing them naively of course) brought him back from the grave although, it also send the heavyweight back to the crypt in a Hollywood second. I say that with all do respect..The movie unravels near the end of its two-hour running time, as it seems as Wallace is trying to complete all of the items on a bucket list before his death: reconcile with his mother, take responsibility for his children, whisper sweet nothings to all of the women he has ever wronged (and there are plenty of them). Revealing his death isn't giving away the ending, because the first moments of the film reveal that he has been shot and killed.It's not all bad..What the extremely R-rated (which doesn't hurt) film does well is trace Wallace's life as a child abandoned by his father through his ascent to the top of the music world. Jamal Woolard portrays Wallace from the age of 17 to his death. He does a serviceable job of expressing the flaws in Wallace's character and his early attraction to the mean streets during his days as a drug dealer, but Derek Luke as the charismatic (and, obviously, angelic, considering who produced the movie) Combs and Anthony Mackie as rapper Tupac Shakur steal every scene they are in with their over-sized personalities. Let me get this right, Notorious is the title no? This overtaking of a supporting role reminds me of the Dark Knight, scheming the joker into the finish line of attention.Back to the bad..This movie had nothing special to offer, at least nothing more than the Wikipedia entry. Another thing this film provides is the proof of the director's cliché. No experience, or at least nothing more than a his ridiculous Soul Food and Barbar Shop franchises that were compost-filled films. The script lets too much slide, and Anthony Mackie was a horrid choice, he couldn't provide the sense of Pac at all.There's no sense of reality, no feel of the streets, none of the raw zest and spark that spilled out of Biggie's music. This is the type of biopic Hollywood made in the '40s about people like Johann Strauss or Cole Porter: phony to its bones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie with great expectation. Besides the hype surrounding it, for someone who embraced hip hop for many years being influenced by the like of Biggie Smalls, Nas &amp; Tupac to mention a few, it only made sense for me to want to watch this movie.From the beginning i could not seem to get over the way in which B.I.G was portrayed as this smart, lovable young boy because it made me look at him in a whole different light that i initially thought. I feel his son played the part well (though he did not have much to do). The story line is pretty straight forward and there are a few surprises concerning the emotions the characters invoke in you and make you understand them more deeply. The acting was not bad, i actually like the guy who acted as Biggie, he made the character quite interesting and lovable. The rest of the cast were not too bad either: Puffy, Faith Evans and the guy who played Biggie's manager were good too (don't expect any Oscar winners though!) From a neutral point of view (without being a Notorious B.I.G or Tupac fan) i really felt that they tried to explain the beef between the artists with a more lenient view of Biggie. When watching the movie i couldn't help but think how much Biggie was the 'bigger man' in the beef and that Tupac simply caught a fit at the wrong people. Then i had to ask myself a few questions about that. The movie makes you want to take Biggie's side on the whole issue. I don't know if this is true but i felt that it was rather unfair no matter how much of a nice guy Biggie was. In watching this movie its hard to see it any other way than that the beef was Tupac's fault. It's up to you to believe it or not.All in all it was a good effort, nothing too memorable but a story worth knowing especially if you want to know more about some of the most critical times in Hip Hop. Biggie fans will undoubtedly love this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie For Biggie Fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MY girlfriend and I went to see this opening night and I was a little worried about the director and first time actor Jamal Woolard but it turned out to be a great film. Now i am a Biggie fan so you may think this is biased but it was a well done movie and showed you the life of biggie and how he made it. There is a couple things that i thought were not so good about the movie like go more in depth his younger years so we learn more about him and also go deeper into the feud with him and pac. But other than that Jamal Woolard gave a great performance as well as the rest of the cast. Now my girlfriend doesn't even like rap and she liked this movie so i would suggest it to anyone. I am surprised about the bad rating but i guess people hate on the best rapper of all time too much lol</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Biggie fans will love "Notorious"; everybody else, well, that's another question entirely...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Tillman Jr.'s "Notorious," a by-the-numbers biopic about the life of Brooklyn rapper Christopher "Notorious B.I.G." Wallace (1972-1997), is sure to only please the members of his core fan-base, myself amongst one of them. I was 11 in March 1997 when Biggie Smalls was shot and killed in Los Angeles, California, just seven months after his friend and fellow rap artist Tupac Shakur (1971-1996) was shot and killed in Las Vegas; Tupac died the day after my 11th birthday in 1996.Many thought that their murders were part of the whole East Coast/West Coast rivalry between rap artists during the mid '90s. Both Big and Tupac became the unlikely martyrs of gangsta rap and the violence that characterizes it. What's most shameful about that is that over a decade after their deaths, it seems that the hip-hop community has yet to learn a very valuable lesson.But I'm getting off-track. "Notorious" is a well-made and well-acted movie. Unfortunately, however, it's too by-the-numbers and follows the tried-and-true methods of most biopic storytelling: it glamorizes the life of the character, goes from one success to another, and doesn't really shed anything new on the person the movie is about. Of course it traces the beginnings of Biggie's life, from growing up as a bright Catholic school student in Brooklyn raised by his loving mother Voletta Wallace (a perfectly cast Angela Bassett), to his dropping out of school at age 17 to sell crack on the streets to help feed his baby daughter, and his eventual being signed to the then-newly formed Bad Boy Records by his best friend Sean "Puffy" Combs (Derek Luke). The rest, as they say, is history.I also forgot to mention that Jamal Woolard, as Biggie, who is also an aspiring rapper himself, is probably the best thing about this movie. He really captures the essence, and character of Big, and not only does he look like him, but he also talks AND sounds like him. And his skills on the microphone are undeniable as well. He lends some authenticity to the film's rhyming sessions, rapping to the songs of the real-life Notorious B.I.G., and he pulls it off magnificently. It's a star-making performance that unfortunately gets overshadowed by too many of the film's flaws.The script (co-authored by Biggie's biographer Cheo Hodari Coker) skips from one success to another; that's the biggest problem with most biopics. Another problem I had was that the portrait of the main character was pretty one-sided. While I personally consider his debut record "Ready to Die" to be one of the most important and significant rap albums ever recorded - it helped return the East Coast rap scene to prominence - I'm not totally certain that he was truly one of the greatest rap artists who ever lived, especially after only two finished recordings. And I really would have liked to have seen more of Big's friendship with Tupac Shakur (Anthony Mackie), which I felt was one of the most overlooked and tragic aspects of his life during the East Coast/West Coast rivalries. (People often forget that not only were they friends early on, but they were very close friends.)And while I'm quite certain that the sex appeal of Lil' Kim (Naturi Naughton) is one of the reasons for her success as a rapper, I also feel that one of the reasons she's here, apparently, is to show A LOT of skin and seem like the biggest, baddest 'ho in hip-hop (that's debatable). Big's relationship with wife Faith Evans (Antonique Smith) was not all that well-developed either, as was Big's friendship with Puffy, or the members of Junior M.A.F.I.A., who he helped to promote along with Lil' Kim, whom he was carrying on an affair with while still married to Faith. I also would have liked to have seen some of the paranoia and fear that gripped Biggie in the final months of his life as well, and a little bit more on the aftermath of his murder.Like I said earlier, I'm a fan of the Notorious B.I.G. myself, and so I'm sure that I'm one of those people that would have liked "Notorious" a lot more. That's the biggest tragedy about his life and this film. His short life and violent death made him one of the most important, and tragic, figures in hip-hop. I also think it's a disgrace that not much has been done by law enforcement officials to try to solve his murder, or Tupac's for that matter, and the questions revolving around the involvement of corrupt police officers in both killings have yet to be followed up in any significant fashion by anyone.I'm not going to be a cliché: I don't think he was one of the greatest rappers, personally, but the impact of his music on the industry cannot be denied by anyone: he helped the East Coast's rise back to the top of the rap scene in the mid '90s. As for the movie about his life, on the hand, it could have been better - a lot better.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A B.I.G. Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of Notorious B.I.G., I was looking forward to this movie. I am unfortunate to see it is a terrible movie. Jamal Woodward is not convincing or realistic enough to portray Notorious B.I.G. A lot of the story follows Notorious B.I.G.'s real son, Christopher Jordan Wallace as Notorious B.I.G. as a kid. Unfortunately, he is not convincing enough to pay tribute to his father. Derek Luke is just as unconvincing as Sean "Puffy" Combs. In a nutshell, no one is convincing enough to play their roles here. The big problem with this are these are actual people they are playing. It was boring, and did not give any information about Notorious B.I.G. that fans and non-fans alike did not already know. I was especially disappointed with Angela Bassett, a very good actress wasted here as Voletta Wallace. The movie slugs and slugs along thinking that Notorious B.I.G. fans will spend tons of money on it. I am unfortunate to say that that happened. It's nowhere close to a good movie. I was expecting so much out of it, but unfortunately I didn't get anything I wanted from this. I think you should definitely skip this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, I'll admit it. I love "The Notorious B.I.G". I, and many others see him as the king of Hip-hop/Rap. This movie really glorifies Biggie as well. First I'll talk about the main man himself, Jamal Woolard as Christopher"Biggie"Wallace. I know this is his first time acting in anything, and fair play to him. But Woolard does a really good job as Biggie Smalls. He brings every last detail off him to the screen. He's a jerk, but likable and funny. He did a great job and did some amazing rap scenes too.(e.g., "Juicy","Party and Bull", "Warning") This was an amazing movie too watch. I was only a baby in the 90's so I new nothing off this at the time. It really captured you in the feeling of how cool it was too live in this time. One thing I would have to disagree with other posters. Anthony Mackie did a great job as 2Pac. Yeah! He wasn't supposed to bring that much emotion to him. He was only a supporting character! It wasn't his movie. He only acted the way 2Pac did in those moments he came across Biggie. And he did a good job. He was charismatic . In those scenes. The one that really stood out for me was the actress who played Lil Kim. She was very impressive and one of the most well-cast characters in the movie. She was powerful and aggressive. Overall I loved this movie and I could watch it again and again. One off the years best so far. 9/10</fullReview>

Its all covered up and buried deep down.Second, I'm not against neither 2pac or Biggie I love them both but 2pac and Lil Kim DID get embarrassed in this movie for sure...Next, for all of ya that are saying that the movie is awesome and cant see the truth, either u are too blind too see it because u think u know something about BIG or you don't know anything about him at all and u love this Hollywood teenage movies. Use your mind and see though the clouds... There is a lot of it you could say when it gets to this topic, I did not say 60% of what I have to say because its a very wide topic but for the movie I can only say that it could have been a little bit, I mean a much better done. But anyways I'm just some person giving her opinion....No hard feelings...Look, I love hip hop and I live for it but after seeing this movie every person with a little intelligence could see that this is not how someone is suppose to live. With all do respect for 2pac and BIG, like all the other artists who are making for a living like this should turn the other page because u are ruining the youth....Bringing the wrong message to the children and that is: not going to school but living from the streets, hustling and just grabbing for the paper....The true hip hop is suppose to be about love and intelligence, be smart and all.OK I know that many of you will think that I'm crazy, but this is just my point of view. Look I am maybe wrong about something and Im not saying this is a completely bad movie because even if I'm in hip hop for 17, 18 years I still don't know anything bout 2pac or Biggie no matter how many articles I read or how much I support them and listen to their music...Like most of you all out there. Only people who were really close to them and the killers know the truth behind all this.And for the end I just wanna say for all of ya Biggie and Tupac fans and family, this two men were and will be the greatest of all time, no matter how they lived their lives but PLEASE IN THE FUTURE TRY TO BE BETTER, LEARN AND LOVE EACH OTHER, THINK GOOD EVEN FOR THE ONES THAT Don't LIKE YOU, BECAUSE AT THE END...ITS NOT ABOUT HOW MANY MONEY OR FAME U COULD GET AND HOW FAST U COULD GET TO THE TOP, ITS ABOUT ACCOMPLISHING YOUR SELF TO THE FULLEST AND FEEDING YOUR SOUL, YOUR BODY AND MIND...BECAUSE IF U MANAGE TO DO THAT, YOU WILL BE LIVING A LIFE EVEN AFTER DEATH!!!! PEACE AND LOVE TO YA ALL!!!! RIP BIGGIE,2PAC,AALIYAH,LEFT EYE,JAM MASTER JAY AND THE OTHERS WHO MAKE A CHANGE IN THIS WORLD!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A REAL unbiased opinion of "Notorious"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say that honesty is always the best policy, and this movie is no exception.The movie was Okay, very vague, and honestly never really dug deep to show who Biggie really was. So either the director was scared of criticism, or there just wasn't anything really interesting about the man. The acting was Okay, honestly it was better than expected. Overall I'll give it a 5/10 for effort. First of all I will start by saying that Biggie was truly talented and gifted, and he was a central Hip-Hop figure in the mid-1990's. But that is all, people! He wasn't Dr. King for God's sakes!!!! Let's be honest I enjoyed and still enjoy his music, but let's stop kidding ourselves. 2 1/2 albums qualifies no one to be "the greatest rapper of all time", please cut it out &amp; use your brains!!! Biggie had a long way to go before he could ever hold that title. Hell, NWA revolutionized the realness of Rap. They were the first to really talk about Hood life and Hood things. And Biggie is just one of many talented people who followed in their foot steps. Sadly he never talked about much else, he was never reflective, or adamant about other issues. He talked about himself, partying, women, drugs, and money (How Original). We have to stop Kidding ourselves.I won't now compare him to 2pac because there is no comparison. Pac wasn't commercial like Biggie was, but that didn't matter because, when he rapped about himself he blew you away. no one tells the truth as honestly &amp; vulnerably as Pac. Furthmore, he didn't hold anything back. He also cared about bettering the Hood, and used his music to be inspirational as well as informative. Yes he loved the T.H.U.G. life, (which he defined as "coming from nothing and turning it into something") but he was also very politically and socially aware. He was very dynamic and cared about spreading his philosophy, and over the last 14 1/2 years and 6-7 after death albums its evident that his music and message were the most important things to him. C'mon people, it's time to end the fake "controversy" and leave two talented men to rest!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>B.I.G for beginners.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a musician reaches a certain level of fame in their career, many companies will seize on the opportunity to cash in. One of these ways is through a film biopic of their life, which gives old and new fans a chance to explore the depths of their idols and see a more interesting side of them that they hadn't previously been aware of. Notorious (based on the life of rapper Notorious B.I.G) is one such example, and while it is an enjoyable and compelling piece, it is perhaps more suited to the rapper's new fans rather than his die- hard ones.The story focuses on the life of Biggie Smalls (AKA the Notorious B.I.G) from his early beginnings as a New York drug dealer to his early success when he signs on to Bad Boy Records to his personal relationships later in life to his untimely death by an unknown assailant. The story is one of the film's major problems, as while it goes over his life's important events, it often just skims through them, without going into much depth. The most detail the film goes into about his life is his womanising. It's surprising that the film has been called hagiographic, as it does show the ugly side of this, as he is very passive about it, eventually cheating on his wife because of it, who (quite rightly) throws him out of their house, and it gives both the film and its title character the conflict that it otherwise lacks, and is the most engaging part of the film because of it.The rest of the film is more standard, as it shows us many of his life's highlights in brief portions, which while interesting to those who may not be familiar with the rapper, isn't as exciting if you already know the story. It also doesn't help that the film clearly alters history for its own ends. Bad Boy Record head Puff Daddy (who also produces the film) is suspiciously portrayed more hagiographically than BIG himself, many of BIG's problems aren't perhaps as accurately as they should be (i.e. the drug dealing and firearms charges aren't as severe as they would be in reality) and you can't help that the film has a overtly negative view of the West Coast rap scene, mainly that of Suge Knight &amp; Tupac Shukar, leading to many set-pieces (mainly one which describes why Tupac turned on Biggie) that even those who have reservations towards Suge and Tupac (I have my own) won't buy. The film still manages to be quite an enjoyable ride though, as the pacing is good and a lot of the acting is great, particularly that of Jamal Woolard as the title character. Apparently he put a lot of preparation into the role (i.e. learning the songs word perfect, researching his character), and it clearly shows, and fits perfectly into the role because of it, and brings more appreciation and depth to the rapper than the film itself. All the other actors are pretty good too, with the exception of Anthony Mackie as Tupac Shukar, who while good, doesn't bother to attempt to look (only bearing the slightest resemblance) or sound like Tupac, something even more distracting considering Jamal's accuracy to his role or how one of Tupac's songs plays on the radio at one point, making the differences even more obvious.However, despite its faults, Notorious isn't an overall bad film. It's just a very flawed biopic that is worth watching, but mainly for those who are unfamiliar with the subject, as it gives the viewer the basic facts about the star, to perhaps create new fans in the process who will look more in-depth afterwards. But for those who are die-hard fans, the film is still pretty good for what it is. Perhaps it doesn't go into as much depth as one likes, and certain details about the film have either been altered or fabricated, but it is still an entertaining, engaging and perfectly watchable film that is occasionally very detailed and you'll be treated to some fine acting, especially from Jamal Woolard who was clearly born to play the Notorious B.I.G, and it also has the very upbeat and positive message of following your dreams. It's quite good overall and is worth watching, but it may still take a while for the definitive story of the Notorious B.I.G to be made, even though this is a good first stab. Just don't confuse this for the Hitchcock one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tries to cover a bit too much ground</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Biopics can either try to cover the highlights of a person's life, or focus on a single part of it. This one does the former, and it should have done the latter. The cast is great, and music blends in really well, and if this movie relates to something you are interested in then I am sure you will love it - but I would have preferred it focusing on either BIG in his early years, or, more preferably, the feud with 2pac. Having both did neither part justice. That said, BIG as they presented him, seemed like an under-achiever. He worked hard with his music, but mostly things seemed to just fall in his lap because of the people around him. If this is true or not, I don't know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie if your a fan of Biggie Smalls</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I have to say Notorious BIG is my favourite rapper and one of my favourite music artists ever! I also love a lot of Puff Daddy's 90's music so obviously straight away I'm going to love something about this movie.... The music! The performances are perfect and the man that plays biggie acts as him perfectly. Also all the other actors are superb and all of them seem like the real people that they are acting as. But then this can also be a huge turn off for some people. People that don't like rap music, or Bad Boys records then you are probably not going to enjoy this movie as much because you don't really care about the people as much because you don't respect them for their music. But if your like me and absolutely love rap music especially the early 90's rap and love Biggie's music this is a must watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed but touching biopic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Notorious kept my interest until the end. I thought Woolard did a great Biggie and the set pieces were spot on. The editing and production value was tight and the plot seemed to flow well. The music was perfect for the time it was representing, and the east/west coast rivalry of the mid 90s was portrayed well. Unfortunately Notorious is a safe movie, hardly shedding any light on Christopher Wallace and the "gangster" times. The Tupac issue was treaded lightly and I never really felt the connection. You would think with Sean Combs as a producer, we could get a real behind the scenes feel of the boiling situation, but instead we get a watered down, submissive, cliché biopic. All in all Notorious is a decent movie with a great actor at the helm. If you are a Biggie fan, watch it for a trip down memory lane, but don't expect to learn any more about the deep, sometimes disturbing Christopher Wallace. 7.2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a great film.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie that I was looking forward to, until the reviews started rolling in....Now obviously, I don't take the critics word as the gospel truth, and more often than not, I disagree with them, but I thought the producers and directors must have messed something up, to be getting all the negative backlash.I suppose the best way to properly start this review is by asking a question - What exactly did you want from the movie? I was expecting, and looking forward to, a dramatised portrayal of the life and times of Christopher Wallace, which is exactly what I got, and I enjoyed every minute of it, from start to finish.Now being a long time fan of the Notorious B.I.G, may imply that this review could be biased, but I can assure you that I am, more often that not, more than ready to attack a movie and pick it apart, no matter what it is.As someone who knows the ins and out of the story, obviously, there were some things that bothered me slightly, including the void of some key characters who played a big part in Biggie's life, and the less than impressive casting of Tupac and Puffy's characters. Referring to the last point, their acting was great, but on appearance, Anthony Mackie looks nothing like Shakur, and lacked the charisma and iconic presence that Pac had. Big boots to fill. I felt the same way about the actor who played Puffy.During the east coast vs west coast segments, the movie was slightly biased towards the Bad Boy camp, but come on, this is a movie to celebrate Big's life. It didn't bother me at all. There are plenty of documentaries and articles for one to read, if they want a purely fact based, and raw account of the story, from both parties.Now back to the positives. Jamal was absolutely incredible as BIG. A flawless performance.The movie was gripping throughout, and I found myself eagerly awaiting the progression.The acting was generally good, and the soundtrack was almost perfect, apart from one or two tracks that I would have liked to have seen/heard in the mix, but thats just personal opinion.Now for those who are not a fan of Biggie, or Hip Hop for that matter, I would not cross this off your list yet. You won't be overly bombarded with hardcore gangster rap songs, thuggery and street slang. Obviously, Biggie's songs are prominent throughout, but the music is not relentless, and I'm almost sure that these guys had a wider target audience in mind when making the film. This is not a film that is just for 'the fans' or those on the 'streets'.Obviously, Big was no angel, and some of his ways, especially in his earlier life, could offend some. Certain scenes involving sex, drugs, and cheating had to be present, in order to maintain an accurate depiction of the man.Lil Kim had a problem with the way her character was portrayed, and I can see why. I don't know enough about her life, or her role in Big's life to comment, so I will have to look into that someday.We all know what happens in the end, so its no spoiler. I was a little choked. I didn't think I would be, but I was. A sign that the crew have done their job correctly. The movie hit the right spots. Excitement, sadness, and inspiration.The conclusion? I loved the film, and look forward to watching it again with some friends.This is not Oscar worthy by all means, and I'm sure people will continue to nitpick away, but once again, these people really need to ask themselves what they were expecting, and what exactly they wanted from a biopic film.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Takes the mask off.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The rapper, much like a fellow form of entertainer the clown, is a persona that relies on masking weaker aspects of character and temperament in order to fulfil their role as exactly that?a person that people will be able to relate to or find solace within. Of course, comparing a rapper directly to a painted circus act only goes so far until all attempts at providing an ample analogy wear thin. Instead, rap is an artistic movement that attempts to convey the rags-to-riches story with poetry laced over simplistic musical backings built to elicit response of an audience out to either get down or simply share in that collective stream of pathos. Yet the masks that both wear nevertheless serve the same function; while the Notorious B.I.G. would eventually become key in a movement of hip-hop stars making music through the soul rather than pure social frustration, there nevertheless remains a code of conduct or, ethic to being a rap star that overrides any form of drama within the person's life to take centre-stage. Notorious takes the mask off.Notorious then, which takes the form of a bio-pic documenting famed star Christopher "Biggie" Wallace's rise from the gutter is an unmasking of sorts that goes beyond the gold chains, sunglasses, sleek rhymes and ultra-cool persona to reveal the man behind the music. The concept of course is as old as boots, but too often it is the case that such ventures into famed celebrity lives are either told with no care for genuine character-investment or instead play far too loosely with the facts. It's a pleasure then that Notorious which is directed by George Tillman Jr. (his first feature film since the underrated Men of Honor in 2000) does well to balance both the facts and the drama to ample effect with no neglect at all given to the music that propelled Biggie to stardom. Instead, Notorious plays out like a substantive character drama that always keeps the focus on Christopher Wallace rather than Biggie Smalls, and the result is compelling in its ability to stuff in so much material into its runtime without seeming overly abundant or superfluous. Most importantly of all however is that Tillman's effort here resonates far more emotionally than one would expect; sure, the rags-to-riches story is fast becoming a sickly cliché, but Notorious remains true to its story regardless and ends up coming out feeling genuinely compelling without resorting to mundane and transparent devices.No doubt key to the entire productions success however, regardless of how finely constructed the screenplay may be is the performance by leading man Jamal Woolard who not only embodies Christopher Wallace to a fine point, but also nails what is demanded of him when chants of "Biggie" take form. Indeed, much of Notorious' ability to keep things flowing and feeling fresh is through such instances where the drama is interlaced with Wallace's more public persona throughout the many musical interludes that transpire as the rapper makes a name for himself. Much also has to be said for Woolard's co-stars who range from friends and family to old and new lovers, some famous, some not so famous. The result is an ensemble that do well to shine on their own grounds but never get enough screen time to detract the attention away from the man himself. Of course, this does have some detrimental effect on some elements of the script's focus (namely involving his mother who battles breast cancer) but with a runtime already clocking in at two hours with very little throwaway material therein, one can't complain too much.In the end it's obvious that existing fans of the Notorious B.I.G, Biggie Smalls, Christopher Wallace and all around hip-hop icon will no doubt find a lot more to enjoy here than casual onlookers, but even those with an affinity for these kinds of stories will find much to invest within here. Indeed, while a large portion of Notorious details the hardships that the young rapper had to overcome on his way to the top as well as many failings along the way also, it is this honest and compelling look at those words now infamously engrained within two of rap's most esteemed records that give Notorious all the flow and pathos of Biggie's work himself. And even if you can't appreciate that, then there's the fantastic soundtrack itself, the spot-on performances and a brief history lesson on one of the music industry's brightest and short-lived stars to enjoy.- A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</fullReview>

Which I completely lost interest just a matter of seconds from the beginning of the movie. I'm very disappointed, that's like watching a biography story on Mark Anthony and having Arnold play the part.

		<shortDescription>Excellent Bio-pic of Late Rap Star Chris Wallace a/k/a Notorious B.I.G.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew little about Notorious B.I.G. going into this movie, other than he was murdered in an East Coast/West Coast rapper feud which also claimed Tupac Shakur. I didn't know anything about his music or his life.What really made me like this movie was the way the writing, directing, and acting helped bring the character and his story to life. The movie went into a lot of depth about Wallace's upbringing in Brooklyn, about his mother, his absentee father, the neighborhood influences, his slide into the "Thug Life" of violence, drug dealing, and prison, all of which contributed to his development as an acclaimed rapper.I really enjoyed how his entertainment career development interacted with Lil' Kim, Puff Daddy, Tupac, and all of the others.Many people will be turned off by how this movie seems to glorify violence, objectifies women, and accepts the baser and more coarse aspects of inner city Black culture. Yet I can't help but find a lot to like in this movie, especially the story it tells, the characters it develops and explores, the live music scenes, and the acting, above all.Even if you hate rap music, this is a movie well worth renting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember watching Notorious one night when I couldn't sleep and I was under the weather so I thought why not.I have been curious about the film and do enjoy motion pictures based on music stars.However Notorious is not one of those films that did it justice not even close. It does showcase some of the facts we know about the Notorious B.I.G. such as his friendship with Tupac before they became rivals, his rise to fame and his relationship with Faith EvansIt also shows how the famous East Coast West Coast Rap War begin so the film did some things but still wasn't enough to make the film true to the Notorious B.I.G.They did too much and it just feels like they wanted a rush movie and I don't know if half of the events of the film were true because I have had watch and listen to different stories about Biggie Smalls but yet most of the film I don't feel like they knew what they were doingThe acting is just mix at best because while Jamal Woolard did research and listening and did everything he could to give us the look of Notorious B.I.G. I will give him credit for at least trying. Anthony Mackie as Tupac is just a mix results that is hard to give it justice Derek Luke as Sean "Puffy" Combs I actually don't remember how I felt about his performance.All together it just feels like a wasted chance to talk about perhaps one of the greatest artists who ever came to music and it just feels like a real disappointmentI suggest finding looking for other movies based on true events and not this film. I give Notorious an 4 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1997, Christopher Wallace aka rapper Biggie Smalls is gunned down. Back in 1983 Brooklyn, Christopher is a bright student with an overprotective mother (Angela Bassett). He decides to follow his friend D-Roc into selling crack hiding his gangster life from his mother. His girlfriend tells him she's pregnant. He start rhyming while selling crack eventually beating another guy in a street battle. His mother kicks him out and he gets thrown in prison. Eventually he gets signed by Puffy Combs (Derek Luke) and marries singer Faith Evans (Antonique Smith). His friendship with Tupac Shakur (Anthony Mackie) turns sour.This is a rather traditional music biopic. It could have been more intense considering the subject. It should have been more than a run-of-the-mill production. Jamal Woolard provides a charismatic center. Even his narrations are compelling. He's also joined by other good actors. I'm not convinced about Derek Luke but Angela Bassett is terrific.</fullReview>

They see 2 idiots creating drama between 2 guys who did nothing but instigate and create havoc into society. Tis the reason both of them died instead of American society making the right call. Both of them were born with a tool to create something that made some kids believe but instead they created havoc between parts of US. Realizing what went on this movie was made I think? It's not called Thug Life but called Notorious instead. Biggie was better as a person just like this movie was called for but he died.

		<fullReview>Notorious is a nice, interesting biography that chronicles the life of Notorious B.I.G and his rise to fame and his downfall. I'm not a rap person at all, but the film has gotten me interested in the late 1990's battle between East Coast versus West Coast. All of this drama and rivalry is very intriguing and which resulted in the deaths of two talented rappers.George Tillman Jr's film is the story about B.I.G and how he grew up in the ghetto selling drugs to becoming a worldwide phenomenon who lost his life at the very young age of 24. This story also accounts for his friendship turned enemies in Tupac Shakur who also lost his life at a very young age.The acting is actually not too bad. I have never heard of Jamal Woolward before but he is pretty good as B.I.G. Anthony Mackie does a good job as Tupac. Angela Bassett is really good as B.I.G's mother who cares for him very much.Overall, this is a solid biography that may teach you a thing or two. I wasn't as moved as most people but that is because this is not my kind of music at all. But it's still worth a watch just for seeing what an interesting character B.I.G was. I rate this film 8/10.</fullReview>

It looks good, and facets of it shine, but behind the gilded facade there's not much there.The movie leaves us with the sense that, twelve years after Biggie Smalls's death, a lot of people are trying to extract whatever profit or pride they can from the chaotic life of a young man who was, as he well knew, a work in progress.While the script provides ample illustrations of Wallace's tough life, there is not enough focus on what set the recording star apart from his peers or why he became so incredibly popular so quickly.Overall,it is an intermittently entertaining but thoroughly conventional and standard biopic.</fullReview>

I remember that a friend to me was a real Biggie fan, and by that time I didn't know who Biggie was. Every day he showed me Biggie songs and the only rapper I was listening to was Tupac. He told me one day that it will be a movie that is about Biggie, and after 2 months the movie was released. We rented the movie and I wasn't so positive to it. But It ended up to being one of my favorite movies.The film is about Christopher Wallace and his life, how he went from being a crack-dealer to a legendary musician. How puffy helped him on the road and made him to the one he became, and how Christopher helped Lil Kim to be the one she became. My favorite part is when he has his beef with Tupac and he is performing in Los Angeles and the people there hates him and he says "you know what, I don't give a f..." And after that he raps the song "who shot ya" that some people say is a dis against Tupac. I like this film because its reality. It's about how it is to live in misery but still fighting hard to reach your goal, and the harder you fight to reach it, the closer you will be to it and one day you'll succeed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very well done, and very inspirational.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Notorious i have to say is a pretty solid movie for a biography, probably one of the best bio movies iv seen. This movie is about Biggie's life, his rags to riches story, this is a very touching and moving film, the way Biggie is portrayed makes him a very loving and caring man trying to make it in the cold world of fame.The cast chosen for this movie was great. The movie was very well done, iv seen man comments on this site about this movie, saying it did not cover a lot of things, the thing is it was not made to cover his whole life and every aspect of it if you wanna know all about that i suggest you watch a documentary. This movie was made too tell his story like any other Hollywood movie.The thing i did not like about this movie was how biggie was portrayed as the "Good Guy" in the whole 2Pac and Biggie beef, how they try to saw he didn't want beef and 2Pac was trying to start it all nobody know's they should of left it at that but other than it was great.I would suggest this movie to anyone that likes rap, other than that if your not a fan of this type of music i don't think this is that type of movie for you other than that great movie props to the director and producer, cant wait for a 2Pac one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its a good movie, but they could have added more interesting things about his life. The actors were dressed well, and the story was pretty good.I wasn't expecting them to talk about his dope slanging when he was young. I like how the character development goes out smoothly.It was a good movie, only bad thing was that they didn't really capture the moment of his death, it looked like he was tranquilized.err, i don't really know what else to talk about, junior mafia looked kinda weird. Biggie was fatter than that.Oh yeah, the girl has that plays lil kim in this movie had a camel toe in the concert in the movie when she show her eye candy.It was funny when his mom thought that the crack was ''old mashed potatoes'' I never knew that puffy was the one that told him about the ''juicy'' beat.</fullReview>

What i have to say about this documentary is that it was very well done. For anyone that may object to watching this just because it is about rap artist i would highly disregard that notion and give this documentary a try. It portrays a very detailed life story of more than just Christopher Wallace. Although some rated R scenes can be obscene for some this a good watch for anyone partially interested in the story of Christopher Wallace</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hit me out of left field...an incredible movie gem that might glorify Big but still entertains to the max!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I should make clear that I am not a Biggie Smalls fan. I am not even an R&amp;B fan so I decided to watch Notorious with my fiancé begrudgingly. I think by the end of the film it was so incredible, powerful, emotional and just terrifically entertaining that my jaw was dropped on the floor. Who would have thought that a straight to DVD movie about a rap star would be so incredible. It would seem that all the reviews from other IMDb users say the same thing...the movie is completely biased towards making Biggie Smalls look like a glowing angel and it's true it does that but I know nothing about his history, his life, or his death so for me it was just completely and utterly entertaining. The film focuses on his ride to stardom and his subsequent death but also goes into his childhood and his relationship with Lil Kim and his down slide into drugs. It also sets up and shows the turbulent relationship with Tupac Shakur. One of the cool little Easter Eggs in the film is the fact that Biggie Smalls (aka Christopher Wallace's) son plays Biggie Smalls as a kid. In this case for me I don't watch this film wanting to see reality, I watch it to be entertained and Notorious nails that on the head.Newcomer Jamal Woolard is absolutely brilliant as the Notorious B.I.G. Woolard has no other big film credits to his name and yet nails this performance and makes B.I.G. look really good. You just feel empathy and really connect to the late rapper. Christopher Jordan Wallace really does a great job portraying his late father. This is also his only screen credit and he is perfect, ironically. Naturi Naughton gives an incredibly eerie performance as rapper Lil Kim. I say eerie because she looks like her and completely embodies the persona of Biggie's wife. Anthony Mackie adds to the cast as Tupac Shakur and does as good a job as any of them. He embodies the character and the terrific chemistry between him and Woolard makes the entire film worthwhile. Dennis L.A. White plays Biggie's friend and confidante Damion 'D-Roc' Butler and while he doesn't quite have the same size of role as the rest of them he does it well. Derek Luke is decent as the music giant Sean Combs but honestly I thought his role would be better in the movie.George Tillman Jr. does a terrific job directing the film. He seems to really give his actors room to make the roles their own and I think if he has any role he casting he does it brilliantly. One of his earlier films Men of Honor is very under rated and a brilliant movie in it's own right. It seems he always directed films from the black community and does so with style and real intelligence. If he did this film as a tribute to the Notorious B.I.G. then he nailed it completely and utterly. I have to imagine that there are plenty of B.I.G. fans out there and therefore this shouldn't offend anyone that it really does lean in his favor including the feud and subsequent deaths of both him and Shakur. Don't watch the film if you want a fair and balanced version of his life but watch it for the drama and the story and you'll be entertained. Even if you're not a fan and barely know who B.I.G. is you will love this film!! It's the perfect drama and a real gem!! 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Notorious is a cliché ridden, badly scripted, by the numbers and shallow biopic of New York rapper Christopher 'Notorious B.I.G' Wallace.If it was not for the fact that he died in 1997 I could have sworn he was an Executive Producer of this movie given how much this film hypes him up. A school nerd turned big time drug dealer and babe magnet. It did not matter if a girl in the hood showed no interest in his large girth. A few sweet words, a smile and they would be humping his large frame. This happens repeatedly throughout the film.Now I once knew a fat guy who was a babe magnet, he was also a small time drug dealer. Which begs the question did all these women fall at his feet because Notorious was a rapper or drug dealer or a nobody with lots of charm?The movie deals and speaks in clichés throughout. A character mentions not once but twice lines like, 'we are not here to play the game but to take over the game.' Many of the themes dealt here were better in earlier films like Hustle and Flow and Get rich or die trying. They also had better music.Many of the side characters are depicted in a shallow way. Sean Combs was a producer in this film and he just happens to be portrayed as a great guy in this film. Lil Kim goes from a sweet office worker to a sex bomb. Angela Bassett is a hard working, virtuous mother, who raises Notorious single handedly but her Jamaican accent is a bit off. Tupac Shakur pops in and out of this film but his shooting marks a turning point in this film and the east and west coast rivalry in the mid 1990s.The movie never deals in depth as to what was the cause of this rivalry and why Shakur was shot. The film is not interested in the casual viewer but seems to be squarely aimed at fans of Notorious B.I.G and rap enthusiasts.Even at the end of the movie it is shown that Notorious was maturing, learnt the errors of his way but again its just clichés. I was more interested to know why if it was so dangerous for him to go to California, why did he not wear a bulletproof vest and drive around in a bulletproof car with heavy security? He certainly had the money for it, so was he just arrogant or plain dumb? The film never deals with it but in real life someone would had asked those basic questions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Biopic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Notorious is a biographical film about the rapper Notorious, how he came to fame, and his death. It's pretty educational regarding his life, I learned a lot of things I didn't know.Something that really bothers me about movies based on real life is when the characters don't look anything like who they're supposed to be. The only person who really looked like who they were supposed to was Notorious, but everyone else was confusing. A lot of the time I was just waiting for someone to call somebody else by their names before I knew what was going on. That was really frustrating for me.Another thing I've heard is that it doesn't capture the amazing personality of Notorious, and I kind of understand. It does capture a little bit of it though, for sure. The film didn't really make me understand how he became so famous and loved so fast. It tried to say it, but it was way too vague and quick about it. There was too much focus on his love life and not enough on his career, in my opinion.The plot was interesting. It's made even more interesting because it's true. I liked the story-telling techniques by the director, but I feel like he could have done better. There were some things that needed more explaining, and some things that needed less. It's all right.The music is great, but of course, only if you like rap. If not, you probably won't have a good time. I really love Biggie's style and I think he was really skilled, so I really enjoyed watching the parts when he was rapping. It has a great soundtrack.Main point, I liked this film. It had beautiful shots and a nice style. It captured the streets of New York and the dangers of the gangster life. I'm not saying it's the best one ever, but it was a little better than decent. I recommend it for a rent or to borrow from a buddy, but I probably won't be buying it soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If this is supposed to be the black experience, let me out at either the front or back door.A mama's boy one day sees 2 young hoods walk by and from then on it's all down hill for him. Angela Bassett, the one shining grace in this film, plays his over protective, religious mother. Despite her anger at how his life has turned, by the middle of the picture, she really decides to accept this. She allows his friends to come in and suddenly it's all right to use the profanity as long as it's not in front of the children.This is a sad state of affairs regarding gangster rap. You knew where this film was heading.I literally laughed out loud when at the end, when Bassett is accompanying her son's body for burial, she states that while his life had been cut short at age 24, he had become a man. What man? He had been a convicted criminal, wrote the most atrocious rap music with constant vulgarity,and scorned society. That scene in the classroom where he tells a teacher that as a sanitation worker, he will earn more than the teacher is a perfect example of what goes on in our schools. The complete and utter lack of respect for the teacher.The east coast, west coast gang rap rivalry is never fully explained. All we see are guns blazing.A terrible picture doing nothing to prevent gang violence. What horrible role models are these rap singers and their foul music. The African American community should take umbrage at their very being. Who was this classless fat slob who portrayed Biggie? He made Rerun from the old television show look thin by comparison. I know it was the streets of Bedford Stuyvesant that changed this chubby little boy into the vulgar monster that he was. What a sorry state of affairs when this is called motion picture entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Notorious tells the story of a Brooklyn junkie who later turned out to be one of the most world-wide known rappers. And that person was Christopher "Notorious B.I.G" Wallace, a junkie who turned to rapping and then produced albums that made millions while also making a name for himself. Jamal Woolard plays the role of Biggie Smalls exceptionally well and he also shares a similar face and body. It tells the story of Biggie Smalls life from 1972 to 1997 starting from his childhood all the way to his death. The rap music is the great thing about this film but Lil' Kim's live stage rap was totally unnecessary and inappropriate. This film shows that a celebrities life-style isn't all that great and when they think that they have everything, next thing they are getting divorced. The acting from some, Like Angela Bassett and Jamal Woolard, were very promising and they really settled into the life or Biggie Smalls. If you ever wanted to know more about Notorious B.I.G then this film must is supposed to be on your must-watch list. The language is very rude and uncool because they are swearing in every line, Motherf*cker that and this! What is the world coming to? NOTORIOUS is the story of Christopher Wallace. Through raw talent and sheer determination, Wallace transforms himself from Brooklyn street hustler (once selling crack to pregnant women) to one of the greatest rappers of all time; THE NOTORIOUS B.I.G. Follow his meteoric rise to fame and his refusal to succumb to expectations - redefining our notion of "The American Dream." The story does get interesting and a lot of lessons are learned and this film sent out a message saying: It's never too late to change yourself.If you are a drama and rapping fan then by unanimous decision this film is what you need to watch. Jamal Woolard looks really weird and cute at the same time when he gets that weird smile on his face (See the scene between Faith and him at the end). Marc John Jefferies has given one of the best performances in the film as he portrays a young Lil' Cease. The film also tells the story of Tupac's and Smalls friendship that turned into a racial break up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>NOTORIOUS is not just for fans of Biggie Small, or The Rap Music community. The film is primarily about any serious musician's quest to discover and nurture his artistic muse, and transform it into stardom. NOTORIOUS reiterates the classic Cinderella story of an artist who rises from nowhere and, against incredible odds, becomes loved and idolized by millions of fans. However, in the case of Brooklyn based rapper 'Notorious BIG'(Christopher Small), he becomes embroiled in a pointless and dangerous feud with certain West Coast Rappers. To me, it seems that the artists central to the controversy were too smart to really believe in this phony imbroglio, but they were pulled along by crazed fans, deluded managers and misdirected hangers-on. Much of Rap Music celebrates an extremely destructive and violent lifestyle, and it seems that certain fans are unable or unwilling to differentiate between artistic license and reality. If fans of pro-wrestling or NASCAR had such a worship of guns and gangs, they too might see their heroes cut down in their artistic prime. NOTORIOUS is a fairly standard bio-pic which tags all the bases, and contains some believable characterizations of real figures within the Rap community. We've all seen this kind of movie before, but NOTORIOUS attempts to examine a kind of stardom which is manifested and celebrated within a culture of violence and mayhem. However, the film fails to address the real question which is central to the life and death of 'Notorious BIG'. Is Rap music merely a reflection of violence within society, or does it somehow fan the flames of this aggressive hostility?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't have too much time right now, so I'll make this quick. I watched this film with low expectations and I got better than what I had in mind. It has fantastic performances by every actor (especially Jamal Woolard as Biggie), but with that said, I'm afraid that this film just focused too much on the negative side of Biggie, rather than his main contributions.Of course, the music is great, the cinematography is pretty good, it's well directed and extremely well acted (that's twice I've said that, stop me the next time I bring it up), but there's just such a negative flow to the whole film and that pretty much brought it down from my original rating of 8 to a 6.Yes, it did exceed my expectations, but not by much. Right when I felt that I was impressed, I was let down tremendously, but not enough to give it a bad review. It's a good movie and deserves to be recognized, but I just really wished that they had focused much more on the positive side of Biggie's life rather than all the negative.By the way, I'm not a fan of rap music so this is a totally neutral review.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>when i first heard notorious b.i.g. at 13, i was immediately blown away. his flow was some of the best i have ever heard. when he passed away, it left a hole in the hip hop community that will never be filled again. this film takes a look at his life story. the film looks at his relationship with his mother, and the streets. two totally different worlds that biggie is deeply in love with. he starts out as a loving mamas boy and grows to a greatly respected drug dealer and extremely talented rapper. his skills blow away everyone in his neighborhood and soon catches the attention of an aspiring c.e.o. by the name of Sean "puffy" combs. Combs starts his own record label, Bad Boy records, and immediately signs biggie. from there its a roller coaster ride as biggie takes the hip hop world by storm. and mo' money mo' problems as his beef with tupac takes a tragic turn that changes the hip hop world forever. newcomer jamal woolard makes his big screen debut, and shines as biggie. he has a natural charisma that captures biggies essence in every way. angela bassett plays voletta wallace, biggies mom, and her performance is great as always. the rest of the cast does a surprisingly good job, playing their roles as real people, and not caricatures of famous people. this film ran at around 120 mins and felt real and i had a great time watching it. this film brought back so many memories of my teens and made me realize how much the world misses the notorious b.i.g.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Movie was way better then I thought. The actors/actress in it resembled each person in everyway possible. The little kim character was on point even the way she spit those lyrics in the bedroom. According to Naturi Naughton who played the role of little kim she never rapped before but you couldn't tell the way she flowed. When she performed in that lacey outfit towards the end you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between her and kim. The biggie character played by gravy was also on point as well. The voice, build and complexion was spot on. When the faith character sung "I remember" I couldn't believe how great she sang, and it didn't look like she was lip sycn-ing at all. I really enjoyed the movie and it brought me back to those great times in college when I was hooping for Suny Farmingdale.I was disappointed about one thing and that was the drama aspect. Nothing surprised me about it, because everything in the movie we already knew. It wasn't one thing in the movie that left anything to the imagination. It was very predictable because I already knew he sold drugs, he went to jail, then got discovered by puffy, he blew up, then he died. So probably 15 minutes into the movie I pretty much knew what would happen next. I still loved it and the music in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If we're not talking about the impact rapper Christopher "The Notorious B.I.G." Wallace left on the rap world, becoming an icon in his early twenties for his equally cut-throat and poetic lyricism, then we're talking about the finals days and unexpected death of Wallace when he was shot and killed in California in a drive-by shooting. Rarely do we talk much about Wallace's life as young boy, a teenager, and somebody who tried to break into the rap game before being picked up by Sean "Puffy" Combs, who had faith in him and his abilities.George Tillman, Jr.'s Notorious makes a bold attempt at detailing those years and, as a result, produces a captivating biopic, one that is built on complete and total devotion, admiration, disgust, but above all, interest in its character and not his rapping persona. Notorious is about Christopher Wallace, the complex, often contradictory, heavyset man who came from a solid home in New York to become one of the biggest names the rap industry has ever seen before being shot and killed. Not the cocky, flashy, and well-groomed persona he was on stage and on CDs known as "The Notorious B.I.G.." Notorious stars out in humble beginnings, where Christopher was a young kid kept in line by his Jamaican mother Voletta (Angela Bassett), who believes in tough love and discipline, with the bad parts of the neighborhood lurking right around the corner. In the grand scheme - and even compared to the person who is often brought up in conversations about Wallace, Tupac Shakur - Wallace had a very good upbringing, despite living very close to the projects of New York right in the heat of the crack cocaine epidemic that crippled low-income areas. Wallace was told never to leave his front stoop, but seeing all the people dealing drugs on the street not far from his own stoop, he began to idolize them in a way, aspiring to go from "a kid on the stoop to a boy in the streets." In his teenage years, Wallace began dealing drugs and collecting a great deal of money to only be eventually kicked out by his mother, who finds a plateful of cocaine concealed underneath his bed. Much like when Shakur left home as a teenager, Wallace's role models became petty street hustlers. Jail-time and incarcerations came and went, which gave Wallace time to write down his thoughts, which turned into rhymes, which were then worked into cut-throat lyrics that only the genre of rap could fittingly handle and accept. Despite this, in his teenage years, Wallace still said, "the streets were my wife, while my music was the bitch on the side." That all changed after record companies began looking to expand their line of rap artists, one in particular being Sean Combs' Bad Boy Records, who saw the untold potential in Wallace and signed him to a deal. From there on out, it was a road of considerable highs, testing lows, and incredible experiences, from having several kids with several different women, getting caught up in the bitter and violent East Coast/West Coast rivalry in the rap game, and trying to keep friends close while the going gets tough.Notorious illustrates these bitter environments through slick, black-and-teal cinematography, colored and coordinated by Michael Grady in an intense way. The film keeps this color scheme throughout most of the film, and when it doesn't, it captures its brighter scenes with hues of orange and yellow, often showing a beautiful, contrasting array of vivid colors. The film's look is beautiful, and that's one of the ways the film keeps you in tuned with what is occurring. However, at the forefront of all of the events in the film is Jamal Woolard, a real find of an actor. A New York-born rapper, Woolard seems to know the environment of the streets well, or at least does a great job acting like he does. Woolard plays Wallace with nothing but conviction, turning emotional scenes into scenes that bear real emotion (consider when he tries to calm down his long-suffering wife Faith (Antonique Smith) the first time) and darker, more brutal scenes (consider when he threatens Faith after a shocking discovery) into a powerhouse of performance and feeling. Woolard is an unstoppable force in the film, and the chemistry he forms with Bassett, while likely to find itself unmentioned by the abundance of events and ideas going on in the film, deserves a mention as well. Bassett's tough-love character further builds Wallace as a character, and we can see in the scenes where Woolard and Bassett are the only two present that she is affecting him in such a way that can barely be described but can seriously be felt.Writers Reggie Rock Bythewood and Cheo Hodari Coker form a compelling narrative when there could've easily been a shortchanging one. With one-hundred and twenty long minutes to fill, Bythewood (who also wrote Spike Lee's incredible drama Get on the Bus) and Coker go through the events of Wallace's life and fill them with character, humanity, and style. With that, they also take careful time to illustrate Wallace as the complex figure he was, often saying one thing, but doing something else. The film doesn't make the case he was a role model, frequently being unfaithful to his girlfriends and children, and going back on his word several times in the face of turmoil and uncertainty, but paints him more as a figure that came to define some of rap music's core elements.Notorious is a rousing biopic, never boring, filled with invigorating and memorable music, some of which even performed by Woolard himself, and bearing very skilled people in the writing and directing fields to assure justice was done to one of rap music's most charismatic and defining figures.Starring: Jamal Woolard, Angela Bassett, Derek Luke, Antonique Smith, and Anthony Mackie. Directed by: George Tillman, Jr..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good biopic...but lacking something</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no doubt that this is a decent biopic. It covers the life of Notorious BIG and charts his hip hop career, creating a character that people can connect to and believe in. The musical side of the story is interesting, especially the representation of how BIG crafts his lyrics. However, it falls down on the representation of his home life. To be a genuine biopic, I would have expected the film to spend more time on his clearly troubled relationships, especially with women. It seems that the film is enamoured with the hip hop side, which is fine, but that would make it a musical biopic, not a genuine biopic of his life.On the whole, though, it is a enjoyable, interesting, kicking-back-on-Saturday-night-after-work film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a 62 year-old white male and LOVED this movie and still do after seeing it 6 times now. I bought Life After Death the day after it was released and still listen to it because Big's music absolutely resonates. Everyone who had anything to do with this movie did a much better job at it than what I could have. $20M is a small budget enterprise and I wouldn't be surprised to learn that sourcing funding was a challenge considering the subject. I think Jamal Woolard did an outstanding job for a first-timer; the man was on the mark! Were some facts glossed over ? In all likelihood... Hey, I've seen 10's of thousands of films and have yet to view the perfect movie, this one included. But there are no other movies on this subject to compare this to and there ain't gonna be a sequel. Give this movie some time to grow on people. I think it has definite staying power. A superior movie experience will give you a movie handover. You'll be thinking about it for awhile, it'll be nagging at your subconscious the day after. There are some unforgettable scenes in this flick. I could never get close to Pac or Biggie in real life ( they're probably freak out . . . white bread . . . ), so this provides the only avenue to get a glimpse into that other, amazing world. I appreciate everyone's effort to bring the story of Poppa to a wider audience. Thx for listenin....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Were the children really considered?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I waited until I could purchase the movie to watch it, and as I have been with so many life films, I was hurt. There is already enough crime on the streets without our Black sisters and brothers who pull themselves up from poverty hating on each other. I find it tearful that the mother of Tupac and BIggie can hug and be reasonable, but this should have happened years ago. Yes money changes people if only in the way that you have more business choices to make, but it DOES NOT have to change the love and respect you have for your fellowman. The scenes with Lil Kim was so unfair. It shows you right off who the film makers respect, and it was not Kim. So what? Did Biggie have a camera in the private moments with Kim? Why was it necessary to dumb down someone who to this day can be respected. Why was it EVER OK to use the real life son of Biggie? Considering the fast life Biggie led, his offspring will already suffer with public opinion and scorn, so why include a CHILD in this mess? Does he not have enough to overcome to be a productive citizen, husband, father, friend?(consider OJ's children.) Sometimes I cannot be proud of the way our people have come up when we should, because I am always afraid of greed, jealousy and desire to the top gun. I don't know if Biggie was behind the murder of Tupac. I suspect he was indeed angry about some public things said about his family, but I would like to think he was bigger than that to resort to murder. However, I do agree with the thoughts that someone closer to Pac and Biggie in the music world did do this. When people have public display of "upsetness", that gives others the possibility of getting rid of money makers and passing the possibility of murder to others. Do what you want, but one day you will no longer be able to hide your crime, and that is the time and the one you should fear!!!!! I have not heard a lot about Faith, but please know, Biggie and no other man is worth the wear and tear on our minds, bodies and general health. There should be no reason for the women in this movie to be against each other. Neither could have done anything with Biggie if he had not allowed it. Be bigger than TUPAC and BIGGIE and don't wait until a tragedy to know that you ladies should have no beef with each other. In making the movie, people know that if one person is glorified and another dumbed down, it is usually from someone who pretends to know the biggest, the best the most important in the life a man who could have used his gain for the generation following him. TO the ones alive and involved with the whole situation, the world will love you more when you show love for each other. TO BIGGIES'S LADIES...DON'T WAIT UNTIL ANOTHER TRAGEDY before your offspring see you being mature and hugging each other. Clean up now for the next possible world entertainers!!!! Prayerfully submitted...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I thought this was an amazing movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally, I thought the movie was great, especially for a biopic. All the characters were played out perfectly and matched who they were set to be. A lot of speculation has been going on about how Anthony Mackie was 2Pac was weak. Personally, I thought he did a very good job. However, as good as he was, he couldn't carry out the power and respect 2Pac carried with him his life. However, there will be one and only 2Pac and you will never be able to get someone to represent him completely. Also, I think Jamal Woolard is a good actor, and studies Biggie well, but I just didn't feel he was Biggie. He doesn't sound like him either. You notice how different they sound when Jamal raps Biggie's lines in Juicy. Other than that, I loved the movie and I highly encourage people to go out and see it, definitely my favorite biopic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Simple Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just finished watching this. I like to just give honest reviews without going too much into the characters and plot and spoiling ot for everyone.The Good Points - Good music, great casting the lead actor stands out as B.I.G and as always Angela Bassett is reliable as ever,not sure of the complete story but the movie looked as if it tried it's best to portray an honest account of his life.The Bad Points - Appeals to a particular type of audience, leaves you with mixed feelings afterwards.Overall - Not a movie which will appeal to everyone, I enjoyed it but then again I like that type of music, it's a decent enough film but like I said before it leaves you with mixed feelings towards the mighty B.I.G and his life and the problem is the truth of his life will probably never be revealed so you feel a little cheated somehow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Notorious B.I.G</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film could almost be seen as a glorified documentary of the rise and fall of Chistopher Wallace, A.K.A Biggy Smalls/Notorious B.I.G. As the storyline unveils, the audience seems to try and integrate themselves into BIG's character, however it is not as well directed as it really could have been and this was a huge disappointing factor of the movie. I mean that the events about his life are true but they are not precise, that whole scandal with Tupac was broad and the unnecessary scenes with him and the guns are just useless. To be honest, personally I was expecting a lot from this movie, because i was hoping that it would unravel the story of a true east coast rap legend; which was eventually the true intention of the film. A few more scenes with his inspiration for writing good lyrics could have better incorporated the audience, but "gimme some weed and Pepsi" just doesn't cut it, well especially not for me. Despite this, I am still happy with the film but I can't stop thinking on what a hit this movie would be if it was better directed. If some more scenes were added about his music , his "struggle" intensified and he build-up to his death more seat-gripping then I truly feel this could have been one of the best movies of the year. (Remember that Notorious BIG was one of the first rappers to come off the streets and make something for himself.) The film was overall nothing more than a 6/10 because of the lack of emotion and build-ups, but I did like the respect he always gave to his mother, and the change of personality BIG showed just before Tupac's death. Mutual respect was indeed created, too bad he had to suffer the east coast/west coast conflict and that it was too late... Overall a good attempt at representing the true change in the life of a black man from NY.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>doing it BIG</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where do I begin when talking about Notorious, the movie was fantastic. I think George Tillman Jr did a great job with the cast. I think all the actors did a great job of filling the role. I also enjoyed how the film was set up, taking you from his death back to his childhood and then through his life.The thing in my mind that stood out the most was I hate to say it but it wasn't a documentary like Tupac's resurrection. This was an actual movie with real actors. It really showed us who Biggie was and helps explain some of the reasons for the things that happened in his life. At the time that this was all taking place I was to young to understand. As I got older I started to listen to more and more Tupac and Biggie. I learned about what really went on in his life, and how he told a story about life in every song.Another thing that helped make this movie great was they were able to show everything he did with his life from drugs on the street, to marriage with children. They didn't glorify him for selling drugs, but stressed the point that it was all he could really do for money at the time. When it came time for him to clean up his act and become an artist he did just that and changed his focus.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Film bio of rapper Notorious BIG is good for what it is but rather artificial. Gosh darn it everyone is so nice and sweet that you really can't imagine why anyone would want to kill him. This is the life of a gangster rapper? Strangely compelling despite the feeling that its all a highly buffed version of the truth (never let your mom tell your story), its worth a look, but not really worth seriously considering as anything other than a place holder until a real version comes along. Its a shame that the excellent cast didn't a better film where they could really let go instead of making nice.6 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Notorious" is not a film for everyone. Its tailored for those who approve of the Notorious B.I.G. and many of the things he at one time stood for: gangs, drugs, drug dealing, violence, sex and so on. But what else would you expect from a film about a drug dealer turned No. 1 rapper of all time? Anyone else who really objected to this film should probably stop the "lets pick a movie title randomly out of a hat" game and learn at least a general premise about what they are in store for. On the other hand; I know people who enjoy watching films which contain content they will object to. That's me."Notorious" was a fairly, well archived(though biased) biography of Christopher Wallace, the Notorious BIG. The film begins with BIG as a child, followed by the discovery of his talent, the rise to international fame and his ultimate demise. The film does a good job of showing how influential and controversial the hip-hop culture was in the mid-90's and how a gangster celebrity status can be short-lived. Jamal Woolard did well in my opinion as the star. He looked, talked, rapped and moved like BIG. To my disappointment, practically everyone else provided only a "filler" sense. What may not sit well with others is that the film never really gets into the feud between BIG &amp; Pac, which ultimately results in the their premature deaths. But the theory that "mo money mo problems," means exactly that, rings loud and clear.The acting was overall fair(5/10). This movie does a good job of portraying BIG and poor in re-enacting everyone else in BIG's environment. All but Lil' Kim, who does do a good job in playing BIG's lifelong mistress. Everyone else's characters were two-dimensional and were merely informational. Enough said.Filmography and dialog overall were OK(6/10). The staff fudged on expenses where they thought necessary and anyone critical may be annoyed with some scenes and conversations.Music was excellent(10/10). The film played all the crowd favorites and if anything assisted in scenes lacking visual effect.Content was good 8/10. The movie was obviously biased(no surprise gauging by who funded the film) and was more of a pseudo-factual epic memorial than a biography. But thats really what I was looking for; a glamorous snapshot of an unaccepted lifestyle and how it doesn't work out. I got what I expected, an enjoyable film about a mid-90's musical icon. BIG may have not invented rap, but he certainly made some of the best examples of what gangster rap and status rap implies. If someone were to study the evolution of hip-hop culture 100 years from now, BIG's music WILL make for some of the token samples.If someone needs a REAL cinema-style biography, give someone like Oliver Stone the green light. Hope a 2Pac epic comes out to balance.7/10 TD</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie opens January 16, 2009. OK. First, whoever was the casting director for Notorious did a great job finding an actor to portray Biggie. Now don't get me wrong, the other actors were also good, but Jamal Woolard was a very good Biggie. From profile, to voice, to the acting itself, he played Biggie very well. Another person who acted well was Derek Luke who played Sean "Puffy" Combs. He may not have resembled Puffy, but he definitely had is mannerisms on point. From Puffy's signature dance, to the way he interacted with people. I also liked the fact they used Biggie's real son (Christopher Jordan Wallace) to play him as a kid. Does Lil' Kim (Naturi Naughton) look familiar? She should, she sang with group 3LW. Rumor has it they could have picked a better Tupac, but since the movie was about Tupac, then it's all good, right? Speaking of Pac, aren't they making a movie about him? The movie gives no opinion as to who to blame for the shootings of both Biggie and Pac. So it makes the movie that more entertaining by not being clouded by opinions. I would like to call it a bio pic, but I do not know much of Biggie's life which makes me no authority on Biggie's biography. The movie makes you want to buy a Biggie CD (even if you have them at home) and play it on repeat. The music brought you back to the good ole days, I was actually waiting for someone to start dancing in aisle in the theater. The acting is good, the music is better. If you can get past who is playing what in the movie and who is not in the movie, then you should definitely watch Notorious.</fullReview>

And by storm it was, it shows Biggies rise to the top. the acting was impressive Jamal Woolard did wonderfully as biggie. also if your interested in rap a few other familiar stars were involved like Diddy, 2 pac,Lil Kim etc. I learnt a lot of this movie and the truth behind Biggie, things i didn't no before. Also the drama between west coast and the east coast was also explained in this movie. all in all a great inspiring movie with impressive strong acting. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This could have been a great film. This could have really given us an insight to the life of Notorious BIG. This however was not.It was in fact a completely biased film which simply tries to glorify Notorious BIG, making him seem so ameliorated and sanctimonious, that it destroys any real feeling left in this film.It was produced by his mother and by Sean Combs (aka Puffy, Puff Daddy), so it can be expected that a level of bias was there. However, if your a fan of Tupac or Lil Kim (as i am) then you'll find this film to be insulting as well. All in all, i would suggest that if your a real fan of hip hop, don't watch it, unless you are a die hard love Biggie fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, especially if one doesn't relate to hip-hop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked this movie--mostly because it gave me insight and understanding for the world of hip-hop. I don't love the music, although by now I don't really notice it, and even some of it has likeably good rhythm. But the point here is that the despite the misogynist &amp; violent lyrics, I now have more tolerance for how they came to be. I think the movie is a bit slow at times, the characterizations a bit stereotyped, the relationships a bit simplified--nevertheless, the humanity involved does come across.One point made in the movie is that Biggie was smart--(the scene in the math class when he solves the problem no one else wants to tackle and he has even been cutting class). But the question that I ask is, was he the huge success because he was sufficiently smart and then lucky to partner with Puffy? Or was he extremely smart and missed his chance to become something more traditional and still be successful --like a senator? (not to mention, President!)Talking about smart, I think what comes across in the movie is that Biggie's mother had Emotional Intelligence, and Biggie didn't--but he did have Musical Intelligence. It's a good movie, perhaps even a better movie for those of us who have very little knowledge of the world it portrays.Lastly, I was disappointed that the movie didn't play the song that Puffy &amp; Faith Evans made for Biggie, a remake of "I'll Be Missing You". For years, I have listened to this rap version with Faith's gospel voice interweaving-- a truly beautiful rendition, but I never knew the significance of this song. It would have been a perfect song to use during the final credits.</fullReview>

The actor who played Biggie was not believable at all. The only thing that made it semi watchable was the occasional female nudity. The actor who played tupac also played "Papa Doc" from "8 Mile" and was much better in that movie. This movie was definiely over hyped and over produced. It seemed like they had enough movie to make a great movie, but I just wasn't feeling it from the actors themselves. They need to go back to acting school and relearn the basics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>flawed but compelling biography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The biopic "Notorious," directed by George Tillman Jr., tells of the life and career of Notorious B.I.G., the gangsta' rapper who was gunned down on the streets of L.A. at the age of twenty-four. B.I.G. began life as Christopher Wallace, a kid being raised by a single mother in Brooklyn who, despite her best efforts, was unable to keep her son from falling prey to the destructive influences of life on the street. For by the age of twelve, he had already begun dealing drugs and, by seventeen, had dropped out of school and served time in prison on a weapons charge. But it was his talent for rapping - for putting into words and music his reflections on what it meant to be a black man living in the inner city - that brought him to the attention of Sean "Puffy" Combs, founder of Bad Boy Records, who signed Wallace, now known as Biggie Smalls, to his first recording contract.Soon, B.I.G. was a major figure in the gangsta' rap scene, adored by his fans, hated by his enemies and partaking in the fruits of all that the "high life" of a mass market celebrity had to offer: namely, wealth, fame, fashion, women, and an unlimited access to guns and drugs. But as with all such tales, it would seem, Biggie ultimately found himself on an irreversible slide towards self-destruction, culminating in his assassination on Wilshire Boulevard on March 9, 1997, a victim, in part, of the life he lived and of outside forces he was simply unable to control (his killers, incidentally, were never identified)."Notorious" is less interesting for the admittedly rather predictable cautionary tale and domestic drama it relates than for the glimpses it affords us into the hip-hop and gangsta' rap scene of the 1990s. The sounds and fashions of the culture are successfully recreated on screen, backed by generous helpings of B.I.G.'s music that come in the form of stage performances and background accompaniment for much of the action.The film really hits its stride when it focuses on the famed and ultimately bloody feud that developed between Bad Boys Records on the East Coast and Death Row Records on the West, whose figurehead, Tupac Shakur, came to believe that B.I.G. had a hand in a botched attempt on his life. This real-life thug opera that played itself out in the media ultimately turned deadly when, first, Tupac, and then B.I.G. himself met similar fates at the barrel of a gun.The movie is most notable for the performance of rapper Jamal Woodard in the title role, who not only looks amazingly like the original Biggie but manages to sound quite a bit like him as well. It is Woodard who makes B.I.G. both the larger-than-life figure and the regular human being he needs to be to be believable. He receives strong support from Derek Luke as Combs; Anthony Mackie as Tupac; Naturi Naughton as protégé and sometime love interest Lil Kim; and Angela Bassett as his long-suffering mother who seemed to be the one rock-solid moral force B.I.G. had in his life. In fact, it is the scenes between mother and son that ultimately serve as the heart and soul of the movie.For purposes of mass consumption and in the interest of burnishing B.I.G.'s posthumous reputation, the screenplay by Reggie Rock Bythewood and Cheo Hodari Coker provides a sunnier and more upbeat assessment of the man's final days than is, perhaps, warranted by the facts, but those who made the movie can't really be blamed for wanting to cast their subject in the most positive light possible, especially in the summary moments. It may take some of the edge off the movie in the final analysis, but not enough to spoil the many fine qualities it still has to offer.</fullReview>

If you were a fan of Notorious, watch this flick, but if you weren't, miss this one without blinking twice.Performances: Jamal Woolard is superb as Chris Wallace/Notorious. Christopher 'CJ' Jr, Wallace is perfect. Angela Basset is exceptional in a supporting role. Derek Luke is quite effective.

And not everyone that talks about or acts like a real hustler or mafia guy is really it. (Not minimizing B.I.G. life's story, i mean, how could i?)

		<shortDescription>Mediocre recap of a great man.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Notorious is a film that fails to succeed completely because of its inability to cross between cultures. It's too familiar for the people who would actually be interested in seeing it, and it's too inept and poorly-paced to make converts of the sort of people who would need convincing. It has a good number of the same problems that all music biopics do: it's overlong, many of its actors seem to be merely imitating the characters, and it fails to bridge the gap between good, bad and real. Reading reviews of the film after writing this writing, I had to go back an append it for something I noticed: most of the reviewers that have no connection to this genre of music seemed to feel that Biggie came off as a wholly unlikeable individual that the film not only failed to explain to outsiders why he is so loved, but made those in a neutral position shift towards the negative.Watching the film, I felt it balanced the tone well between the redeeming charm and innate goodness, and the lunkheaded, morally ambiguous badness, but I wonder how much of that is due to my overt familiarity with the artist himself. Being someone who knows the words to almost every song he made, my opinion and familiarity of the man made Notorious a series of cinematic reenactments of events and recordings and stories that I've heard a thousand times. Like someone watching an adaptation of a book they've read hundreds of times, I ended up focusing on the recreation more than the storytelling, so I can understand the reactions based on the difference in point of view.The Notorious B.I.G. was such a unique, memorable individual that any attempt to emulate or inhabit him would be nothing but an imitation, and the role as essayed by first-timer Jamal Woolard is one of someone who studied really hard trying to learn his specifics, instead of someone who gets the heart of the man. He can ride a track just fine, but in dialogue, his voice sounds more like Shyne than Biggie, which is fitting considering that accusations of being a poor man's Biggie were leveled at Shyne until he took that gun charge for Puffy. Speaking of Puffy, Derek Luke's acting is more of a mockery than an imitation, which is odd considering that Puffy is an executive producer. Then again, it almost balances the fact that Puffy as a character is whitewashed to the point of almost being a guardian angel. He's not seen in much detail, but when he is, it's only to serve as a catalyst to success, a shining beacon of Right. Being essentially a budget production, the rest of the no-name cast is uneven. Praise should go to most of the female actors. Angela Bassett actually does get Voletta Wallace, from her disposition to her accent, Ex-3LW member Naturi Naughton similarly gets Lil' Kim (as well as naked), and Antonique Smith is a dead ringer for Faith Evans. On the other hand, Anthony Mackie zaps 2Pac of all his humanity, and an even more fascinatingly divergent character than Biggie turns into a gibbering, ignorant hooligan, despite Biggie's slack narration about how "complicated" he was. Sean Ringgold makes Suge Knight as a big, threatening man, but fails to recreate Knight's simmering menace, brought to the forefront by his version of the Source Awards clip, one of the most played and infamous moments in the entire beef.In the end, though, it's the technical aspects that let the film down even more than the acting. The direction is uninspired and mostly observatory, point-and-shoot stuff. The writing is a combination of lack of effort and lack of ideas. Half of the film writes itself since the entire situation is so well-documented, both in the media and by Biggie himself. In fact, the film's biggest weakness is to emulate Biggie's talent for speech and wordplay. Notorious the man, was a great speaker because he had a talent for painting vivid pictorials and bringing humanity into otherwise sketchy situations, while Notorious the movie brings to us a dull narration and a proclivity for awkwardly rounded storytelling (i.e. he finally finds his Meaning of Life minutes before being gunned down) that just makes everything seem blunted (and not the good kind).The man who famously said he went "from ashy to classy" has been done a disservice by the people who care about him the most. To keep that metaphor, this film needs some damn lotion. If you're interested in the facts of the legendary coast battle that led to the death of "the black Frank White" as well as Tupac Shakur, maybe look into the documentary Biggie &amp; Tupac (which I have not seen) as well as the excellent Tupac: Resurrection (which I have). If you want to know about all the details of Biggie's backstory, just pick up a copy of Biggie's Ready to Die and put it on track 10. Or, go to YouTube and type in "notorious b.i.g. juicy", and you'll be able to see the recreation of the event with Chris Wallace himself in the role of Biggie. Notorious lasts 123 minutes. "Juicy" lasts a twenty-fifth of that length, and is twice the artistic achievement. That track's a 10. Notorious? 'Bout a 5.{Grade: 5/10 (C) / #1 (of 1) of 2009}</fullReview>

When I was watching Notorious, the film about the late rapper Notorious B.I.G., I had a hard time finding anything enjoyable about it at all. The film tells the story of Notorious B.I.G.(Jamal Woolard) , his short time of fame, and his rise and fall. It shows his relationships between his wives, girlfriend, his mother, and Tupac,until(spoiler alert for anybody who actually cares)his death in 1997.I know i'm disrespecting the dead here, but this guy was not likable. He was a cheater. He cheated on his wife, he cheated on his mistress, he cheated on his mistress's mistress. He was a bad father, a bad son, a bad husband, and(please don't kill me, America), a bad musician.I don't like any of his songs, so thats why the extended concert sequences(there are plenty of them)get very aggravating after a while. Watching him do all of this stuff really got under my skin. Every time he would screw somebody, I would think" who in their right minds would screw him?"I was also thinking," How could anybody enjoy a movie about a fat black adulterer who does a lot of drugs and never stops?" I know I don't. I really started hating the film once Biggie grew up, which took about five minutes. Obviously, the director was a fan, and this is a love letter to him. But the end is the thing that really got under my skin. It shows all of this footage of people who were heartbroken after he died. And I was thinking"He wasn't Jesus". They made it seem like he'd done something for America. I know what he did: He took up space.I am not a racist. And i'm sorry for all the fans i've disrespected in this one review. But I really couldn't stand this repetitive and boring biopic that doesn't really go anywhere. I really hated this movie. "Birthdays was the worst days, now we're drinking champagne when we're thirstay". Thats a B.I. G. quote. The movie will want you to go chug some scotch afterwards. Skip it.D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bling-bling to the grave</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Christopher George Latore Wallace, born in 1972, grew up in the mean streets of Brooklyn; became the leading East Coast rapper known as Biggie Smalls or the Notorious B.I.G; and then, in Los Angeles, apparently a victim of the 1990's East Coast-West Coast hip-hop feud, was shot dead in a car at the age of 24. We know that from scene one, and the rest is one long flashback narrated by the dead man, spoken with the wisdom of one whose first album was called "Ready to Die." Perhaps oddly, though its hero's fickleness and irresponsibility as a husband and father are amply chronicled and his mother is rarely happy with him, this is one musical screen life that's more full of the joy of making it big than the sorrow of hard knocks.This biopic is notable for its casual bling-bling look. Warm-colored closeups abound and in grainy night shots even the car headlights look like giant flashy diamonds. It's notable too for the natural charisma of the hefty and talented newcomer Jamal Woolard in the title role, and for the shocking explicitness and sexual vulgarity of the women's rap performances. Two of the women in the man's life were themselves hip-hop and sou artists, Lil' Kim (Naturi Naughton) and Faith Evans (Antonique Smith). The third was Jan (Julia Pace Mitchell,) his neighborhood girl and mother of his first child, a daughter. 'Notorious' is, up to a point, itself a product of hip-hop culture, exuding its abundance of energy, bad behavior, and danger, and not at all notable for a critical perspective. But director Tillman knows how to make stuff happen, and keep on happening. The movie's replete with convincing scenes, dialogue, and hip-hop types who make the dancing and brawling feel real. Biggie's own son, as chubby as he no doubt himself was as a boy, even plays the young Chris Wallace.A certain "biopic-itis," as one reviewer calls it, does not sink the film but leaves it scant room to breathe amid the mass of hastily telegraphed incidents crammed in to touch upon all the milestones of the life. Woolard's ease in delivering his spoken lines and drive in rapping make his character engaging and alive. But there should have been more in Reggie Rock Bythewood and Cheo Hodari Coker's screenplay to show what rap and rap-making are about, how Biggie honed his skills and what makes a great rapper better than a decent one. It's good to have a scene of a very young and somewhat nerdy Wallace sitting outdoors writing down rhymes; and the grownup man, incarcerated, filling marbleized notebooks with his verses. And there are enough performance sequences to show what the venues were like in action. You can call me white though, but the rap contest sequence of Eminem, playing an avatar of himself in Curtin Hanson's '8 Mile,' is more interesting in the way it details the verbal sparring than the one that shows Biggie's first signal that he's at the top of the game. This is not to say there isn't plenty of music in the film. It's just that the whole idea of making rhymes that dazzle like diamonds and shame the competition is a little too much taken to granted for what is, after all, a (warts and all) celebration of the life.The 1972's was the height of the crack epidemic, and as a youth Wallace sells the drug to make money. His relationship with his Jamaica-born mother Violetta Wallace, a pre-school teacher, played appealingly by Angela Bassett, is faithful enough to make him hide his flash threads and dirty deals from her. She loves and nurtures him; things are so cozy and bourgeois she calls him "Chrissie-poo." He gets good grades and Violetta pushes him to work hard. But eventually he begins missing two thirds for his classes. Then he messes up and goes to jail. Later he could have been sent up for five years or more, but his childhood friend D-Roc (Dennis L.A. White) takes the rap so he can pursue his career. The movie celebrates friendship and glosses over enmity. Biggie links up with Sean "Puffy" Combs (Derkk Luke), who has a major setback. Fired from the label Bad Boy Records, Puff starts his own Uptown label and never loses his positivity. Even Biggie's continued drug dealing to support his little girl isn't seen as a minus. The movie does not judge. Though this is a limitation, it avoids heavy-handedness.It also avoids any explanations of what happens. Since everybody is so positive, including the violent--but like Biggie, smart and talented--Tupac Shakur (Anthony Mackie), the "Cali" star rapper who's depicted as only turning against Biggie due to media hyping the East-West divide, it seems mysterious that both "Pac" and "Big" die of bullet wounds. The only clue is that B.I.G. declared in his first album that he would die a violent death. But even that is not dwelt upon as a theme. The impression this sometimes unpleasant and overlong but lively movie leaves is of too much success and too much bad behavior--strong weed, expansive cars, big checks, French champagne, headlines, all the women you want, and no future. But not for Sean Combs, Puff Daddy, P. Diddy--Sean John for his clothing line. The multi-named star and fashion plate is still alive and well and worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And he produced this movie. "You're gonna wanna see it again," he says. He'd like that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movie based on the life of Biggie Smalls.Without sounding racist, the number #1 person this movie will appeal to is young black youths. i seen the movie at the theater, and there were only 2 other white people there- the rest were black kids aged 15-23 I'd say- most of em laughed whenever Biggie Smalls said something that the film makers intended to be funny.it was okay- had all the shiny bland production values of a typical Hollywood movie, failed to portray life as gritty and shitty like it is, but I've seen a lot worse. i'm sure this guy went through a lot more sh't to get to the top though... this movie makes it look like becoming a super star is a walk in the park (which can be said for A lot of movies), and we all know the answer to that...there's not much to say about the performances and story, as most people can probably guess the flow of the movie before it even starts- Biggie Smalls roses from the gutter in Brooklyn to rappa super stardom, then got shot by west coast gangsters in 1997- so it's pretty easy to conceive of what happens in the film based on the semantics of a usual Hollywood biography.4.8/10- nothing special, but worth a watch if you've nothing to do</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a bad bad film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a few people on here saying that this is a good film, and that it is a very honest 'feel-good' movie. These people know nothing about movies or The Notorious B.I.G.OK so firstly, this film is not a factual account of the events in his life, AT ALL! There are huge portions that have been left out in favour of endlessly dragging out minor details to fill some sort of void of idiocy. It is massively 'Hollywoodized', and many facts have been left out in order to make Wallace out to be a much better man than he really was (which is much the case when a celebrity dies young). Oh, and the picture painted of Tupac Shakur is one bordering on the psychotic. Tupac is made out to be the bad guy during their feud in a BIG way, and I would like to see someone make a movie from HIS point of view.NOTE: Come to think of it, I think the movie would be more passable if they changed all of the names and locations in order to make it totally fictional, in favour of pseudo-fictional.Secondly, even if you ignore the facts not being accurate, it's easy to see how poorly made this movie is. It looked as though they used cardboard sets straight out of a cheap soap opera; the direction and cinematography was awful; and the script was full of 'people-wouldn't-say-that-in-real-life' ridiculousness!! On top of that, around 60% of the acting in this movie was pretty damn poor.My advice is: DO NOT watch this movie, unless of course, you have the opportunity to watch it for free.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know what?,I haven't even seen the movie yet,but i certainly to intend to do so because i feel that this movie was made to cause more friction between 2Pac and Biggie fans OK and the fact that Sean "Puffy" Combs or P.Diddy or whatever he calls himself these days,is a producer on the credits list doesn't make me feel any better about the situation.Every die hard rap fan knows that this movie was made to glorify Biggie and to kick dirt on 2Pac and make it look like everything that happened was 2Pac's fault.Everyone knows Puff and Biggie started it after 2pac was shot outside Quad Studios with that song called "Who Shot Ya?". A song saying that pretty much they were responsible for that shooting.That they set him up.And they did because neither Puff nor Biggie were nearly as talented as Tupac nor were they smarter than him either.I dearly and greatly hope that someone out there in showbiz puts out a movie about 2Pac to set the record straight.Just to me,there was never any comparison between 2Pac and Biggie and I never understood what all the fuss was about over Biggie being so great because i've listened to Biggie and Pac's music and to me Pac's far outweighs Biggie's.Even in record-sales,it's a fact.Not to mention the fact that this is just another way for Sean Combs to milk Biggie some more to get money because as a rapper himself in my opinion was garbage.He sucked!P.Diddy,and pretty much Bad Boy Records in general sucked!Death Row records had far better artists than Bad Boy.So please someone out there make a real 2Pac movie, not a documentary this time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Notorious Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ask lovers of hip hop who they consider to be the greatest rapper of all time, many would answer Notorious B.I.G. For hip hop cronies who feel that Notorious B.I.G.'s storytelling lyrics and rhythmic melodies have made an impression on their life, the premiere of "Notorious" is a much anticipated release."Notorious" is a story that charts Christopher Wallace's rise to fame from a Brooklyn street hustler to one of the most influential rappers of hip hop generation. The film sheds light on the hardships, life and relationships that B.I.G often spoke about in his rhymes.Watching the story of Christopher Wallace unfold was extremely interesting because it truly revealed the man behind the music.Christopher Wallace was played by first time actor, Jamal Woolard. Woolard did an admirable job portraying Wallace and was the only actor that Veleta Wallace, B.I.G.'s mother, felt could truly portray her son. Woolard gained nearly a hundred pounds, spoke with cotton balls in his mouth and studied B.I.G.'s every mannerism to dramatize him effectively. Outside of Woolard's adequate efforts to portray B.I.G, he naturally has a close resemblance to the rapper. Faith Evans, B.I.G.'s ex wife, said that on set she was taken aback by how much Woolard resembles B.I.G.B.I.G.'s son Christopher Jordan Wallace plays B.I.G. as a child and young teenager. On B.I.G.'s rise to fame he became friends with Lil' Kim played by 3LW singer, Naturi Naughton. Angela Bassett did an acceptable job playing B.I.G.'S mother. B.I.G. became a national recording artist with the help of P. Diddy played by Derek Luke. Luke's portrayal of Sean "Puffy" Combs is dead on from Diddy's swag and energy to his hunger for greatness. Faith Evans was played by novice actress Antonique Smith, who also closely resembles her character and has good singing chops.The movie also shed light on the relationship between B.I.G. and west coast rapper 2pac. It showed how the east coast-west coast beef between the two rappers began and escalated. Making the nonsense behind B.I.G. and 2pac's death seem even more senseless. 2pac was portrayed by Anthony Macky, who got the part after playing 2pac in a play at Julliard.The cinematography in this movie was fickle, changing noticeably from scene to scene. The movie also seemed to move too fast on certain scenes leaving no chance for the viewer to connect. The music is one of the most important and enjoyable parts of the movie. Hearing some of Notorious B.I.G.'s hit songs is very much a delight. The movie is a good portrayal of the rise of Notorious B.I.G. but did not meet the expectation of some movie goers. If you're a hip hop fan then you'll like this movie and if you're not then you may want to wait to check it on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Avoid the crowd - Get it on DVD - on the day it comes out ;-)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Notorious was a decent movie - that arrived about 3 years past its ideal date - but I have to say, I think they took some liberties with the film. For instance, Sean "Puffy" Combs is portrayed solely as a mentor and friend to BIGGIE but I think this has a lot to do with his executive producer credit. Make no mistake, its still a good film with a killer soundtrack - but lets not mistake this for anything more than an average biopic. Good effort by Jamal Woodard as B.I.G. but as for movie vets, Derek Luke and Angela Bassett? I was left feeling . . . feeling like something was missing. Luke did well enough playing that ass clown, Puffy, but why did he do it? Probably for the paycheck only. Angela Bassett flowed in and out of the Jamaican accent - with in this case - made it hard for us to believe her as Voletta. Naturi Naughton had a good turn as Lil Kim but I was not happy with the amount of gratuitous nudity they displayed when it came to her. But I blame that on the director solely. Anthony Mackie was horrible as the late Tupac Shakur....just horrible! Antonique Smith was really impressive in her role as Faith Evans. We really believed in the chemistry between her and Woolard. In the end, I think all eyes should be on the two of them in this one and I hope Jamal finds some other opportunities to be a leading man. Black and sexy as ever - Jamal....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So...why aren't these rappers played by, you know, themselves? The not-dead ones, I mean. I thought these fools did anything for money? Isn't that how you get into rap in the first place? Being better at talking quickly and to a beat than being on your back (or knees, as the case may be)? There's a reason porn stars aren't very good at their lines; porn doesn't usually need talking, and so they only have to look good. Rappers, on the other hand, are USUALLY god-damn freaking butt-fugly, lending credence to my hypothesis. As to those who say you need 'talent' to rap, well, that may be. I'm not really sure. I personally haven't heard any rap that could be considered 'not a direct ripoff from an established rapper' since, oh, 1995? Kinda hard to tell. They all sound the same.But anyways. P-Diddy isn't quite dead yet, why does he need an actor to play him?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>-- To Balance Out The Rating Bias --</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I may not have otherwise given this film a ten out of ten (likely an eight or so), I felt that Notorious was a terrific film; and I consider myself to be one that appreciates the ART of film making. The following has been affirmed, to the extent that it can be affirmed, by this movie in relation to its IMDb rating: I had always been curious as to why every movie made by Tyler Perry - I know that Notorious is not a Tyler Perry production - had received such a low IMDb ratings while still managing to gain praise elsewhere. I had not a clue as to the explanation for this dynamic until I heard another IMDb member's explanation - from his/her perspective, of course. This individual proposed that the rating bias may have had something to do with the stigma existing against 'Black movies' (i.e. movies featuring issues that primarily pertain to Black characters).Although this claim is fairly bold in the assumptions required to reach such a conclusion, it seems to be the only reasonable explanation. While I have no doubt that a racial bias still exists in society today, regardless of any recent or distant events in the past, I believe that this cinema bias may have a more reasonable root cause than actual racism.If we look at the history of Black film making, as a single body of work, it is obvious that a majority of these films have fallen victim to low budgets (that is simply a fact). If you are willing to recognize that fact, it is reasonable to apply logic to the situation that supposes history leads us to assume; leads us to pass judgment based on prior experience. I indeed realize that this sounds like a great foundation to create a stereotype upon, but in essence it is not based on any group of people. It is based on the fact that Black films have historically received less backing from those in the film industry with the capacity to produce quality material, financially and by means of reputation.INEVITABLE RESULT: when a fine piece of cinematic work is released, it stands less the chance of receiving recognition for it's true value due to an existence of the aforementioned bias.For those curious individuals among you... I happen to be White myself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In response to "are there no good young black actors?", the answer is of course there are. As a matter of fact there were a few brilliant young actors who auditioned for these roles, including Pac, who were not cast because they did not have the "name" to sell the film. Unfortunately that is the sad name of the game at times. To be honest, I don't think this film was made to get Oscar nods. If I do see the film, I am going in not expecting stellar performances so I hope the story is there. Somebody is always going to be displeased with the story who is part of the story. Kim is that person now. Her sexual relationship with Biggie probably did not need to be as explicit as it was as it had no real importance to the story but hey.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unless you were a close friend, classmate, neighbor, relative, or business associate of Christopher Wallace, you would never know the REAL "Biggie Smalls." You knew Biggie Smalls the "media creation" and marketing product of Bad Boy Records.I think this movie gives the indifferent B.I.G. fan another side of his personality. We've all seen the photos of him frowning with his hood "I'm so hard, don't fu** with me" scowl, but how many people saw B.I.G. playing with kids or talking to his Mom? That's where this film delivers. Is it perfect? No. Only a documentary would provide you with raw, gritty, real life truth. This is not a documentary. This is a "mostly truth combined with entertaining Hollywood exaggerated fiction" movie.Bottom line, I enjoyed the film. Jamal Woolard not only carries his weight, but he carries this movie. For someone who is a first-time actor, I was extremely impressed with his performance. If anyone else had played B.I.G., quite frankly, I don't think I would have enjoyed the film. Derek Luke was entertaining at time, Angela Bassett did her normal "concerned mother in the hood" role, and Naturi Naughton gave a balanced performance as X-rated lyricist Lil Kim.But this is Woolard's movie. His performance is by far the heart and soul of this film. Bravo to the young rapper known as "Gravy." I will look out for Woolard's projects from this point forward.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. First of all, you must be stupid to think this movie was supposed to be like Hitchcock's "Notorious" in 1946. There is no relation at all besides the title, like you pointed out, but there is no reason to state that unless you're saying they were supposed to be similar. You're obviously oblivious to the fact that this movie is following the life of Christopher "Biggie" Wallace and it is a true story. This isn't a fairy tale, it doesn't have to show a transformation of any sort. Jamaal Woodward did an excellent job as portraying Notorious and you must not who the rapper was to know this. If you don't know Notorious' life or listen to his music or know anything about him and expect a fairy tale, then don't see this movie. It follows his life in Brooklyn so yeah, there's going to be some swearing and "n words". It's not degrading to black society at all, that's a rough part and it was being accurate.

		<fullReview>I have to say that after hearing about this movie I wasn't too excited. However, once I saw a trailer for the movie on TV, I was hooked and decided I had to check it out. I was a teenager growing up when all of this East Side - West Side stuff was all taking off so it threw me back to when I was a kid. I decided I would give it a try and I was happy I did. The movie shows Biggy growing up from child to teen. Struggling in B-town until he finally finds his outlet of music. I think this is what 8 Mile was trying to show, but just didn't get by with because of the over-written drama...it just didn't seem "real." Anyways, After seeing Notorious I was particularly surprised at the filming and framing of characters in the "artsy" format...with heavyended phone calls leaving half-empty screens of black...it really helped convey some deep emotions on screen. Now the only reason this is getting an 9 and not a 10 is because of the way the film leans towards East Side more. (maybe because P Diddy was producer) but the film makes the West Side (mainly 2 Pac) look like a bunch of straight up nancy boys. Now 2Pac was a Thug and he was a lil more intense then this movie showed. I know it's a film about Biggy, but it didn't dive into the E/W rivalry enough to hook me and think it was real. Now the films actors are nothing short of magnificent. The guy who plays Big should win an award. He had an amazing on-screen talent. I thought that I was really watching Big at most moments on screen. When he shows up with the cane and the pin-stripe suit and those Cazelle sunglasses. That was the perfect attire to show he was B.I.G. Overall...if you are a fan of Biggy..then you will like this film. If you liked VH1 Behind the Music TV Shows...you will like it...If you are a fan of rap music...you will like this. if you are a hardcore West Side Lover..you will hate it.If you like this you may also enjoy Too Legit: The MC Hammer Story (VH1 Made for TV Movie) Summer Dream (The Beach Boys True Life Story)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Derek Luke deserves a standing ovation. Without him, the movie would have been a complete waste. Jamal Woolard and Antonique Smith were good as well, but none of the cast could match the level that Derek Luke set as Puffy. Overall, the three really captured the essence of their characters, as we know them now and knew them then. But, the movie fell short of good characters aside from these three. The biggest disappointment being Anthony Mackie as 2Pac.There must be a shortage of young, black, male actors because Mackie could not carry the essence of 2Pac. He does not physically resemble Pac, though he tried to, he couldn't capture the sense of poetry, serenity, and social consciousness that the world knows 2Pac for. Instead Mackie made 2Pac look irrational, paranoid, and just plain stupid. For that, Mackie should not be invited back to the hip hop movie world.Lil Kim, played by Naturi Naughton (the girl who got kicked out of 3LW), was acted out beautifully, but the actual character was written a little over the top.The biggest flaw of all is the fact that the movie had no interpretation and no real drama. It was a biopic without an opinion. There is no "theory" as to who could have been behind the shootings of 2Pac or Biggie, and I think people would have preferred to see that. Maybe George Tillman Jr. is afraid of repercussions if he expresses an opinion. This movie missed the drama mark by miles. You will notice that as scenes are about to reach their dramatic peak, they are over. You basically wait and wait and wait for the real drama to occur, and you look up and the movie is over.Overall, I'm happy I saw the movie at matinée price and not at regular price.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Notorious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie this past weekend with a group of 20 friends and family. Being a huge all time Biggie fan I was anticipating seeing this movie big time. The movie I thought was phenomenal. The actor who played Biggie was incredible. I thought he had Biggie's facial expressions as well as suaveness down to a tee. I even got goosebumps how close he was to the real thing. Angela Basset as always was great as portraying Biggie's mom. This film was authentic in details as to locations of actual events as well as where Biggie lived and grew up. The only thing is I wish they went into more detail as him growing up as a young kid and who gave him the inspiration to being a rapper. other then that I can't complain at all. If they did go into more detail the movie would have been 3 hours long so I guess thats why they cut it out. Believe you me I would have gladly stood in my seat for 3 plus more hours without a doubt. If your a Biggie fan you will absolutely love this movie and even if your not it doesn't disappoint. This movie should have been given more stars but their are always haters out there...Playa Hater as Biggie would say. Its a must see movie and I hope you all enjoy as much as my wife and I as well as my friends and family did!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Musical bio pics have always been one of my favorite film genres; I've enjoyed everything from Bird &amp; La Bamba to Purple Rain &amp; The Temptations. Ironically the Hip Hop films have always been hit or miss with most mainstream moviegoers. There's been Oscar Winners such as 8 Mile, straight to video flops such as I'm Bout It and forgotten classics like Wild Style. Not since Krush Groove has there's never been a true to life hip hop biopic; finally with Notorious Hip Hop fans now have an excellent film to add to the list. Without a doubt, The Notorious B.I.G. is one of the greatest rappers of all time, so it's only fitting a film is made about his life. Biggie Smalls influence on modern Hip Hop is still relevant today in the lyrical styling of Jay-Z, Nas and countless other New York rappers, bringing his life story to the big screen would require great detail and most all of the right actor. Thankfully director George Tillman Jr. found an amazing talent in lead actor Jamal Woolard. Playing The Notorious B.I.G. from teenager to young man, Woolard gives one of the best lead debuts in recent memory. Woolard fully throws himself into the role Of Biggie, the same Jamie Foxx did in Ray. From his the dialect in his voice, to his swagger with the ladies, Woolard makes the character so believable it's almost as if he never died. Naturi Naughton, formerly of 3LW and Antonique Smith also both make amazing film debuts as Lil Kim &amp; Faith Evans. Naghton is able to invoke the "tough girl" attitude and blunt sexuality, that her real counter part is known for; while Smith could easily serve as stand for the Faith Evans, The supporting cast Angela Basset as Volleta Wallace (Biggie's Mother) and Derek Luke as Sean "Puffy" Combs also both give excellent performances. The only performance in question is Anthony Mackie as Tupac Shakur. Mackie had played Tupac before in the off Broadway play Up Against The Wind, which is why he was given the role, however from the start, Mackie was seen as the wrong choice by Tupac fans to bring Pac to life on screen. Given his limited screen time and story arc I think Mackie (who happens to be one of the finest young black actors working today) does a fine job. It should be noted that Mackie really isn't given a chance to fully embrace Shakur as this is a film about Biggie and not about Tupac. The script by Reggie Rock Blythewood may follow the standard biopic outline, but the performances in the film, the flashy visuals and authentic New York setting are what make the film worthwhile. Notorious is more than a film about Hip Hop, it's the story of a man coming to his own who life was cut to short by senseless violence. After leaving the film, the question lingered in my mind if Biggie and Tupac had just taken a few minutes to settle their differences would they be alive today? I came to the realization that if they were alive then the legacy they both left behind wouldn't be as great as it is today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Notorious is the movie to see of 09 so far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is great. It makes you laugh, cry, and dance. Jamal Woolard plays Biggie perfectly. This movie shows you how interesting Biggie's life really was. Having problems with women, 2pac, his mother, and fame, and how he lives through it. Then he decides he needs to become a man and take care of his children. Anthony Mackie played 2pac very well also. It seems that this movie tries to make him look like the bad but that's not the case. Derek Luke played Puffy well to with his hunger &amp; determination. Angela Basset was amazing as Voletta Wallace and how strict but loving she was. The ending is a tear jerker. If you want to see a good movie for 2009, go see Notorious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hated this. I mean I REALLY REALLY hate this. I went to see it strictly because I knew that Derek Luke was in it and I think he is a fantastic actor. But not even he could save this dog of a movie. I have seen a lot of bad movies but never bad enough to walk out in the middle of it. The guy who played Biggie sounded like he had an enormous booger stuck in his nose. I also hated the character...there was nothing likable about this movie to me. But hey, if you like to hear the word mother-f***** and the n-word every two seconds, then be my guest. But it got old and infuriating to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found it compelling that Biggies, son played big poppa as a young teenager. Nearest we could ever get to seeing biggie as a little boy. Great film, sad story and Fu&lt; Suge Knight, he contracted the killers in both assassinations, Tupac and Biggie. The sad reality is that big poppa was destined to be the greatest m.c. of all time and his rapid rise to fame was cut too short, silenced by a killer's bullet, or hail of bullets as it were. Too bad Tupac was so easily duped and manipulated by such a psycho as Suge Knight. We will never know what would have happened, it's like Bruce Lee, murdered by a Chinese master for teaching non Chinese. Don't believe what you have read, there were 3 official stories, and he was under a death sentence by the martial arts community. Biggie was just killed because he was a threat to posthumous record sales of Tupac's recordings held by Suge Knight. He has mob ties and corrupt L.A. cops, so the truth will never come out officially.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now Listen If You Love Music and Whats The Inspiration Behind An Artist's Life and Work..You'll Love This Movie. If You Don't Especially Like Hip Hop Music and Don't Care For Cars, Cash and Girls Then You'll Probably Hate It. I loved it. I thought that is was beautifully directed and 90% of the actors did a great job aka Tupac, Violetta Wallace and Lil Cease acting was horrible.This movie was not meant to win awards...it was meant to inspire and show the highs and lows of one man's fame. To people who say that it didn't show any progression and let the characters develop... ITS THE BIG movie and plus it was almost 2 hours long. You cant expect them to go into the lives of everyone or it would be 8 hours long. So Go see the movie I Guarantee you leave the movie learning something about his life that you never knew before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BIGGIE's Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hmmmmmm...... The Vibe in this movie was like the VIBE of the 90's. The Life of Biggie is very fascinating and detailed in NOTORIOUS.First Lets start with the cast........The role of biggie was handled very well by the newcomer actor. The voice and rap were a nice duplicate to BIGGIE. the actor who plays Sean Puffy Combs has a singular role. Lets talk Tupac..... I wish Romeo was still alive from the Steve Harvey Show, to play PAC.. he would have nailed this role. But Pac was shown as a little spoiled kid. I hope in the future they make a PAC movie and get a good actor to play PAC like biggie. I enjoyed this movie! I give it 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally!!!! A great film about hip-hop! Jamal Woodward was perfect in every way. I have been a Biggie fan since the beginning and was blown away by his performance.Most hip-hop movies are far fetched and corny (Get rich or die trying') for example. Never, was this movie corny or fake.I am proud, once again to be a fan of this music.Amazing movie for an amazing artist. A must see, not just for hip-hop fans but, for anyone who doesn't understand hip-hop.I was brought to tears at the end. Even after I lived it the first time.Go see it!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Notorious -Perfectly released on eve of innaugaration and MLK holiday!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I seen this the first night it opened out in Farmingale,Long Island. I was blown away with how realistic Jamal (a/k/a Gravy) Woodward's portrayal of Christopher (Biggie Smalls/Notorious B.I.G./Biggie) Wallace truly was. I thought for a moment that Biggie really was not killed in senseless violence some 10 years ago almost to the day.The resemblance and manneurisms were just uncanny.I only hope that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences takes a good look at this cinematic wonder for consideration and nomination for the 82nd Oscar telecast in Feb 2010. Angela Basset's portrayal of Biggies hard-working mother was also worthy of recognition. I recommend this picture to all, who haven't seen it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The True Story Of The Notorious BIG.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been waiting for this movie for 12 years. It looked like Faith, Lil Kim, and Biggie's older daughter's mother had no self respect according to this movie. Why did they have Naturi from 3LW to play the role of Lil Kim? Why did they have Derek (Antoine Fisher) Luke to play the role of Puffy? They needed an actress as strong as Angela Bassett to play the role of Vonetta Wallace. It was cute having little CJ Wallace to play his dad as a child. 2 Pac and Biggie both died during my senior year of college. The movie portrayed them being tight friends before they were enemies. I see why Lil Kim is upset about this movie now. It portrayed Kim as a whore who was using Biggie. I had to get used to the guy playing Lil Cease as an older teenager and not a little boy actor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Idiotic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Back in the 90's as a teen, I never really got in to Biggie's music or lyrics. I never knew the correlation between HE and all these artists like "Puff Daddy" Faith Evans, Lil Kim all came up together. I never understood how the East Coast West Coast feud got started.The correlation between HE? Where do you people learn English? Adding another name doesn't change anything. HE is a SUBJECT, not an OBJECT - ALWAYS !!! "I love that line in the move "If you wanna change the world, First you've got to change yourself"" This quote means nothing! Of course you can change things without changing yourself. I can change my tire on my car without changing myself. Idiotic quote by a stupid person for stupid people.Hip Hop and Rap are listened to by stupid people who think at Level 1.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Liked this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay first off the movie and the actors in it can never be the actually people but they are portraying them as much as they can. I like the fact that Biggie's son played him as a kid. I like everything about this movie because it gives us the understand from Biggie's eyes. I don't want the opinion on who might have killed Biggie or Pac. We get enough of that from the news and things. I wanted to get an insight on his life and thats what I got from this movie. I have to say that Antonique Smith people said you were good as Faith but now i believe it. I loved Naturi as Lil Kim even if I still know her as 3LW she played Lil Kim. That is the way Lil Kim comes off. Now I don't know Kim Jones but I am just saying from the CDs and videos thats the Lil Kim I know. The only reason this movie isn't a 10 is because I think they could have done a little more talking to Pac's mom or friends to get a more believable Pac. I loved this movie otherwise cant wait for Pac's movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fans of the N word will love this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yo, homies, ya wanna c a reel grayt moo-vee, go watch Idlewild. Dis moo-vee is (blank).The only things in common between this movie and its 1946 namesake is the title. Any other similarities, of which there are none, is purely coincidental. This film is so bad that it is difficult to decide where to start. But start we must. First, the acting. The actor (or "akta")playing the main character had to be reading his lines off a prompter (or is it "prompta'?). His performance has to rank as one of the worst acting jobs in any major feature motion picture. Second, the main character. The main character has no redeeming personality characteristics (or in street "lingo" he "aint cool") in to the movie, which is supposedly based on a true life story (or "stor - e"), the main character is a drug dealing, coke snorting, woman abusing gangster (or should it read "gangsta'")who disrespects ( i.e. "disses") his mother - and throughout the movie he never changes. This guy (or "bro" or "homie") has no qualms about selling crack to a pregnant woman. Third, the use of the N word. If anyone has a thing for the N word, then this movie is for you. This movie will leave you enthralled as the characters loudly call each other by the N word, sometimes as a token of honor and respect, other times when angry. And what makes this even more remarkable and baffling is that it is African-Americans doing the name calling. White people are no where to be found. Fourth, the music. There is rhyming and then there is noise that masquerades as rhyming. This movie contains a huge dose of the latter. But even with all these drawbacks, the movie would have still deserved at least a passing grade, albeit a low passing grade, if it weren't for item number five: the inherent racism that permeates this movie. In this movie racial stereotyping abounds. Every African-American character is portrayed as being a gangster, drug-dealer, drug-abuser, or whore, or a combination of two or more thereof, and completely incapable of functioning within the norms of mainstream society, this sense of isolation being further magnified by the absence of non-African-Americans in the story. (Why not make a movie glorying the exploits of, let's say, Pretty Boy Floyd or Machine Gun Kelly?) You cannot make a meaningful biography about any performer of color without placing the story within the context of the larger mainstream society, which is mostly non-African-American. After watching this movie, one could reasonably conclude that the whole world consists of Bedford Stuyvesant ( that is, "Bed-Stuy") and Sunset Boulevard. It's bad enough when non-African Americans produce slanted, racist images of African-Americans but when African-Americans themselves produce the same images then that is just pathetic. Try to imagine a movie where Jews, Irish, Italians, Chinese, Hispanics, etc. go around calling each other derogatory ethnic names. Such movies would be either utterly unwatchable or be treated as parodies.</fullReview>
