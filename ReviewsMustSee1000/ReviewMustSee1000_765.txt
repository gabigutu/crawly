		<shortDescription>Losing one's mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Hilton's contribution to the movies was enormous. His novels have ended up as films that made great impact, as is the case with this film. Mervyn LeRoy must be given credit for bringing it to the screen in a movie that has all the ingredients to keep the viewer glued to his seat.The film is a tribute to a form of entertainment that alas, has just but disappeared from the present Hollywood. Nothing like this film will be done in the near future because of today's tastes dictates the big, if mindless, spectacles full of special effects, favored by today's movie makers.There are things in the film that wouldn't make any sense in our high tech world, but the charm of the many twists and turns make for a charming voyage, as we get lost into this tale of love given so honestly by Paula to the amnesiac Smithy. The biggest challenge to logic is the reemergence of Paula as Ms Hansen, Charles Rainier's secretary. But that's the magic of the film, we put up with every twist and turn because we figure these two will find one another in the end.To have Greer Garson play the role of Paula/Margaret, was a stroke of genius. This actress, with her unusual beauty, made us believe she is that woman whose love for her man is everything. If that object of love was Ronald Colman, one of the most talented leading men of the era, it was well worth the price of admission. Ms Garson was one of the most accomplished actress of the time. Ronald Colman on the other hand, plays his dual characters with a panache and conviction that only actors of that period had. Mr. Colman makes us believe he is Smithy, the amnesiac soldier, as well as the business magnate that he was prior to losing his mind in the war. He made these two men credible as he transformed himself from one to the other with an ease that was uncanny.Susan Peters had a small part playing Kitty, who falls in love with Charles, even though she knows it's an impossible undertaking.This is a film to be cherished by lovers of old American films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Three Most Emotionally Satisfying Movies Ever Made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Along with NOW, VOYAGER and CASABLANCA, RANDOM HARVEST is one of the three most emotionally satisfying movies to ever come out of Hollywood's classic period, and a great example of the best that MGM had to offer in the '40s. Beautifully accomplished in every department from writing to art direction to cinematography to scoring, you have only to watch the first scene (so like REBECCA's) to be drawn in by it and then consistently surprised and entertained. And reading the 28 other comments here, I am struck by the unanimity of opinion -- because what makes the contrived plot believable scene by scene, and what causes the picture as a whole to live so warmly in the memory, is the unbeatable work from Ronald Colman and Greer Garson. More than MRS. MINIVER, this is the archetypal Garson performance: her tact, gentle humor and intelligent restraint are in perfect service to her character and the story. If she seems too starry and aristocratic to be a lowly music hall performer, she is right in every other respect, particularly as an efficient secretary, society hostess and perfect helpmate. And this is Ronald Colman's best work ever. He should have won his Oscar for this lovely, subtle performance rather than for the strained work he did in A DOUBLE LIFE. Full of wistfulness as the amnesiac early in the film, there is real heartbreak in the way he says the line "I would have liked to have belonged to them" about the couple he hopes will turn out to be his parents. But he is just as convincing later as the confident, energetic 'Industrial Prince of England.' Colman and Garson are the perfect grownup romantic couple: they make intelligence and maturity seem impossibly glamorous, and they embody the idea that friendship, loyalty and mutual respect must be at the center of every enduring love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Sidney Pollack says, this is an Essential film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen Random Harvest a number of times, but recently I watched it twice as part of TCM's Essentials series hosted by Sidney Pollack. This time I was inspired to read the James Hilton novel, Random Harvest, which I recommend to all lovers of the film. If you know the film, you won't get the little surprise at the end of the book -- you will know it already -- but it's still a most enjoyable and heartwarming read. You will see that Smithy/Charles Rainier is quite a young man at the beginning -- however, I did not find Ronald Colman too old in the role, he overcomes the age difference with his splendid performance. And he doesn't seem too old to play Charles Rainier, the prince of industry. I can't imagine another pair who could play the two romantic leads, Greer Garson is so radiant. And all of us who watch old films know that people did look more mature back then -- they looked like real adults! This is such a romantic film, everyone should see it. And Sidney Pollack was right not to remake it -- let well enough alone!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The only "amnesia" movie that really works.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thank heaven Sydney Pollack did not have amnesia when choosing this year's Essentials for TCM. I had long heard of "Random Harvest," primarily from relatives who saw it on first release, but never had the chance to see it for myself until this year.What a wonderful movie. It's never overly sentimental, it's wistful and suspenseful at times, and buoyed by supreme performances from Ronald Colman and Greer Garson.And who knew Greer could sing and dance like Marlene Dietrich! Colman was so versatile; one of the few actors who was just as successful in talkies as he had been in silents. He was by turns dashing, heroic, dignified, playful and romantic. Here he gets to be all of them. And Greer is his equal. This movie (and "Valley of Decision") made me a fan of hers, plus we have the same birthday.Sydney Pollack was right in abandoning his long-held plans to remake "Random Harvest." It simply couldn't be done again. Mervyn LeRoy, the James Hilton story and that wonderful company of actors can't be bested.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must for all romantics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most irretrievably romantic films ever made, Random Harvest is an absolute must for romantics of all ages. I'd agree that Ronald Colman is a bit too old for the early parts of the story, but that didn't stop him from giving a magnificent performance. And Greer Garson is every bit his match in a perfect role. However, if you possibly can, read James Hilton's amazing book first; the movie totally negates the important plot twist that makes the last page of the book such an incredibly emotional experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Memories Just Out of Reach</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The novels of James Hilton were very popular in America as well as in the United Kingdom. Mr. Hilton created British heroes that resonated with the American public and cerebral actors like Robert Donat and Ronald Colman seem born to play. I do remember as a lad being given a book with Lost Horrizon, Goodbye Mr. Chips and Random Harvest by my mother to read and the stories fascinated me.Random Harvest concerns Charles Rainer who sustained a head injury during World War I and woke up in a hospital in his native country with no memory of who he is. On Armistice Day in 1918 Rainer walks out of the hospital and takes up with another drifting soul, an entertainer named Paula. When you're Ronald Colman, goodness oozes out of you from every pore, so small wonder that Greer Garson accepts him at face value with no idea who he could be. They live together for two years and then one day in Liverpool, Colman is hit by a taxi. He regains his memory when he regains consciousness. He remembers he's Charles Rainer, oldest son of a title and a wealthy fellow at that. But no memory of his life with Garson.The chemistry between Colman and Garson is a thing of beauty. She wants so much to tell him who she is and he was for three years, but she's advised by psychiatrist Philip Dorn not to do so. And Colman becomes even richer and more successful, but with something missing. Memories just out of his reach and Colman exudes a sadness that the most hardened heart will find touching.One highlight for me is Greer Garson performing one Harry Lauder's great music hall numbers, She's Ma Daisy with appropriate Scot's costume. This was the career year for James Hilton. In addition to this film, Hilton did the screenplay for the Oscar winning Mrs. Miniver in 1942 and won a personal Oscar there. In fact Random Harvest ran second to Mrs. Miniver in a lot of categories. Mrs. Miniver was the Best Picture of 1942, Ronald Colman for Random Harvest and Walter Pigeon for Mrs. Miniver both lost to James Cagney for Yankee Doodle Dandy for Best Actor. And Susan Peters as Colman's step-niece lost to Teresa Wright for Mrs. Miniver as Best Supporting Actress.The film brought Susan Peters her first recognition. But her's was another career cut short due to a hunting accident that left her a paraplegic.Random Harvest as a book and as a film is how the British see themselves and how they like being portrayed on the screen. When you have players the caliber of Ronald Colman and Greer Garson doing it with the help Hollywood's English colony, the results are outstanding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best Ever !!!!!!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Due to being overjoyed in January 2005 at being finally able to own a copy of this masterpiece on DVD, I am re-editing my previous comments dating from 2001 slightly. Since that time, I have noticed a marked increase in the number of comments upon this film, and, furthermore, nearly all of the comments are highly positive. That just goes to show what a masterpiece this film is ! Indeed, I have my own personal list of top ten best films and this is one of them together with "Waterloo Bridge" !. It is a beautifully romantic (they just don't mak'em like that any more !!) and satisfying film to watch, and I just love the tune "O Perfect Love" which recurs on several occasions through the movie. I just wonder whether there is someone else in the world who loves this movie as much as me. Greer Garson is incredibly beautiful and sexy in this film and I would dearly loved to be "picked up" by her like Smithy was !! The overall plot is fantastic and is like a dream and the actors are beautiful. I may add that the quality of the DVD recording is excellent and in several languages/subtitles so there is no excuse for anyone being disappointed ! You need a large supply of hankies or Kleenex to make it right to the end without being flooded out. I did ! Let's hope that "Waterloo Bridge" will be given the same treatment in the coming months ..............</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most beautiful love stories ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film touches you on every level possible. The roles are cast to perfection, and even though it has differences to the book, it manages to capture the magic completely. I only have to hear a squeaky gate and the moment and magic comes back to me. I saw the film many years ago, and for a long time it has been a favourite with me. The romance and deep feelings/loyalty shown by Greer Garson to Ronald Colman are what most women idealise in a romance they would aspire to having themselves. The film brings a feeling of love overcoming all obstacles, and a deep warmth to those who know and love the story so well. Cynics may accuse the film of being too sugary sweet and sentimental, but I challenge them to watch the film with an open mind, and not be touched a little by it's beauty. This love story touches me deeply every time I see it. A must see for every romantic out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Period.Even more so than "Casablanca."The only movie that comes close to "Random Harvest" in sheer heart-wrenching romanticism is"Golden Earrings," with Ray Milland and Marlene Dietrich. Now THOSE were movies!! Yes,I'm stuck in the 40's,and very happy to be there! I cannot get enough of Ronald Colman's voice,especially in this movie.He has the most beautiful inflections of any actor I've heard,on par with Orson Welles,I think,but in a different way. I won't give away any plot twists,but suffice it to say there is one heart-grabbing scene that knocks you out.This movie is not to be missed by sentimental saps who loves black and white movies from the 40's.This is one of the very best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In every respect, especially its co-stars Greer Garson and Ronald Coleman, 'Random Harvest' is, and will forever remain, THE unsurpassable romantic nonpareil that it is.Attempting to remake this masterpiece would be the criminal, sad equivalent of graffiti vandals overspraying the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. There has since been no film remotely as riveting, emotionally suspenseful profound and, ultimately, redeeming and breathtakingly glorious; and, I'm not at all sad to say, we will never see its equal or better.Throughout raptly watching the superb DVD transfer of 'Random Harvest' I lost count of how many times, and I could not measure how uncontrollably, my breath bated and my heart raced, arrested, throbbed, broke, pined, and rejoiced. Oh, what an eternal story! Oh, what a magnificent, unsurpassable film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The weepie to end all weepies! The two leads are perfect, the plot twists and turns, and Hollywood 'England' has never looked more lovely.I'm also fascinated by the opening, given that Coleman had been through WWI, and must have known people with bad shell-shock, even if he escaped it himself. (For a modern take, try Pat Barker's 'Regeneration' trilogy.)I think one of the reasons this sort of film is so appealing, is because of it's now-dated attitudes to commitment and relationships - you just can't imagine this story (or for that matter Brief Encounter) working nowadays - the protagonists would have taken shortcuts.But here's to the days when this was the way one behaved!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well we have all heard the saying..."they really don't make'em like that anymore"....well it's true! It's all been said by the previous users comments but with top notch MGM production values the excellent cast sparkle in this totally memorable film. Whether the writers got confused themselves with all the plot twists it doesn't really matter as you are ultimately carried away by the 2 stars at their peak. Ronald Colman is sadly overlooked by film historians nowadays as his tender romantic screen persona seems out dated in this sometimes cynical world. What a great actor, only because his relaxed screen presence make it all the more engaging. Greer Garson could do no wrong at this time in her career &amp; a more perfect combination is harder to imagine.The scene towards the end when Colman suddenly regains his memory is truly and literary a "roses round the door" ending which always leaves me reaching for the hankerchief! Got to be 10 out of 10 for sheer Hollywood moonshine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "balmy doozer" of a film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a classic film buff, I stumbled across this film (which I had heard of but never had the chance to see, unfortunately) on Monday, March 1, when TCM finally decided to air it months after I had missed its last airing. All of the praise that you can read about this film is simply not enough. Many people comment that they find the story improbable. But folks, this is the movies, and movies need be neither probable nor practical. An endearing story with smooth direction by Mervyn LeRoy and flawless performances, it has quickly grown to be one of my all-time favorites.(Spoilers!) To put it simply, John Smith (Ronald Colman) is a WWI vet who was found in the trenches without any knowledge of his own identity. By chance, he meets a music hall actress named Paula Ridgeway (Greer Garson) and strikes up a friendship which soon develops into a romance, leading to marriage, a baby, and a poor but blissful existence. Tragedy strikes when "Smithy" (as she calls him) is on his way to Liverpool to apply for a job with a newspaper -- he is hit by a car. He remembers his true identity -- Charles Rainier, wealthy aristocrat -- but forgets he was ever John Smith. He returns home, and months later Paula returns to him, too -- this time in the form of Margaret Hansen, playing the part of his devoted secretary, hoping that perhaps he will someday remember the life that they had together and the love that he had for her. It's such a tragedy that Susan Peters was injured in a shotgun accident not too long after this film -- she does a fine job as Kitty, Charles' almost-wife. Also, Henry Travers (who is never bad in any film) does a grand job (though his role as a doctor is small). The two stars of this film, without a doubt, are the folks with top billing: Ronald Colman and Greer Garson. Ronald Colman is wonderfully cast as the melancholy soldier who just can't seem to get a break any way he turns. Just listen to that rich voice and look into those big, sad eyes -- he really turns on the charm, here. Then you have Greer Garson -- vibrant, stunningly gorgeous, luscious voice, and, indeed, a talented little singer and dancer! (The "She's Ma Daisy" number is an absolute treat -- a side of Garson the public seems to forget existed.) She takes your breath away as Paula, and makes you believe in the power of her love for her beloved Smithy.All in all, this movie comes highly recommended: 10/10, five stars, two-thumbs up... you know the bit... but be sure to have those tissues handy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Watchable But Frustrating Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those who like melodramas, this is one of the better ones. I don't particularly care for them, but this one kept my interest for the whole 127 minutes, so it must be good.The film reminded me of "Tomorrow Is Forever," with Orson Welles and Claudette Colbert. That, too, was a fine film but a frustrating one to watch. This, too, has its frustrations as Greer Garson holds back information that you and I couldn't have the strength to do.I don't recall Garson ever looking prettier and more wholesome in a film. Ronald Colman, the male lead, entertains as he usually does. It was interesting to see Philip Dorn, too, the "papa" in "I Remember Mama," one of my favorite films. Adding to this cast are Susan Peters, Henry Travers, Reginald Owen and Bramwell Fletcher.About the story, it's simply about a World War I vet who loses his memory, meets and falls in love with Garson, whom he marries. Then one day, an accident jars his memory and now his life with Garson is blanked out of his memory bank and he starts all over again in another town, leaving Garson back home and wondering whatever happened to her husband!One thing: in all the time that passes - about 15 years - no one ages! They still look the same! Also, Colman playing a returning veteran was a little far-fetched. I mean, the guy was 40 or 50 years old, playing a young 20s guy?? Oh, well.Overall, a good story that keeps your interest, even if it suspends belief. How many times you'd watch this depends on how much these type of stories appeal to you. If you love them, this is one you'd want in your collection, especially since it is out on DVD now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw ?and loved? Random Harvest when I was very young and thought it would seem trite/déja vu 60 years later. Was I wrong! It was as wonderful as the first time around.Last shot: closeup of Greer Garson. The reason seems obvious. She was the rising star while Colman, very big in the 30s, was getting older. Was he ill at the time of filming? He looks overly made up in the scenes of his "recovery." In some scenes, especially one at the onset of their marriage, he seems to be wearing a toupée. It's a profile shot.Question: does ANYONE remember the name in Spanish? I first saw it with subtitles. We were lucky to hear the actors' voices because, although dubbing became popular in many countries, it flopped in Peru.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...I rented this and now I'd like to own it. It's just plain wonderful.Despite being endowed with a story by the redoubtable James Hilton, this film is carried by the sheer power of its two stars. Colman (as Smithy/Rainier) and Garson (as Paula/Margaret) are at their luminous best. While the story can seem a bit implausible with too much thought, it is presented with such great truth, sincerity, and momentum that the viewer is swept along effortlessly.Like other Hilton books and their associated film translations (such as Lost Horizon and Goodbye, Mr. Chips), this movie has an exceptionally memorable and satisfying ending. I wanted to watch the ending over and over, but I'm glad that I resisted in this case - it helped me to retain the film in perspective.The sad note is Susan Peters, who does a great job of essaying Rainier's young admirer. Peters was paralyzed in a hunting accident not long after this film, and her career and personal life never recovered.If you've seen and liked the other Hilton adaptations mentioned above, as well as films such as Mrs. Miniver and The Talk of the Town, then you should not miss this. Close to a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best film ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always said that for me the three best films ever made are "Random Harvest", "Waterloo Bridge" and "The Ghost and Mrs Muir". I'm very pleased to check that I'm not the only who has this kind of feeling. Random Harvest is an outstanding film made in an era when the most important features were proper use of language, dialogues, looks, music... In Random Harvest all of these ingredients are mixed to result in a master piece. Ronald Colman is superb. He plays to perfection the aristocratic role of Smithy/Charles, aristocratic when he is a humble writer and aristocratic when he plays the role of a member of Parliament. Greer Garson plays a lovely Paula/Margaret, patient, noble and guileless. They are not young in this film but it is also one of the best attractions in this film: love is never old enough. There are some culminating points in this film, but the highest ones for me are: 1. When Ronald Colman is going to marry Susan Peters (another lovely actress) and they are choosing the hymns for the ceremony. Whe he listens the same hymn they played in his previous wedding (the lovely O perfect love) he stares Susan Peters in a indescribable way that says everything. And 2. The final scene (indescribable, you must see it to feel how your soul moves). One thousand times I'll see the film one thousand times I'll tremble. Thanks everybody who made possible that wonder! thank you very much!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Beautiful Warm-Hearted and Emotionally Gripping Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Normally, this kind of sentimental film does not appeal to me, but this work makes for an obvious exception. What a beautiful woman Greer Garson was, not just in appearance but also in poise and loveliness of personality with her warm and generous charm. This is a major achievement in movie-making, the likes we will never see again, and, believe me, that is tragic because as a society we are the worse for it as it states that something is lacking in us in general. Ronald Colman was the classic gentleman, a wonderful man whose acting brought out the best that is in all of us. This film was my mother's favorite and I can see why. This is truly a romantic film about two people torn apart by the mind, and yet with hope and faith the couple in love can never be separated forever if there is a will for one to protect the other from harm. What a wonderful and beautiful climax right at the end of the film when Greer Garson exclaims "Smithy" and Ronald Colman is bone-chilled as his mind recovers its memory of lost love when he replies with "Paula." Your heart should melt at this point and if it does not there is something seriously wrong with you as a human being.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romance with a Capital "R"!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Long ago---when life was far more simple-----and sentiment as well as romance were qualities to be cherished-----there was "Random Harvest." At that time, it was no sin to cry at a movie because it moved you in an emotional way. Our lead characters had a nobility about them that made us love them, become engaged in their predicament (no matter how far-fetched it may now seem to a more jaded contemporary audience) and thrill in the way everything was resolved. Yes, in those days---sometimes good things did happen to good people! "Random Harvest" is the quintessential M-G-M high gloss romantic film from its Golden Age. Others have presented the plot of this marvelous story and noted the touching performances of Greer Garson and Ronald Colman. And the supporting cast is an extraordinary ensemble.How many movies can one see again and again----and still be much affected by the sheer joy of what you are watching? There is something magical about film. It can transport us back in time with a story featuring long-dead performers at the height of their unique creative powers. "Random Harvest" is such an experience.I have long admired Colman as someone who was always able to project a humanity and decency in the characters he played. From "Prisoner of Zenda" and "Lost Horizon" to "Talk of the Town" and "Tale of Two Cities"-----Colman gave us roles featuring truly exemplary people. And Garson's mature glamour and glow are qualities we can much treasure even today.This is truly one of the greatest romantic films ever made. See it with someone you love! It will only make you love each other more!</fullReview>

But it does have value and the fact that we have at sometime been at war or had a conflict with other countries since then is a moving point. Although one can admit that the scenery and backdrops are slightly idealistic for rural England, I do like the fact that Swindon on the Great Western Railway is mentioned. This being a Hollywood picture, being filmed in 1942, with two leading British born actors could only inspire the home force. It is certainly a film that requires the tissues.

		<shortDescription>A wonderfully, romantic movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is said that "Random Harvest" was Greer Garson's favorite film. It's easy to see why. This is the type of movie magic that we all wish was the basis for our own lives. Love found, then lost, and found again, just in time for the final credits.There are those that think "An Affair To Remember" is the most romantic film ever made. Not a chance. "Random Harvest" will have you reaching for the handkerchiefs even after you've seen it a dozen times.And the movie is all Garson and Ronald Colman. He is wonderful in this role. A pre-cursor to his role in "A Double Life" where he played multiple personalities, and he carries it off beautifully. Extremely handsome, and that voice...wonderful. The only problem is, it reminds me of the parody of this movie that Carol Burnett did on her show with Harvey Korman playing Smithee. Very Funny.And Greer Garson is in short, stunning. Her eyes are radiant. She was certainly one of the most beautiful actresses of her time. And her performance is perfect. It's easy to see why she is one of the only actresses to be nominated for best lead actress Oscars five years in a row. I love this film.10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>better than the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just read the book, and although, just like all other James Hilton books I have read, it is a very good novel, I liked the film better. Maybe it's because I already knew what was going to happen on the last page, but I think it is mainly because the viewer knowing more than the characters, the approach the film takes, and has to take, makes for better drama. To use a metaphor so as not to spoil the plot: in the film, you can see the time bomb ticking for an hour; in the book, you only see an unexpected blast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As perfect a romantic film as was ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the perfect romantic movie. One of the most notable things about it is that everyone in the movie is nice. There are no traditional villains, just war and chance and bad timing. There is nobility and sacrifice and a wonderful payoff of an ending (though not quite as powerful as in the original James Hilton novel). Greer Garson and Ronald Colman personify British goodness and decency and are perfect in their roles, though Colman is a little old for the early scenes. All in all, this film is an excellent use of your hard-earned Kleenex.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real sentimental journey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say! One of my all-time endearing film experiences I have seen. Greer Garson and Ronald Colman are perfectly matched in this tearjerker. The 40's era produced some classic weepies and this is no exception.Set in England around the time of WW1, a soldier (Smithy) escapes from a mental hospital. He's only ailment is his loss of memory, so severe he has no recollection of his past life at all. While fleeing he befriends a woman (Paula) who instantly feels compassion for him and takes him away to the country to be safe. There they fall in love and marry, everything is wonderful until Smithy goes off to a job interview in London.It is originally filmed in B/W, although there are some rare tinted versions available. I know 'Random Harvest' will be a treat, especially for the ladies. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A magnificent Hilton allegory shines on the screen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Hilton wrote a handful of works whose staying power and emotive intensity compare with the greatest of all written literature. Taken from the great book, "Random Harvest" is one of the most beautiful and tender movies I have ever seen. Flawless acting, memorable cinematography, multi-dimensional characterizations, gorgeous scenery and peerless direction augment the pleasure of witnessing this great film. For Hilton aficionados, this cinematic gem sparkles and gleams in the sun of Hilton's undying faith in eternal optimism, hope, sacrifice and love. The story is true to the Hilton novel and left me with gratitude rekindled for all of life's great bounties and blessings, not the least of which are the everlasting bonds of love we create and re-create through mortality. Personally, I find the story parabolic on a deeply significant level: indeed we all are children of a great--yes, royal--family; sometimes we live our mortal lives with a dismissive attitude toward what turn out to be the turning points in our lives; oftentimes it takes us all our lives to find out who we really are; we walk through life constantly "adjusting our glasses" to see more clearly, when the very key is to adjust OURSELVES so that the "glasses" we HAVE help us see clearly; and finally, love DOES conquer all.See this fabulous movie with a dear one and experience the magic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the first old movie that my wife and I saw together almost 30 years ago. I love films so I initially had my doubts about it. It was so much better than I thought it would be. Greer Garson's acting would be Academy award winning today. I became an instant fan. I certainly can not think of an actress today that could pull that part off and still be believable. Many films of that age do not translate well to todays more sophisticated world. This film is an exception. Absolutely outstanding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greer Garson may have been the only actress, alive or dead in the entire history of the motion picture industry, to be able to carry this off. If any other actress had done it, it would seem unbelievable and corny. I really wish we could make comments on actors. I would have many good things to say about this beautiful, gracious lady. Because of her magnificent performance Random Harvest may be the greatest love story ever made. The hero, Ronald Coleman, was a handsome man with sad eyes and a beautiful speaking voice. When the movies needed a noble and self-sacrificing hero, they always turned to Ronald Coleman. Besides Random Harvest, he was the noble self-sacrificing hero of The Prisoner of Zenda and Tale of Two Cities. If you have any romance in your soul, please watch this movie. You will love it.</fullReview>

This movie is believable because of the storyline and the acting. It makes you believe in true love. Ronald Colman has made many good movies, but this is the second best movie he ever made. The best movie Colman made was "A Double Life", which is a devastating story of an actor lost in his stage role and going mad. Mr. Colman won the Oscar for "A Double Life", which he deserved.This is Greer Garson's best movie and best role. She should have won the Oscar for this movie, not for "Mrs. Miniver".

		<fullReview>Greer Garson, a Meryl Streep of her time, is remarkably sympathetic in this classy, surprisingly absorbing weepie. And Ronald Colman (how could he, of the magnificent voice have started in silent pictures!), at his peak as well. Add a haunting performance by Susan Peters, stir in the wartime MGM magic, and you produce a classic.You have to go with the storyline to appreciate this box office smash, and I did (consider the horrors of the real world when this was released). Beautifully directed, with several wonderful scenes. And Greer Garson also appeared in Mrs. Miniver that same year, she could have walked off with two Oscars (another "of its time" classic). Get yourself in the mood, sit with a loved one and take this time capsule and escape!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would recommend this film to everyone - and indeed I have!! - whether you are a fan of romances or not. It is beautifully acted by Greer Garson and Ronald Colman, as two people who meet unexpectedly and try to build a life together, only to have unfortunate circumstances thrown in their paths. It's a real tearjerker but falls together wonderfully and is enough to melt even the hardest heart. I have yet to read the novel by James Hilton but I'm looking out for it and I expect it to be every bit as good as this 10/10 movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Random Harvest is a wonderful romantic drama, directed with great skill by Mervyn Le Roy, from the Golden Age of Hollywood. The story has WW1 amnesiac Ronald Coleman finding true love with music hall girl Greer Garson - only to lose it when his memory returns. The rest of the movie is about how they get back together and is surprisingly bittersweet until the requisite Happy Ending. Even if the story is far fetched, so what? The two leads are on top form and the whole thing is done with such style that it's hard not to be swept along with it. Top quality.</fullReview>

Each time that I've seen Random Harvest, I notice some small touch that I hadn't remembered from earlier viewings. I think my favorite moment is when Ronald Colman returns to the city where he had been in the asylum and, needing a cigarette, turns to his colleague and says, there's a tobacco shop just around the corner.A warm feel-good movie, one that I could see time and again </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greer Garson makes this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing a couple of other movies with Greer Garson, I am convinced that she is one of the most wonderful actress ever to grace the silver screen. I fell in love with her in this movie and only wish there were actress today who would just try to be like her just a little (maybe they can't).The story is a sweet tale of a amnesia suffering soldier wandering from a hospital after returning from WW1 and happening upon Greer Garson ( I wish I could happen upon such a wonderful, caring, kind, lovely creature) and she takes care of him and love follows. The story gets a little choppy when he regains his memory and forgets Greer's character, but like a boxer regaining his legs the story does too and this may have been by design or due to a difficult period of interpreting the script by the director. Anyway Ronnie Colman pulls his character through. A good supporting cast, though no one stands out, it could be that the two main actors were so powerful no one could distract from the main characters. If you want to see Greer Garson working her beautiful magic this movie is a must.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's just occured to me that there are some similarities here with the English Patient, which I also loved. I guess it's just that kind of romantic, passionate and sad story that I go for. I kept wondering why they hadnt remade this one yet - and thinking about who could possibly play the main female lead... Maybe there lies the answer - who could? Meryl Streep 10 years ago possibly...They joke about Kleenex etc. but there are plenty of friends I know for whom that would be a reality. If this one doesnt make you cry - then nothing will. I thought the script unusually good too. Not sure if the novel had been raided for snappy dialogue, but there were some great lines. But all set within a dramatic, surprising and imaginative plot that has few equals.Not sure what you could fault this one for...so Ill give it a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Requires much suspension of disbelief, but you'll be rewarded at the same time?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since RANDOM HARVEST is beloved by so many people, I deem it as the greatest classic film tearjerker second only to director Mervyn LeRoy's other MGM film, WATERLOO BRIDGE (1940). Despite the contrived, corny, and far-fetched plot elements throughout the film, it was just what American audiences needed as the Second World War was occurring in 1942. And the film is still enjoyable and emotional today?so much that a remake is out of the question?due to the superb craftsmanship of the film. It is coincidental that RANDOM HARVEST was made by many of the same hands of WATERLOO BRIDGE, since both films were produced by the MGM studios.Having never read the original James Hilton novel before, the film is wonderful nevertheless. Also, James Hilton himself was so pleased of this film that his own anonymous voice is heard narrating the film's prologue. All the performances are excellent and all the characters are appealing, particularly Ronald Colman and Greer Garson in their starring roles. In a miracle of casting, they are absolutely perfect together despite the fact that they were never really in contact with each other during the film's production. The dialogue is clever and almost never descends into banality. The usually pristine MGM production values are indeed apparent here, displaying mostly accurate post-World War One English settings to the audience. The black-and-white cinematography, by Joseph Ruttenburg, is atmospheric and makes excellent use of low lighting effects for foggy exterior scenes. The music score, by Herbert Stothart, is appropriately emotional and makes excellent use of strings and the Anglican hymn "O Perfect Love" throughout the score.The film is indeed very far-fetched and requires much suspension of disbelief throughout. For example, the characters never age in a period of 15 years and Greer Garson looks glamorous in every single scene! But the film is so well-done that's easy for me to forgive such flaws despite the somewhat fantastical story.And the film's finale is unforgettable and makes the film worthy of deeming this as the second greatest classic film tearjerker. Make sure you have some tissues handy during this part! I doubt that there has ever been a more emotional ending in any other classic film.A Hollywood masterpiece, pure and simple, and one of the most romantic films ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Living in the present while the past is missing and a mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally acquired the DVD of this very fine film which seemed all so familiar to me that I wonder if I might have seen it before many years ago perhaps when quite young and it had since faded from my memory. That's odd to mention a faded memory because this story is all about memories lost and shrouded in mystery, obscured by the harsh tragedies experienced by 'Smithy', a soldier in the First World War.My comment can only be on viewing the movie as I haven't yet read the book which I plan to buy very soon, just to complete the picture, you might say.Ronald Colman is first seen as John Smith, or 'Smithy' to some. He appears withdrawn, shell-shocked and with no memory, unsure of who he is; he obviously has been recuperating in an asylum from the mental stresses of the war. That night he wanders out into freedom in the town where there's suddenly great jubilation on all sides when news is abroad that the war has finally ended but it has little meaning for him then. When he stops in a small shop to buy cigarettes he encounters a kindhearted lady, Paula (Greer Garson), who sees his fragile condition, is rather attracted to him, and eventually decides to take him under her wing so to speak. Gradually in the days that follow a great love grows between them and they find genuine happiness together in marriage and a peaceful country life. Although early memory still eludes him, Smithy has recovered considerably and finds his niche as a writer with a promising future awaiting him. Soon the day arrives when he must make the journey on his own to the city and that is where Fate intervenes. ...When I reflect on the situation it appears the general response to mental relapse has changed little even after more than half a century has passed since this film, and that the stigma of mental illness is something not readily accepted or discussed openly, particularly in the military. It is only recently that the subject, now known as PTSD, (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder), has received due recognition as being a treatable illness and due compensation provided on the agenda of the armed forces.Yes I too was surprised to notice that Greer Garson could actually sing and dance! A delightful moment.The role of Kitty (Susan Peters) was nicely done, at first showing the typical emotions of a young girl attracted to an older man (that is Charles Rainier, or 'Smithy' after he'd regained his memory) and later blossoming into a deeper feeling for him when she grows up. However, after she realizes and sees how his mind is still living in the past, seeking a key to unanswered questions, she knows she must step aside because his heart lies elsewhere, and he has yet to discover where that is. Once again Fate has stepped in. I think Kitty's emotional expression of 'letting go' of her love for him is a truly universal experience most can understand and sympathize with. Added to the dilemma is, as she says, once you've known the best how can you really settle for less? Her life would go on but never quite the same, and they say many marriages are really a second choice for some, which would probably the case for her.The significant clue throughout the latter part of the movie involves a simple key which Smithy had in his pocket ... when Fate stepped in ... and now as Charles, his former self, he has kept it with him as a part of his missing past, a piece of the unknown puzzle, which he often holds in his hand while lost in thought.For me the only weakness I can think of in the movie is that as the years passed by - two, three, then several more years - there ought to have been a slightly more evident aging of the main characters to give it more credence, a nice touch to be added. Just my opinion.It was interesting to get a glimpse of Una O'Connor, the shopkeeper, and Melville Cooper as a Rainier relative (both of whom I recall from the perfectest movie, "Adventures of Robin Hood" of 1938); and Henry Travers as the doctor, (always remembered as the genial, bumbling angel in "It's a Wonderful Life").Overall, "Random Harvest" is a very moving film, great actors, great story, what more can one ask for. Don't miss it. Now I'm going to find the book!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those films that the term "They don't make 'em like that anymore' certainly applies to - only in the 1940s, at MGM could RANDOM HARVEST have been made - a decade later and it probably wouldn't have worked, which is why it still holds up and why a remake isn't necessary and wouldn't work.Yes, Ronald Colman was a little long in the tooth to play Charles Ranier, but his presence is so forceful that you don't really mind. And Garson - well, she's luminous - even in black-and-white you KNEW Garson's hair was red! The film sacrifices the novel's surprise twist at the end, because filming the novel as written would have been virtually impossible.Yes, it's a very glossy MGM movie - not a bit of it looks in any way real - this movie takes place in an alternate universe, but from first frame to last it becomes our universe and we never question where we are or what we're doing there."Oh, Smithy, Smithy...!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen this movie about 10 times and I plan on watching it at least 10 more times! I love everything about it with the exception of one nearly unbelievable relationship. In my opinion Susan Peters and Ronald Colman being lovers is just a wee bit (actually a lot more than just a wee bit) of a stretch to begin with; good grief he was old enough to be her father, and then there is the scene with her tearfully abandoning him in the church after gazing into his eyes for a few seconds? While that scene was very well done and quite touching, IMHO it is just too unbelievable. Too bad she died about 10 years later in a tragic accident as she was quite convincing in this movie as a perky teen and a beautiful and confident young lady. In the book she dies, and I suppose throwing that into this movie instead of her simply leaving him at the altar would have required extending the movie another 20 minutes or so perhaps making the movie too long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thanks For The Memory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most times it's the book which is better to read than seeing the film and vice versa on rare occasions, for example Hitchcock's 39 Steps was better than Buchan's. All personal taste of course! To me Random Harvest is in between ? the book by James Hilton was excellent but the MGM film was too, albeit it was altered significantly to fit into a 2 hour time frame. All works of fiction are fantasy but the film is definitely more fantastic and the audience has to seriously suspend reality for the duration. I've seen it lots of times now, the lustrous and heartwarming atmosphere always sucking me in.War veteran Ronald Colman suffering from loss of memory stumbles blindly out of an asylum in 1917 and into the arms of Greer Garson who helps him make a new life until he unfortunately regains his memory a few years later. MGM gave it their all - the studio production values from the outset were sky high and now it's an absolutely gorgeous nitrate composition to look at thanks to HD. Colman &amp; Garson also gave it their all and are also gorgeous to look and listen to especially when Colman starts talking properly ? my, was he lucky bumping into her in the cigarette shop in the side street! They make it all seem so romantically believable and that such endless self-sacrifice always gets rewarded in the end no matter how long it takes. The usual laughable olde Hollywood picture of immutable master servant relations and the proper working class deference shown to men and women of pedigree I pass over, except to say Thanks Guvnor And Gord Bless You Sir!In short, it's a wonderful film, perhaps the best of its kind and hopefully worth your time as it is mine and many others. Imho the "random years" for the movie industry were approximately 1914-1950 but there's no chance of the memory of those years ever being completely recovered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ronald Colman stars as a shell-shocked WW1 soldier who suffers from complete amnesia. He is befriended by a kindly music hall singer (Greer Garson) and they fall in love. Inevitably, he regains his former memory and their lives change forever.Ronald Colman's dramatic voice and charismatic charm are irresistible in this movie and Greer Garson is incredibly beautiful and sympathetic; it's just a pleasure to watch them on the screen. The story is sweet and romantic and rich with characters. The movie received seven Oscar nominations in 1943. I did think the second half moved a bit slowly, but it comes to a satisfying conclusion. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a masterpiece. Keeps viewers engrossed as the story unfolds. Emotionally satisfying yet there are moments when we often worry about the central character Paula (played by Greer Garson). Undoutably, one of her best performances and she brings life to the character of Paula and later of Margaret Hansen. The story is fast and doesn't let the viewer loose interest. Sets, characters, sound effect, and casts are well chosen. The story is not that new, but the way it is directed and told is quite impactful. The tender yet a strong character of Greer Garson brings the story to life, quite rare in modern movies. A movie that will remain in memories forever!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd been looking forward to this for several years. It was no disappointment at all. Hilton's novel is long and episodic and to a certain extent so is the film, but it never strays from its narrative and maintains its leisurely pace without seeming either pushed or dragging. This was made in the throes of war and the "English" environment was meant to woo the international (and particularly American) audience, however indirectly. Part of it was rather unashamedly "tea cozy" and "Hollywood quaint" in depicting the English scene, a bit too cutesy or endearing and too often cloying to the senses. We had the white picket fence, the tree all in flower, primroses round the path - no wishing well though... and thank heavens no Greyfriar's Bobby to melt the hearts of the kids and chew up the scenery to boot. The performances were excellent and the script beautifully organized.Ronald Colman was a bit old for the part but Garson was splendid throughout. I can fully understand that this was her favorite film. I'm ordinarily not a big fan of Le Roy or Hilton but this was truly a lovely trip.Curtis Stotlar</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greer's dance in "She's Ma Daisy" the stunner of the whole movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greer was a stunner, and not always the stiff upper lip character about whom we have heard many times. When she does her "She's Ma Daisy" dance and singing, she hits the ball out of the park. I love how she's the star of the number, and center of attention. The chorus dancers kowtow to her. She leads the entire group. The military men later dancing with her are certainly having a great time.Greer, with her beautiful legs, was doing an homage to the Scots singer and entertainer Sir Harry Lauder. He had bowed legs shaped like he was riding a horse, whereas Greer's were long, sleek and feminine. She was a great dancer. I hope she did her own singing. I thought that that part was excellent. When Greer picked up the crooked walking stick, the audience just knew she was going to do a Sir Harry imitation. Sir Harry had been famous before World War One (The Great War; The War to End All Wars; which, we know by now, 2010, that there have been lots of wars since then).Reginald Owen was great, as the former boxer. Ronald Colman was just superb, even playing the mental patient. Later, when he takes over as head of his family enterprises, he plays the executive well, also. As the young thing desperately in love with Colman, Susan Peters plays her character very well.I like the end, where Smithy and Paula go back to their original home, and where of course the key fits. The beautiful white blossoms on the tree beyond the white fence are just divine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this 68 years ago,at the Radio City Music Hall, Way back then they had a stage show as well, &amp; for Christmas It featured in mime ,the Birth of Jesus,plus other acts, including a symphony Orchestra.They also showed a newsreel &amp; a cartoon.Nearly every performance was shown to near capacity audiences. The theatre had slightly under 6100 seats.We probably went to a Sunday matinée,Total cost for the three of us was probably,just under $3.00Now back to the Movie.RANDOM HARVEST was one of the best films of 1942, I still think these many years later it still would be one of the best. It stars two of the biggest names in film history.Greer Garson (who was only making film for about 3 years &amp; will win an Oscar for her previous film MRS MINIVER) Her co-star Ronald Colman (a movie veteran who will win his Oscar in a few years for(A DOUBLE LIFE).Now leave us ignore the fact that both actors were too old for the characters. The charisma &amp; charm of both make us believe, they were younger.Mervyn LeRoy directed &amp; it is based on James Hilton's novel,( he also wrote LOST HORIZON). Back then Hollywood loved to change novels to suit the studio owners.I do not remember how close to the novel the film is. The story in both novel &amp; book is pure romantic soap opera &amp; delightful romantic fantasy,This is the way they made films back then. The scenes supposedly in Liverpool were studio made &amp; no there is no resemblance to the real Liverpool or to real homes etc.The running time is a very fast 134 minutes, the DVD also has about an hour of interesting extras.I had not started to keep records of the movies I saw then, that hobby started in January 1943.If I had my rating would be the same as today.Ratings" **** (out of 4) 98 points (out of 100) IMDb (10 out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was fortunate enough to come across this film last week when on business in the States. It was being viewed on the TCM channel and I count myself lucky that I just happen to have tuned in before it started so was 'warmed up' for it. Wow - what a great, great movie! This film - particularly Ronald Colman's performance - really moved me. He really captured in his eyes that essence of complete helplessness - I am now checking out any movie that he has ever starred in. What I can't understand is how I had never heard of him before. This - along with 'A Matter of Life and Death' - is now one of my all time favourites. I immediately ordered the DVD when I arrived home and just know it will never be out of our DVD player. And what can I say about Greer Garson's performance - wonderful actors, wonderful story, wonderful direction. They do NOT make films like this anymore - more's the pity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Indeed, one of the masterpieces from that wonderful period when there were actors and actresses who could make implausible movies and make you love them. It doesn't matter that they don't age over the time-frame of the film - it doesn't matter that the plot is like a soap-opera - nothing matters - "Random Harvest" is another jewel that cannot be re-made. As one user commented, Maybe Meryl Streep could have done it in her younger years, but she doesn't have the actual beauty Ms. Garson ("Paula Ridgeway", "Margaret Hansen") possessed, and I'm a BIG fan of Ms. Streep. Ronald Colman ("Charles Rainier") was superb in the entire film. Who, of today's actors, has his appeal ? Few modern actors/actresses are blessed with the elegance this story demands.Director Mervyn LeRoy must have realized he had the best of his dreams with such a cast....and cinematography....and extras, and costumes, etc. Script-writer Claudine West translated from the novel with brilliant clarity. Una O'Connor (the tobacconist) lights-up the screen in ANY role, in her youth and in her older age.I can't believe I don't have this in my collection - but, I shall in the future. This is a movie I remembered the title with love, but had forgotten the plot, but love it even more, now. I agree with many who think Garson and Colman deserved Oscars for their roles. Robbery....Many users suggest that you share "Random Harvest" with someone you love - I would rather keep it selfishly for myself. This movie is a testament to how true love plays-out - do yourself a favor and learn its lesson.......a "50".....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Satisfying and Poignant Story; Beautiful Production</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amnesia is always an interesting plot element for a writer, for a number of compelling reasons. The primary one I suggest is that the motivation of the sufferer from memory loss is so strong, causing the viewers to empathize with and accompany him/her on a journey of discovery and often of some danger. "Random Harvest", one of James Hilton's trilogy of most important works, has as its subject the interesting story of a war veteran who suffers first battle shock then total loss of memory, who makes a new life but always with the sense of having lost another life he had known--a youthful idyll whose details he has forfeited to fate; one whose memory always stays with him as an unreachable ideal...The stars of this compelling and hard-to-forget drama are Ronald Colman and Greer Garson. She plays the fascinating role of the young music-hall luminary who shelters, helps and spirits away the wounded soldier she finds so interesting, hiding him from the authorities who want him to return to the asylum to which he had been confined after the war; when they marry and he loses his memory, he of course forgets her entirely. He then returns to a life of wealth, responsibility and eventually of fame, finally as the winner of an election. He is even considering marrying a young woman. His wife finds him again and becomes his secretary and right-hand helper, for years; Only later on does he begins to get flashbacks, when he visits the town where they had lived together, and he recalls details he could not possibly know. And at the end of the film--he remembers the woman he had once loved. And he knows it is the woman he has denied his love for so long--for the sake of a memory too-bright to look upon clearly, too distant to remember. The production of the film is "A" budget all the way; consider the credits: sets by Edwin B. Willis, art direction by Cedric Gibbons, hairstyles by Syndey Guilaroff, cinematography by Joseph Ruttenberg, music composed by Herbert Stothart. All-around director Mervyn LeRoy also had a fine cast with whom he interacted winningly. It included, besides Garson and Colman. Susan Peters, Philip Dorn, Henry Travers, Aubrey Mather, Una O'Connor, Rhys Williams, Reginald Owen, Margaret Wycherly, Bramwell Fletcher, Margaret Wycherly, Arthur Margetson, Melville Cooper, Alan Napier, Jill Esmond, Marta Linden, Ann Richards, Elisabeth Risdon and Norma Varden. Credit for the difficulty adaptation of the novel goes to Claudine West, Arthur Wimperis and George Froeschel. This is a moody, intriguing and sometimes leisurely film, I find.Its makers accomplished the difficult feat, in my opinion, of making the characters' motivations entirely clear and yet a bit elusive. In the principal role, Colman conveys a wistful sadness and detachment that is well within his fine but non-classic capabilities. He was given awards for the film, but then it is Greer Garson who for once was allowed to do many of the things she could do--underplay, play sympathy, play drama, sing a music hall specialty beautifully and be as charming as a ray of light, the sort of glowing personality that can dispel the clouds of fear and gloom that have settled within the mind of the shell-shocked soldier known only as "Smithy" at the hospital;l where he had been confined. It is she in my judgment who deserved awards for shining so brightly a film that was not perfect but was made by those who loved its story about as well as it could be realized on film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As much as I love "Mrs. Miniver" and "Forsyte Saga" as well as other roles, I have always thought this was Greer Garson's best film. Much of the movie seems like pat 1942 movie making but that ending, under the flowering tree, in front of that divine English cottage, never fails to bring tears. I hate watching this movie late at night because I always have trouble falling asleep afterward...so invigorating is that ending. It has often puzzled me that no one ever did a remake of this film. The story is so good. Perhaps amnesia won't work in modern day films, since medicine has evolved so much since then. Ronald Coleman is very good in this film too, even though he was too old for the role. But Garson is just wonderful. I can imagine she was a delightful woman in real life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Random Harvest is one of those films that you have heard about for generations but you never get a chance to see it! Your out when its on TV or you forget to record it. I saw it the other day and for 2 hours was glued to the screen. There are times when you know although the action is set in England that it was filmed in the USA, like the accents. Of course, Ronald Coleman and Greer Garson were perfectly cast in the roles and you felt at times that you either knew them or you were there! They both play dual roles superbly and I can imagine that when it was finished MGM new they had a huge hit on their hands and quite rightly so. I loved it and can't wait to see it again and again and again. That hymn played all the way through it 'O Perfect Love' was the ultimate. Great all around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw Random Harvest in 1985 and I loved the movie so much I bought the video and since then have watched this movie about 10 times. Two 'mistakes' in the movie are Miss Hanson's collar is turned up when she leaves Mr. Ranier's office, but when she enters her office it is fixed. Another is in the hotel. After Mr. Ranier inspects the contents of the old suitcase he shuts it, but in the very next scene it is still open.Several people have commented that they felt Ronald Coleman was too old for the role he played in the movie. I felt that way too for awhile but then I took into account the ages of Mr. and Mrs. Lloyd in the asylum office scene. Assuming they were in their mid or even late 20's when they had their son, their son would have been in his mid 30's since they appear to be well over 50. Also he was a captain in the army according to his statement in the chemist's shop after being hit by the cab, and officers are always somewhat 'older' men in the military. I love this movie, but I feel the weakest scene in the movie is at the church when Kitty realizes Charles is 'out there' and she is not 'the one' and leaves. Of course I am a man, and perhaps women have a sixth sense about things like this. The last scene will have you in tears.</fullReview>

It's an exquisite-looking film with the wonderful sets and costumes you would expect from MGM during the Golden Age. The cinematography is excellent and the music fits the tone perfectly at all times. The script is soapy and sentimental to a fault but in the absolute best way. Fine supporting cast includes Henry Travers, Philip Dorn, and Susan Peters. But, of course, the stars are what makes this work above all else. Ronald Colman and Greer Garson have amazing chemistry. Both play their roles with such sensitivity and elegance. Remarkable work from two screen legends. It's just such a great film. It tugs at the heartstrings and gives you "feels" in so many ways.

		<shortDescription>Cinematic romance at its finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Random Harvest is very fondly remembered and loved by many and for good reason. It is such a beautiful film in so many ways and one of the most moving films I've seen. Random Harvest is a splendidly made film, both sumptuous and Expressionist and still looking as fresh now as it did then. The period detail is rendered handsomely as well, not accurate perhaps but with the quality of how the film looks that doesn't really matter all that much. The music has that lush romantic feeling without being too syrupy, the use of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake was apt and will be a delight for classical music enthusiasts(count me as one). The script has the right dose of warmth and pathos with nothing being corny or overly-sentimental; this is a script with heart. As has the story, which is romantic to the hilt, heart-warming and incredibly touching, you're guaranteed to need tissues when Charles doesn't return to Paula after going to Liverpool and when his memory starts to come back. I was so engrossed by the characters and so touched by the story that any improbabilities were easily forgiven. Mervyn Leroy's direction is masterly and the characters are sweet and very human, complete with one of the most realistic and heart-breaking portrayals of shell-shock on film. The supporting cast all give solid performances, Susan Peters is utterly convincing in her feistiness and confidence and Reginald Owen, Henry Travers and Edmund Gwenn are always watchable. But the two leads dominate and are a huge part of the reason why Random Harvest works so well. Ronald Colman was a revelation, wistful and dignified but it is also very difficult to not tear up at Colman's body language when his memory starts returning, a very telling piece of acting. Greer Garson is just radiant and is wonderfully sincere in her role. Their chemistry together is just pure magic. All in all, beautiful and outstanding film, cinematic romance at its finest. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In many ways "the" most outrageous amnesia story ever told yet, ironically (or should I say "iconically?") also one of the most successful. And memorable. True love. Passion. Everything you could ever want. And then, bang, he disappears. Patiently, she tracks him down. And tracks him. And tracks him. And finds him. And discovers that he lost his memory and is now a very successful businessman who, strangely, never married. The big meeting. He does not recognize her at all. (This was considered a 6-hankie movie by the way, and we just used up 4). So, aware he might never actually know who she is, she takes a job by his side. Because something is better than nothing. Many modern reviewers have criticized current TV dramas for "manipulating the viewer shamelessly." I am guilty of this myself. But the pattern, the template, for viewer manipulation was set here, decades ago. Yes, the acting was spectacular. I mean, OMG, Greer Garson! And Ronald ("a far far better thing I do") Coleman! You could watch these two sort laundry and it would still be a good film. But, fact is, the last 30 minutes or so of the film are spent with the audience always on the edge of its chair hoping that ANY MOMENT he will recognize her. And he does, sort of. Critics have said the ending under-performs the film. It does, but, think about it, with that kind of setup, ANY ENDING WOULD UNDERPERFORM. This is one of the must-sees.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Some day the miracle will happen"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the onset of war, the cinema was no longer primarily the bright world of spectacle and entertainment that it had been in the 1930s. Pictures of emotional depth began to have a significance and popularity they had never seen before, as they gave a chance for escapism not merely through distraction but through the hope for a brighter tomorrow.Random Harvest is a little different to the average tearjerker. Rather than building up situations dramatically and comically before opening the floodgates, we instead have a constant trickle of poignancy aching its way through the story. It's not an easy thing to get away with, especially in a picture so devoid of comic relief or other diversions, and yet it works through its delicate presentation and uncompromising sincerity.At its heart are two towering performances. Ronald Coleman by no means convinces as the young man he is supposed to be at the start of the picture, but he is right for the part because he remains true to the emotional reality of the character. In other words, he is always with the state of mind of his character at any given point, from the fragile, confused manner in the asylum, to the tranquillity he reaches in the new life he makes, to the stern professionalism he acquires when he regains his old memory. And yet he keeps a kind of consistency throughout that allows us to believe it is the same man. Greer Garson engages us at once with the realism and likability of her character. Later, much of that slow emotional ebb is played out on her face, as we see her handling the psychological blows that rain down on her character. The agony of her situation is never overstated, yet it is not brushed aside lightly either.Doing probably the finest job of his career is director Mervyn LeRoy. Normally LeRoy's pictures were fast-paced attention-grabbers, but here he is uncharacteristically slow and dignified. When Colman wanders through the crowds celebrating the war's end, the camera moves at his pace, making us share that impression of an outsider amid the clamour. There is a kind of disorienting feel as we (like Colman's character) hear things before we see them. The leisurely pace continues as his relationship with Garson blossoms, giving it a timeless, placeless and above all idyllic tone. In the latter half of the picture, LeRoy's aim seems to be to remove all distractions ? long takes, little background movement, no close-ups for minor characters ? focusing us entirely on Colman, Garson and Susan Peters. The style is smooth and seamless, without jolts, matching the story's gentle emotional tug.There isn't much else to say about Random Harvest. The performance of Susan Peters is almost on a par with the two leads, brilliantly handling the transition from flirty teenager to confident young woman. The score by Herbert Stothart is absolutely sublime, and never too intrusive, only surfacing to our attention when necessary. And this, in a way, is the reason it's hard to comment very specifically on this picture. The whole thing is constructed so beautifully to draw us into the lives of these two people that all detail becomes forgotten. Anything like comic relief or well-defined supporting characters, far from counterpointing the poignancy, would distract from it. It is the perfect movie to make you forget the world, and that is undoubtedly why audiences of the day loved it. Random Harvest captivates, and leaves you hoping for nothing more than the chance of a happy ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Classic Romance....Garson and Colman are superb.....remember the tissues!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the true classic Golden Age romantic dramas, Random Harvest's plot may seem completely illogical (Colman marries Garson twice without knowing it??) on paper yet somehow it works beautifully and I really believed in every minute of it. I can thank Ronald Colman and Greer Garson, two British Academy Award-winning cinema greats, for this- they were excellent in their roles. Its the first time I have seen Colman in a film, and I completely fell in love with the guy! He gave such a wonderful, delicate, nuanced performance in a role which could have gone badly over-the-top. Even though he is in his 50's (and, on paper, too old for the part)he is very winning as the male romantic lead. Garson gives an equally great performance- if she hadn't won the Oscar for Mrs Miniver in that same year she would have walked away with it for Random Harvest, hands down.Aside from the plot contrivances (which don't really bother me at all- it's a movie, folks!), this is a top-notch film all round. Random Harvest is studio film-making at it's best: MGM obviously had a lot of confidence in their star system and the strength of their actors and the production unit. It is competently directed, has some beautiful black-and-white cinematography and just feels like a well-crafted film. Susan Peters gives a supporting performance worthy of note- she handles a part that could so easily be unsympathetic (because we are supposed to-and do-love Garson) with great skill, making you believe in her character.Perhaps the film is a trifle too long, the scene where Smithy/Charles and Paula chase up his luggage, and he doesn't recognise it, is probably unnecessary because it doesn't really move the plot along. But every other scene is a keeper- and there are so many memorable moments here. I had tears running down my cheeks at precisely four points in this film- Paula telling Smithy he perhaps should go back to the asylum (Colman's eyes just say it all, I wanted to give Smithy a big hug and take care of him!), Paula telling Smithy/Charles that their child died (and Colman can't even mourn the loss of his beloved son as he doesn't remember their life together), Garson holding the cheap beads Smithy gave her up to her eyes and saying "he said they looked just like the colour of my eyes", and, of course, that great, classic ending. An excellent film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deeply reflective romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its almost impossible to say anything about the plot of this movie without spoiling it, so I'll just say on the surface its classic "Boy Meets Girl", "Boy Loses Girl" and a long suspenseful "Will They Ever Get Back Together?" Except this movie gives the whole business some of the most bizarre and entertaining plot twists in Hollywood history. I was literally squirming in my chair with frustrated anticipation as the movie neared its conclusion.This is a very entertaining and extremely well made classic from Hollywood's golden years. Everything is first class- story, directing, cinematography, supporting cast, music- but the two principals are what keep the movie from slipping into sentimentality and give it its gloss.Greer Garson and Ronald Coleman are both wonderful, quivering with repressed emotion in parts that could have easily been overacted. The movie and the characters have deep undercurrents and provoke us to think about memory and destiny and true love in ways that few other movies do.Definitely a must see for old movie buffs, and I look forward to a second viewing in the future when I won't be on the edge of my seat and can appreciate the many subtleties this film has to offer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An MGM soaper of the highest order</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot (I wouldn't dare reveal the surprises) has been lifted from this picture and used in more episodes of network day-time dramas than can be counted. Nevertheless, if it has ever been approached as freshly, or acted out as well as in "Random Harvest," I don't know about it.Colman is in top form, in a character that seems tailor-made for him. Greer Garson seems a bit miscast at first (especially to those who've seen her noble, earnest performance of the title role in "Mrs. Miniver"), but she quickly grows on you, the same way she did in "Pride and Prejudice" (probably her best movie, that).One of the best films of 1942, "Random Harvest" is a big, terrifically entertaining, high-gloss tearjerker. If you're looking for a good, old-fashioned romance-drama in the MGM vein, you can't go wrong with this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed the picture - how could it go wrong with Ronald Coleman and Greer Garson?But I think the plot played fast and loose with the symptoms of amnesia.What Smithy had, given his circumstances (trench warfare and all that) was undoubtedly 'organic'amnesia which rarely lasts for long periods of time. And amnesiacs, after they recover, usually remember what they did while in the fugue state. Rainier, having completely forgotten Smithy, was obviously in another fugue state,from which he eventually recovered on returning to the cottage. So did he continue on as Smithy or Rainier? Probably a combination of both, but the movie leaves us guessing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderfully old-fashioned love story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A woman and an amnesiac fall in love in "Random Harvest," based on the novel by James Hilton. Hilton is also famous for his novel "Lost Horizon," which was made into a very successful film - well, the first time around anyway.Greer Garson is a beautiful young music hall performer who saves an escapee from a mental asylum, "Smithy," played by Ronald Colman, who suffered trauma as a World War I soldier. The two fall in love, get married, and have a child. En route to a job interview in Liverpool, Smithy is hit by a car and loses his memory - and doesn't know what has happened to him in the last three years. He returns home to his wealthy family and a young woman (Susan Peters) who is in love with him, with no idea that he has a wife and child somewhere. This is old-fashioned romance and heartache at its very best. Colman is too old for the role but he and Garson make a great couple. Garson has rarely been more beautiful. This is a very sweet story that really touches the heart.Susan Peters plays the young girl in love with Rainier - the Colman character's real name. She's very spunky, but because of Colman's age, this doesn't seem like much of a match. However, she received an Oscar nomination and was really on her way with MGM. Unfortunately, she was shot during a hunting accident three years later. MGM kept her going by having her write an interview column for one of the fan magazines. She worked occasionally from a wheelchair after her injury in film and on stage, but died in 1952, in her early thirties. A real tragedy. "Random Harvest" is an opportunity to see this truly lovely young woman during her all-too-short career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hair Giveaways</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been observed that Greer Garson's hairstyle in "Random Harvest" remains '40s throughout although the story's period settings vary.The fact is that most period pieces, no matter how meticulously steps are taken to make the costuming, sets and decor look "authentic," women's hairstyles are a "giveaway."The problem, it seems, is that the leads apparently want to look their most attractive, and producers want to sell their product. Contemporary hairstyles are the last thing to be altered, for fear of "turning off" audiences, especially female patrons. So, regardless of when a story's supposed to take place, one can almost always count on ladies' hairstyles reflecting more what was in vogue when the film was actually made. That's seems one bit of "realism" that everyone just sort of overlooks and goes along with the fantasy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this film when I was a child. My mother and I used to watch old films every Saturday afternoon on TV. It has always made me cry, particularly Ronald Coleman's depiction of a soldier returning from war. The part where the couple come to visit Ronald in the hospital, thinking that it may be their son, is really heartbreaking. I think that film, more than any other war film, really brought home to me how soldiers are forever affected by their war experiences.The film is really atmospheric, and Greer Garson is such an unselfish character in the film. Her beauty radiates. The theme really seems to be about sacrifice, what he sacrifices for his country, and what she sacrifices when his memory returns, and he cannot remember having met her, or fallen in love.</fullReview>

When Paula takes him into her trust and care, the way she does it blows you away. For 1942, Greer Garson was sexy. In that kilt and Scottish get-up, I fell in love. She by far plays that part the way no one else could. She has that pension for doing that part where she breaks down. When talking to the doctor about her husband in any part, her emotion comes straight out, and makes you feel for her.All in all, I just have to say this is my favourite movies of all time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All but perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since this is one of my 3 favorite movies (right behind "GWTW" and "Ben-Hur", I'm pleased to see that the vast majority of reviews here are extremely positive.I want to begin my review my dismissing several of the oft-heard criticisms of the film. First, that Colman was too old for the role. When you a have a film than spans nearly 20 years, any actor is going to be either too young for the older scenes, or too old for the younger scenes. Either way, there's going to be lots of makeup. Colman was 51 when he made this film, meaning that if you want to go with actual ages, his character would have been 47 when he entered the military at the beginning of WWI. In actuality, that made Colman 6 years to old for enlistment status (41 was the upper limit). But just right to be the "industrial prince" of Great Britain later in the film. So you either err in the age of the soldier, or you err in the age of the industrialist.Another criticism is the need to suspend belief. Yup. That's what the vast majority of movies require. If not, you're usually either watching a very boring fictional movie or a documentary. Normal life portrayed on the big screen isn't usually very interesting.Another criticism is that the film brings in the twist midway through the film, rather than at the very end, as the novel did. Well, doing the film way simply wouldn't have worked. Garson would have had to have been absent for half the film. And, the choice is between total surprise, or the interest in seeing how each of the main characters deals with the "ruse". And, Garson's character (Paula) explains why she wants the relationship only when Colman's character (Smithy/Charles) comes to a realization based on love and remembrance, not based on when he feels a legal responsibility. And frankly, I recently read the book, and I thought it was awful. And I doubt that most readers knew about the plot twist before reading the book; you just can't keep secrets like that.One criticism of this film that I hear that is accurate, though of little consequence, is that the hair and clothing styles of the women are not accurate to the time period. Fair criticism, but fairly common in the cinema.The one major criticism I have is the character of Kitty, played by Susan Peters. Supposedly being only 15 when she first meets Charles, while he is clearly in his 40s (by movie standards), not only didn't work for me, but I found a bit repulsive. It would be easier to tolerate the liaison if Kitty had been fresh out of college when they met -- a May/December romance -- but this is a bit too much. Not only that, but despite others praising her acting here, I was not impressed at all. She was far more suited to the next film she made -- an Andy Hardy piece where she was a co-ed. This one flaw is the reason that, for me, I can't give the film a "10".I hold Greer Garson and Ronald Colman in almost equal esteem. There are some who see this as Garson's film, but I disagree. Considering the degree of suspension of belief required of viewers here, Colman had the task of holding the center while being a shell-shock victim and amnesiac on the one hand, and becoming the industrial prince of England and a member of Parliament on the other. I noticed one of our reviewers for criticizing Colman for "walking through" the film. I had an uncle that was shell-shocked in WWII, and that's exactly what he did -- walked through life with something missing. And Colman portrays that perfectly, without going over the edge. He talks to Paula about wishing he had belonged to the couple at the asylum. Perfect. He becomes easily distracted by certain semi-flashbacks, but not able to focus on them. Perfect. This should have won the Academy Award (although I'm not taking anything away from James Cagney). And then there's the scene which is as good an acting job as I've seen -- at the cottage door when all you see is the back of Colman's head as the memory returns. Though lasting only seconds, you see several stages of returning memory in just the way his body tenses in very slightly different movements. Absolutely perfect.Greer Garson also plays this perfectly. Just the type who would take in a stray dog. Just the type who would want the relationship to be based on love, rather than responsibility. And her dance routine -- so very entertaining...and different for her! I fell in love with Greer Garson watching this film.There are other actors in the film who make it feel so comfortable -- Henry Travers, Reginald Owen, Una O'Connor, Margaret Wycherly, and more. But Philip Dorn, a Dutch actor, stands out as the psychiatrist.I love this film and have for years. Since its DVD release, I find myself watching it a couple of times a year. I never grow tired of it. Almost the perfect film.</fullReview>

Susan could have become a star after this but she sadly became paralysed when she was injured in a hunting accident and died a few years later.One of the best romances of the studio era,Random Harvest is one that you won't forget in a hurry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Superb, endearing film with Ronald Colman giving a masterful performance as Smitty, an amnesiac who finds happiness with actress-singer Greer Garson. While on a job hunt, he meets with an accident and is thrown back to his former life-Charles Rainier, a wealthy industrialist and eventual member of the British parliament. Seeing his picture in the paper, Garson becomes his faithful secretary and the two eventually marry again. (She had him declared previously legally dead after 7 years.)With success and wealth abundant, something is terribly wrong for Colman. He can't grasp at it. Susan Peters was wonderful, especially in her memorable scene where she realized that she was not the one for Colman. She well merited her best supporting actress nomination.The old adage that money isn't everything and can't buy you happiness is well proved here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Colman is well cast as a World War I amnesia victim who tries to piece his life back together in this solid drama; he was a master of projecting melancholy and wistfulness. Garson, as a woman who helps him and falls in love with him, is quite radiant, giving a better performance than in "Mrs. Miniver," for which she won an Oscar the same year. Peters, who plays a pretty young lady smitten by Colman, died tragically at age 31 after a shooting accident. Although the romantic plot has elements of soap opera, LeRoy has the good sense to keep it from turning too mawkish. It is beautifully photographed and the finale is quite moving.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Affecting story about love and memory loss</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found the idea at the core of Random Harvest pretty moving. What if the person you loved couldn't remember you? There's something mystical about memory. We're nostalgic about our favourite things from childhood. It's a profound feeling when very old memories are triggered by a sense or a thought. Luke believed there was good in Darth Vader despite an overwhelming lack of evidence. We want to believe everything is remembered, somewhere deep down. True love cannot be entirely forgotten. It must live on somewhere.Ronald Colman walks out of an asylum when nobody is watching. He was there because he lost his memory near the end of the war. Maybe from an injury or from stress or shock. He doesn't talk much. But he meets a friendly lady (Greer Garson) by chance and she goes out of her way to help him. She trusts him for some reason. He appreciates her kindness and seems to recover his mental stability. Eventually, they fall in love.The movie maintains tension as we don't know where it is heading and we know nothing about this man or his nature. More stuff happens and his memory problems become an issue. The movie takes place over many years. It's a little tricky piecing things together as the film is indirect with a lot of information. It's not always obvious how much time has passed or what has happened to people. But it does make sense overall.One part of the plot in particular seems far-fetched. I'm skeptical about whether it's possible or has ever occurred in real life. But it creates the situation that the romance and drama reside within. If we simply accept it, the concept is powerful and affecting. The important thing is that the story and acting are very good. And the music is also very nice. I was unexpectedly moved to tears by the end of the movie. The feelings of Garson's character really resonated with me. And it's just a wonderfully beautiful story anyway. I was frustrated that Garson wasn't saying certain things but now I think I understand why. I'm very happy I discovered this movie. We watch movies to be affected and this one did that in many ways.</fullReview>

My favorite star, Ronald Coleman, was there and that is what made me even want to watch it. I have never seen Greer Garson but know of her great talent from Mrs. Miniver and this pair made the fine story even finer with their convincing and earnest acting. Oh! for the days when we had real actors and real stories come out of Hollywood! I do not recall any other romantic drama from Hollywood that is this memorable or haunting as this one. Only Wuthering Heights with Lawrence Olivier and Merle Oberon came close.Ronald Coleman and Greer Garson did a superb job of producing a variety of expressions on their faces to match their words and atmosphere. Some scenes would bring tears to the eyes even in grown men. The movie as a whole including the sets and period costumes was impeccable.I wonder if any one with a fascination for old Hollywood classics noticed the actress that played the little lady owner of the tobacconist shop. She was the one that performed so delightfully as the half blind house keeper in that famous film, Witness for the Prosecution.</fullReview>

While they carry the English emphasis on correct behavior nearly to the breaking point, I still love the mystery and unsettled nature to this psychological mellodrama. In the scene where Kitty realizes Sir Charles does not love her, Coleman does incredible things with his face that defy description. Just his expression convinces her and us he does not love her.

		<shortDescription>Joyous Suspension of Disbelief</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why does Random Harvest work? It does not regard any semblance of the way things work in this world, from amnesia to the capacity to which anyone could bear pursuing someone they love to chronology. I know what this is. It is suspension of disbelief. My concern is why it works, why it was after the film was over that I started to realize that it was full of it.The film opens during the closing days of WWI. Ever poised Ronald Colman is a British officer who was shellshocked in the trenches, now restricted to an asylum because he has lost his memory and has trouble speaking. When the war ends, joy rules in the nearby town and the gatekeepers desert their posts to join the merriment. With no one to stop him, Colman simply wanders off?OK?For some reason, I bought that. I was happy he was able to escape. Good.In town, he is befriended by Greer Garson, who will always hold a tender place with me for her work in William Wyler's Mrs. Miniver, here a benevolent showgirl, who takes him under her wing. After she finds out he has escaped, but seems harmless, she arranges for him to join her traveling theater group. After a confrontation that endangers them with unwelcome attention, she takes him away to a quiet, out of the way country village, where they marry and are ecstatically on cloud nine.Colman realizes a talent at writing and tries to earn a living at it. He leaves Garson and their newborn baby for an overnight trip to Liverpool for a job interview with a newspaper. On his way, he is hit by a cab. When he comes to, his past memory is reinstated, but his life with Garson is now completely gone and forgotten. I mean, doesn't that seem like it would make sense? From there, it unravels surprises and we are deflated from the bliss of his life as an amnesiac, at least as much as director Mervyn LeRoy will let us be deflated.I know that James Hilton's original novel was different, and had less of a problem deflating us in the name of dramatic effect and a familiarity with life outside the movie theater. But Mervyn LeRoy restricts his vision of the story to the rule of splendor. Loveliness substitutes simple function, and the film, rather than taking license the way an Indiana Jones movie would, imposes its creative set of laws on life. LeRoy is involved with forming a congruous and well-proportioned society founded on handsome ideas and stuffed with a pleasant aesthetic. He is of the cinematic view that sculpts out a world in which we can wholeheartedly escape from the one to which we will be returning in no time.This is just the sort of movie in which elitist cynicism toward film is rooted, but, hey, it works. I was happy. Somehow, I was transported. I bought the whole thing for 125 minutes and only grasped its abandon afterward.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I caught this again tonight, it must be my fourth viewing and it never fails to carry me along on its quite unbelievable plot and really hokey Hollywood lot exteriors. The reason, of course, is the stars, Ronald Coleman in one of his decent, agonized roles that he made quite his own and Greer Carson looking so beautiful and fragile and always quivering bravely on the edge of tears. The plot is convoluted and really pushes the credibility metre the wrong way. We are asked to believe that a shell shocked WW1 veteran who can barely speak has completely forgotten his past. So far so good. He meets and marries his rescuer (Greer of course) and they have a child. He takes off on a writing job, suffers an accident with no ID on him and remembers all he left behind prior to Greer and forgets all about the interlude with Greer. Many years later Greer gets a job as his personal secretary and this still doesn't jog his memory, he is all prepared to marry someone else and then through another co-incidence, marries Greer in a contractual, passionless arrangement. Of course it all irons its way out in the end. The stars are faultless, Ronald got an Oscar as did a remarkable performance by Susan Peters as the young love interest. 8 out 10. A sinful indulgence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Kleenex inspired finale will doubtless appeal to romantics seeking a happy ending, but I always have trouble putting films like this under the microscope. There's so much suspension of disbelief necessary to pull this one off that it becomes a distraction. It begins with Paula's (Greer Garson) virtual pick-up of a World War I veteran (Ronald Colman) who can't even remember his name. This is not my idea of rational behavior, and for Paula to persevere in this romance and virtually smuggle her 'Smithy' out of Melbridge County doesn't seem the best way to embark on a new life together. But not leaving well enough alone, the story then goes on to have Colman's character restore his pre-War memories and reclaim his former past, but in the process forget about his marriage to Paula. When she turns up as the secretary to the new Industrial Prince of England, it was almost too much to bear for this reality based viewer. I won't even go into how the newly married couple managed to set up a household in the English countryside with no visible means of support. This was, you'll remember, before he set out for London for that job interview with The Mercury, and Paula had long since left her position with the dance hall troupe.For the sake of a better review, I'd have to sweep virtually all of this impossible stuff under the rug, along with fifteen year old Kitty's (Susan Peters) starry eyed obsession with a man easily three times her own age, only to throw him over without a second thought when she 'suddenly' came to her senses. Certainly the characters deserved better than to be held hostage to a desire to find normalcy once again. Though the film held firm those traits of enduring love and loyalty, it just wasn't convincing enough for me. For their part, Colman and Garson hold up their end with portrayals that work magic if you're not particularly concerned with realism. I wish I could be more positive, but this one just didn't work for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having just finished reading for the first time Random Harvest, I was interested to see the movie based on it. I wish I hadn't. The book is brilliantly cynical and perceptive and tantalizing; the movie is hokey and saccharine and ungainly. The book's conclusion (and I do mean the very last line) hits the reader in the solar plexus when we learn that Mrs. Charles Ranier is also the true love, the first wife, Paula. This stunning turn of events makes the reader reevaluate the entire book; it makes the reader realize that he, the reader, has been in his own amnesiac haze. With no words left to read, we realize we have been as lost as has Charles/Smithy. Well, the movie reveals this "secret" half way through the film, so there's absolutely no jolt to the ending. To be fair to the movie makers, I don't see how the story could have been made into a visual medium without doing this--short of resorting to some really artificial device, such as having a different actress play the part of the secretary/new Mrs. Rainier who then morphs back into Greer Garson at the end. This inability to achieve the surprise element, which is the sine quo non of Random Harvest, argues that this is a novel that should never have been filmed.However, let's look at some of the other shortcomings of this movie that make this a dreadful piece. First off, perhaps Ronald Colman was seen as a dashing leading man in his era, but time has not been kind to this definition of "dashing." More than that, though, is the fact that he is WAY too old and WAY too sexless to be Charles/Smithy. I can find no reason why Paula would have found him appealing or mysterious, let alone sexy. The next problem is the cheesy painted scenery. Everything looks like a high school stage setting, including the obviously model trains! The photography style is actually quite elegant, especially the lighting, but what is photographed is laughably implausible. Equally bad is the "romance" of the young girl for Charles. Since Ronald Colman looks so old, the age difference makes the viewer positively uncomfortable when they kiss. Yet another problem with the movie is a bias that is tossed into the screen play that is troubling; namely, it is the obvious pro-union/anti-capitalist slant one gets. Finally, the major problem with the movie is the fact that it has been removed from the time in which it was most definitely meant to be set. The story was written to be playing out against the rise of Fascist totalitarianism and the despair of a Europe going to hell in a hand basket. Yet this is totally absent from the movie, replaced by breathless but artificial "when will they get together again" romance.Recommendation: Read the book, skip the movie. Time has enhanced the former but has shone a bright light on the flaws of the latter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As every bigamist's dream . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . RANDOM HARVEST provided the blueprint for thousands of men to subsequently establish multiple households with multiple wives. Sure, technically "Smithy"\Charles commits double marriage with the SAME WOMAN (so that the censors would remain happy). But it's not hard to read between the lines. When you enjoy Dale Carnegie Get Rich Quick training, you learn to compartmentalize your life (think Bernie Madoff). Though the military man in this movie harvests his women serially due to his randomly alternating realities, it doesn't take too much imagination on the viewer's part to tweak the plot and shorten the time between towns\households\wives from this flick's lengthy 3 to 15 years down to a more reasonable 3 to 15 days or hours. Though some men have been known to reap their RANDOM HARVEST among as many as four or five separate families, this strikes me as being too stressful, not unlike a show performer trying to keep five stacks of plates perpetually spinning atop five tall poles (sooner or later, some china is going to shatter). However, if an amnesiac can "randomy harvest" the same woman twice, how hard can it be for someone with all their marbles to seed and harvest two or three a few fields miles apart?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sentimental tear-jerker gives Garson and Colman ideal roles...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To say that RANDOM HARVEST was a highly popular success when released in 1942 is almost an understatement. It played for ten weeks at the huge Radio City Music Hall, filling it with appreciative fans who couldn't get enough of this sentimental James Hilton romance.Most of its success is due to the charisma of RONALD COLMAN and GREER GARSON, both at their absolute peak of professional charm and poise, with Colman doing a magnificent job of making the shell-shocked "Smithy" one of his most appealing characters and Garson giving one of her most radiant performances as Paula.But if you take a moment to examine the story contents, it makes you realize what an accomplishment the performances are since the story has so many flaws in realism, particularly regarding the instant falling in love that happens when Garson first discovers "Smithy" is from an asylum and then her refusal to tell him the truth for a long period of time while she patiently waits for him to get his memory back. Too patiently.The amnesia theme was a favorite of '40s Hollywood and it has never been used to better advantage than it is here. But the instant attraction between SUSAN PETERS and Colman when he returns to his snobbish family after an auto accident that makes him forget Paula, seems a contrivance that doesn't ring true. Nor do the subtle clues that bring his memory back seem reasonable enough to swallow. However, the moment when she realizes he is still thinking of another, is brilliantly handled by both Peters and Colman.Nevertheless, all of the schmaltz has been so skillfully directed by Mervyn LeRoy that most will fall under the spell of the film's unrelenting romanticism and let cynicism fade. That's just as well, because LeRoy's direction is slow-paced at times, almost cumbersome, letting the film run to an inordinate length before letting "Smithy" and Paula get together for a final embrace while cherry blossoms fall and the music swells to an appropriate volume for "The End".I don't rank this film as high as WATERLOO BRIDGE or TO EACH HIS OWN, both romances that skillfully told a tale without resorting to the glossy romantic close-ups and violin music that "Harvest" uses to accentuate the chemistry of Colman and Garson--a distinctly MGM trait.But they do have enormous chemistry and that is the factor that makes the whole unbelievable story work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well mounted piece of sentimental hokum</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This glossy romantic melodrama has Ronald Colman as a WW I amnesia victim, and Greer Garson as his main love interest. I will not spoil your potential enjoyment by providing plot twists, except to say that the film-makers, starting with the book author James Hilton, are absolutely shameless. If you can get by the very high hokum factor, you can expect a pleasant time; if not, don't say I didn't warn you.I concur with James Agee's contemporary review, in his very first film column for The Nation: "I would like to recommend Random Harvest to those who can stay interested in Ronald Colman's amnesia for two hours, and who could with pleasure eat a bowl of Yardley's shaving soap for breakfast."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The novel, 'Random Harvest' by James Hilton might be un-filmable.I read this book every year on November 11. And, every year a lump forms in my throat at the novels' end.Unfortunately, the movie doesn't deliver. Ronald Coleman is mis-cast (too old), Robert Donat would have been better. The movie doesn't capture the feeling of pre-WWII England sonambulisticly heading into war. Hilton did a great job with the novel; but unlike his 'Lost Horizon' and 'Good-bye, Mr. Chips', Hollywood couldn't put it on the screen.-30-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a bit silly and soapy but great fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first exposure to this film was Carol Burnett's parody of it on television. Interestingly enough, her version wasn't all that different from the real story. It is a soapy story of a VERY long-suffering woman (Greer Garson) who falls for an amnesiac (Ronald Coleman). They marry and live happily ever after,....until Coleman suddenly reverts to his original personality and has no recollection of Garson at all! This sounds a lot like a soap opera or the Flintstones or some sitcom plot device, but despite it being so improbable, it still works. Why? Well the direction, cinematography and acting are SO good you can't help but suspend belief and enjoy--provided you are one who appreciates films from the Golden Age of Hollywood.FYI--I also read the book and the plot is VERY different. Not necessarily better--just different.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greer Garson begins the film by making a mistake that would be viewed humorously in a contemporary work: She falls for a man she knows has escaped from a psychiatric hospital. She's a (rather unconvincing) music hall headliner and takes him under her wing.The man, Ronald Colman, has amnesia. They are happy for a while till ... Well, I can't give away the plot. Suffice it to say, he finds himself back in his true identity, that of a man whose rich father has -- what a coincidence! -- just died and left him a manor. He starts on a new life and Garson reappears.Susan Peters is very appealing as the woman to whom he proposes in this second part. Garson is OK. I love her in "Good-bye, Mr. Chips" and "Pride and Prejudice." Here, she is the centerpiece of a wooden, overproduced tear-jerker that left me completely dry-eyed.Colman is a fine performer too. Here he is called on primarily to wander around in a daze. To see him at his best, catch "A Double Life." That is a terrific picture -- one of George Cukor's best and, for some reason, least shown.Though I had never gone out of my way to see this before, I think I watched it with an open mind. And for me, it's fancy but just not very good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I couldn't care less about the amnesiac man and his fate. Watching him trying to talk and the woman caring so much about a total stranger while soft music was playing over cardboard landscapes was too much for me.I couldn't watch the whole film out of boredom but I read it's* synopsis. I don't believe in selective memory loss and so I consider the plot nonsensical. First he looses* his memory then he gets what was lost before, but than* again he looses* other memories because of a convenient accident so the plot can go on to make a sappy love story.And lead actor is wrong for the part, he is way to* old to be a soldier. It would have been easy to find who he was after the shock. Just look for missing 3 star generals. It usually takes 30 years to be promoted to that rank and this guy looks about 50.And someone tell me why was a beautiful and kind woman like the lead actress conveniently single without any love interest in her past?*Intentional errors in accordance with Internet protocol.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Minor spoiler below.It's true that the performances by the two stars are first rate, and Greer Garson is stunning, but what about the duds in this film? One point is Susan Peters' accent. How did they happen to have an all-American girl in the English family? Another big defect is the lack of period feel. The passage of years from 1918 to the 30s is an important feature of the story, yet any sense of this is very sketchy indeed. In particular, Greer Garson wears 1942 fashions and hairstyles virtually throughout. The outdoor scenery also leaves a lot to be desired, even by 1940s studio-bound standards, especially the fuzzy cardboard country cottage. The story is OK -- this is not meant to be social realism -- but why does the film miss out the key moment of Greer Garson's character coming back into the Coleman character's life?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Romantic Slog with Ronald Colman and Greer Garson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plausibility was never a strong suit of 1940s romantic melodramas, but even at that "Random Harvest" is just too much to bear.This ridiculous twaddle finds Ronald Colman as a WWI veteran who has lost his memory and wanders out of the mental institution in which he has been living, only to be adopted by Greer Garson, an actress/singer who performs atrocious musical numbers in terrible stage revues, and who falls in love with him instantly and marries him. Years pass and they have a baby. Then one day, when Colman goes into the city on some business, he's hit by a car and regains the memories he previously lost, but loses all of the memories he's gathered since the last time he lost his memory (following me?). He then returns to his hoity-toity family, is set upon by a young step-niece who wants to marry him, becomes a big shot, and completely forgets about wife and child. Meanwhile, Garson, suffering nobly, becomes his secretary(!) so that she can be close to him and help him possibly regain his memory of her.If all of this sounds like it would make for a juicy soap opera, it maybe would, if someone other than Mervyn LeRoy had directed it. Instead, this film drags pointlessly on and has no life to it. Characters come to dramatic conclusions and life changes in the blink of an eye, with no set up from the screenplay, so that plot twists seem to happen completely at random. Garson's early obsession with Colman comes across as a bit too intense and unstable; likewise, Colman's step-niece (Susan Peters) attaches herself to him with a creepy obstinacy. I half wondered if she was only marrying him for the money he stood to inherit from the family fortune, and was disappointed when I found out that wasn't the case -- at least that would have explained her behavior. As it is, that whole story line could have been left out of the movie altogether without sacrificing much of anything, and it would have had the added advantage of making it about half an hour shorter.Greer Garson brings some glamorous beauty to her role, but little else. Colman sleep walks through the movie. Everything is languorous and dull, perhaps welcome attributes to a battle-weary WWII audience, but we ain't in WWII any more. The only thing I liked about the movie was its visual style, which borrows the chilly, shadowy look that was emerging as the predominant style of film noir. The early scenes even display hints of German Expressionism, I'm sure meant to be a visual representation of Colman's fragile mental state. Everything else about the movie is a slog.Grade: D</fullReview>
