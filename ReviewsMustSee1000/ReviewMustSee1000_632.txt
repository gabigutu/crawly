		<shortDescription>The fine line between love and hate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Believer" contains rare insights into Jewish identity, and it's a shame that the film was withheld from mainstream audiences due to ongoing controversy. But it deals with an ugly subject, and it handles that subject in an ambiguous way that makes many people, including many Jews, uncomfortable. Make no mistake about it, though: the film is uncompromisingly pro-Jewish, and the director, himself a Jew, has said that he became more religious because of his work on the film. Ironically, the film is likely to resonate the most with Jews, though it also contains universal themes familiar to anyone who has ever struggled with faith.The idea of a white supremacist who's secretly Jewish is not new to me. I've long known about Frank Collin, who caused a national controversy in the 1970s when he planned to have his neo-Nazi group march in a predominantly Jewish suburb of Skokie, Illinois. It was later discovered that Collin's father was not only Jewish but a Holocaust survivor. This case is so bizarre that it leads one to assume the guy was simply insane. While there may be some truth to that assumption, it isn't a satisfactory explanation. What would possibly lead a Jew to join a group that believes in the inherent evil of all Jews? What is such a person thinking? How does such a person live with himself, rationalize his own actions?What "The Believer" accomplishes is to go inside the head of one such person and provide a compelling, believable explanation for how such a person could exist. The film is based loosely on a 1960s incident in which a high-ranking member of the KKK was discovered to be Jewish. The movie updates the story to modern times and depicts the young man, Danny, as a skinhead rather than a Klansman. His characterization is speculative but reveals a deep understanding of human nature.What's truly bizarre about this story is that Danny never abandons his Jewish roots entirely. After attending a neo-fascist meeting, he goes home to his family, whom he treats with respect. He even performs Jewish rituals in private. Yet he terrorizes a Jewish kid on the subway, tells his neo-Nazi buddies that he wants to assassinate a prominent Jewish diplomat, and spouts what sounds on the surface like typical white supremacist ideology. But he's not, as we might suspect, a hypocrite saying things he doesn't believe, or a two-faced lunatic. His philosophy is surprisingly coherent. Sure, he's a walking contradiction, but so are many other people who have a love-hate relationship with their religious background.His anti-Semitic beliefs all revolve around a single idea: he thinks Jews are too weak and passive. Sometimes he adopts a macho outlook, since he doesn't want to be associated with a people stereotyped as brainy intellectuals. On a deeper level, he dislikes the persecution theme in Jewish history and culture. But is this theme a sign of weakness or strength? Danny isn't sure. He eventually decides that Jews gain strength from their persecution; they seem to grow stronger the worse they're treated, and the biggest threat to their survival is not those who want to destroy them but those who don't care. This is a far more Jewish idea than an anti-Semitic one. Several Jewish holidays, including Passover, Purim, and Chanukah, commemorate events where Jews grew strong after periods of persecution. Many Jews today believe that assimilation into the culture is a greater danger than genocide, because it could signal the disappearance of Jews as a distinct people. As Irving Kristol once remarked, "The problem is that they don't want to persecute us, they want to marry us."The implication is that Danny actually admires Judaism, and that his anti-Semitism is his own warped way of affirming his Jewish identity in a world where, he fears, Jews are increasingly seen as irrelevant--not loved or hated but simply ignored. His ambivalent feelings escalate as the movie progresses. When he has his neo-Nazi buddies deface a synagogue, he can't bring himself to damage the Torah scroll, and he secretly takes it home with him. His intimate knowledge of Jewish beliefs and practices looks strange to his fellow skinheads, to say the least. He tells them that he studies these things in order to know the enemy, pointing out that Eichmann did the same thing. Do they buy this explanation? Apparently they do, but Danny's girlfriend is a little smarter than that, and she finds herself strangely drawn to the religion he's running away from.Like "American History X," this movie contains disturbing scenes where the protagonist articulately expresses his bigoted ideas. There are other intelligent characters who argue back, but not everything he spouts gets answered, so I can understand why this movie makes some viewers uncomfortable. In one particularly distasteful scene, Danny mocks Holocaust survivors, and while they do answer him eloquently for the most part, his raising of the old "sheep to the slaughter" canard is left open.Nevertheless, this a powerful and compelling film, with a lead performance by Ryan Gosling that manages to rival Ed Norton's Oscar-nominated performance in "American History X." We see early on that Danny is capable of doing appalling things, but his moral conflicts are then presented so persuasively that we cannot help but empathize with him. The climax is painfully ambiguous. Those who are looking for easy answers may want to skip this film. But they will be missing out on what is easily the most authentic and profound exploration of Jewish self-hatred ever portrayed on screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intelligent and Provocative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found myself alone in an small theater yesterday watching "The Believer". The absence of a crowd didn't have any impact what so ever on my experience with this film.Daniel Balint is a promising new right wing extremist who, with his radical ideas and eloquence, wins over the minds of a small group of neo-Nazis. At first he expresses that he wants Jews dead because, as he states, anti-semitism is a human instinct. But Daniel is a Jew himself. He denies his roots, But as the movie progresses he must come to terms with who he is. And that's not always easy.Ryan Gosling who plays Daniel is a frightening good actor, who almost manages to persuade the audience of his anti-semitic views. I really can't praise Ryan Gosling enough! He could be one of the great new actors to come. The interesting aspect of this movie is the mental struggle in Daniels mind whether he's a Nazi or a Jew. Or both? It's about finding out who you are. The films poses some very intelligent questions, and provokes at times, and this is the films force. This movie is brilliant! Go see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely thought-provoking masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Believer is the kind of film that has social relevance beyond the contents of the actual film. Highly-censored through corporate teamwork, The Believer was never picked up by a major distribution house because of its provocative subject matter. The film demands a re-examination of beliefs and a discussion. Isn't this the kind of provocative free-thinking that the medium is about? The Believer is one of the top 5 films i've seen in the last few years, in regards to disturbing consciousness. It is the kind of movie that can help us understand one another a little better. A MUST SEE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>God said to Abraham:kill me a son!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Antisemitism has come a long way since "gentleman's agreement"(1947).Kazan's attempt seems rather timid and tame today."The believer " sets the record straight.It's one of the most convincing works in the field.It's all the more disturbing as the hero is a Jew joining the neonazis.And his behavior stems from his own education,his rebellion against the Torah:Abraham did really kill his own son,the Jew was made to comply with God's commandments;the hero finds similarities between the Nazis's and the Jews's beliefs ;both are the Chosen ones .What puzzles me is the fact that he wants to annihilate the Jews ,but he stills reads (and respects) the Bible(One shall not be naked in front of it for flesh is impure).His arguments are sometimes disquieting (hints at Marx,Freud and Einstein) but finally it boils down to "we hate the Jews because we have to".Danny is definitely a complex character,caught in a web of contradictions.One of the strongest scenes shows former victims of the Nazis during WW2;it's of course with them that we side ,and whatever Danny says about how he despises their passivity ,his protected life makes him incapable of true grit.Spoilers Danny's final sacrifice is revealing:if God's wrath had killed him as pharaoh's tribe drowned in the tide (eg if he had accidentally been killed during one of his terrorisma acts or sentenced to death by a human court),the movie would have been a religious one (God's victory on evil).Danny chose the other way out.They will be speaking for a long time of the final sequence :it resembles an atheist version of that of "Jacob's ladder".The stairs and the teacher's sentence have something of Borges.End of spoilers.To say that "the believer" is unique is to state the obvious.Even more intriguing,the most celebrated names (Theresa Russel and Billy Zane) are only supporting actors.At a time when graveyards are often profaned,when the far right wing's bad moon is on the rise almost everywhere ,this kind of film has become a necessity.Henry Bean is a very clever director and I hope to see more of his films in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ryan Gosling -- Superstar!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think I first saw Mr. Gosling in Murder by Numbers, in which he played half of a modern-day Leopold and Loeb murder team. In that good-but-not-great thriller, he did a fine job with an easy role: the smarmy manipulator who's convinced his Intellect is so superior to everyone else's that he has the right -- no, the obligation -- to kill those inferior to himself.In The Believer, Gosling plays the young fascist who really seems to believe the antisemitic vitrol he spews. His skinhead punk is just as scary, believable and *common* as Edward Norton's in American History X -- with the added layer of being from an Orthodox background. He has apparently convinced those around him that his fascination with all things Judaic is only an effort to "know his enemy thoroughly" -- nothing more.Gosling is nothing short of astounding in this role. He richly deserves all the honors bestowed upon him. If he continues to only get roles like Murder by Numbers, it will be a waste of a wonderful natural resource, kind of like strip mining in Yellowstone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nazi-Jew Identity Crisis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like "Romper Stomper" and the intensely powerful "American History X," here we have another brilliant film which revolves around National Socialism and the fiercely racist ideals behind it. This movie, however, varies strongly from the two previously mentioned in that it seems to have been researched far more heavily, and, focuses on not a general Neo-Nazi or skinhead, but on a young Jewish man?who has turned to Neo-Nazis and fascism for strength. This film revolves around a young man who was born and raised into Judaism only to become heavily fed up with the styles, rules, rituals, and apparent hypocrisies therein. Ever since his youth he'd been questioning the Jewish faith and the very meaning of being Jewish. The film follows him as he struggles with the faith he was raised with and the Nazi ideals he adopts against it. Through it all, he also struggles with his own identity and the hypnotic way that these two opposing ideologies have power over people. On top of that, he's later recruited by a group of neo-fascists, so to speak, looking to make fascism a reputable political movement, much like Communism has evolved into Democratic societies these days as Socialism. Here's the breakdown: The Good: --The acting, for the most part is excellent. --The amount of information about both Nazism and Judaism is staggeringly well researched. At least, that's how it seems. --Nice cinematography and atmosphere. --Interesting story. Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help: --Decent music. --This film focuses very little time on "Neo-Nazis versus everybody;" it's more about Nazism and Judaism butting heads. The Bad: --Often times with movies of this nature, Nazi Movies, there is strong violence used in part to hammer home the intensity of the subject matter. This film focuses on the ideologies more than the violence and as such, actually doesn't feel as powerful as, say, "American History X." --During flashback sequences where we see the main character in his youth in school, the kid playing the part isn't exactly a great actor. --Somewhat predictable ending. The Ugly: --With the ideologies, stories, and characters?there's an awful lot going on in this film. Unfortunately, when the movie ends, if feels like there was a lot left unanswered, or simply, not fully explored. Memorable Scene: --There were actually quite a few. For me, it was the first several times we get to know the girl who becomes the main character's love interest?and all the ways it seems she's just not right in the head. Acting: 8/10 Story: 9/10 Atmosphere: 7/10 Cinematography: 8/10 Character Development: 9/10 Special Effects/Make-up: 0/10 (Movie didn't require any) Nudity/Sexuality: 3/10 Violence/Gore: 6/10 (Not as much violence as is common in films of this type) Dialogue: 9/10 (Some brilliant conversations and ideas throughout) Music: 7/10 Direction: 8/10 Cheesiness: 1/10 Crappiness: 0/10 Overall: 9/10 Be prepared to stomach a lot of harsh words and racism, but this is an intense film with a lot going on. Another one recommended to those with an interest in National Socialism, Judaism and their histories and ideologies. Full-fledged Nazis, ironically, will not like many of the directions this movie takes, and neither might serious Jews?the views expressed in this film are that strong. My final rating comes from the overall intelligence and strength of the film, despite is drawbacks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compelling storytelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inspired by real events, The Believer tells the story of a young Jewish man who is contradicted by his beliefs in neo-nazism. Ryan Gosling (Remember the Titans) plays Danny Balint, a Jew by birth and upbringing, who's ideas about the religion lead him into a world of denial and hate. Flashbacks show the viewer how Danny struggled with his early teachings of the faith and his lack of understanding would result in his decision to be a practicing, race-hating skinhead.Along the way, Danny meets up with Lina and Curtis played graciously by Theresa Russell and Billy Zane who want to recruit Danny and use his persuasive talents to advance their cause as fascists. It is in his first meeting with this couple that Danny also meets Carla (Summer Pheonix), a confused young girl who eventually befriends Danny and soon begins her quest to best understand the Jews through their language and traditions.In a later scene, Danny finds himself at a white supresmist training camp and meets other skinheads with the same hatred and desire to rid themselves of the Jewish population. Danny befriends the group and garnishes their respect with his fighting tactics, and on one fateful night, the group land themselves in jail after initiating a fight with two blacks on the street.It is here that the most disturbing and challenging scene of the movie takes place where the group is forced by the courts to enter counselling for their crime. This counselling would include Jews who survived the holocust who tell their story to the unappreciated skinhead audience. While the others argue that the Holocost never occurred, Danny is haunted by the story of an elderly man who tells of a German Soldier who stabbed and killed his son with a bayonette during World War II.This then leads Danny down two separate paths. On one side, he is a race hating monger, who begins to build bombs for the purpose of blowing up a synagogue. The other, a conflicted man of the Judaism faith who teaches Hebrew to his girlfriend and still practices the basics of the religion (don't light the candles at Yom Kippur before eating).Director/writer Henry Bean does a masterful job of keeping the pace of the movie going, while not being preachy or dumbing down to the audience. The director crafts the film and does not shy away from religious interpretations (why can Jews have cheese with meat, but they can have chicken with milk), without giving us his version of the answers. Dannys scene with the reporter from the New York Times is both honest and gripping in its language and its portrayal of a man trying to justify his racist views.Portrayed as an articulate and intelligent youth, Ryan Gosling sparkles on the screen and gives a commanding presence that is award winning material. He reveals the character to be someone of higher intelligence who hates his religion because he just can't understand all its principles. When Danny is first confronted with an opportunity to kill a Jew, he can't bring himself to promote the results that he preaches.In short, the movie has powerful moments, great acting and tells an unbelievable story of one man's quest to understand the world he was brought up in.

		<shortDescription>Powerful but not exploitative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I read a description of this film, I thought it would go overboard in the violence and "shock sequences." I was relieved and impressed that it left most of the violence to the imagination. The shock value comes from other places--the content, the dialogue. This is a very thought-provoking and smart movie, not at all preachy (and it easily could have been preachy). The acting is unforced and its story does not fall into the "American History X" trap: Its main character does not become an "all race loving" good guy. The protagonist in "The Believer" is a tortured soul, and his fate (although somewhat predictable) is fitting after the events in the film. This movie is another example that cable movies occasionally surpass theatrical movies in their subject matter and execution. Very well done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a strong story about self-hating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am amazed how little this impact this film has made. It looks like its distribution around 2001/9/11 events and the fact that some American Jewish circles feared that it can be mis-interpreted led to a limited distribution. However, the directing of Henry Bean, the acting of Ryan Gosling, and the strong treatment of a difficult subject should have led to more respect than this movie received.'The Believer' is the story of a young Jewish boy in today's America. Raised in a religious environment he is asking questions that are not unusual for a young Jewish person two or three generations after the Holocaut. Where was God during the Holocaust, and why did the Jewish people did so little to resist their oppressors? He is obviously giving the wrong answers, and not only loses his faith, but falls into the trap of self-hate, becoming a neo-Nazi and a Jew-hater, a self-hater in other words.There are many things that can be said and discussed around this theme. The character may seem paradoxical, but it is not impossible. The fact that the story is loosely inspired by a true character is not that relevant, what is important is that we can believe the motivations of the character and understand his evolution. Certainly a film to watch and think about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Showcase of Contradictions, Intelligent and Pertinent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is almost a sort of shame that the ever-hot topic of racism/anti-Semitism nearly outshines the more central struggle with spirituality and religion that Danny is going through. Many fascist/skinhead types seem to confuse or blend race and religion when considering Jews and Judaism. Danny certainly seems confused in this, but comes around toward the end of the film when he suggests to the fascist big-wigs that the way to eradicate Jews is to love them, absorb them (because, he believes, Judaism thrives on being hated, separate). My notion of Judaism has long been the same as that of Christianity and Islam: ALL adherents thrive on being hated, on being an underdog, and lose their power when they are most widely accepted and tolerated (Christians seem to have gotten more of being thrown to the lions than the Romans did, and Islamic pride seems to get stronger the worse the rest of the world treats its disciples). These religions are like three awful, brutish brothers, always at each other's throats, and, in the end, essentially nihilistic individually. Because of this, I can understand Danny's spirituality problem (but am left wondering why he did not consider religions outside of the three great desert religions of the middle east). Danny has few anchors to the earth (pagan?) world, a pair of kind old friends (from youth, the most pagan time in life), his weird but spiritually hungry lover (who seems to be looking for anything to fill a hole in her soul ...which is where Christians get so many of their converts); but there are many more negative influences present in the film, and these absorb him. Add to this the fact that he considers his god a bully, and Judaism more about doing things than believing (which is true with many Christians and Muslims), and you've got a foul spiritual mix. Once ousted in the papers, Danny would clearly not find a home in either of the two worlds he is a part of, and so suicide seems an easy solution (a physical solution, just like pumping iron and beating up kids in the street). Danny's fatal flaw seems to be that he keeps questioning and cannot just accept faith and submit to god (which works within the box of the film, though thankfully not in the universe outside of the three desert religions!). The final sort of afterlife scene was my favorite of the film and shows this clearly: Danny's former teacher stands in the stairwell, trying to get him to engage in a discussion on a religious argument while Danny keeps running up the stairs. "There's nothing up there," says the teacher, but Danny keeps going. A rather frightening image when you think about it ...and one adherents to the religion can keep for themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie didn't make sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really disappointed with this movie. It just DOES NOT make sense. I cannot believe all the 5 star reviewers. Does basic storytelling matter to you people? OK, where to begin......Gosling's Danny Bolint is a militantly self-hating Jew. Why? Not sure really. Through use of some clumsily overdramatic flashbacks, we learn that Danny enraged his Hebrew School teachers by challenging long accepted laws of Judaism. OK, fine. So Danny learns some untraditional teachings from his father. How that evolves into violent hatred for his own religion is anyone's guess.Well, as another reviewer wrote with the title, "You better believe this movie deserves 5 stars" explains:"Soon thereafter we learn that Danny himself was a yeshiva student. He's a Jew who has become a Nazi skinhead."EXACTLY! Hey buddy, how do we go from point A to point B here? So his father teaches him some non-traditional interpretations of the Torah and suddenly he's some violent hard-core Jewish Nazi? Huh? I think we need A LITTLE more than that people! Another reviewer stated that "you could tear any movie apart if you wanted to." Perhaps that is true. BUT this is a FUNDAMENTAL part of this movie! Its a fascinating concept that deserves a reasonable explanation. This movie fails miserably on this crucial point, that alone should keep it from 5 stars, but of course, there is much more:OK, so after going into a synagogue, this violent Nazi who has no qualms about beating up Jewish kids, setting up bombs in synagogoes to kill dozens of Jews, has the uncontrollable urge to protect the Torah from his friends and other religous properties? Not just that, but he reveals his immense knowledge of Judaism in front all his fellow Nazis and gives them obvious hints that he's Jewish, for no apparent reason, throughout the film (ex. wearing a Hebrew cloth inside his shirt, keeping and protecting objects from the synagogue, goes to a Temple, says a Jewish prayer in his room and in front of fellow Nazis, teaching his bizarre girlfriend Hebrew. Why does she want to learn it? Don't ask me). Even though he says to the reporter that he would KILL HIMSELF if it was ever found out he was Jewish he gives these obvious clues throughout the film.When Danny was with his friend attempting to shoot at a Jewish couple, he finds he can't/won't do it, and then his Hebrew cloth is revealed to his friend who realizes he's Jewish. Danny then shoots at him and leaves the area........OK.....Soooo what happens to his friend? Is he dead? Is he injured? Does he survive to tell anyone? The character completely dissapears and we never hear what happened to him. Once again, thats amateurish storytelling at best, dissapearing characters is not a minor detail. Jeez, I would get upset if this happened at a local high school play, let alone an award-winner that I'm paying money for!Another unexplained event in the film is perhaps the best part: during the resensitivity seminar when Danny and his friends hear stories from Holocaust survivers. Danny offends the speakers and walks out prematurely even though the instructor warns him that he will be resentenced if he leaves. OK.......so what happens next? Does he go back to court? Is he sentenced to jail? Is he fined? Is he a fugitive? Better ask the 5 star reviewers, the fanatics in this website all these questions, because after watching the movie I can provide you with none.Keep in mind, I'm ignoring the emotionless and puzzling girlfriend played by Phoenix, Is she a Fascist? What are her politics? Why does she like Danny? Why does she like to get physically hit by Danny? Why Danny showed no anger/emotion at Phoenix or Zane when he saw them making love, the make out scene the day after , right when Danny just threw up, what exactly makes Danny so incredibly valuable to Zane and the fascists, Zane's laughable hairpiece, etc etc etc. Point is, I was willing to accept ALL that as being "minor", however I cannot accept the HUGE holes in the script. Basic points like why he's a Jewish Nazi, what turned this violent person around so dramatically, and the missing and unexplained characters/events throughout the film.Sorry for the long review, but I was truly disappointed with this film. Expected much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Self-Hating Jews Head Left, not Right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an Orthodox Jew, I found this movie disturbing, but not in the way one might think. They made a movie about a Jewish Nazi that ended up being politically correct!The main theme of this film is how an Orthodox Jewish boy evolves into a neo-Nazi because he doesn't buy into the religion's dogma. I am here to tell you that, while it makes for a man-bites-dog story, it simply cannot happen. Yes, there are self-hating Jews, but they evolving from the fringes, not from the core, and they move left not right. Self- haters like Noam Chomsky and Norman Finkelstein were brought up as Jews in name only, and became stalwarts of the liberal left. The right, with the exception of a few dozen neo-Nazis, support Israel and Jews; it is the liberal left that constantly finds fault with Israel. It is the liberal left J Street that flashes their Judaism while opposing Jewish causes. In real life, Danny would vent his anti-semitism through membership in J Street, not by finding the nearest KKK office.It was also disturbing how the Jewish director depicted the Jewish community and especially the synagogue at the end. Male and female Orthodox Jews never sit together in synagogue, ever. They would never, ever let a complete stranger lead the most sacred prayer of the Yom Kippur service. Yes, most sects are half-assed, but the Orthodox are not, and I resent being portrayed as such.Finally, the movie makes it seem as if bands of skinheads run wild while authorities are powerless to stop them. If skinheads went near a kosher restaurant, they would be jumped by every Jew in the neighborhood. On the rare occasion that someone plants a bomb or takes a shot at a synagogue, the full power of the local police, state police, FBI, etc. descends with such fury that the attacker is quickly apprehended and harshly sentenced. Damage a torah and find the IDF at your door. Finally, it is now fairly clear to everyone that if Jews are hated, it's because we are high, not low. Most is based on jealousy, not deicide.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great premise, poor execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd heard about this film when it won the Sundance prize, and immediately thought, given the accolade and the premise, that it had to be great. I also assumed it would be ultra-disturbing, so being somewhat squeamish, I waited a long time to actually see it.What a disappointment.The idea that a religious Jew could become a Nazi is indeed compelling, but this film never lets the viewer in on the WHY behind the main character (Balint's) decision, so, to continue watching, you just have to take it on faith that for some reason he has his reasons for inspiring a group of fascists to begin executing Jews. This, maybe I could have lived with.But when this anti-Semitic Jew brings his thuggish skinhead buddies into a temple and has misgivings, here is where the lack of character development really becomes a problem. I could live with the assumption that for some reason this Jew's a Nazi, but, without any insight into the character, this business of his conflict, a seeming revelation of complexity, is just plain confusing.Then, it commits the sin so many independent films do...by believing its overlong dialogue and speech scenes are compelling enough to drive a story forward. But this is minor in comparison to the nonsensical protagonist and the un-paid-off story lines: Balint shoots a fellow Nazi, Drake, when Drake discovers that Balint is wearing a prayer shawl under his skinhead clothes (again -- WHY???) I assumed he killed Drake, but, he doesn't...shouldn't there be some resolution to this turn of events, perhaps some jeopardy for Balint? For example -- your fellow Nazis find out you shot one of their own...shouldn't there be some sense that maybe Balint's life is now in jeopardy? Also, the leaders (played by Theresa Russell and Billy Zane) find out off-screen that Balint is a Jew. Shouldn't this also be a moment of high tension? This is a great, intriguing premise, but, the film is an extreme disappointment. I expected at some point that everything would tie together in a way that formed a cohesive, powerful, compelling, morally ambiguous narrative, but it doesn't. It's extremely unsatisfying throughout, and I really believe that its status and acclaim come from the premise alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Danny Balint (Ryan Gosling) is angry. He questions his Jewish heritage and challenges his faith. The movie starts with him bullying a Jewish boy on the subway in New York. He joins a small group of fascists led by Curtis Zampf (Billy Zane) and Lina Moebius (Theresa Russell). Danny pushes for the group to start killing Jews. Carla Moebius (Summer Phoenix) finds him fascinating. Curtis doesn't want to go down that road again while Lina finds it appealing for their cause even if she doesn't believe in it. Reporter Guy Danielsen is writing about the right wing movement. Danny joins up with others as his star rises in the movement.This is a character study of anger and self-hatred. Ryan Gosling is brilliantly unbalanced as he challenges religious authority. He's also superficially very convincing in his insane rants. More than anything, he's very charismatic. It is a bone chilling performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Did you ever go to a restaurant and order the biggest, juiciest hamburger on the menu and when they finally served it, it looked so big and delicious you just didn't know how to handle it? That's exactly how I felt the first ten minutes into The Believer. For years I had been hesitant to watch it because I didn't think it sounded plausible and my 14 year old macho aversion to "artsy crap" wouldn't allow it. But as I got older and a little more appreciative of the independent scene I became more open to "artsy crap." So it finally was on Thursday of this week I sat down to watch the Believer and I was blown away.The movie tells the story of a young Jewish man named Danny Balint who suffers a crisis of identity because not only is he a Jew he is also a Nazi. At first it seems like a bad joke, but that is the point it makes you ask "why?" Why on earth would a Jew hate his people and himself so much as to become a Nazi? This is the hook of the movie; you want to know Danny and what's going through his head. As the movie shows us, there are no clean and easy answers to these questions.Danny is a tortured man, bright and articulate yet confused. He is torn between his faith and the utter helplessness in the Jewish conception of God. This struggle between helplessness and self sufficiency leads him to find empowerment in Neo Nazism. Throughout the movie we watch Danny as he engages in contradictory actions, such as an attempted bombing of a Synagogue and a reading from the Torah, and argues amongst himself and others over what it really means to be a Jew.Ryan Gosling gives a perfect performance as Danny. He manages to embody the character's internal struggle without making it seem silly or simplified. His performance gives the role the complexity it deserves.Carla Moebius gives a startling performance as the daughter of a Fascist and the girlfriend of Danny. The horrible secret that is revealed about her halfway through the movie is tragic simply because of the look of shame she gives Daniel as he watches her have sex. The dynamic between the pleasurable act of sex and the look on her face sent chills down my spine.The ending is both satisfying and ambiguous, leaving you to discuss it with your friends at length. It's also deep in symbolism and invites multiple interpretations. It demands to be watched more than once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In a word superb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are looking for a movie to challenge you intellectually and spiritually - this is it. Ryan Gosling is outstanding in the role of Danny - a Jewish man who challenged Jewish doctrine from an early age - who later turns to the American Nazi movement to find an outlet for his beliefs. But this is a multi-layered film with multiple messages. While he brilliantly espouses the Nazi mythology about Jews (check out the dialogue/rant in the restaurant with the reporter) he is torn by the (what he believes to be) need for the Jewish people to be victimized. (way too deep for me)This movie motivates you to learn more about Jewry and the religion (much like Danny's anti- semitic girl friend). Especially the Jewish belief in "nothingness." A quick Google search on the subject was not very helpful.But since this is a movie review, this movie is superb. I rarely give movies a "9" but this one deserves it. While we are repelled by Ryan Gosling - his beliefs, speech, attitudes AND actions, we are fascinated by the conflict in him which is just below the surface. The flashbacks to his childhood as a student of the Torah are enlightening - and the memories of the holocaust survivors plays on his mind - and shapes his actions. The connection to the past as Nazi atrocities (one in particular) play on Danny, until the dramatic climax in the closing scene.While not necessarily resolving anything, the closing scene is perfect - for the movie and for our thoughts. I highly recommend this movie - hang in there past the disgusting Nazi stuff - it is worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deeply disturbing and thought provoking.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a character study (inspired by a real life case) of a young, violent, amazingly articulate neo-Nazi who wants to kill Jews, only to turn out to be Jewish himself. The film is frustratingly, but honestly, without answers. There are only questions. It doesn't try to explain away his psychology (or psychosis), but only offers tantalizing hints. That drove some people crazy, and won the admiration of others. I fall into that second camp. While the film never explained Daniel to me, I was riveted by his character ? Ryan Gosling gives an amazing performance ? and "felt" moments of understanding, rather than thinking them. It's really a film about self-loathing, in a universe without hope ? something anyone has experienced moments of. There are some awkward moments, and a couple of the supporting performances aren't great, but overall this is the kind of challenging disturbing film I we saw more of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am amazed by the number of people who considered the movie obscure and could not understand Daniel Balint's motivation. The meaning is kristal clear to any Jew who grew up in the 1930's and could not have been more explicit. Daniel was angry at the Jews for allowing themselves to be slaughtered, ignominiously, without putting up a fight. He was also angry at God. It was worse than feeling that God allowed the Jews to be slaughtered. Daniel felt that God mandated the slaughter of the Jews -- simply as an arrogant display of His power. How could it have been made plainer. It was discussed in the conversation (mandated by the judge) with the survivors. The movie starts with Danny giving his angry interpretation of the story of Abraham and Isaac. We see it in his fantasy about the Jewish father who attacked the Nazi who had bayonetted his three year old son. I wish I understood how so many sophisticated movie goers could have missed this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Depth and very Thought provoking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie opens with a quote, "I love and Hate, but I don't know why" or something along those lines. I don't know if you have ever had an ex-girlfriend or anything like that. But I do know that people who have had bad break-ups, claim to hate the person that they broke up with even though they really love the person. The love is very strong, yet they can no longer be with the person that they love which leads to feelings of hatred that are actually sourced in love.This movie really played on Danny's relationship with God in a similar way, and this is just one of the ideas that "The Believer" provoked. In the movie Danny, as a child, "dumps" HaShem (literally "the name"--the Jewish God) right in the middle of the classroom. While he hates God on the one hand, on the other hand he loves God and desires to think about Judiasm and Torah all the time. Thus he becomes a Nazi. He can obsess over God and Judiasm, yet still claim to hate them both. This is an extreme version of a dynamic which is at play amongst many Jews and non-Jews today. They spite religion, hate practitioners, and despise God. The movie really outlines this idea well, and it really answers how one can come to love God without this hatred. One must lose his ego and submit to God and his faith based Law. Because of the protagonist's hatred for God and Torah he believes in the anti-thesis of the Jewish God and Torah--that is Nazism. Yet in order for him to hate God, the Jews and Torah, he must first love it and assert its truth. You can't hate something you don't even believe in. Thus it is absurd to call Danny an atheist in any sense. His hatred presupposes a strong belief and a strong love. When he sees the Torah being desecrated he realized this dynamic, this love-hate relationship between God and himself. His obsession with Jews, God, and Torah was his love not his hatred, but yet he could not lower his own ego enough to say that he loves it. He could not submit God and the Torah. This happens to many Jewish people as well as non-Jewish people today. I hope that by making this dynamic explicit, people will read this article and realize that this dynamic is at play in themselves, and it will help them submit in love, rather than fight in hatred. That is why this movie is so good, it makes clear something so difficult to explicate. In order to get a lot from watching this movie one must really think about the psychological and theological dynamics that are at play. It is really very accurate and very thought provoking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Struggle for the Self (Spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Believer is a powerful and thought-provoking examination into a character that has come to hate himself because of his personal beliefs. The character of Danny Ballint is one of the most complex characters I have ever encountered in film because he is capable of understanding the moral implications of his hatred and yet utterly incapable of stopping his hatred from destroying himself. Ballint is depicted throughout the film as an intellectual who has strayed from his faith; there are numerous scenes depicting Ballint's ability to engage in philosophical debate with his elders which demonstrates his selfish insistence on logic over faith. For instance, the memory he replays about his conversation with the Rabbi about Abraham demonstrates Ballint's desire to impose a literal interpretation upon the Torah; Ballint believes that Isaac would have died anyway knowing that his father would have killed him. Ballint's interpretation of this event as symbolic of God's power over humankind rather than in Abraham's faith in God demonstrates Ballint's inability to read with his heart and not merely with his mind. It is an inherent problem within western religious tradition that faith and reason do not mix, that we are always insisting the literal truth of our religious texts over the symbolic representation of a lesson to learn. Ballint wants the text to be absolutely true so that he can be one of the `chosen people,' and when his attempts to bring the Torah to life fail he becomes the persecutor of his own belief in Judaism. Because of this, Ballint exists in a world of tragically divergent contradictions, a world in which he dares God to show himself and then becomes angry when God doesn't.Ballint chooses to live in a visceral world, one in which he needs physical interaction in order to feel alive. The opening scene of the film where Ballint attacks the Jewish man from the bus demonstrates his desires for physical reality and his self-loathing for not being able to accept faith over reason. Ballint taunts the man and begs to for the man to hit him in order to provoke God to show himself; he wants to know for a fact that God is powerful. Ballint makes it clear that he is looking for the being out of nothingness, and ultimately he embodies the existential musings that gripped much of Judaism after the Holocaust. There are no easy answers for Danny Ballint, and because he can never reconcile faith over reason he becomes trapped in his own solipsistic logic. For instance, Ballint talks about killing Jews throughout the film, but he never carries through with his threats until the end when he kills himself. His earlier two attempts to kill people end in failure, symbolizing his impotence and his inability to take another person's life. And although some may want to read his final act as a form of redemption, in reality Ballint becomes the ultimate nazi when he kills the Jew in himself. His hatred is never about the community or the people; it is a hatred of his own knowledge that God does not do for us what we do not do for ourselves. The ending of the film is the ultimate symbol of a man trapped within his own hatred. As he desperately runs up the stairs Ballint is faced with the truth of his own words: there is nothing left for him. In all, The Believer is one of the most powerful films I have ever seen because it depicts the struggle to find faith in the face of logic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though Ryan Gosling got into the Oscar sweepstakes for Half Nelson this year, I think the part he played in The Believer might be his career role at least so far.Based on a true story from the seventies, Gosling plays a member of the American Nazi Party who was in fact Jewish. It's the ultimate in self hate and not as uncommon as one would think.In my life I've known at least one Jewish individual who converted from Judaism to the Russian Orthodox church, knowing full well the past involvement of that church with pogroms. I know a couple of openly gay men who are members of the New York State Conservative Party who wants to see a rollback of gay rights laws around the nation. The wellsprings of self hate run deep in a lot of people.The Believer offers an explanation. Gosling is a bright man who just won't identify with Jews as a victim, as perpetual victims. It goes against his grain so much that he'd rather identify with the oppressors than with martyrs. In the end Gosling can't live with himself. Him I understand, the people that I know are beyond me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen quite a few documentaries on white power groups; as even this film says, know your enemies. They are made up of a couple of natural leaders and an army of skinheads who want nothing more than to drink beer, thrash to hate metal bands, and look scary. Few of them came their hate naturally; the charismatic leaders find teens who feel disenfranchised by life and tell them that it's the fault of blacks, of Hispanics, of Jews. The lonely kids, hungering for a sense of family, seize on this and begin to truly believe it, and another skinhead is born.`The Believer' opens with Ryan Gosling (who also shone in the tepid `Murder by Numbers', filmed after this but released first) and his gang showing up at a small white power meeting in a nice house hosted by Theresa Russell and a wigged Billy Zane. Zane and Russell want to get their point across by getting candidates into office and corrupting from within; Gosling just wants to kill a Jewish person. He even knows which one, a powerful banker. His idea is discounted, but his charisma and knowledge aren't. No one knows his real reason for wanting to kill this man; that he too is Jewish.This movie, with it's many speeches and explorations of the Jewish religion, could have been awful; offensive, boring, and absurd. But Gosling is portrayed as smart and conflicted rather than a megalomaniac or a goon. As a child, he sat through Jewish study classes and then brought up points for debate that he didn't feel comfortable with. But rather than taking the time to answer the boy's questions, the teacher kicks him out of class. This fosters resentment towards the faith, which eventually turns to rage and hate.But Gosling still loves the faith; he simply hates those who practice it. He grows angry when members of his gang curse in front of an unrolled Torah scroll. He snaps at his girlfriend when she parades naked in front of it. He has cut himself off from all of his old friends, the Jewish ones, and he no longer sees them as people. They are just the enemy.The white power group lets him become a public speaker for them, turning aside his dreams of murder. But, with his gang beside him, he taunts and attacks Jews, slowly working up towards his first murder with the help of a silent sniper. All around him, people are puzzled; he walks the walk of hatred, but he doesn't quite talk the talk. Their suspicions grow as Gosling's girlfriend thinks about converting to Judaism and he runs into his old childhood friends. The film builds quietly and effectively to a natural, powerful climax.Gosling is powerful as the character. The rest of the cast is solid but never noteworthy; whether they were simply overshadowed by Gosling or told to underplay cannot be known. But this is Gosling's show, and the young actor brings pitch-perfect shades and textures to the role. Those who oppose films like this dislike it when they humanize this sort of character and make us see him as a person rather than as a symbol of hate. In `American History X', as good as it was, Edward Norton's character was either a cartoon of a scary, homicidal skinhead or a repentant young man; both sides were not allowed to exist at the same time. `The Believer' bravely allows conflict in a person who hates; it makes his dilemma both understandable and confounding. And with Gosling, they have found the perfect actor to express these feelings realistically, without caricature.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This stirred up a lot of controversy when it was released . Up and coming pretty boy actor plays violent neo-Nazi in no holds barred indie film examining racial hatred and what sets THE BELIEVER apart from its peers is that it's 1 ) Based on a true story 2 ) The violent protagonist is from an orthodox Jewish background himself Now that the controversy has died to such an extent you're left thinking if there was any controversy at all then what we're left with is a movie that is confused and totally underdeveloped . So much so that I have no hesitation that this is a fairly dreadful movie regardless of its content Early on we're shown via flashback the protagonist Danny Balint struggle to believe that the Abrahamic God he is taught about at school is a benevolent loving God and the audience are left thinking he's no different from the likes of Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens in that God is the cruellist , most sadistic character in fiction . Effectively Danny's rage doesn't come from his views on race but from religion . In fact the film ends with a character telling him " Don't go up there. There's nothing there " which can be interpreted as going to heaven . But the way rest of the film has been badly developed this is surely coincidence rather than subtext Things happen in the film that are never followed up on and remain unexplained . Danny gets together with like minded violent Nazi types , or should that be stereotypes ? They're portrayed in such a one dimensional manner you're almost expecting them to burst in to Springtime For Hitler . They decide to bomb a Synagog but not before Danny tells them to leave the Judiac scripture alone . Luckily the bomb doesn't go off and one wonders if Danny had something to do with this , but this is never followed up . Likewise a sniper attack where Danny misses his target and one of Danny's colleague is wounded comes to nothing . Throughout the movie you're expecting Nazi characters we were introduced to earlier in the film to re-appear and add something to the plot but people appear then disappear from the narrative without explanation or follow through This is a painfully ill thought out film that leaves the audience thinking what the point of the film is . It does touch upon the suggestion that some of the hierarchy of Nazi Germany were of distant Jewish descent themselves hence a bitter irony but like everything else in the movie you never believe this is what the film is trying to tell us. It's confused storytelling at its very worst BTW the selling point that it's based on a " true life character " , namely Daniel Burros is merely artistic license . It's " a true story " in much the same way Michael Bay's PEARL HARBOR is a true story . In other words it's a cynical marketing excersise . In the words of Public Enemy don't believe the hype</fullReview>

There are not special effects or such which puts more meaning on the roles of the cast to carry the film and keep the viewers interest which it most certainly does. If you are looking for a romantic, dreamy film because you have seen Ryan Gosling in films such as The Notebook then this is not the movie for you.

		<shortDescription>A Jewish neo-Nazi conflicted between his respect for the Torah and his vendetta against his people.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently came across The Believer (directed and written by Henry Bean) starring Hollywood heartthrob Ryan Gosling in one of those tortured roles that fit him perfectly. Ryan is Danny Balint, a former yeshiva student that turned into a neo-Nazi. Directly based on the true story of Daniel Burros, this psychological struggle mastered by the intense performance of Ryan Gosling will pin you to your seat. Henry Bean managed to capture the raw emotions of his main character authentically played by Gosling. There is definitely more than abs to the former Disney child star. I was struck by Gosling's performance as a clever but psychologically-troubled mind. His intensity is captivating and the tension he builds within himself is somewhat close to insanity. In The Believer, I witnessed the brutality of Danny's words and actions but I couldn't help but feel bad for the poor guy and the deep struggle he has to face. At first, I obviously hated the character for being such an inhuman monster but when I discovered his demons and his love/hate relationship with his own God and religion, I had trouble being that resolute about his fate. The monologues made me clench my jaw and the constant violence of his deranged self challenged me as a passive viewer. This movie treats a topic not necessarily well-known by everyone: self-hatred in the Jewish community. If you think of starting a collection of neo-Nazism-related movies: The Believer is the one to put right next to the brilliant but different American History X.1 reason to watch: The mesmerizing performance of Gosling on the intense paradox that is self-hatred in the Jewish community of contemporary New York City.Read it here: http://squeerelist.blogspot.com/2013/04/the-believer- 2001.html</fullReview>

The movie raises a lot of questions but answers little of them, in particular regarding the reasons that pushed him to develop such a hate.The script has almost no twists or turning points, and the dialogues are ultra verbose, which leads to an overall linearity and very slow paced rhythm.The direction and editing aren't much of a help either. The flashbacks fit badly with the story, but more importantly Henry Bean used tacky, ridiculous visual effects throughout the movie such as weird slow motions.In the end, the only satisfaction of this film is Ryan Gosling whose acting abilities are already noticeable even with his little experience at the time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Believer is a drama that stars Ryan Gosling as Daniel Balint, an Orthodox Jew who becomes a Neo-Nazi. Billy Zane,Theresa Russell and Summer Phoenix co-stars.The film is loosely based on the true story of Daniel Burros, a member of the American Nazi Party and the New York branch of the United Klans of America who committed suicide after being exposed by a New York Times reporter to be Jewish.It was written by Mark Jacobson and Henry Bean,also the film's director.Danny Balint is a member of a gang of racist skinheads that espouses a vile but well-articulated philosophy of anti-Semitism. He also has a secret: he is a Jew and was a top student in Hebrew school before he began to ask too many questions about the deeper implications of the teachings in the Torah and the Old Testament.Then he got expelled. Angry and confused, he began to explore the philosophies of the neo-Nazi movement, which he soon came to embrace through a mixture of anger over the tragic history of the Jewish people, bitterness over his experiences in Hebrew school, and a loathing of himself. He soon becomes a key member of a skinhead sect led by Curtis and Lina but while they believe that the desire for cultural assimilation by many American Jews will lead to their self-destruction, Danny advocates a more direct and violent approach in dealing with the "enemy".As Danny gains the admiration of his fellow skinheads for his intelligence and commitment, he wins the affection of Carlaand a group member with severe masochistic tendencies. But in time Danny's beliefs begin to shift once again, just as the truth about his background becomes known to his comrades.The Believer is a reminder of the power of film to move us and to make us examine our values.It is also one of the most thought-provoking and hard-hitting films ever released.Also,its underlying premise is simple and understandable to any one of us who have grown indifferent to many of the teachings we accepted with such naivet, such open hopeful hearts throughout our early education.Finally,what really makes it effective is Ryan Gosling,who commands the screen with a raw, electrifying performance for he is a powerful actor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gosling - Brilliant; Film - So So</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 2001 film "The Believer" is worth seeing for Ryan Gosling's riveting performance as Daniel Balint, a violent, mentally disturbed American, Jewish, neo-Nazi. Unfortunately, the rest of the film is not anywhere as good as Gosling's central performance. Gosling is on screen throughout most of the film, though. I rarely watch movies at home in one sitting and I sat through this entire film, almost afraid to look away, Gosling was so intimidating and fascinating. "The Believer" was inspired by Daniel Burros, (1937-1965) a Jewish man who became Grand Dragon of the NY Ku Klux Klan. After the New York Times revealed Burros' ancestry, he killed himself. "The Believer" opens with Balint menacing a wimpy Jewish student on the New York City subway. The Jewish student cringes, cowers, and attempts to scurry away. Balint menaces him before he gets into the subway car, on the subway car itself, and on the street outside the subway, where he finally pounces, beating the student into a bloody, broken mess. It's a horrible scene to watch. The soundtrack expertly wrings the scene for all the tension and terror it is worth. As brilliantly manipulative as this scene is, there's a problem with it. As much as you hate what you are seeing, you end up identifying with Balint. The Jewish student is weak and cowardly and refuses to defend himself. Balint at least has the integrity to act on his vile ideals. Even if you didn't know that Gosling is playing a self-hating Jewish character, you would be able to read that from his facial expressions. He sneers as if smelling something foul. He begs the student to defend himself. You know that he is beating the student because he hates the despised potential Jewish victim inside himself. That theme ? the theme of Jewish self-hatred as a reaction to the Holocaust ? is one of the movie's big ideas, and it is not a worthy one. After committing one of many hate crimes, Balint is forced to undergo sensitivity training. He is lectured by three elderly Jewish Holocaust survivors. One describes the Nazis bayonetting his son, peeling the corpse of the son off the bayonet, and dropping the corpse on the ground at the man's feet. Balint turns the table and lectures these survivors. Why didn't you fight? He asks. At least then you would have had your dignity. You were going to die anyway. The film allows that question to go unanswered, and that is not right. Jews *did* fight. Jews fought in the Polish Army when the Nazis first invaded Poland, and in the Anders Army at famous battlegrounds like Monte Cassino. Jews fought in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, the first urban, civilian uprising in Nazi-occupied Europe. Jews fought in the forests with the Bielski Brothers. Jews fought in the Treblinka concentration camp uprising. Jews fought in non-martial ways, as well. There were poetry readings in the Warsaw Ghetto, and Sabbath commemorations in concentration camps. To remember your own culture in the face of death is also a revolt against death. It isn't the responsibility of "The Believer" to provide viewers with this detailed history lesson, but it lessens the value of the film to allow Daniel Balint, a Jewish neo-Nazi, to go unrefuted. Other than Gosling's performance, there isn't much to recommend the film. There are shadowy scenes of fascist plotters meeting in New York City apartments, strategizing ways to take over America. Billy Zane is pretty much wasted in his few scenes as a fascist theorist. Summer Phoenix, River's little sister, has a gratuitous, exploitative, topless scene. She plays the part of a depressive, masochistic fascist sex toy. Through Balint, she becomes obsessed with Judaism, and begins to practice, lighting Sabbath candles and attending synagogue services. This is the movie's second big idea: if you look at it through the right kaleidoscope, being a member of a Jewish community is in some ways comparable to being a member of a hate group like the Nazis. This is just simple-minded, undercooked, grandiose thinking, and this is why, outside of Gosling's performance, I can't recommend this film. There is some incoherent, implausible plotting: fascists meet in the woods and beat each other up; there is a bungled assassination attempt; there are a couple of synagogue bombings. None of this goes anywhere. There's another problem with this film. It is very much in the cinematic tradition of Sexy Nazis like "Inglorious Bastard's" Colonel Hans Landa, "Black Book's" Ludwig Muntze, Oskar Werner, Maximilian Schell, and too many others to mention . Ryan Gosling is a very attractive man and in this film he is shown shirtless, lifting weights, and masterfully beating other men. In real life, Daniel Burros was not so omnipotent, not so sexy. In fact, journalist William Bryk said of Burros that he "was an inept paratrooper: overweight, poorly coordinated and slow. He wore thick-lensed glasses that made his eyes look larger than they were. The other guys in the barracks laughed at him. He had no friends. Finally, he made three phony suicide attempts: a few shallow razor cuts on the wrist; an overdose of aspirin; and again the razor ? The Army discharged him 'by reasons of unsuitability, character, and behavior disorder.'"In short, Burros was mentally ill, as is Daniel Balint in this film. Given that the film is about a man who is not processing reality accurately, it is unfortunate that the film provides no coherent counter voice to the flawed conclusions Balint lives by.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating portrait</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aggressive and highly-intellectual skinhead Danny (Ryan Gosling) enjoys spending his time getting into trouble and beating up the local Jewish population, whilst proudly displaying his swastika-branded t-shirt. Only Danny has a secret, one that if revealed to his gang of like-minded hoodlums would land him in hot water and would probably lead to his murder - he was born and raised a Jew. Falling in with respected racist and anti-Semite Curtis Zampf (Billy Zane), he is forced to put his violent behaviour behind him in order to spread the hate in an intellectual way. As his hatred for the Jewish community increases, so does his guilt, and so begins a long and confused path for Danny.I'd heard great things about this film, but I found myself disappointed as the opening scene played out in front of me, which sees Danny frighten a young Jew on a train before violently attacking him in the street. I thought this was going to be another Romper Stomper and American History X inspired neo-Nazi film that would offer nothing new. Yet as the film went on, and Ryan Gosling shows why he is probably the most talented young actor working in film today, I was completely engrossed. Danny's character is so fascinating and conflicted that he drives the entire film. There are no clichs here. One of the key scenes in the film is when Danny sits down with a journalist to talk about the Jewish problem. He is asked why he hates the Jews. Danny comes up with an unconvincing argument about the ways Jews like to have sex. He simply does not know why. And when he is confronted by the same journalist about if he himself is a Jew, Danny holds a gun to the journalists head and threatens that if he were to print that information, he will kill himself. Danny has more hatred for himself than for anything else. Fascinating stuff.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

The story it pretty incredible as well. Plus it it a thinker. Left me a bit stumped in the end, but I watched it again and was just as entertained. There is some harsh stuff here. Not for the faint of heart or gut, but for me it was brilliant. One I am going to add to my collection. Nice work by everyone involved.

		<shortDescription>I shared a similar mindset about "God" that Gosling's character did.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the title of this review says, I now have really noticed how much me and the character Danny Balint had in common about "God." I was raised a Roman Catholic Christian. However, it wasn't until I learned of the fanatical born-again Christian movement that pretty much consumed me at a time of my life when I was vulnerable and weak to the whole notion of depending on "God" as my only hope and happiness. Then I learned from the born-again perspective about a "God" that they said was all loving, yet, if you didn't believe this, this, and this, you were going to the lake of fire, also known as hell. Me being very hard on myself and negative already, thought of myself going to hell, because I couldn't seem to believe what they said as true Christianity or feel that "saved" experience. It really frustrated me and I developed an anger against "God" and Jesus. It made me feel so intense at how a "God" could just damn people who thought differently, especially the "if you don't believe this, this and this you will burn" thought process. However, times have changed, and I now realize that these born-again Christian people for the most part, are dysfunctional people who need to believe this fantasy. They are weak, insecure, ignorant and can't think for themselves. Many had serious problems already for them needing to be "born-again." Now of course this doesn't apply to all born-again Christians, some are less fanatical than others and don't have or to a lesser degree of ignorance and non-realistic views. But it applies to a lot of them. I didn't join an anti-Christian group and attack Christians but I felt the anger and rage that Danny felt. I was going back and forth on my beliefs. One minute i'm a bible believer, the next i'm not a bible believer, I loved "God" and next I hated "God", first I was against catholics (as Born agains are and vica versa) next I was with catholics against born agains...I had a messed up psychological concept of having double and contradicting beliefs, I didn't know who I was and wanted to be what others were. I see Danny Balint and I know what he went through because I feel I went through a similar thought process. All though I still have a loyalty to Roman Catholicism as a heritage feeling and I do feel if any "church" has a right to be called "The Church" it is the Roman Catholic Church due to historical facts. I consider myself an agnostic, because to be honest with you, I REALLY DON'T KNOW and as my life gets more interesting, I really don't care. I think Ryan Gosling is a little overrated, a little stiff. But, he did a decent job here. People can believe what they want, if it makes them a better person than that is all that matters. It is when they impose their beliefs - and that is all they are...beliefs - on others that it becomes ignorant and wrong. And it isn't only the ridiculous born-again cult-like movement that has grown over the years, the same goes for Roman Catholicism, other Protestant sects, Judaism, Islam and other religions. They all to me have ignorant and wrong belief systems that make me shake my head, lol. But, back to the movie, I can relate big time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I heard about this film on the festival circuit but did not see it until this fall, after evacuating from Louisiana due to Hurricane Katrina. Suddenly I had lots of time to catch up on films, and was lucky to find this gem in a tiny drug/video store in southern Indiana. Someone here commented that they can't say enough about Ryan Gosling's performance in this film. I cannot agree more. Good lord, this guy's talented. From the second he appears on screen, you can't take your eyes off this Canadian. From the eyebrow twitches to the jerky shrugs to the choking and panting of his rants, every nuance of his physicality pulls you further into the character's mind. Simply outstanding. I have since been hunting down Gosling's other films, and saw The Notebook two weeks ago... and again tonight. I understand he got into woodworking to prepare for the role and even made a table featured in the film. Hang on... sexy, outspoken AND multi-talented? How much can a poor girl take? The 'industry' has obviously taken note; he's in pre-prod for three films as of this writing. So a very happy 25th birthday to you, Ryan. I'll be watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Race, Religion, and Ideology</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possibly flying over the heads of the status quo, The Believer is a stunning film that challenges audiences to examine their definitions of religious faith, racial prejudice, and the contempt of modern society for all forms of institutional ideologies of hate and intolerance. Ryan Gosling brilliantly portrays the troubled Danny, a skin head youth whose hatred for Jews manifests in bullying and intellectual jousting with moronic lesser grunts. At first, Danny seems the quintessence of neo-Nazism as he espouses rhetoric and baits his family with his nihilistic actions. It is revealed early in the film that Danny is in fact a Jew and has jousted with the intellectual points of spiritual faith and belief systems since a young boy. His questions angered his teachers resulting in Danny's antagonism towards both Judaism as a religion, and Jews as followers of the belief system which he was expected to embrace.Gosling is staggering as the pawn of both religious and political manipulators who seize on his intellectual skills of debate to further their own agendas, but his true inner struggle is with himself. In attempting to deny the source of his identity as a Jew, Danny strikes out through his anti-Semetic acts that torment and confuse him all the more. His hatred is self-hatred, and for all his verbal acumen, he is unable or unwilling to turn from the religious practices and rituals that he hides under a swastika t-shirt and Nazi salutes while reciting in Yiddish from the Torah.Unlike other films such as American X, the Believer approaches the topic with much more intellectual examination of issues of racism and anti-Semetic American culture today. Based on the true story of a Jew who joined the KKK in the 60s and was outed by the NY Times, The Believer poses serious questions to challenge audiences about the insidious nature of racism, bigotry, and fascism that permeate American society today. It is a tour de force performance for Gosling, and worthy of multiple discussions for courses in religious studies, American studies, and humanities at the university level.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film struck home for me on many levels. As the son of a Jewish mother and a Catholic father, I watched this film with rapt interest as it unfolded, and the faiths of Danny merge, overlap, and are torn. We see him as a young man in flashbacks constantly in the film, fighting the illogical tenants of his lineage, being drawn toward either believing blindly in the face of logic, or asserting a path of rejection and hate far easier. In a few brief scenes with his father, we see how the seeds of this discontent are sowed, a shut-in who is sick and bitter.The love interest in this film is rather subdued, but serves as the catalyst for his ideals to finally square off at each other.The dialog in the film is very well written, and thought provoking. It provides subtle and no so subtle metaphor for Jewish and Christian values all through the film, from adultery, violence, as well as many direct biblical references.The use of different point of view flashbacks to the same scenes to show how he is feeling as the struggle unfolds is a masterful bit of cinematography, and provides a direct visual impression of his struggle rather then seeking it through dialog.It's movies like this that keep me coming to off the beaten path video stores and outlets, I would never have had a chance to see such a masterpiece elsewhere.</fullReview>

A young Jewish boy, beyond his peers and teacher, finds himself deeper into the Tora (Torra?) than they, and almost all others combined, failed to escape.Daniel gets it, kind of an antithesis of Seinfield. Both engage a form of faith that fails to connect all dots. It's entertaining, though it shouldn't. Both engage in, "a whole lot of nothing about nothing". Who would have thought that anyone could put it into a comedy and drama at the same time?Daniel has a soft spot. See if you can pick it up. When the old guy in the support group spoke of murder of his 3 year old son, Daniel moved to quickly to assess both sides.This movie is a 9.3.1418!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>disturbing positively, not positively disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though based loosely on a kernel of truth, the unbelievable notion that a young Jewish man could make his way into a den of neo-nazi's I think is dispatched by the sheer moxie of Ryan Gosling's performance. Or should I say chutzpah?As a result, we are able to focus more on WHY his character would do so, rather than how he could. While few viewers can connect with the degree of self-loathing Gosling displays, more can likely relate to his difficulties in rationality ensnaring religion. Still his argument, built upon some sophistry, as well as exploiting idiocy in scriptures strictures, is at times engaging. Additionally, his railing against abstraction compelled while it confounded (on its inherently abstract level)Overall, it made Judaism more appealing to this devout agnostic! The scene regarding sensitivity training showed doubt amongst elders in a faith. To me doubt is a critical aspect of life, and to allow it where normally dogma would insulate against even weaker wondering was impressive. This is also seen when Gosling reconnects with his synagogue.I should say, I had rented this via NetFlix, and kept it for nearly two weeks while sort of dreading it for fear that it would be too assaultive. But while I was uneasily queasy at times, much of the violence is implied...and though this film was disturbing, it was disturbing in a positive way.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the beginning of this film, it shows a lot of violence against Jews, and it has a very disturbing scene of trashing the synagogue. This hit me so hard, I had to leave the room and my dad, who happens to be a rabbi, had to come in and help comfort me. I could barely sleep that night. I might have been able to, if only I had watched the rest of the movie instead of turning it of right then and there. About two minutes after I stopped watching, the main character begins to lean back into Judaism, and leave his violent way of life. I was very impressed by the Hebrew used by the actors used in this movie. I would have been more impressed if he had gotten the word "ar'eka" right, but it was all around good. After I watched the end of the movie the next morning, I left with a great love of the movie and the message of never forgetting who you are, and left with a better impression than the night before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This blows "American History X" away...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brilliant, thought-provoking film with a first-rate performance by Ryan Gosling. Gosling is a star in the making, and I relate this performance to a young DeNiro who was just coming to age in "Taxi Driver."Beyond the particular religion that this film centers on (Judaism)... to me this represents how explosive and obscure man's relationship with God can be. Look what is happening all over in the modern world today -- terrorism fueled by religious ideology -- and you don't have to question why this film was so dramatic.Danny held many of the Judaic principles to be sacred, but he was disgusted at how weak and passive the Jews have been throughout time when facing oppression. (The emotional scene with the Holocaust survivors was brilliant. "Kill your enemies!")His way of dealing with the disgust he had was to rebel against his own people by rationalizing ways to hate them. To fulfill this, he turned to Nazism. And because of his logic and wit he was admired profusely by fellow Nazis -- even those who probably knew he was a Jew.But in the end, Nazism was not the answer. Hate is not the answer. We see the conflicting emotions running through his mind throughout the film, and it was done beautifully.Unlike "American History X" the brilliance of this movie is that it does not preach to you. It simply shows you how man can become so frail and so driven in the name of God and/or religion. It is truly thought-provoking and very alarming. You draw your own conclusions.It makes you think about faith. It can be a very sad world without any faith, and a very sad world when you push faith too far.I can't speak any higher of Gosling's performance. Remarkable.</fullReview>

I have to say that this was one of the most emotionally draining films I'd seen in a quite a while--the scene in which he argues with Holocaust survivors at sensitivity training was especially gut-wrenching. I was afraid that it would simply be American History X Part II, and while it did have some similar elements, the film was so effective that it stands on it's own against the fine Edward Norton film. If I can the fault the film at all, I would say that it could have better established where his anti-Semitism came from. I didn't completely believe that an argument over the story of Abraham's sacrifice of Isaac would be enough to turn someone so hateful. Nevertheless, I found the intellectual debate at the school fascinating. Great performances all around. 9/10</fullReview>

In fact, "The Believer" does not disappoint at all. The ambiguity of its message finds a mirror in its artistic form, and the complexity of the main character nicely reflects the complexity of Judaism and the Jewish experience in the modern West.What I liked best about the film was that so much of what the protagonist says about Jews is true. The protagonist's ultimate tragedy is that he saw Jewish ambiguity as a source of horror, not joy, a point underscored in the brilliant final scene.Ryan Gosling is a fine actor, and this film is written and directed with intelligence and subtlety.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A meditation on Jewish Theology</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nobody has yet commented on the theology of this film. There is the seeming arbitrariness of God's commands - from not mixing milk and meat to sacrificing your son. When Jews study torah, they do so in pairs, since theology is about argument and questioning.Danny starts off as a model Jew - not because he obeys, but because he questions, like Job. However, like many educational systems, his teacher cannot cope with his questioning. Religions need their critics on the inside, challenging the tradition, instead of leaving it to mediocrity after its best minds have gone.It's almost as if Danny still fervently believes - he still reverences the torah scrolls - and wants to shout louder so that the tradition will listen to him. He trashes the synagogue like children trash their rooms when parents don't listen. As a child he had challenged God to strike him dead; a challenge he will make at the end and, if there is no answer, he will bring about himself.The film is a meditation on the Abraham and Isaac story. The Jewish man, his son and the Nazi with the bayonet is a modern replay of it. Danny meditates, almost in Ignatian Christian terms (where someone imagines themselves into a biblical story and explores it from different angles, role-playing the different people in it.) In the story, great play is made on Abraham being made to take, 'Your son, your only son, whom you love.' Christians have seen that as a type/paradigm of Jesus - God's only son. Danny comments on the success of that self-sacrifice enabling Jesus to become God. So Danny decides to be another sacrifice in his quest for divinity - but will it work? The story ends with him being told 'There is nothing up there,' echoing the debates as to whether God is dead or never existed, a debate which has been on many Jewish (and Christian) lips since the Holocaust.</fullReview>

And yet while Danny is a Neo-Nazi and he hate the Jews and what they symbolize, according to him, he still hold dear all the things that are in itself a symbol for being a Jew. Danny is an insider, he knows Judaism well. He uses what he knows in order to undermine Jews all around him, however he is torn apart because the more he try to escape the more he find himself drawn back to the world he is trying to avoid.I found myself intrigued from Danny's twisted logic(and it is a twisted one). How the same arguments are used by both side to show them to be actually more close to each other than they could ever imagine it. At the end I was left with the conclusion that the movie main message is that no matter what you do, you can not run away from who you are or from your past. Your past is who you are and you can't avoid it.A movie like that can only succeed if the main character is believable and Ryan Gosling carry the film on his shoulders. His performance is convincing. You believe him, you are convinced by what he says that he is Danny. He manage to be emotional and argumental and you feel for what he goes through. A strong supporting cast help all through the film.This is an intriguing film. It raise questions and doesn't always give an answer and it worth seeing because it makes you think. Not a lot of film do this today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>human beings tend to like things in a binary fashion. we like to link things in pairs, mainly opposites. light and dark, hot and cold, love and hate. but to a certain extent this film tries to make it clear that in fact love and hate are not in fact opposites, but in reality are much closer then that. 'the believer' tries to draw attention to the very short step for when obsessive love can turn into hate.the plot synopsis has been covered in detail by others but whilst i can see some of the complaints from some of the other reviewers i certainly cant see others. all films to an extent rely on suspension of disbelief, of things happening that if they did so in the real world (whatever that means) would draw incredulous looks (or at the least raised eyebrows). what works for me is the sense of the inner battle that is taking place inside Danny, and indeed highlighted in the changing flashback episodes within the film.the film is not perfect (but then what film is?) but it is certainly thought provoking. danny's face when confronted with the idea of becoming the 'fund-raiser' for the new 'above-ground' fascism movement and the entire episode in which Danny and his gang are made to talk to 'real' jewish victims of the holocaust. and for me this was the best part of the film. the victims are shown in a non-unified way, arguing and squabbling amongst themselves. but two moments stand out in this sequence (this may be a SPOILER here), the first in which Danny says what i think that a lot of people now may think today. if your son (or wife or father) is being killed in front of you, then why dont you fight back, why dont you 'kill your enemy?' and secondly, and to me the key moment in the film, is when one of the jewish men tells of his son dying. tears are in Danny's eyes. one assumes that they are tears of pity of what the old man had to go through. but then the tears become one of rage and hate. why? maybe its because Danny felt sorry for someone he hated. and so the emotion which Danny does not wish to turn inward instead goes out. the tears disappear and the face hardens.maybe what this film is trying to say is that if you take a look at what it is that people hate then you can easily see what it is they fear. a very good film that in the cinema where i saw it, when the titles came up the audience did not get up and rise as one to go back to the world. instead they sat there for a few moments thinking of what they had seen and of the questions that the film had asked of them.</fullReview>

Also, as a side note, the music by joel diamond is extraordinary...original, subtle and perfect for the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is independent filmmaking at its best. "The Believer" is what Sundance should be all about: taking audiences to a new levels of understanding through film. Don't miss it. I only hope that this work finds its audience through great distribution. Ryan Gosling is no doubt one of the next great film actors. His brilliant performance will be a benchmark for all who follow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great film that sends a powerful message and I hope everyone watches it to see the effects racism has. A s a Jewish person I found telling of anti Semitic beliefs is important. Henry Bean did his best work here in my opinion and Ryan Gosling gave his best performance. It is R-rated for good reasons but I think everyone should see it as soon as they turn of age. It's another American History X but even better! I think that it works as a film and works as a human story and as a drama. The story is written well. The film comes from a great script and is great. This is me. Mathew Azaria. And my review of the believer! Have a great time watching this classic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the theme of a movie is neo-Nazis and how they treat other people, especially Jews, you can't help but comparing it to "american history X". So as the film started I began to compare the two movies, but felt that it wasn't fair and it would bias my opinion, so i stopped after 10 minutes and gave it a chance to stand on its own.It just can't.How is it that a Nazi is a Jew, but he's conflicted about it? And lets say i buy that;from the middle and forward the movie became so flat without the smallest effort to give us a peak of this confliction. After the film ended i felt i took a trip to endless nothingness!Total waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very strong film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I checked this movie out solely on a friend's recommendation, and mostly because Ryan Gosling, who had been so good in The Notebook (among other films) was the star. I have to admit frankly I was unprepared for what follows.The Believer is a thought-provoking film following the story of Daniel Balint (Gosling), an intelligent, articulate Jewish boy who grows up to be a Neo-Nazi anti-Semite. Along the way his diatribes attract the attention of a fascist organizer, Curtis Zampf (Billy Zane), and his partner Lina Moebius (Theresa Russell). Daniel begins preaching his particular brand of hate to more and more people, and he feels compelled to commit further and more disturbing acts of violence against the Jewish community; yet even as he does so, he is torn by the spirituality of his upbringing, unable to tear himself completely from his roots.It's not an easy movie to like. The Believer -- much like American X before it -- confronts the audience with uncomfortable ideas and beliefs. The movie wisely never endorses such hate, but rather examines what could drive a person -- particularly an intelligent one -- to such a stance. In doing so it takes an uncompromising stand and is not afraid to get ugly -- or to let its protagonist get dirty.Gosling is incredibly sharp as Daniel. He manages to make the character both sympathetic and hateful; we can feel the anguish he is going through as he tries to reconcile his past and heritage with the new attitudes he has adopted, vile though they are. Another filmmaker and another actor might not have been able to pull off the dichotomy, but Gosling imbues the Daniel with such intelligence and such complexity that along with being revolted by his beliefs, we are fascinated by his struggle.It's rare that I come across such challenging and thought-provoking films like this. The Believer is a hard look at what makes certain people hate, but it is also deeply rooted in Jewish beliefs and heritage. It is smart enough to examine a difficult and complicated issue in an honest light, and brave enough not to shrink away from what it finds. While it's not light entertainment, and some could find it offensive, The Believer is one of the best films I've seen all year, and certainly one of the most challenging I've seen in a long time. This film is certainly worth your time to rent.</fullReview>

There is one character in this film and one subplot that I found unnecessary and tapering the level of movie. For what is this perverted girl who likes to be hitting and loves licking puke from the mouth of her lover. This character seems to be in kind of Dorothy Valance from Lynch's "Blue Velvet" but really don't fits in "The Believer". Explaining antisemitism and nazism by the sexual perversion is rather cheap. For this reason many years ago I dismissed Visconti's "Fall of the Gods". Such sexual undertones made very good, indeed, movie a little bit closer to such exploitation craps like "Elsa She-Werewolf from SS" or "III Reich's last orgy".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Danny is a Hitler-loving, swastika-wearing Nazi skinhead who vandalizes synagogues, harasses Jewish youths on the subway, and declaims against Jews for being the ruination of the American culture. He also reveres the Torah and wears traditional Jewish garments under his clothes. Why the bizarre discrepancy? It's simple: because Danny is himself a Jew, or, as the newspaper headline in the film calls him, a `Jewish Nazi,' - truly the ultimate oxymoronic epithet of our time. This is the startling premise of `The Believer,' a controversial film by writer/director Henry Bean that features, as its protagonist, one of the most strangely conflicted characters in movie history.`The Believer' is a highly disturbing, if not altogether convincing, study of a bizarre underground movement, the Neo Nazis, the existence of which few of us even want to acknowledge, let alone spend two hours of our movie watching time studying. Undaunted by popular indifference, Bean takes us into the heart of this subculture, showing us the irrational fear and hatred that motivates these people. There are any number of cringe-inducing scenes such as a confrontation in a kosher deli between a group of racist hooligans and the proprietors of the shop and, even more terrifyingly, a scene in which these same men, sent by court order to listen to a group of holocaust survivors, ultimately end up mocking the speakers and demeaning their heartrending experiences. We are thrown off balance seeing that fellow human beings could be so callously inured to the sufferings of others - until we realize that that was the very mentality that allowed Nazism itself to flourish.It is in moments like this that `The Believer' really hits its mark. What it is somewhat less successful at doing is actually getting into the head of Danny, to help us understand just how a person could come to such a point of self-loathing that he could actually advocate the killing of his own people. Nothing we see about Danny's past seems to indicate why he would end up on as radical, illogical and inexplicable a life path as the one he has chosen. We see that he has some problems accepting the teaching he learns in his religious schooling, but is this enough to send him off the deep end in so totally warped a fashion? I appreciate the fact that `The Believer' at least tries to deal with this subject in a unique and intriguing way, but merely exploring previously uncharted territory is not necessarily enough to ensure success as a film. Luckily, `The Believer' has more to recommend it.The acting, for one. Ryan Gosling turns in a star-making performance as Danny, managing to get into the skin of this dangerously twisted, dangerously confused young man. Gosling can be utterly terrifying in those moments when he is threatening physical violence, yet almost sympathetic in the quieter times spent with his father, his girlfriend and the Torah scroll itself, which he caresses almost as he would a beautiful lover. We can see the anger and frustration building up behind his ever tightening face, just as we also perceive the thoughtful demeanor of a cerebral young man trying to come to intellectual terms with the beliefs he has chosen to accept. Summer Phoenix, Theresa Russell and Billy Zane are also excellent as some of the people who become a part of Danny's life and world.`The Believer' never really makes the case for why Danny is like he is. Yet, come to think of it, perhaps the film really SHOULDN'T make the case; perhaps it's actually a better film because it DOESN'T. After all, to turn Danny into nothing more than a clinical case study in pathological self-hatred might cheapen the material, providing penny-ante answers where none actually exist. Would it be better to come up with easy pop psychology rationalizations for his existence instead of just letting the bizarre story stand on its own with no explanation? In many ways, though this approach makes the film less digestible and palatable, it may make it more real and pointed. For instance, what are we to make of the fact that Danny is obviously terrified of being uncovered as a Jew, yet he seems to go out of his way with many of his actions to cast suspicion on himself? Is he, like many an arsonist or serial killer, actually TRYING to be caught, leaving all sorts of clues behind so that someone will find him out and be able to put an end to his unresolvable internal conflict for him? Is it all merely an inarticulate, rage-filled cry for help? By leaving such questions unanswered, the film ends up intriguing us all the more.Thus, `The Believer' provides a unique movie watching experience that is sometimes enlightening, sometimes maddening, yet always strangely compelling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you don't want to know anything about this film, stop reading now, although I'll try not to give away any more than most reviews do, and in any case you probably should see the film.At the start of the film, we see the main character, Danny (played by Ryan Gosling), intimidate a Jewish student on a subway, follow him, and beat him up. If you had never heard of this film, you would have been able to watch this sequence without knowing... (last chance to stop reading) ...that despite having a shaved head and wearing Nazi emblems, Danny is in fact Jewish. I had heard of the film, however. In fact I was scheduled to see it on September 13th at the 2001 Toronto International Film Festival, but due to the events two days prior it was pulled from the festival.Early on, the film also shows flashbacks to Danny's days as a young boy in Jewish school, arguing with the teacher that any God who would order someone kill their own child is basically a bully. In this scene and in his scenes as a 20-something adult, Danny is shown as the most intelligent, articulate, and charismatic character on the screen, even when what he has to say is completely repugnant. He starts the film single-minded, but later he begins to become more conflicted and complex.The keys to the film are Gosling's possibly Oscar-worthy performance in the lead role, and the words that the writers have provided him to say. What works far less well are the other characters, who seem either one-dimensional or totally undefined. Mostly this didn't bother me while I was watching the film, with the exception of Lina's daughter Carla (Summer Phoenix), the love interest, who never made much sense.The editing seemed interesting. There were many jump cuts, which I guessed might have been made simply to get the best moments in various takes. But based on an interview I read with the first time director (Henry Bean, who also wrote the film), this was done to show that in a sense there are multiple Dannys. Note also that there is extensive use of handheld and often unsteady cameras (SpastiCam TM).This film is actually based on the true story of a Jew who was a member of the Nazi party and also the KKK until he was "outed" by a journalist in 1965. Despite winning the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance in early 2001, it has had trouble getting distribution, finally showing on cable on Showtime in March, and only now getting theatrical distribution (locally starting 6/14/2002).I saw this at Camera Cinema Club in San Jose, CA on 6/9/2002. Unfortunately, no one from the film was available to talk, but the audience discussion was quite interesting. If you do get a chance to see the film, and I definitely recommend it, try to see it with an open minded group of people who can discuss it afterwards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film about Judaism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD; DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE FILM.I'm addressing my comments mostly to the previous poster, FreeAll from Denmark. I agree that the film is not at all about Nazis vs. Jews. Rather it is entirely the realization of an internal debate within Judaism. Perhaps it was not stressed it enough, but the manner in which observant Jews perceive the world is through asking questions. In a very real sense, it is the questions one asks (rather than the manifold answers one can find) that represent engagement with the world around us.In that sense, Danny is the archetypical Jew, because his engagement is excessive to a point where he does everything better than all around him: He questions more deeply, is more intelligent, he hates more virulently, he acts more openly, etc. He is constantly seeking to do more. (Perhaps this is what attracts Carla to him, since she is also constantly asking questions and seeking more. In that context, their sex is gratuitous.)One of the scenes in which we see Danny going against this characteristic is the flashback scene of him (as a young boy) running away from his yeshiva, with the voice of his rebbe (teacher) calling him to come back. We see this scene a few times, showing us that this is one case where Danny did not try to probe, go deeper, or face the questions--which is just another way of facing who one is and what is one's place in this world. Avoiding engagement, he ran away.Thus at the very last scene of the film (if one feels forced to take it literally, then it's presumably the last seconds of Danny's life), we see him finally answering his rebbe's call to come back. But he's not coming back to the rebbe, who he passes several times on the stairway. He's coming back to finally face and wrestle with God, or if you will, to finally face himself and his conflicts. To my mind, that the stairway is eternally ascending, is an indication of Danny's final engagement (read: acceptance) with who he is, for one's questioning of the world around them never ends. As an observant Jew, and I've seen milder forms of people like Danny, both religious and non-religious. I enjoyed the film tremendously, and wept many times through it, not the least at the final scene. I commend Henry Bean for having the creative zeal to bring this story to the screen, for in a sense, the story is one that is really essential to understanding the conflicts that propel all peoples' lives.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed watching this film. The passion that Ryan Gosling displays in this movie is amazing for an actor his age. As far as the subject matter of the movie, the religious aspects seemed a little fuzzy. It's layered in Jewish theology, however, it's not as clear at times.I was troubled at times by the message that the movie was trying to make. It seemed at times like Danny was suffering from split personality disorder rather than just going through a phase of confusion and self-hate. I think that a lot of the neurotic behavior shown by Danny was done on purpose to further emphasize the struggle taking place inside of him.This movie may disturb some and confuse others but the acting is pretty good. Ryan did his best to keep this movie coherent but he can't work miracles. Good acting, shaky story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Contradictory ideas fused together expertly (p.spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To learn that Henry Bean, the director of 'The Believer, is himself a Jew is rather surprising. This is so as he often portrays his protagonist, Danny Balint, a violent Neo-Nazi active (portrayed brilliantly by newcomer Ryan Gosling), with sympathy more than disdain. At some times, the film may even lead you to believe that, due to Danny's intelligent approach to anti-semitism, that his views are justified and that the Jewish faith is fatally flawed.However, I believe that Bean is actually trying to convey an ideology that Judaism actually is flawed, and to represent the confusion experienced by those questioning their traditional faith, as shown by the flashbacks of a young Danny arguing the finer points of the Jewish faith with his class teacher and the repeated hallucinations encountered at the rear of the movie with Danny running up the stairs endlessly. Even at his death, Danny is unsure of what to believe, questioning both his compressed Jewish faith and his recent anti-semitic beliefs, questioned by the presence of a newspaper reporter.This is where 'The Believer' differs from the powerful 'American History X', an obvious comparison. At the end of that movie, both Edward Norton and Edward Furlong's characters had 'learnt their lesson' regarding anti-semitism and decided against it, but Danny in 'The Believer' has not, and this is where the latter is discreetly more hardhitting.It is unfortunate that 'The Believer' was made at such a time where it hits a very sensitive topic and therefore will only be seen by a very select few, because it is a superb directorial debut and a movie that will be thought provoking in the future. The fusion of contradictory ideas will be confusing in the cinema, but may start to settle as more thought goes into the film. Overall, this is an intelligent study of a troubled character, loosely based on a true story, questioning the meaning of a specific religion.</fullReview>

A well crafted indie with a solid cast of tier two acting talent, "The Believer" will have little too offer the average audience. As an exposition of neoNazism, it is ill-focused and superficial. As an exposition of Judaism, it is too esoteric. As a drama, it is mediocre and fails to crystallize the self-struggle of the central character.

		<fullReview>if you're considering seeing this movie for its political / cultural message, don't waste you're time. you're IQ will actually lose 5 points from viewing it. if you know anything about skinheads, white racialism, etc, you will instantly see problems with the movie that discredit the entire thing. for example, why does the main character have an AWB(Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging) tattoo? hes from new york, not south Africa, i fail to see how he'd have a strong enough connection to the Afrikaner resistance movement that he would tattoo their symbol to his body? its there because it looks something like a Swazi, although its really 3 number 7's connected, meaning 777 from Christian dogma. the only other reason he may have this tattoo is for its connection to the racialist group blood and honor, a group that also uses this logo sometimes. why he would get a tattoo of this group, which is still in existence and in many nations, i have no idea. there is no way the character portrayed in this movie would be a blood and honor member, for reasons too numerous for me to bother with here. also, when he attends the "skinhead retreat", they show a female with a completely bald head, as if she just had cancer treatments. this is another piece of sensationalism. while National socialist skinheads often are guilty of misrepresenting skinhead style and fashion, this is a silly exaggeration. however its meant to jump out at people who know nothing about these scenes, and take advantage of their ignorance. what about him walking around Manhattan with a Swazi shirt, him and his blatantly Nazi buddies walking around Manhattan drinking etc? the traditional skinhead scene in Manhattan is huge, and violent. they basically cleaned out the Nazi skinhead scene YEARS ago, and the remnants rarely if ever present themselves this way. maybe he could walk around like this for days, weeks maybe months and have no problems, but the truth is this is another bit of sensationalism. you just don't see this like the movie tries to portray it. as if this movie wasn't unrealistic enough. so, he gets caught with the Torah in his room, his fascist girlfriend finds it, and he makes her get dressed because being nude in front of it is a sin, according to Judaism. then he begins to read it to her, in Hebrew, and teach her Hebrew. so, this doesn't send up any red flags to her at all? I'm sorry but I'm sick of these sun dance winner movies being touted as great works of cinema, when they are really just awful white guilt trips. now i wasn't able to sit through the entire thing, but I'm going to guess that this movie totally avoided the fact that the vast majority of American skinheads are traditional, in the sense that they are not politically affiliated, are non racist, and are actually respectable members of the community. i wonder if i made a movie that showed Hasidim Jew's as only diamond smugglers and Zionist supremacists, would that win a sun dance award? there are a few scenes that cinematic ally are good, the opening scene is exciting and almost hard to watch, the fight at the retreat is good. there is some truth to the way NS skinheads are portrayed. other than those, i fail to see what made this film an award winner. seriously, don't waste your money like i did on this one folks, it stinks of agenda.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first thing I thought after seeing this movie was "How is this possible that 'The Believer' actually won a price at the Sundance Filmfestival????"It's not that it's all bad, but it's not a movie I would call good. First, there are dozens of little errors. Especially in the beginning the editing is bad. Two times you get the feeling "where am I?" after a very quick cut to a scene somewhere else with the same characters. You get disoriented by it.Another error, when Danny vomits on the street, his girlfriend (who is actually not yet really his girlfriend) comes after him and french kisses him!! Man, that's gross! You just don't do that!The main character Danny, doesn't convince me either. Why did he become a skinhead? Okay, there's this explanation of banishment when he was a child, but I just don't see how you can choose for being a skinhead after that. And doesn't it seems slightly odd that although Danny has a huge collection of jewish items, knows hebrew by heart and doesn't want anyone to get close to the tora, and nobody seems to think, "well, maybe he's jewish???"Last but not least, there's the acting. Especially the flash-backs are very bad acted. The young Danny-boy tries to much and thinks he's as good as Haley Joel Osment. Furthermore, the older Danny tries a bit too hard to look like Edward Norton in American History X. I have to say, some of his looks sometimes work very well, but alas, most of the time they're just rip-offs.No, it really astonishes me that this movie won a prize. Well, it's just one prize, but because of that, I think less about the Sundance Filmfestival. A grand jury should know better than to give this movie a prize.</fullReview>

The movie is a kind of visual debate on that fact but the scene is in US. Although the movie can try to depict the darkened mind set of Nazi supporters in a psychological tempo, I must say that the movie was quite unsuccessful in bringing a strong impression for the audience like me, who likes challenging impressions. Ryan Gosling's performance was totally great although the confused architecture of the screenplay. If the synopsis of the movie was asked from me, I would have written "A believer Jewish young man prefers a very opposite way to show his anger on Nazi. He is in between his anger at Nazis and his anger and mercy on Jewish people who became the victim and who couldn't show deadly resistance to Nazis." The synopsis looks interesting but sub stories cannot complete the whole story. Perhaps, the director tried to show many things at the same time. I don't know, I advise this movie to be watched but will not be one of my favourite ones!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A young Jewish man develops a fiercely anti-Semitic philosophy. Based on the factual story of a K.K.K. member in the 1960s who was revealed to be Jewish by a New York Times reporter. The Believer" explores a Jewish student's private journey to understand the meaning of Judaism in his life. Set in New York City, the Plot follows a morally confused young adult struggling with the conflict between his beliefs and his heritage. "The Believer" examines themes of religion, family, and self-loathing. It is a psychological examination into the forces of intolerance, both on the individual and society as a whole. Roger Ebert wrote: "The ending of "The Believer," if not exactly open, is inconclusive, and this is the kind of movie where you need to go budget in time afterwards for a cup of coffee and some conversation. The movie is better at portraying Danny's daily reality than at making sense of his rebellion (if sense can be made), but perhaps the movie plus the discussion can add up to a useful experience. Although his film needs more clarity and focus, Henry Bean has obviously taken a big chance because of his own sincere concerns. And if the wrong people get the wrong message--well, there has never been any shortage of wrong messages. Or wrong people." The Believer is an extremely disturbing and thought provoking film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only Highlight Here Is Ryan Gosling's Explosive &amp; Electrifying Performance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inspired by the true life story of Daniel Burros, The Believer is a thought provoking, hard-hitting, powerfully disturbing yet profoundly moving tale starring Ryan Gosling in one of his earliest &amp; most electrifying roles and despite its provocative subject manner, is a heartbreaking experience at the same time.Set in New York City, the story of The Believer concerns Daniel Balint; a Neo-Nazi skinhead with very strong anti-Semitic feelings despite having a Jewish background himself. The plot presents him as a morally confused individual who constantly finds himself torn between his beliefs &amp; his heritage before being exposed by a journalist.Finely directed &amp; nicely written, the film is unflinching with its content &amp; is often a tough sit at times but a rewarding experience nonetheless. The technical aspects don't add much to the story for the entire narrative is mainly driven by Ryan Gosling's explosive performance as the self- hating Jew &amp; still remains one of his best works to date.On an overall scale, covering the themes of religion, hate &amp; self-loathing, The Believer is a fiercely crafted &amp; steadily paced drama that's much worthy of a wider audience, is a fascinating but somewhat underdeveloped study of a troubled character, and benefits greatly from Gosling's commanding screen presence &amp; show-stealing performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Steady, competent urban set drama about right wing belief vying with repressed faith.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During The Believer, we recall two specific films dealing with Nazism; both made within ten years of it and both taking the material in varying directions. First and foremost, Romper Stomper; a film about a person or a group of people whose white supremacist beliefs were depicted amidst a growing foreign contingent in the territory that has always been theirs. The film mutated into a depiction of a love triangle, a covering of two of these neo-Nazis falling for the same girl and fighting one another over her. Fast forward to 1998's American History X, and we observe someone just as politically motivated as the lead is here although ultimately coming to reject his Right-Wing beliefs in a manner not linked to his past. The Believer falls between the pair of these films; it covers the sort of ground both films wound up going over but probably comes up short as a piece of cinema ? it is a competent effort but one that often struggles in the pacing department. Further, it lacks both the guerrilla-like sheen of Romper Stomper; that ugly, hulking tone and aesthetic said 1992 Australian effort had, as well as the free-flowing sense of causality as one thing led onto another in American History X.Indeed, following on from these two films The Believer will open with your seemingly now standardised beating of an ethnic minority on account of a white man. Gone are the reverberations one felt during that black and white beginning involving African Americans and an attempted automobile sabotage; gone too is that nasty underpass-set kicking of a helpless Vietnamese adolescent. The opening here is different, it's shot in colour and in the middle of the day; a sequence that begins on a very public subway train as someone eyes down their target before flowing out into the open streets wherein the aggressor will target their prey. It is not as striking, but it is a scene that seems to delicately steer clear of previous incarnations in its construction of the sequence: same subject matter, different approach.That aggressor is a certain Daniel Balint (Gosling); a Nazi sympathising, Jew hating American living in New York City who tunes into political radio shows and attends the odd ring wing gathering evening trying to get across his views. He wants every Jew in America dead, but will sit opposite a Jewish reporter in a diner and speak of his views for some sort of recognition. He hides his past: the fact that he was once Jewish and grew up as a boy ingrained in Jewish circles before finding a new path, and the film coming to form a depiction of this man unsure of precisely where he lies. Observe the "space" Balint occupies in this world of extreme far-right views, someone with the sort of charisma often attributed to a politician but with the meaty aggression and street-set streak of violence often set aside for the more mindless of thugs just looking to bully ethnic minorities. He is by himself; he is above the low level Nazis with whom he loiters and who have never even heard of Adolf Eichmann, yet not really in his element with the political higher ups he meets ? people who dress more formally and channel their anger through words. It is this middling extent that encapsulates the ambiguity around where Balint stands.It is interesting to observe films made in countries, or about people IN certain countries, that are based outside of nations with an all-white, all-Caucasian heritage. When Russell Crowe's lead in Romper Stomper speaks of how he doesn't want to be "wiped out" by the growing Vietnamese population like the "Aborigines were", it is a moment where we pause to reflect that it was those of his Caucasian ilk responsible for replacing said native group of people in the first place. With American films, similar points of whose nation belongs to what ethnicity rear up in a circular motion causing arguments that can't really go anywhere. These films often depict white groups taking on the elements: all else who're non-white, but for what heritage do they fight? In Europe, we fight for what preceded the immigrant threat as well as what lies ahead: preservation is just as crucial as control. Elsewhere, white groups can only really vie with foreigners for incumbent control of the future. There is little doubt that, should a film such as this be produced in through a Western European country, cries of it being pro-Nazi would almost certainly ring out.As stated, I came away feeling The Believer fell in-between two distinct and somewhat impressive films tackling this subject matter. Its central arc about somebody conflicted feels heavier here and the pacing gets clumsier when Summer Phoenix's S&amp;M enthusiast character, Carla, enters Balint's life around about the time he darts off to a drier, more desert dominated part of his country to engage with other fascists. Writer/director Henry Bean's trump card here is often his dialogue; dialogue that arrives with original and philosophical weight. Take, for instance, the conversation between a handful of people wherein they question whether or not someone who denies the Holocaust is less likely to be a neo-Nazi than someone who very much believes it happened. They argue as to why someone who idolises Adolf Hitler would do so if they DIDN'T think he was responsible for the death of six million minorities ? why else would you think he was a genius? The piece is not without its film-making merits, but you come away wanting to have liked it more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pointless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ryan Gosling is a great actor with a huge present, an even more promising future, and a past I'm digging into. That's why I decided to go checking on this movie and he certainly didn't disappoint as an actor, but the movie was not compelling at all. I missed the point of it, if there's any. There's no explanation whatsoever of why the main character is the way he is. The story presents a conflict since the very beginning that is expected to be explained as it develops, but it never does. Why is the guy the way he is? You'll never know. He just is. What does his father or his friends have to do with the plot? Nothing, they are just there and mean nothing. That's something I've been good with for the first 40 minutes, cause the movie is pretty entertaining, but when I discovered that it was going nowhere, I felt kind of tired of it. In the end, It just felt pointless and hollow, to be honest, like if the whole neo-nazi theme was just a hook to attract the audience, without a real good story to tell. Acting is good, and I can't say you don't have a good time for the first half of it, but then it turns into disappointment. Just mediocre, that's what it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie about how self-hatred can lead to own destruction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought about the movie "American History X" while watching this because of the similar themes in it and although this movie isn't as powerful as "American History X", it is still a pretty compelling movie. The plot revolves around a self hating jew, who is a group with racist skinheads. And while "American History X" the modern Nazis targeted blacks the most, in this film the main target is the jews. The main protagonist in this who is a jew, although articulate his cause isn't developed very well. Plus most of the jews in this movie look very stereotypical as well. Another thing that lessened the impact of this movie is how unrealistic it is at times. Danny the Jewish nazi played by Ryan Gosling, Gosling's acting is very good in this the character just didn't seem all that realistic, mainly because of the scenarios. There are a bunch of scenes with him wearing a shirt with a big swastika in the middle, but nobody in the big city seem to notice and doesn't do anything about it and the whole movie takes place in New York. So I am amazed how he managed to walk the streets and survive with almost no harm done to him. Again I compare this film to "American History X" because of the similar theme, but unlike that movie with Edward Norton this has more to do with the aspects of hatred and love in one direction. The main flaw though is the line between hatred and love it just isn't developed all that well. His hatred isn't all that well developed and so is the parts about his deterioration from his main goal. The parts about Danny(Ryan Gosling) being involved with the modern fascist movement didn't really add or take away much from the story. It seems the main reason why he hates jews is because of some aspects of judaism. The story is good, but as the movie started coming close to the end the impact sort of started to die a bit. This film also bring about a lot of issues but hardly explore any of them.7.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>powerful, but uncomfortable viewing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The subject matter is a young and talented Yeshiva student who questions his religion to such an extent that he takes a wild swing into the ranks of anti-Semitism and Neo-Nazi groups. But I question whether this is an examination of anti-Sematism per se. The journey that this character seems to be taking is a quest for God -- but such a wrong-headed quest that he repeatedly challenges God with the most-heinous acts hoping against hope that he will be struck down. Which would at last be a signal that God exists and is aware of him. As such this is a valuable film and wonderfully acted by Ryan Gosling. But because of the inflamatory nature of anti-Semitic views, this film will never get the wide release and recognition it deserves. This is powerful and thought-provoking stuff and does not in any way glorify anti-Semitism. In fact in one of the best scenes Danny is thrown into sharp relief against -- and shows his disgust for -- his skin head buddies. They are trashing a synagogue, but only he has the knowledge and familiarity with Judiasm to lend any meaning to his actions -- he knows what he's rebelling against. His buddies are just mindless idiots. Ironically, this scene is where Danny is brought back face to face with his religion and finds how powerful and potent that religion is.....Never watched the movie. the hatred is too strong. It exists in this world but the intensity of the hate and the needless hate crimes he did was not something worth seeing. I have to say I rarely don't finish a movie. I usually give it the benefit of the doubt. Not in this case</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deeply Disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are films that are hard to watch. Some are simply very sad, or deal with disturbing material. Then there's "The Believer." I've seen many films, but none has bothered me so much as "The Believer." "The Believer" is the story of Danny Balint (Ryan Gosling), an articulate and fiery anti-Semite who superb skill for hate rhetoric makes him the poster boy for a fascist movement led by Curtis Zampf (Billy Zane) and Linda Moebius (Theresa Randle). But Danny carries a secret: he is a Jew himself. But the higher he climbs on the ladder of the Fascist movement, the more conflicted he feels about his heritage and what beliefs he is spouting. Comparisons to "American History X" are warranted, and although the two films deal with similar subject matter, just about everything else is different.This is a riveting film. It is also unapologetically controversial. In fact, it embraces it. When dealing with provocative material, films must tread carefully to both accurately portray the material without alienating the viewer. Director Henry Bean makes no attempt to avoid offending anyone. Bean takes the material and runs with it; if anyone is offended by what shows on screen, Bean says, "Shame on them." While one could applaud Bean for being so daring (to the point of recklessness), his film-making skills are not as strong. The film starts to go off the rails during the final third, when we no longer understand the motivations of the characters.That being said, whatever may be wrong about the film itself, it has nothing to do with the performance by its lead actor, Ryan Gosling. Gosling is electrifying. His performance is nothing short of incredible. When he talks, we listen. His firey speeches put those of Edward Norton in "American History X" to shame. But beneath that vicious, hateful exterior, there is a deeply conflicted human being trapped underneath. There are times when even though he's throwing out hateful words, you can see the pain beneath his eyes. Had this film been released more widely (no distributer would back it after claims of anti-Semitism), Gosling would undoubtedly gotten an Oscar nomination (and maybe even have won). The other acting is good as well. Judging by his performance in 40 Days and 40 Nights, I did not think that Glenn Fitzgerald had the ability to act, but I was proved wrong. Fitzgerald may not talk much, but he's actually a little frightening as Drake. Billy Zane is at his ice-cold best as Curtis, but he could have used a little more screen-time. Theresa Russell could have taken a note or two from Zane and added a little more coldness to her performance. However, compared to Gosling, even his best co-stars can't hold a candle to his stunning portrayal.Do I recommend the film? It's a good film, there is no question about that. But the feeling I had was so unpleasant that I hesitate to recommend it. I suppose I could if they had a thick skin and were a die-hard fan of excellent acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confusing at times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ryan Gosling is one of my favorite actors but I had never seen The Believer which apparently was the movie that introduced him to a larger audience.Being a fan I had to check this movie... As I expected Gosling can do no wrong and delivered a very interesting and intense performance, the movie however felt short of my expectations.The Believer tells the story of Danny Balint, a young Jewish man with an anti-Semitic worldview, or in other words, he is an Nazi.The question,obviously,is how can someone have so much hatred for his own people? Trough flashbacks we get to know Danny a little better and as the story develops we feel closer to the character; however, I was unable to truly understand Danny's motivations...and don't get me wrong, I think the idea behind the movie is great and American History X is one of my favorite movies. I always love when films enter the "belief/moral" territory, its always interesting to analyze the human mind, our belief systems, the ideas we assimilate from society and so on. The problem is throughout the course of the movie, Danny seems to constantly go back and forth in his beliefs to the point that we question...who is this character? Who is he really, what does he really believe, what is really going on his head? In the end there is only one possible conclusion: Danny is an extremely conflicted individual with an identity crisis.He's struggling to understand what's right and ends up questioning his own actions several times.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A confused movie about a confused character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot of The Believer is centered on a young man, Danny Balint (played by Ryan Gosling), who rejects his Jewish upbringing and becomes a rabidly anti-Semitic white-supremacist. As the story progresses Balint begins to have doubts regarding his anti-Semitic beliefs and endures a painful identity crisis.Religious faith and political extremism are polar opposites in many ways, yet both are passionate pursuits and require a degree of belief that goes beyond strictly logical thinking. People who are deeply committed to a cause aren't easily swayed. The problem with this film is no truly compelling reason is given for Balint's rebellion against Judaism and eventual change of heart.Yes, as a child he had philosophical differences with his Hebrew school teacher and stormed out of class. Over time he came to see Jewish people as weak, perpetual victims and began searching for a way to feel powerful. However, this doesn't seem to be enough motivation to explain his transformation from young philosopher into a murderous thug set on the genocide of the Jewish people. One keeps looking for a deeper explanation, yet all we get are flashbacks of him arguing with his Hebrew School teacher.When doubts begin to creep into his mind about his anti-Semitic views, the viewer is left equally perplexed. He's gone to such lengths to develop his new persona. He's shaved his head, been tattooed with white-supremacist insignias, lifts weights in a fury, wears a swastika prominently on his chest, studied Nazi literature and he's ready to severely beat anyone who doesn't fit in with his Arian view of the world. Despite all this, doubt creeps in very easily. A few stories from Holocaust survivors and the sight of a synagogue being desecrated are enough to soften his heart. Earlier in the movie, he badly beat an innocent Jewish boy on his way to school. He felt no remorse at all then. So what has suddenly changed? Once again, the explanations are nebulous.One could see this movie as a study in losing and regaining faith, but the central character seems too weak for that. He can't commit to anything, so associating any sort of faith with Balint is a stretch. It's more of a study in confusion. One can only conclude that Balint doesn't really know what he wants, or who he is. His supposedly "eloquent" propaganda speeches back that up. His explanations for his anti-Semitic world view are childish and poorly thought out at best. He sounds like a bad high school debater, struggling to justify something that's beyond his understanding.It seems the filmmaker wanted to make a movie that seriously studied religious faith, anti-Semitism and political extremism. However, after a solid start the film goes off track. We're left with an immature, incongruous central character who just isn't very compelling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True Faith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie on cable television. They always keep broadcasting the same things but i never grow tired of "The Believer". The Bulgarian translation is "Tvurda Vqra" - "True Faith".Not that this is very appropriate because one of the main themes in the film is the inability of Danny to decide who he really is - a jew or a Nazi. The really strange thing is that he somehow manages to be both in the coarse of the entire film. And somehow it makes sense. I never really thought of this while i was watching. If someone had told me that this is possible i wouldn't have believed. But the director did a great job. He also wrote the screenplay. But the biggest surprise of all is the acting of Ryan Gosling.He is brilliant in this film. I remember him since he was in this dumb teen TV show - "Breaker High". And i couldn't believe it's the same person. I still can't. And i heard he was in Mickey Mouse Club too. And still he is one of the greatest Young actors around - maybe second after Gael Garcia Bernal. His brilliant characterization is what makes Danny believable. He is to blame for carrying the whole massage of the film - unbelievable as it may seem. A Nazi Jew - who can play that? It's like a fascist hippie or a really calm and peaceful balkan. I bet he can't play the last one.As a whole - a great film. Everything was really great, the cinematography (a little bit documentary style), especially the screenplay, the acting (i should mention Summer Phoenix). Watch it if you can. But it's definitely not for everybody. There are some really appalling scenes and the subject matter is not so usual. I have to say it really sparked my interest in Jewish history and Judaism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I don't really know what this movie is trying to bring across. It's not that I'm the "message" type of guy; in fact I would always prefer questions rather than answers. But let's assume this movie's main issue is antisemitism - in which way is it being portrayed? If you ask me, it's a mess. All kind of different antisemitic stereotypes are mixed together so that it sometimes seems more like a panorama which just SHOWS. But the picture it shows is blurry. Not for one second it's made plausible how the main character turned from a sceptic young lad to a hyper violent thug - the only explanation the movie seems to give for this per se uninteresting development is that of what in Christianity would be a theodizee ("if there's a god, why's there so much suffering on earth?"). I have myself seen black neo-Nazis. Well, these guys are funny. It might be of an almost voyeuristic interest to watch them - but their sole existence teaches you nothing about racism, antisemitism or what attracts people to this strange formula of neo-nationalsocialism we find portrayed in movies like American HISTORY X or ROMPER STOMPER or THE BELIEVER. Jewish neo-Nazis are freaks basically. So what?the end of the movie where we find something like a dream or an after-life sequence (which is, frankly spoken, a bit funny - does this mean the narrator is god then?) in which the presumably dead main character is running upstairs endlessly. Of course, what at first seems to be a metaphor for (here we go again) questioning and searching is in fact a translation of the ancient Greek myth of sysyphos. Now how's that connected to the movie's main issue, antisemitism? I tell you how it is - not at all. It's all purely eclectic and for-the-hell-of-it. If that's what the movie is about, showing the absurdity of religion itself (here we have to place sysyphos then), well - accepted. I'd buy that.When you get THE BELIEVER on DVD, there's an interview with the director among the special features. This guy seems to have a real problem with jews, really. Did you know know why this movie didn't make it big? He explains it - cause a rabbi from the Simon Wiesenthal Center gave it a bad review ... here we go again ..... another dull and ridiculous stereotype. But not articulated in the story telling process but in real life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A winner at the Sundance film festival, The Believer is an interesting movie about a young man with a Jewish heritage who turns into a Nazi. The movie is reportedly based on a true story that occurred in USA in the sixties. The set-up is interesting, but unfortunately the movie does not concentrate on the reasons that drove the main character (Ryan Gosling) into the lifestyle he leads. We do get to view some flashbacks from his past, but nothing that really would explain to the viewer what the reasons are behind the choices the main character has made.It would certainly had been more interesting to concentrate more on the issues that make a person deny his own identity. Still, the movie is well worth watching because of it's interesting topic, but in comparison with the Edward Norton movie "American History X" (which deals partly with similar issues) this movie clearly comes in second place.Ryan Gosling gives a solid performance, but the other characters (including Billy Zane, Theresa Russel and Summer Phoenix)in the movie are a little bleak.</fullReview>

It was obvious that a lot of research went into the movie, and that it took a lot of time to simply get the timeline down. Which in itself was amazing.This movie really made me think. It made me feel and lastly it made me realize that no matter how hard we try, we can never escape what we were meant to be. I thought it was really well done. It really raised par for a good movie. It was a movie that made people feel, think, cry, laugh. I think it was a movie that everyone should see regardless of how they feel.But what really awed me was how well Ryan Gosling pulled off his character Danny. He really pulled the audience into the story. Conveying every emotion, he fit the character down to a T. I personally thought he did an amazing job. He had a passion in the movie that few actors have these days and I appreciated that. He did a good job.All in all. Good movie!</fullReview>

It makes very precise critisisms of judaism, and im surprised the film was allowed to be made, normally the adl or someother jewish run org would prevent it, but because of the films ending they may have viewed it as pro jewish.

Placing it all in the character study - which is Incredibly detailed and filled with different undercurrents and nuances - gives Gosling the scope to be a PERSON who's incredibly wrong, as opposed to "a villain" or "just crazy".

		<shortDescription>Simple, Powerful Morality Play (spoilers ahead)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Young Danny Balint challenges God to strike him down, and God shows him how it will happen, by Danny's own free will, no less. Young Danny began by depising the intellectual frailty of religous faith and grew to hate the religion and people he was born into. At any point he could have deracinated that hate (to borrow the term), and his life would have taken another course. But on the course he chose, he had no other outcome than to step forward to his own death, of his own free will. Either die that evening at 7:30, or, having been exposed at a Jew parading as a Nazi, be murdered within the next few days by his own irate former gang mates.A Moment-of-Death redemption occurs, as he moves in his fantasy from the SS soldier bayoneting the infant, to the young jewish father made courageous by the rage at the murder of his child. A second redemption of sort occurs immediately afterwards, as the apparition of of his ealier schule teacher brings him the news that Danny's side of the original argument might have merit. Which was to say that this argument which sent Danny of on his path of hate, this orginal challenge to God was not worth sacrficing his life for.Not a miscast person or a weak performance in this entire movie. Especially interesting was the story of Carla Mobius. Her mother's hatred has no meaning for her, nor can she find any oter meaning in life. Her father may have been a Nazi, but has ended up in a sanitorium and talks only of suicide. Danny's unexplained familiarity with the Jewish religion, and his rationalization of that familiarity ("you got to know your enemy"), allows her to explore it without immediate hatred. At the end, she chose not to sacrifice her life along with Danny's, because she was already on a new path, one without Danny's dead end, te path of assimliation into Judaism.Alot to learn from in this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this film. There is a raw intensity about it that makes it almost impossible to look away from. The dialogue - alone - is smart, interesting, and in a weird way educational. The direction and the way the film was shot is also what adds to this film's appeal. And then there is Ryan. Ryan Gosling is a new actor, and according to Hollywood standards not really stretched and tested yet; but this films shows how far a young actor can be stretched and how great his performance can actually be. On top of all this, the symbolism that seeps throughout the film is also very affecting; whether you're religious or not, a nazi or not, in one way you will be affected by this film and it's dark, somewhat disturbing message.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>is it really a deep movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read a lot good reviews about "Believer" my expectations were really high before watching it and...I am not sure if that movie was that great. My first impression was that this movie fell into the category of thought-provoking ones, which was a good thing. Later though, I was left with too many unanswered questions that made me think this movie was not that great... The biggest and I think the most controversial piece of that puzzle was the reason why the main character, raised as a Jew, was so anti-semitic...Was it because all the Jews seemed to weak for him, or maybe he really believed that the Jews, the chosen ones, must be punished and discriminated to become stronger...? Was the main character really a unique, unbelievably intelligent individual who by means of unconventional methods tried to make all the Jews stronger or...was he just a freak??? Again, I don't think this movie was that great, however, if you happen to have a bunch of intelligent friends you can watch this movie with - I highly recommend it! Try to discuss the movie afterwards. There isn't anything healthier in this sick world than an intelligent discussion over a movie you have just seen that made you think...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Believer is a dangerous, thoughtful and fascinating look inside the mind of a self-hating Jew. He is strong, intelligent and one of the most racist people you'll ever see. Many have made note that director Henry Bean never tells us why he hates his own people so much. Can we ever really know why a racist is the way he is? Trying to find a simple answer in a complex world is a lost cause. Danny Balint, the lead character, is as complicated as any real person, racist or otherwise. The film itself is imperfect, but the director is obviously going to go on to do great things. This movie was a ballsy first attempt at directing, and Bean's courageousness will hopefully grow with each successive film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fiercely Honest Man Defeated by His Dishonesty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bean's fascinating film is unique in its treatment of the young, brilliant Jew-bashing Jew at its center: the condition of young Balint's soul is not drawn in black and white.Repelled by those who are awed, as he puts it, not only by the "Inexpressible" but the "idiocy" in traditional lore, Balint is torn between his absorption in the mystery of God, his reverence for the Word and a white-hot scorn for the apparent passivity and sheep-like acceptance of suffering and damage by his European Jewish forebears.This is a man who is not afraid to judge God. In another time and place he might have been a great Jewish rebel. But though he accepts his dilemma in his head and is fiercely honest in his soul, the public disclosure of his outward dishonesty with both his anti-Semite and his Jewish friends convince him his existence anywhere is untenable. His tragedy is he does not apprehend that his first tentative chancings at honesty with both groups could have ignited intellectual fire to enlighten the racist who sucks a sore and the Jew in pain. This is a dangerous and (therefore?) overlooked movie. Jim Smith</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well I went into this movie with high expectations, and I was mildly disappointed. I say that only because I was expecting "American History X" material, and I did not receive it. But that is not the movie's fault, that is mine. So before I go on, I challenge alot of you to think about whether or not this movie REALLY failed...With that said, I think that The Believer did what it intended to do, and that is to make the viewer think. If you pick apart ANY movie, you're bound to find plot holes, contradictions, inaccuracies, etc... Fortunately, all of the errors in this movie have no bearing whatsoever on the point that this movie tries to get across, which hovers around questioning your beliefs. So, why bother having a fit over it all? I'll congratulate you for your analytic/interpretive skills, but that doesn't change the fact that this movie has such a high rating.A word on the acting... Ryan Gosling, I wish I could shake your hand. Brilliant and convincing this kid was in a very multi-layered role... It's no wonder Sandra Bullock is all over him. I'm used to seeing him in comedic roles like in Breaker High, so not only was this role a refreshing change, but it also proved his ability as an actor. Overall, great film, and very entertaining.Rating: 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One false note ruins it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(One minor spoiler)I'm not a Jew, so I don't know (nor care) how much of this is true regarding the jew psyche. But I do know this: the scene where he fights with the teacher about Abraham and Isaac showed absolute historical ignorance. The film puts this as to show in part one of the reason he hates jews. Saying that God is a bully for asking this from Abraham, and the jews following such god are therefore wimps shows a lot of ignorance, and stupidity. Why? Well, in Abraham's time (more than 3,000 years ago) sacrificing your children to the gods was a somewhat common and accepted practice to demonstrate one's faith or to ask favors (remember Jefte offered to sacrifice whoever walked out of his house first to God, and his daughter happened to be that person, and he did kill her anyway). So God asking such a thing from Abraham wasn't much of a stretch. The stretch for Abraham was that Isaac was his ONLY son from Sara (Ismael didn't count for God's promise), and if he killed him what would happen to God's promise of a nation coming from him? Had he had more sons with Sara, he wouldn't have hesitated for a second. He only hesitated because of the promise.Again, I don't know about jews, but to us Catholic those kind of things are explained right from the start. Not to view past event with our modern mentality, but with the one in vogue back then. I guess rabbis explain that too. So to say that an INTELLIGENT and WELL EDUCATED person would get conflicted over such stupidity is ludicrous, to say the least. But, since this is fiction (LOOSELY based on a real case), I guess we can forgive the director for such mistake.Think about it. It's the same as saying that the jews had the Holocaust coming to them for all the genocides they committed throughout history while conquering the promised land. And such a statement would be just as stupid and ignorant, right?</fullReview>

Daniel Balint, the protagonist, is able to defeat a man who is bigger and stronger than him. The moment the women met him they want to go to bed with him. He is supposed to be very intelligent but he just demonstrates to be a violent rebel. Daniel could kill but he didnt want to do it. The young nazi wasnt so bad boy!!!One cant understand why the hell the neonazi girl had to be masochist. What for Bean shows us the anguish relationship between this girl and his father? What does all this add to the main plot?It is unbelievable that Danny doesnt take any advises about how to speak in public, the argument he had to talk about.Daniel speaks against three great jewess: Marx, Freud and Einstein. An excuse to remember us that those important and brilliant men were jewess.We dont see the Daniels destroyed body when he dies. Instead of that, he appears going up stairs; not going down. In spite it is based on a true fact, `The believer' is not believable.In `A clockwork orange' Kubrick knew to show how frightening and terrifying the main character was. Nevertheless, we even feel sorry when he becomes a victim later. This is certainly a well-narrated story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jungian (ULTRA-SPOILERS!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the character of Danny Balint we have person exhibiting Jung's concept of antientmophenia (?), wherein a person becomes their exact opposite. Thus a defiant yeshiva student becomes a violent skinhead. The only problem with such people is that they continually confront their old selves through close relatives, places, activities, and the like. And Balint's other problem is that he has not completely gone through this process; underneath the shaved scalp lies a yarmulke. Because his character thrives on argument more than leading a pack of goons, he is attracted to Lina Moebius' crypto-fascist kaffeeklatch. Blonde beast Lina hopes to make the articulate young man a spokesperson for her movement, but Danny is a Nazi for one reason: he thinks God is a bully and that the Jews are weaklings for following Him. Except for the Israelis; they have land and are willing to defend it, and thus are honorable according to Hitlerite "blood and soil" theories. It is rather interesting that the New York far-right has abandoned anti-Semitism. But then, as John Roy Carlson noted in 1943's "Under Cover", Pro-Axis groups often changed their tone and phraseology so as to be acceptable to various class and ethnic groups. Danny knows this, which is why his self-destructive behavior before a group of potential donors and backers signifies his break with Nazism more than missing the Jewish banker/ambassador he sets out to snipe. To be honest, this movie will make most people very uncomfortable. It deals in subtexts that the American media find taboo, like Danny's subconscious understanding that Nazism and Zionism have similar intellectual grounds, white on black crime, and the concept of extreme racial self-hatred. I get the feeling that, like "A Clockwork Orange", this film will not be released on VHS or DVD in the US as Kubrick's film was in the UK. Whether it will be by the director or by corporate America will will have to see. But "The Believer" deserves to be seen and discussed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This struck me as an above-average film because it is actually saying something worthwhile about society, however controversial. Danny is a young Jewish man who becomes a Nazi skinhead because he thinks Jews are weak, soft. Still, he holds onto his Judaism in secret. Ebert and Roeper said that Danny's argument was too convincing, but I don't agree. The challenge of the film is that Danny's arguments are full of true premises, but questionable conclusions. Underneath the questioning of Judaism, Danny is just like the person who you knew in school (it might have been you) who questioned the teacher to the nth degree. The only problem I had with the film is that I wondered how Danny lived day-to-day with all that nihilistism inside of him. It seems like he should have melted-down before the film even started. There's alot of aggressive self-loathing in the film, but the by-product is that it made me think about fascism, anti-semitism and the conflict inside every person between authority (God, doctrine, the majority) and the individual will.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Believer' is an extremely overrated film. Ryan Gosling gives a brilliant performance as Danny an exceptionally bright young Jewish man who lives a double life, when he becomes involved with weird right wing 'neo nazis' and conceals his Jewishness from them. Danny's rejection of the religious and moral strictures of orthodox Judaism has a narcisstic and nihilistic edge to it, he says the Jews 'are nothing'. He becomes close to a creepy 'intellectual' right-wing couple and becomes attracted to their daughter Carla (Summer Phoenix) and has an affair with her. Unlike her stepfather and mother, Carla has some degree of sensitivity and questions Danny's anti-semitic views.In the meantime, Danny has to keep his Jewish past hidden and he is rumbled a journalist whom he threatens with his own suicide if the story is published. He becomes deeply involved with racist skinheads and plants a bomb in a synagogue. It is here, when Danny sees the damage and desecration to the Torah that his 'Jewishness' returns. He tells his fellow skins not to damage the Torah and takes it home with him. Danny repairs the damaged scrolls, and Carla starts to become curious about his behaviour. What stretches my incredulity in this film is when the naked Carla is reading the holy book and Danny demands that she put her clothes on. All of a sudden Danny is transformed back to being an orthodox Jew demanding that a woman should not be naked infront of a man. Danny's intimate knowledge of Judaism raises suspicion amongst his skinhead colleagues. He is also sent on 'sensitivity training' as an alternative to prison for the desecration of the synagogue. He hears horrific stories from Holocaust survivors but mocks and insults them. This scene I found hard to bear, particularly the idea of the State posing as a sensitive and neutral arbitrator on the issue of racism.The films premise lacks credibility and it is hard to sympathise with Danny and his destructive self-hatred, which he seems to blame on the rigid inflexibility of his religious upbringing. In spite of his religion, Danny lives in New York, a modern secular city. Why would such a bright person want to get involved with right-wing cranks when there are far more opportunities available to him in modern American society? Also, the concept of 'Jewishness' as a cultural identity, is awkwardly posited, one minute Danny is a repulsive fascist convert and then suddenly the sight of the Torah and religious garments turns him back into a Jew. Danny's demise when he blows himself up at a synagogue does not arouse much sympathy with me, as he, and nobody else, has willed on his own destruction. The film is confusing in its narrative structure and it forces issues down the viewers' throats. Anti-semitism is not a major social problem in America and most Jews and other ethnic groups are not under threat by a ramshackle bunch of racist, 'neo nazi' non entities. In fact Jews are one of the most assimilated groups in modern America and the idea of a perpetual, endemic anti-semitism is as ridiculous as the cranky right wing conspiracy theory about the US government being a Zionist Government of Occupation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will admit it; I only wanted to see this film because Ryan Gosling is in it. Forgive me, I am a 17 year old female who loved "Young Hercules". But, in this role, Ryan plays a character so different from all of his others that I was a bit disoriented. I got really lucky and managed to snag a copy of the review tape from a local newspaper film reviewer. The film was supposed to be shown on Showtime but still hasn't. This is one of the most incredible films that I have ever seen. The characters are so...well...human. I love the fact that the main character Danny could never really escape from the beliefs that he was brought up with. I really identified with him on that level because I am a Wiccan and have a love/hate relationship with Christianity. I also love the fact that he wavers a little in his convictions, unlike characters in say American History X which also deal with neo-nazism. The other thing I really like about this film is that you can talk and talk and talk about it. I have shown a clip of it to fellow students in my Mass Media class during a presentation of mine about Independant Film. (the "Look what was accomplished with the death of just one enlightened jew, imagine if we killed them all" scene) They seemed pretty shocked. It is not a movie that people are used to seeing. I also lent it out to an Independant Film buff in that same class and we talked about it just about every day for a week. There are just so many levels to the film. Personally, my favorite moment is when Danny's love interest has sex with another guy right in front of him. The look on his face is just priceless. It looks like sadness, hurt, pity,regret, and a bunch of other emotions. Also, unlike probably quite a few others, I thought the ending perfectly suited the story. It shows that even in death we can not escape what we have been taught, no matter how much we try to run away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brings up more issues than it knows how to deal with. (SPOILERS!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise is fascinating: Daniel, a gifted Jewish boy with a Talmudic sensibility of questioning everything, grows to become a Neo-Nazi skinhead. Why? Because, he argues, Jews are weak...from Abraham (conceding to sacrifice his son Isaac) all the way down the line. He claims a new macho Nazi identity to escape that fate.Many issues are raised and even more not raised: What about the State of Israel? Hasn't Israel effectively erased the stereotype of the Jewish weakling? The movie raises the issue and quickly tosses it aside.What about America? Are we really to believe that a middle-class, suburban American Jew in the year 2001 feels so put-upon and such an outsider that he will react in such an extreme way? That issue isn't raised at all.And what about culture? Are we to believe that Daniel really feels more at home with the ignorant fascist thugs with whom he chooses to associate than with people he can carry on an intelligent conversation with?Finally, something has to be said about sex. The Neo-Nazi thug scenes are literally dripping with homoeroticism. This is not a criticism, per se, unless you consider how bound the Nazi conception of the Jew was with sexual "perversion," something Daniel would have known all about.It's a big can of worms, and the film doesn't really seem to want to go there. But how can it not? You can imagine how sexually liberating it was for Daniel to tear off his nerdy Yeshiva garb, throw away his glasses, shave his head, start lifting weights, and begin wearing tight T-shirts dripping with sweat.It's in these details that you feel that perhaps the film has bitten off more than it can chew.THE BELIEVER is great when the scenes are intimate. Ryan Gosling and Summer Phoenix both give wonderfully charismatic performances, committing fully to their roles despite any weirdness in the story's logic. The film is worse when it gets melodramatic, and the black-and-white Holocaust "flashbacks/fantasies" (!) only add to that problem, as does the music which tries hard to be haunting.By the end of the film it's clear that Daniel's rebelliousness only serves to deepen his Jewishness, a paradox that could work beautifully, but ends up being trite, in part because it's predictable. A movie so enthralled with asking questions should be interested in the complicated answers, not in heavy-handed and romantic displays of Jewish piety.</fullReview>

Gosling plays a rebellious man who renounces his Jewish heritage early in life. Rejecting the shame of Jewish oppression, he goes to the other extreme and becomes a Nazi skin head, bullying blacks, Jews, etc. But then half-way into the movie he starts to embrace the "Jew" inside, and realizes that he can't keep his "Jewness" contained, kind of like "The Incredible Hulk". It's a weird premise for a story. It would have been interesting except that there are so many inconsistencies in the movie.

He comes across here very conflicted, embracing Judaism and Nazism at the same time, and he does not miss a beat. To the best of my knowledge, Gosling was raised a Mormon and not in the Jewish faith, so his fluid expression of Jewish beliefs and the Hebrew language is quite impressive. A Viewer, myself included, may learn more about Judaism from this film than they will at any other point in their life, despite this being fiction.I find it unfortunate that Gosling is now probably best known for "The Notebook".

		<fullReview>It's overly self-indulgent and self-promotional and, quite frankly, a work that seeks to promote the very elements of ethnic elitism that, ironically, was the foundation of Nazi superiority that led to the group's intense suffering. Writers Henry Bean and Mark Jacobson use the standard mechanisms to try and get the viewer to avoid seeing the self-promotion (including the disappointingly sophomoric articulation of the dynamic during one of the main character's uber-self-aware monologues) but the near-constant drive to get across the message makes it impossible. Because of this, the main character's struggle and pain are effectively props. There was such promise here - a character where we could identify with the internal struggles and conflicts and become engaged as they evolve into wholeness. But instead the character becomes a tool for the writers' own desires to promote their own ego specialness, with presenting tired old clichs of ethnic superiority. A little self and group awareness goes a long way, gentlemen, and these old ideas die hard. Self-deprecatory self-promotion is getting very tiresome and even more so in this character that acts as a bullhorn for the writers' shared prejudices.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This subject has been whitewashed (so to speak) so often that it sometimes loses its true horror. Movies like American HISTORY X and ROMPER STOMPER and FUHRER EX (to name but three) simply failed to make the point as eloquently as this movie does. That it's based, in part, on fact, is all the more chilling. I wasn't raised to hate people- for any reason whatsoever-, so racism confounds me. The most telling experience I had with anti-Semitism came when I was in High School. Our history class was ushered into a room and shown documentary footage of a group of prisoners in a German concentration camp (some of which were patterned after the concentration camps used by the U.S. Army to "deal with" the American Indians in the late 1800's). These prisoners had already dug their own graves. They were lined up in front of these graves and shot. The impact of being shot in the head at close range sent their ragged caps straight up into the air as they toppled back into their graves. And all around me, the other students burst out laughing. I was stunned- first, by the horror of what I'd just been shown, and, second, by the reactions of my fellow students. This wasn't just a nervous release: these witless wonders were guffawing and slapping their knees and stomping their feet; they were laughing their butts off. Watching people die. Although I've worked alongside men with numbers tattooed on their forearms, and I've tried to reconcile myself to the apparent fact that every race hates every other race (including themselves, as this film clearly delineates),I've come to loathe the Human Race as a whole. I wish it were otherwise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie with my film class. I attend a school that is kind of the stepping stone to further education, one where those who don't really know what they're going to do with their life, what they're going to be later on come to spend some time, getting guidance and being taught valuable skills. These kids(well, teens, really) are searching for their identity. And anyone who's been around such teens know that they have a tendency to be quite loud... but not this day. The film came on, the opening credits played... and silence. Complete and utter silence. After the film was done, most of us sat around, not knowing what to do or say. I don't think one word was uttered the rest of the day. Not one. Not because they were afraid of saying something bad or inadequate about the film... but because they didn't know what to say. And neither did I. It's been half a week since said day, since I watched this film. And I haven't been able to put down one word about it until today. After a quick look a my collection of reviews, you'll know that I've written quite a few... and most, the vast majority of them were written in an amount of time ranging from one to two hours, and I begun writing as soon as I could get to the computer after watching the film. This film really reached out and touched me. Us. It deeply touched a group of kids that many people would consider impossible to impact emotionally. I feel that describing this is the best possibly way I can explain how powerful and well-made it is. The plot is very well-written and develops nicely throughout the film. The pacing is slightly off at times, and more often than not, the movie seems far longer than it is. The acting is all top-notch, not one performance seemed weak or poor in the least. The writing is excellent. The direction is highly effective, without being manipulative. If this movie doesn't touch you or make you question some things, I doubt anything will. I recommend this to anyone who can deal with the subject matter and who aren't afraid of being deeply emotionally affected by a movie. 8/10</fullReview>

I've grown to like stories with a black and white outlook or message less and less so took an instant liking to, 'The Believer'. No doubt some people will be offended by this film and some people will feel it vindicates their racism, but any film that stimulates and provokes a reaction should be acknowledged and complimented. I first saw Ryan Gosling in, 'The United States of Leland', and could not believe his transformation in this film.

		<shortDescription>What it's really about</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was reading some of the comments (and yes, I agree about the less-than-fabulous acting on the part of Summer Phoenix) and I just wanted to add that I really appreciated the point of the movie. It isn't necessarily about the hatred of white supremacy or hating the Jews. Daniel goes through the things he does out of conflict with his own beliefs, upbringing and intellect. He naturally turns to the people who feel the same way he does. Yes, it does deal with Nazis and Facists, but I think the true point is the main character's struggle to understand God and his role in that. Some of the scenes that seemed superfluous made sense to me- the scene with the reporter interviewing him is a testament to how off-the-wall his beliefs had become. The scene with Carla and Curtis show her holding power over Danny, who spends his whole movie arguing about fighting back and being the aggressor. I think its an interesting depiction of someone who can't accept what he's been brought up to believe. The meeting with the Holocaust victims and how those images play out through the rest of the movie seem really strong in understanding Danny's transition. (I just had to do a critique on this movie for my art &amp; music class). Ryan Gosling did an awesome job, no doubt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie makes you think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ithink this is one of those movies that everyone who sees it can get something different from it. It's highly based on your own background, mental strengths, and how you feel about life in general. My review of this movie may completely disagree with someone else's review or how they saw the movie. My thoughts and feelings on it may be so different as to cause some people to even think I'm an idiot. But that's what this movie does, it leaves so much open to interpretation. First of all, I don't think Danny was 100% a self-hating Jew, I think he hated the Jewish religion and himself for being a Jew at the beginning of the movie, but I don't think he had ever met anyone who was more intense about their feelings about the Jews than he was until he went to that camp that Billy Zane sent him to. There I think he began to see what being an anti-Semite really was. He saw that that meant not only destroying the people, but also their religion, their thoughts, their feelings, dragging them through the mud and destroying things that he felt were still worth saving. Ultimately, this all led to his own demise. He didn't die in the end because people found out he was Jewish. He did that because he felt it was time for him to make amends for his sins and to deal with what he had created. In a way, from that day that he left Hebrew school, God did strike him down. God made his life hard for him to live and deal with from then on. Look at how he finally has to come to terms and face to face with his past, and how he has to deal with it. He'd been running from it. But Carla wouldn't let him continue to run in the end there. She maybe even loved him in the end, if not, she at the very least understood him. This movie is controversial, and it is disgustingly real at some parts. Fact is, Danny never hated the Jews completely, and in the end he hated himself more than he could have ever hated the Jews. Part of that hatred for himself was because he could never make himself fully hate the Jews and he couldn't ever bring himself to truly want them all annihilated. This duality is shown when he is picturing himself as the soldier killing the little boy and as the father who could do nothing to save his son. So yes, this is a well shot, well written, and well acted movie. But it is also a movie that will have you pondering it long after the credits have rolled.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film to watch - to really watch!On a superficial level just another low-budget wannabe, but due almost entirely to Gosling's one-man turn here as neo-Nazi (but IS he?) Danny, this is a powerhouse of anti semitic intelligence. Forget ROMPER STOMPER and American X even, this touches the core, if not ignites the fuse beneath the entire anti-Jewish movement.Regrettably, most likely seen by remarkably few people overall, THE BELIEVER in fact manages to balance hatred with faith and you will have to see this out to understand why I say that. It arrives unassailably at the core of Jewish hatred with the inarguable truism - Why do we hate Jews? Not because they are tight with money, not because they are successful, not because they are clannish.....simply because they are Jews!The last scene is completely inspirational and as one reviewer quite sensibly commented - reminiscent in part of JACOB'S LADDER. It made the film! For once the IMDb rating is getting there. 7.3 is possibly a tad light on but consistent with production values. Personally, I would give it an 8.2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think what is most interesting about the film (other than getting to see the great Tovah Feldshuh and the wickedly sexy Glenn Fitzgerald)is how the central character is doomed by his love of and hate for his own arrogance and free will. What he wants, and I believe this to be true of most "neo-anything-violent types, is someone he respects to literally kick his ass into submission, ie, into maturity and resignation.When he dares God to strike him dead as a child, he is serious. He is saying, Why are you taking this s*** from me?! He loves God with his whole heart and despises his own arrogance and intelligence for questioning his/her/its existence because its this doubt thats causes his pain. He envies those for whom faith comes easily.In the end, it makes no difference that the movie is structured specifically around Judaism. The film is about the often disastrous price to be paid when a strong mind pits itself against a strong soul. And vice-versa.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not Jewish,but it was hard to watch the film. The film shows the inner structure of a complex figure by the name of Danny Balint. He is a Jew,by upbringing and probably truly understands the faith(and Torah)better than many Jewish scholars. The faith,however,is what motivates his hate for the Jewish people. He beats up a young Jewish man at the beginning of the film and I could picture many Jewish viewers turning off the film. The film is a great one and quite thought provoking. There's no disputing that Danny was quite an intriguing character despite his mixed,disturbing views. I saw Danny as a confused,complex man,yet one who firmly believes passionately that his cause is true. He has this inner struggle going on between the Jewish side and the fascist Nazi side. Danny is a misanthrope towards the Jews,yet recognizes their influence on society. His beliefs are so misguided and meandering. He,at times,doesn't seem to totally understand what he wants to do. He,at once,desires to kill Jews,but when given the chance can not do it. This is why I think the film is outstanding. It not only has an actor who powerfully conveys Danny in the very talented Ryan Gosling,the film really has a fascinating story to tell. It disects the Jewish faith,letting Danny explain why he views the faith as an annoyance. This film will not sit well for some people,but it is not Anti-Semitic. The film doesn't hold Danny in high regard,but simply explores the reasons that fuel him. ****/*****</fullReview>

A young Jewish boy, beyond his peers and teacher, finds himself deeper into the Tora (Torra?) than they, and almost all others combined, failed to escape.Daniel gets it, kind of an antithesis of Seinfeld. Both engage a form of faith that fails to connect all dots. It's entertaining, though it shouldn't. Both engage in, "a whole lot of nothing about nothing". Who would have thought that anyone could put it into a comedy and drama at the same time?Daniel has a soft spot. See if you can pick it up. When the old guy in the support group spoke of murder of his 3 year old son, Daniel moved to quickly to assess both sides.This movie is a 9.3.1418!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful examination of the nature of faith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I hate and I love and who can tell me why?"?Catullus"Yet each man kills the thing he loves"?Andre GideDanny Balint (Ryan Gosling) is a Yeshiva student who questions what is being taught and cannot understand how a loving God could order Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac. Loosely based on the true story of Daniel Burrows, a Jew who was a member of the Nazi Party and the KKK, The Believer examines whether Danny is, at the core of his being, really a Nazi or a Jew. Apparently, he's a little bit of both. This powerful film reminds us how easy it is for minorities to fall into the trap of self-hatred.In a religion where God is considered everything and nothing, Danny questions whether or not God is using his subjects merely to demonstrate his power. At Yeshiva, believing the Jewish God to be a bully, young Danny dares God to strike him down. He joins with a bunch of pro-Nazi skinheads to beat up Jews, desecrate synagogues, and commit acts of random violence against Jews. Even while committing these acts, he continues to study Judaism and instructs his sexually masochistic girl friend, Carla (Summer Phoenix), in the teachings of the Torah. Danny feels that Jews are weak and do not stand up for themselves. In a sensitivity training session with holocaust survivors he is forced to attend after an altercation, Danny reacts strongly to a story he thinks demonstrates Jewish weakness. He is both repelled and moved by the account of an older Jewish man recounting how his son was stolen from his arms and murdered by the Germans. "Why didn't you attack this man", he asks. "How could you just stand there and let him kill your son?"In one of the most powerful moments in the film, a woman responds, "You don't know what it was like. Here in this rich, safe, stupid country, it's easy to imagine one's self a hero." Another, an old man, responds by asking, "And what shall we learn from you, Daniel?" The image of the German soldier and how Danny would have reacted haunts his dreams throughout the film, first becoming the soldier and then the father.Unable to reconcile both sides of his personality, Danny addresses a fascist fund raising by telling the contributors that we should love Jews because they grow stronger when they are hated. Danny explains how important it is for the Jew to be martyr and victim in order to maintain his faith and keep Judaism intact. "For if we do not have to struggle, do we not lose identity? Is struggle not who we are?" Perhaps all minorities can identify with this paradox. Danny's final act of self-loathing leaves him at last to face himself and his conflicts. Both eloquent and charismatic, Gosling's performance is remarkable. His screen presence can be frightening, yet he is also sensitive and caring as when he personally saves holy books from destruction after his skinhead pals try to blow up a synagogue. Indeed, the film portrays all characters, even the Fascist organizers as complex human beings, not as one-dimensional stereotypes.The Believer does not attempt to probe the real source of Danny's problem or, for that matter, attempt to shed any light on what turns anyone into a violent hater, whether that hatred be directed toward Jews, Gays, or Blacks. While Danny's motivations are not spelled out, Bean thinks viewers should not take Danny's character too literally and condemns Hollywood films for offering too easy explanations. He sees him as a Kafka-like exaggeration whose behavior is merely symbolic of his emotional state. "I think we often hate and love the things that are closest to us," he says. "In some ways we hate them because we love them, because we're so vulnerable to them. And that hatred and love make sense together. If you deny the hatred you feel for someone, in a way your love gets diminished. But if you can acknowledge the hatred and accommodate it without doing something catastrophic, then it lets the love be fuller, more colorful."This film has the courage to be outspoken and challenges the irrelevancy of outmoded laws and customs that interfere with an individual's direct relationship with God. It seriously examines anti-Semitism, Jewish self-hatred, the role of Jews in history, the nature of the Jewish experience and man's relationship to God. The Believer is about hatred of Jews but it is also a loving tribute to the Jewish experience and an examination of the very nature of faith. Though full of contradictions, The Believer is an intelligent and moving film that deserves to be seen whether or not you've ever set foot in a church or synagogue, or ever care to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie about jewrysm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers. Don't read further, if you don't want to get your evening ruined.The Believer has, by some journalists been called the new American History X, but I think there is a great difference. American History X is about a neo-nazi who discovers that nazism isn't what he thought it was. But The Believer isn't most about that. As I see it, it's more about jewrysm (maybe not the correct spelling). Throughout the entire movie it tries to explain why he question the jewrysm so much.Where I think this movie lags a bit is where it shows why he starts to go back to jewrysm again. I think it skips too fast through it, and doesn't explain it good enough. And another thing is the ending. I doesn't understand it. It's probably me who is a bit slow there, but I get it. Maybe the director has thought about how this infinite nothingness was, and if maybe it wasn't good as the jews think? But I can't come to any conclusion with the ending, maybe someone who is smarter than me could email me and explain it to me?One of the best thing in this movie is Ryan Gosling's performance. In my eyes he does a very good job, and I am pretty sure that we will see more of him in the future. Just like American History X helped on Edward Norton's career, I would hope this helps Ryan Gosling too.I'll advice all who hasn't seen it, and read further, even though there was spoilers to see it. It really is worth it. I gave it 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Kaleidoscope of Confused Evil: Harrowing, Taut, Important</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A crude and not very interesting man, Daniel Burrows, was "outed" by the New York Times some time ago as a Jew when his deepest desire was to live as a flame-breathing, virulent, violent anti-Semite. He was one of a group of similar cretins dangerous not because of their ideas but simply through the fact that violence was their opiate, Jews their target of choice (although blacks, Hispanics and other minority group members would serve in a pinch).Burrows's response to being unmasked was to put on a Wagner recording and while surrendering to the stunningly magnificent music of an absolute Jew-hater, he killed himself with a gun. A testament to his ineffectiveness, he had to shoot himself twice.Based on Burrows's story, which got some attention when it was first reported, director Henry Bean has created a fictional and far more complex version of the late and probably hardly lamented Burrows. With Ryan Gosling as "Danny Balint," the product of a hothouse Jewish education, Bean offers and Gosling portrays a complex, well-read thinking thug. He adroitly spins shallow, sophistic arguments about Jews in history while taking the occasional needed break to pummel a "Yeshiva bucher" or plant a bomb or try his hand at assassination.Gosling's portrayal of evil wrapped up in a complex and occasionally likeable skin works dramatically. What has made a terrorist - for that, ultimately is his only true calling - from the matrix of a young yeshiva boy who challenged his teacher's biblical interpretation in an original and rational if unorthodox (no pun intended) way? Flashbacks alternate the young questioning Daniel with the (im)mature troublemaker.Danny's relationship - sexual and intellectual - with his masochistic girlfriend, "Carla Moebius," (Summer Phoenix) offers an inter-related but also largely stand-alone picture of psychopathology in action. Her character is unreal, her acting unconvincing.New York Daily News reviewer Stanley Couch is simply wrong, in my view, with his comment that "The Believer" "is the most important contemporary film about anti-Semitism and probably the most intellectually complex American film ever made on that subject." This film isn't truly about anti-Semitism in American society and the skinhead friends who trash a synagogue with Danny and prepare for and engage in other violent acts have hardly an iota of knowledge about Jews, something Bean brings out. More importantly, the proto-Fascist pseudo-intellectuals who enlist Danny in their organizing and fundraising repeatedly point out that anti-Semitism is a counterproductive tactic today. (Danny doesn't take the hint.)After World War II "Gentleman's Agreement" (1947) tackled the reality of the snobbish exclusionary policies and bigoted values of people who could and did prevent many Jews from enjoying the fruits of American life. Non-violent, they were potent obstacles blocking Jews from schools and careers. "Gentleman's Agreement" forced viewers, sensitized by the extermination camps of the Third Reich, to acknowledge a suavely interlaced and pervasive conspiracy of bigotry. "The Believer" brings to the screen many characters familiar from current events. As in Laramie. As in attacks on Arabs, As in dragging a black man to his death in Texas. As in...The violent misfits in "The Believer," and Danny is one his intellect notwithstanding, are studies in the individual need to hate. True, they can and do hurt, they can and do kill, they can and do destroy. But they can have no larger affect on society in general or on Jews in particular. The focus of this film, unresolved as it must be, is what turns such people, and Danny in particular, into vehement, committed, violent haters. The target in this film, Jews, is topically important - the story takes place in New York City after all. But all the movie's skinheads could be transported to a celluloid study of the Klan or anti-gay murderers and no part of their collective and individual characters would need much re-writing.One enigmatic issue for many, unresolved in the film, is that recurrent question: "Who is a Jew?" With race and gender American law and the views of most reach a concurrence that both reflect immutable characteristics (sex change operations notwithstanding). But the history of religion is one of patterns of apostasy, proselytizing and conversion. No minority religion can afford to lose many members, especially in a pluralistic America where secular practices threaten sectarian tenets. Is Danny really a Jew? Does it matter? Those are questions worth discussing.The scenes are shot largely with handheld cameras which, after a while, may make some viewers wish for Dramamine. Overall, though, this is a tautly directed, well-acted film that instead of being a "whodunit" (there are no surprises) is a powerful "why do they do it?" The resolution at the end doesn't answer that question - the viewer must. Or at least should try.Please do not leave the theater until the credits have rolled. Listen carefully as they roll.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful exploration of warped faith that deserves to be seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this debut film of director Henry Bean recently in Paris, France, where it was showing at several cinemas (entitled Danny Balint), though I believe it has hardly been seen in the US since its outing at the Sundance Festival. Nor is it likely to be screened much in Britain, though it is being shown currently at a Jewish film festival in London. I found it to be a powerful exploration of the way extreme religious faith can drive individuals to perform irrational acts - a theme which has taken on an added relevance since the events of September 11. In this case, Danny Balint (Ryan Gosling) considers his own interpretation of the Jewish faith to be so superior to that of his co-religionists that he transforms himself into a violent, Jew-hating skin-head Nazi.The performances by Gosling and Summer Phoenix as his girlfriend are exciting and convincing; as are those of the young males playing Danny's thuggish skin-head comrades. Theresa Russell and Billy Zane, however, are a little under-used playing organisers of a more "respectable" fascist movement. The direction and technical aspects of the film are all well handled, and the movie is gripping from start to finish, though the plot becomes unnecessarily detailed and fussy towards the end.As has been pointed out elsewhere in IMDb users' comments, intellectually the film bites off a little more than it can chew; I'm also not sure that the film got all its Jewish ritual right. But overall it was streets ahead of the average Hollywood production; and it deserves to be shown.</fullReview>

Being a Jew and knowing first hand the psycosis of what my people breed, this is all too true.Jewish religion/culture is all bitter sweet and makes you feel sorry for youself and weak (Every year we relive the suffering of Slaverly through Passover). Jews have a hard time standing up for themseleves in confrontation, and the movie uses examples like Egypt &amp; The Holocoust.The plot was not PERFECT in this movie but the underlying theme was Danny hated the weakness of Jews so much he lashed out against it. He was attached to the Torah and it's sacrity and believed in it, but hate the frailty of his people.</fullReview>

Also some of the sound recording was pretty terrible--some sentences were incomprehensible. Also plot motivation was muddy--I'm STILL not sure what the hell Billy Zane and Theresa Russell were doing here. They were good but I never got a firm grip on their characters.Ryan Gosling is the whole show. He's a wonderful actor. His hatred of Jews (in some of his speeches) seems way too realistic, but his love of his faith comes through too. It's a very tricky role but he pulls it off. This is worth seeing for him.Just be warned--the anti-Semitism is STRONG (as it should be to make its point). It is necessary, but it made me angry--and I'm not even Jewish! So be prepared to sit through some truly disgusting comments. I almost turned off twice because it really hits hard. But again, it was necessary for the integrity of the film.</fullReview>

Plays out the same as those tales of born-againers sowing their nihilistic wild oats only to find Jesus just as the thrill begins to get lonesome. It's just that this guy finds The Torah and decides the only decent thing left to do now is to act out on the wisdom of his Hebrew-school-inner-child that had somehow never been successfully challenged.

		<shortDescription>Perhaps it's been heavily cut?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was powerful and compelling, but the overwhelming feeling was that it's incomplete in many aspects. I dislike films that spoon-fed the audience and telegraph their punches, but there were so many elements that needed further exploration.For example, the character of Carla left me feeling disturbed, not because of her behaviour but because her character was so under-developed. All we know of her background is that her father is a suicidal inmate of a mental institution and that she is sleeping with her mother's boyfriend. Why is this girl so damaged? Her behaviour is alarming - as a viewer, I need something in order to see her as a person rather than a freakish collection of traits. Daniel wants to save her life desperately in the end - why? The film does not show there to be any genuine connection between the two of them - it seems she's increasingly seduced by Judaism and he's increasingly disinterested in her.This flaw is present in every aspect of the film - we see Danny as perhaps a 13 year old intelligent student with controversial thoughts on Judaism, and next as a twenty-something neo-nazi. Why? Perhaps the writer/director could say that it's more interesting to leave this open but to me this is a cop-out since it's a difficult journey to chart in such a short time. I believe this arc is more than possible, but the details of his journey are important. Perhaps they could explain away other flaws: such as why he is willing to blow up a synagogue but cries when his fellow Nazis desecrate the Torah. There are issues like this throughout - he is clearly conflicted, but neither the writing nor the direction let us in to his mind.One thing that is clear throughout is that Judaism is deeply entrenched within him - his hatred and anger is towards the Jewish people for what he perceives to be their weakness. From the start of the film, he is desperate for them to fight back, to take a stand against their repeated and constant persecution. His desire to kill a Jew is another interesting point - does he want to kill Jews or put them into a scenario where they can fight back? It's interesting that he sees them as weak when the Jews within the film are frequently portrayed as being strong for precisely the same reasons, especially in the scene with the holocaust survivors. This scene, along with the opening and the initial synagogue scene were enormously unsettling: the film provoked a strong physical reaction in me, leaving me sickened by much of the dialogue and action. However, I did not feel mentally challenged as, without elaborating on many important issues, it felt somehow vacuous. The ending fulfils two of Danny's prophecies: that he will kill a Jew, and that he will kill himself if his background is publicly revealed. Danny kills only himself and directs his hatred to its ultimate source: himself. This would be far more powerful if we understood his reasons for hating his religion and himself. As it stands, the only reason I felt anything was Gosling's exceptional performance which manages to strike a balance between vitriol and deep sadness.I can only conclude, or hope, that the film has been heavily cut. The meat of an excellent film is here, but it's missing the skeleton that would make it great. There are many comparisons here to American History X - The Believer is perhaps a more honest, and certainly a more complex, film in that it avoids the easy resolution (Danny does not reject his entire ideology but succumbs to his own confusion). However, it's not the better film - this is a shame, as it could have been, with improvements to the script. Gosling's performance is powerful and believable, the content is intelligent and thoroughly researched, the outlook is risky and unflinching. The problem is, we don't ever get to really understand the protagonist as we must in order to be deeply affected.Therefore, this film - which could have been a 10 with some attention - barely scrapes a 6, and I'd say Gosling is responsible for the majority of that, alongside an interesting premise and some excellent, highly intelligent dialogue. It's definitely worth watching, but be prepared for some problems.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie doesn't bring much thought to the table when it comes to religion, beliefs, racism, intolerance and facts. A Jew is troubled by an event of his past and starts exploring Neo-Nazi ideology... He then discovers that it's all bullshit and regrets but cannot admit it and he cannot commit to stop at once... He's not an idiot but is acting like one and surrounds himself with narrow minded people that can't even spell their own name...Sounds like American History X to me, only with much less intensity.

		<fullReview>Somewhat unbelievable story of a Jewish rebel. The portrayal of the protagonist as a Neo-Nazi is unconvincing in parts, mostly in his, what seems artificial, love of Torah and the religion he seems to respect but not embrace and intellectually can not submit.These affectionate displays and attachment to the doctrine and dogma are delivered in a rather teleprompter mode as if he is reciting and not truly reflecting on the religious teaching. What is convincing is his disdain and hatred for the pious and superior PEOPLE who practice the rituals and refuse to take a demonstrable stand against its own suffering.What is needed here for the film to be totally successful is the believability of both sides of his inner conflict. His respect for the artifacts and tradition come across as lip service, but his overwhelming overtures and monologues against the Jews come from a deep place and the superficial submission he witnesses from his his fellow clansman are riveting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off I really enjoyed the first 20 minutes or so but than it progressively got worse and less believable as it went. I thought the acting was decent but I grew to hate the messages in this movie and the way it was trying to produce propaganda that Jews are better lovers and everything and this was the reason the Nazi's hated the Jews. This is simply not true. White supremacists especially neo-nazi's like this main character would never had accepted a guy that was treating the Jewish holy documents with such respect as one of their own.Much of this film is focused propaganda about how Jews are actually superior to everyone else. Also when one of the Jewish guys said how what the Palestinians are going through are so much more different than what they went through during world war II I had to really roll my eyes on that one. On the other hand I will give this film credit for trying to delve in this subject but it failed in many ways.What really set me off was the ending. It was absolutely one of the worse endings I've ever seen in my life.</fullReview>

Yet, at the same time, he is respectful of the practices and customs of his people. What demons inside this person cause such turmoil? We see his conflict as a student when he argues theology, and then we next see him as a man beating up a another Jew. It is later we find that he is a skinhead.It just defies any explanation, and has to be seen to understand.

		<fullReview>This movie had so many ridiculously close parallels to American History X, I almost felt as though I was watching American History X at times. There was one HUGE, and I mean HUGE different, however. There was no Edward Norton. Norton made History X fly as you could just feel his anger, animosity and hatred right through the screen.Gosling did a very very nice job in The Believer and this movie has a lot alike in the sense that it's about senseless racism. However it's more directed at the Jewish community. This movie is not full of action it's mostly speeches and rhetoric and learning ways of life that you know exist but may want to know more about. I felt Gosling's pain and the director did a good job of pointing out the important aspects and turning points of Gosling's transformation from Jew hater to Jewish believer once again.If you enjoyed American History X nearly as much as I did, then this is a must rent. It gives a great view into the mind of group of senseless race haters with Gosling leading the way. My rating for this movie would have dropped had there been a different lead actor. I really like Gosling, but have seen him do better work than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the story of Danny Balint, a man who transformed himself from a religious Jewish student to one of the leaders of the Neo-Fascist political movement. It's a powerful true story of a man who was a member of the KKK, but eventually was exposed as Jewish in The New York Times. It was a critical success and won the grand-jury prize at Sundance. That alone might tell you if you'll like this movie or not.The movie is successful in one area, it's disturbing. It's not afraid of taking chances with its disturbing character profile. It takes risks, and never gives any thought to weather or not the audience may enjoy it. It just tells it like it is.But it's this exact feature that is the movie's downfall as well. Telling the movie how it is doesn't always interest the audience. The movie doesn't dwell nearly enough time developing this intriguing personality, although Ryan Gosling does his best to create a unique past without it being included in the script. As an audience member I was left empty without being able to see an explanation for this man's contradictory behavior, leaving me to wonder why the movie has a need to be seen. To some this movie may be a refreshing change from the way these type of movie's are made, but to most, this movie will end in frustration.</fullReview>

His creation seems to me like he's a Jew, he's a Danny and every Dannys problem is Ryans problem because of his grate acting. This movie is very important for me as a person who don't believe in any god and thinks that faith is just bad. I think that if you believe in God, Jesus, if you are a catholic, Jew or Amish when you'll see this movie you would be much more better in you're faith than before, but when you don't believe and hate God you'll hate him than ever before.

		<fullReview>I believe the person who commented above did not understand The Believer at all. This is not a made-for-TV "Jew becomes Nazi" movie. The scenario is almost beside the point : it is a reflection on Jewish identity, and what it means to be Jewish. At one point, you are forced to consider whether every character in the film is Jewish - even some of the Nazis. Ultimately, it asks "what is identity", and can you claim one even though identity is affected by history. It's a beautiful, beautiful film that asks how culture survives or mutates in an age of genocide and assimilation. I am an Irish American and I found it moving as well, and its questions relevant to my own family's history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should be called "The Unbelievable Nazi-sploitation Film"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film thinking it was a true story, as the cover says "inspired by actual events". Well I guess the inspiration was to make an unbelievable story about a "Jewish Nazi". The moral seems to be if you reject Judaism the only alternative is Naziism. Many Jews reject religious BS, yet don't become Nazis, they become open-minded instead. Ryan Gosling gives a powerful Tim Roth-type aggressive performance who is connected with Billy Zane's and Theresa Russell's group. Zane, who looks like a hippy in this film says, "That's why I'm a Fascist". The whole junk about bringing anti-semitism to a non-antisemitic Fascist movement makes no sense. It's like the script writer's agenda is to throw all semblance of reality out the window and show religious Jews as the true heros of the film. Even when the Neonazis are forced to listen to Holocaust survivors, one of the survivors says, "Hitler was sent by God to punish Jews for ignoring the Torah". I don't think you can get anymore religiously fanatical than that. Overall the whole thing is an ill-concieved mess.  And again it does an incredible disservice to most Jews who are non-religious, by dwelling on Neonazis vs. the Religion itself. And the logic of the main character is so irrational that he's obviously insane, though he's treated by everyone in the film as sane.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Riveting performance by Ryan Gosling playing a young man in despair.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Believer" is a paradoxical title for this film, which is about a young Jewish man who calls God a "bully". He becomes a passionate neo-Nazi, although he he himself is a Jew by birth. The title character boldly challenges his Jewish teachers and even challenges God while he is a young boy. He seems to be bitter towards his own people going so far as to suggest that they deserved the Holocaust because they didn't fight back against German oppression. His simultaneous rage and despair become more pronounced as the movie progresses. He views his own father as weak and his own schoolmates and friends as stupid for believing in God. He becomes a well respected and ruthless leader among the neo-Nazis. He insults negroes and Christians as well. The movie begins to reveal that he is having some ambivalence about a plot to blow up a synagogue, and he even warns the worshipers to get out. In obvious disillusionment, he stays in the synagogue and perishes when the bomb goes up. He seems to be challenging God even in his death. His bitterness and disillusionment were all the more tragic in this film because he was extremely intelligent and articulate.Ryan Gosling gives a riveting and amazing performance as the lead character. Enough good can't be said about the effectiveness of his performance. The film oozes quality through and through. It is not preachy or condescending. This movie somehow assumes the philosophy of the troubled young man, and is very effective in conveying thoughts and ideas of this young man who questions God. His ideas about the Jewish people and about the Jewish faith are thought provoking. In the end, it seems that the young man's argument is with God, not the Jewish people. For me personally, this movie exemplifies the hopelessness and futility of a life lived without God and without hope of forgiveness of sin through His Son Jesus the Messiah. I am fascinated with wonder by contemplating what an atheist or agnostic would think about this film, let alone how a Jewish person might react. I very strongly believe that this young man was dead wrong in his concept of the Jewish faith and Christianity and my sadness was for him, not for his ideas. Ironically, I believe he will be judged by the God that he rebelled against. I rate this highly interesting movie an 89/100 points.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ryan Gosling was very convincing in the lead role as a young Jewish man confronted by his own beliefs and the conflict he has with in himself towards the faith of his upbringing. The story centers entirely around him and the people he associates. The various groups we see him become involved, only benefiting to fuel the anger and hatred more between each other and mainly towards Jews. However, I did have a few problems while watching "The Believer" to the extent of not being able to decipher what actually the motivation was to propel this young man to the extremes he involved himself.At times I thought the storyline was quite muddled and if you don't have much knowledge of the Jewish faith (like me) it can be a difficult task to figure out the basis why all the 'hatred'. The first half of the film Gosling's character was so unrelenting. Then the 2nd half we see a glimpse of him soul searching for whatever answer he is trying to find from within himself. My rating 6/10, I would have rated it higher, but the film (I thought)lacked depth in parts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe I waited so long to write about this film. I had heard some 'Entertainment Tonight' stuff about this film before it was released (due to the Ryan Gosling character and his abrupt shift from kid's shows to this), but then I heard nothing about it until I saw it on the shelf at Blockbuster.I'm glad I picked it up! A powerful film, definitely one of the most controversial films I've seem recently. The contradiction of the main character, along with his youth and background, makes for a screen presence that will not soon be forgotten. I hope Ryan Gosling continues to do non-mainstream roles. There are so many scenes in this film that affected me in one way or another, but none more than the black &amp; white flashback scene from one of the Holocaust survivors, who told of how his young son was impaled on a Nazi bayonet and hoisted into the air. At first, the Danny character, thinking from the view of a neo-nazi, pictures himself as the bayonet-wielding Nazi. Then, as the film progresses and Danny become more conflicted as he re-embraces his Jewish heritage, he begins to picture himself as the bespectacled Jewish father who's son is being killed. Very heavy stuff. I'm glad some film makers aren't scared to make movies like this, because we need film like The Believer.&lt;spoilers&gt; The ending confused me at first. I wondered why he stayed in the temple while everyone else evacuated, but then I remembered the pledge he gave to the reporter in the restaurant, about what he would do if his true religious orientation was revealed. Then I saw the ending as being very haunting, as he runs up the never ending stairs towards....? In the director's commentary, it is interesting to note that this film was based on a true story from the '40's, I think. What surprised me was the real neo-nazi's reaction to the secret Jews' 'outing' by the press. Their response was to talk it over and work it out! The individual in question did not take that route, however. Still, very interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>He destroys the both the blameless and the wicked. When a scourge brings sudden death, he mocks the despair of the innocent. When a land falls into the hands of the wicked, he blindfolds its judges. If it is not He, then who is it? Job 9: 22-24Danny Balint is Jew who hates Jews. Why? He claims that there's no reason. Like Catullus, he says, `I hate and I love. Who can tell me why?' And just as he says that it's in the very nature of things to hate Jews, at the very moment he insists that the id rules the ego, he goes ahead and tells us why. The Jews, he believes, `love to separate things.' They're wanderers, universalists without life-affirming ties to the soil. They're obsessed, he argues, with giving pleasure, an inherent weakness that ultimately deracinates civil society. Marx, Freud, and Einstein, he believes, gave us communism, infantile sexuality, and the atom bomb. But that's not the worst of it. These are only symptoms of the disease, which boils down to this: Jewish people don't understand the true nature of their faith. Sure, they love and obey God. That's not the issue. The issue is the character (or lack thereof) of the God they believe in. Like Job, Danny thinks that the Almighty is wantonly cruel, given to unchecked paroxysms of jealous anger, and certainly not a creature of reason or justice or his well publicized love. And so Danny says that he's the only one who *does* believe in God. He's the only true believer, because he sees him for the `powerful madman that he is,' a deity who turned Abraham into a `quivering putz' by commanding him to sacrifice his own son. `And we're supposed to worship such a deity?' he asks. He hates Jews because they supposedly love this deity, this destructive madman.This film is so deep, so layered, so rich and provocative, due in part to Ryan Gosling's amazing performance, I believe this is one of the finest films ever made.

For me, it asks the question: "Is enigma an essential part of a living faith?"More than just a kind of multicultural-era prurient fantasy, "Believer" is an engaging and (potentially) informing portrait of apostasy in general.I think this film would make a great double-header with _Fiddler on the Roof_, and I'm not kidding.Special kudos to the male lead; a difficult role, played with both zest and nuance.Attention goyim: See this film and cower in fear and trembling before the might of His mystery!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The main complaint people have with this movie is that they don't "get it." They don't understand certain things about it, or they had too many unanswered questions after it was over. Well, I'm actually quite sick of people disliking a movie simply because it isn't spoon-fed to them by a director who so desperately wants to appeal to even the lowest common denominator that he or she will even wipe their audience's chins. So you don't get it...think about it...discuss it with someone who MIGHT have understood it. So you have unanswered questions...so what? Does a movie have to spell everything out in the simplest terms just so that no one will feel left out? I, for one, don't like it when a movie comes at me with the attitude of a grade school teacher, talking down to me like I'm a six year old. American History X was a great movie until it started preaching to me...then it kind of lost me. See, I get the point of the movie without the aid of PMSWV (Preachy morals for the slow-witted viewer)...so that kind of stuff turns me off.So, The Believer left some points fairly ambiguous. Yeah...so what? Since when did ambiguity become a bad thing? I don't want the answer to everything sewn up into a neat little package and dropped into my lap when the credits roll. At that point, there's nothing to think about. You just pop the tape or the DVD out of the player and pop in the next movie you rented. And if that's what you like...mindless entertainment that presents no opportunity for independent thought beyond the strict confines of its carefully laid out, all-encompassing moral perspective, then this film isn't for you.But, as someone who likes a bit of ambiguity now and again, as well as a story that I can think about afterwards...not to mention great direction and electrifying performances...I give this movie five stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You'd better believe this is a great movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As `The Believer' begins we see Danny Balint (Ryan Gosling) track down a yeshiva student, follow him off the New York subway, and beat him up. Soon thereafter we learn that Danny himself was a yeshiva student. He's a Jew who has become a Nazi skinhead. The movie follows this paradoxical and crazy situation to its violent conclusion. Along the way this movie challenges us emotionally and intellectually as few movies do. This smart Sam Fuller-eque shocker about prejudice and provocateurs not only examines anti-Semitism, but also considers Jewish self-hatred, the role of Jews in history, the nature of the Jewish God ("a power-drunk madman" and a "conceited bully,' the yeshiva Danny calls Him) and man's relationship to that God. It's a study of bigotry, but of a lot more. It's so bold emotionally and intellectually that it's exhilarating to watch, and sometimes it's so disturbing that I saw people unable to face the screen.It's commendable that anyone in this unthinking country could dare to make a movie that's this daring and forthright about ideas ? seeking to shock but for an intellectual purpose. Needless to say it's Ryan Gosling's intensity and fierce conviction that make the paradox of a Jew turned Nazi work for us ? even after, as the narrative winds down, it stops working for him. Unlike Edward Norton in the relatively shallow `American History X,' to whom he's being compared, Gosling doesn't get in the way of the dialogue by calling attention to his acting, yet he IS the movie. People tend to differ over Summer Phoenix's performance as his girlfriend. I don't know why. I think it's thoroughly real. Her own family's cult background may have given her emotional material to draw on. I can see no flaws in Theresa Russell and Billy Zane as the fascist organizer couple, either. They are just like leftist couples I have met. The trouble is that these characters can't compete with the focus on Danny and with Gosling's searing performance. We can't take our eyes off Gosling, and I don't think writer/director Henry Bean could either. Consequently he didn't give the other characters quite enough space in the script or on the screen to flesh out the movie's human, non-intellectual side. Danny's skinhead buddies are menacing, but not very three-dimensional.But it's a thrilling experience to see a movie about ideas that makes them a matter of life and death yet keeps their complexity. The paradox of Danny's existence never becomes pat. He's in constant flux. Gosling plays Danny as a young man who can beat people bloody, and then go into a living room and dazzle another group of people with his intellect, and he's equally convincing both times. Danny's violent attacks on Jewishness aren't simplified and stereotypical: they're real challenges that provoke thought.This is the best independent film to be seen this year; it blows the competition out of the water as it did last year at Sundance. But it also blew away the distributors whom September 11 made even more timid than usual. It took ten months for `The Believer' to go into limited theatrical release and its prior appearance on Showtime has robbed Ryan Gosling of the chance of an Oscar nomination. This is America. A relatively unconvincing movie like `American History X' got wide distribution, good publicity, and an Oscar nomination for its star. This considerably more thoughtful, committed ? at times downright brilliant ? movie won't get any of that. It's too intelligent and too outspoken and knows too well whereof it speaks. Even our open minded Thumbs Up TV guy feels like it might need to be censored! I didn't know till this movie that Jews have actually become Nazis and Klansmen, but I wasn't surprised to learn that filmmaker Henry Bean is a conservative Jew from Philadelphia. The conviction and validity of this movie come from knowing what Danny knows, from feeling the issues as viscerally as only a Jew can ? and from daring to speak out loud thoughts and feelings that are usually kept private. The brilliant yeshiva boy's love/hate relationship with Judaism leads him to excel in sophistry. This is in evidence when Danny tells a roomful of rich fascists that they must love Jews because Jews are `a people who will not take yes for an answer' and that accepting Jews will eliminate Jews' reason for being and force them to assimilate. Bigotry is based on ignorance but Danny argues that you must know your enemies to hate them truly. When he leads an invasion of an empty synagogue, he's shocked to realize that his skinhead buddies don't know what it means to desecrate the Torah. The movie subjects Jewish identity to cruel scrutiny. Danny denies that Israelis are Jews because they are no longer wanderers, they `have soil.' Why and how and in what sense, the movie asks, are Jews `the Chosen People'? Are they cowards because they let themselves go to the death camps? Was victimization a preconditioned choice? Could the man whose child was speared with a Nazi bayonet have fought back? Danny sneers at the Holocaust deniers as missing the point of anti-Semitism, which, for him, a self-hating Jew, is that Jews are weak and don't fight back. Jewish sufferings make him weep with rage. These are issues that are painful to confront. In this movie they hit you one after another with gut-wrenching force.Such movies don't come along very often. I wish my father, who loved thoughtful movies, sought unsuccessfully to be a Believer all his life, and was famously ambivalent about Jews, spouting anti-Semitic ideas but having Jewish colleagues as best friends, could have seen `The Believer.' Like Danny, my father suffered from massive denial, and was deeply intellectual and deeply conflicted. Like Danny, when he embraced bigotry and its practitioners he found himself in ignorant and unworthy company. This film speaks to everyone, if they'll listen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trash.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want that 99 minutes of my life back, this was the worst movie i have ever seen in my life. If you know about movies, you'd know this garbage is a waste of film. There is no dialog, no structure, no plot, no climax, NO NOTHING. This movie was all over the place and it was complete trash, The best character in the movie was SHLOMO, "Stewart" he only had 2 minutes in the movie. This movie is Jewish propaganda and it's trash, I felt like hugging Jews after i saw this movie. If anybody compares this movie to "American History X" they deserve to be shot and strangled. "American History X" is a very well written movie thats has a moral to the story, This Movie "the believer" on the other hand was complete trash. It didn't make any sense what so ever, Take my advice and don't waste your life watching this piece of garbage movie. I rather stick a knife in my stomach for entertainment, rather than touch this movie with a 10 foot poll. TRASH TRASH TRASH.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is absolute trash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie who is supposed to be about the Jewish issue, is really nothing more than an absolute waste of time, except for one or two scenes. "The Believer" is just extremely poor. The scenes with his girlfriend are perfectly superflous and should not have been there at all. The so-called fascist family are incredibly bad casted and impossible to believe that these people are fascists, or should be in a movie with this theme at all. The main character too has absolutely no credibility. I suggest you see a documentary like "Hotel Terminus: Life and Times of Klaus Barbie" or some decent fictional movie which does not exploit its audience with superflous and hard-to-watch scenes of some actor trying to appear like something from reality.  </fullReview>
