		<shortDescription>Not in top 250?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What the heck are people thinking! There are way too many Costner bashers on the internet. This was a revolutionary motion picture at its time, never has a story about the American indians ever been told with such emotion and grace. What a sham. For the record Costner is not that bad of an actor.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard for me to believe this movie is not in the top 250 on IMBD all time list. Without question my favorite movie. We live in a strange world when Pulp Fiction ranks #18, and Dances with Wolves just misses the top 250. Maybe people thought the movie was too long. I thought it was too short if anything. I wish they would have gone on forever. What an incredible story. The way Costner continued to get closer and closer to the Indians way masterfuly done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People who say this movie is long and boring have obviously never sat through, oh, "Lawrence of Arabia," "Patton," "Doctor Zhivago," "The Godfather," "Ran," "Seven Samurai," or probably even "Braveheart." Thank God that not every filmmaker believes that a car must explode every 10 seconds in order for his movie to be a success. Kevin Costner is one of those directors who prefers the long format. David Lean, Francis Coppola and Mel Gibson, to name a very few, also worked in that format, and produced lasting works of art that also packed theaters. There are plenty of options for people who don't like movies that take the time to build character, drama and suspense, movies like "Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle," "Freddy Vs. Jason," and "Weekend at Bernie's." I don't think any of those movies has ever been called "boring," but they sure are crap cinema.Onward. "Dances With Wolves" thrilled audiences way back in 1990 and made so darn much money precisely because people had forgotten the pleasures of the long narrative, the Western genre, and movies that weren't special effects schlock-fests. It remains an inspiring and moving experience, especially on DVD, which preserves the movie's theatrical sound and picture quality.Costner's direction is first-rate. He's able to blend intimate drama with big, sprawling action that covers a huge canvas. I'm amazed at how smoothly the film segues from movement to movement -- action, alienation, suspense, social commentary, romance. Heck, Spielberg could take a lesson or two from this movie.He also gets great performances out of his cast. I don't think of these people as actors, but as the characters they play. That's a compliment not just to the actors themselves, but their director. And, yes, Costner is terrific as John Dunbar.Sure, it's easy to call "Dances" politically correct w/ reference to the Indians. But it also treats them as people and, better yet, as fictional characters whose lives are made part of a fascinating narrative. I just consider all the complaints about the politics of this movie as total hogwash.Finally, the movie is beautifully shot, has an unforgettable score, and is very well-written. I've never thought of "Dances" as a Western, but a modern action picture/character study that avoids all the boring cliches of the Western genre. Here is a movie that stands for something, means something, and deserves at least as much respect as some of the overrated dreck we've gotten saddled with lately.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I love this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard for me to believe that fourteen years have passed since I first saw this movie. I was only ten at the time, and this was the first movie I ever saw that was both an eye-filling and a mind-filling spectacle. It was also one of only two theater-going experiences that I ever had with my late grandmother, and I always think of her when I watch this movie. It always takes me back to an earlier time in my life no matter how many times I see it.This is one movie that could only have been made in the post-Vietnam era, when Americans began to question the moral integrity of their country. How else to explain, in the opening sequence depicting the Civil War, the utter cynicism of the soldier who speaks with Costner's Dunbar character? Or Dunbar's later observation that "there was no dark political objective" to the Sioux battling the Pawnee? The scene in which Dunbar receives his orders from the mentally ill major also seems to speak of Vietnam, the point being I think that while an entire generation of young men was being cut down in the Civil War the West was being managed by those who were not fit for duty in the larger conflict. Maury Chaykin, in that one scene, gives one of the most memorable and haunting performances I've seen in any film.This movie's depiction of Native Americans is not nearly as politically correct as it may seem to those who watch it only once or only at a superficial level. In the very first scene depicting Indians, in fact, a Pawnee brave shoots one of the white characters full of arrows and then scalps him. The unrepentant villainy of Wes Studi's character, in particular, recalls the moral simplicity of countless earlier Westerns.Even the most sympathetic Indian character in the movie, Kicking Bird, is not kind to Dunbar merely to be friendly but because he believes he can get useful information out of the white soldier about the other whites who are encroaching on Sioux territory. The interaction between Dunbar and the Sioux is powerfully effective precisely because the Sioux remain true to themselves. They are not cartoonishly hostile like the Indians depicted in old Westerns, but they are not soft or na?ve either. While this movie draws its inspiration from American epics as diverse as The Birth of a Nation (1915) and The Searchers (1956), its originality lies not only in its respect for Native Americans but also in its intensely personal treatment of the main character. Few other three-hour epics (Lawrence of Arabia and Braveheart come to mind ) have developed their protagonists as fully and dynamically as this movie develops Costner's Dunbar character.Even after fourteen years, the Dunbar character's arc, going from a suicidal soldier in the opening sequence to an adopted Sioux who in the final scenes puts the needs of his people ahead of his own, is still one of the most remarkable I've seen in any movie. Costner's performance won no awards that I know of, but it provides the movie's indispensably tight focus. He's completely convincing every step of the way, if a bit too clumsy and self-effacing at times, hitting his head in the dark and fainting after a confrontation in a heavy-handed attempt to demystify the West.Another quality this movie shares with The Searchers is that it associates the physical challenges of the frontier with the testing of the soul. The Dunbar character cleans out the watering hole at the fort because he refuses to lose his humanity like the men before him who abandoned the fort. Later he cannot decide whether he feel more or less at home in the presence of the Sioux, because he is struggling to remain true to himself even as he remains unsure of who he is.This movie probably disappoints viewers who are looking for sheer entertainment. It's a quiet, thoughtful story, and although there is action in it the focus is on how the action transforms the characters (particularly Dunbar) rather than on the action itself. You won't see any computer-generated comic-book characters in this movie, but you will see real people having real conversations, and you'll see Costner and costar Mary McDonnell engaging in such intimate and convincing love scenes that you'll forget they're acting!If I could rate the musical score for this movie by itself I'd give it a perfect 10, because it's one of the best I've ever heard, able to stand on its own but fitting the movie like a glove. It is sentimental without being schmaltzy, noble without being pretentious. Best of all, it captures the hesitant emotions of the story, the sense of curiosity overcoming fear and becoming trust.Only this movie's extreme length works against its total success, particularly in the special edition that runs nearly four hours. The three-hour theatrical version is still long, but it's difficult to say what should have been left out of it.Some people still resent the fact that Costner won the Best Director Oscar over Scorcese's Goodfellas. There's no question that Scorcese is the better director, but I believe the direction of Dances With Wolves is better than that of Goodfellas. If you disagree with me try this test: imagine that Scorcese did this movie, and Costner directed Goodfellas. It's a question of which directing job is better, not which director is better.Unlike most epics, this movie ends exactly as it should. The final images, such as the journal floating down the river, the white man and the Native American speaking English to each other, and the brave shouting his farewell from the top of a cliff, are so beautiful and dreamlike that they manage to be both joyful and sad. This is a movie that looks into the very fabric of this country's past, and asks us to do the same.Rating: 10 (Good job, everybody.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story of a lost way of life.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Dances With Wolves'When I first saw the movie Dances With Wolves several years ago the story affected me in a heavy way, so much so that I decided that it would be a long time before I watched it again. The story is not entertainment. It is a lesson. Last week I watched the movie again with a new understanding. Many of the published reviews seem to dislike the movie for various reasons. They are the ones that missed the point of the story.The story is, of course, fiction based on a novel by Michael Blake. Fortunately, Michael Blake also wrote the screenplay for the movie insuring fidelity with his vision. To the credit of Kevin Costner, who was one of the producers and the director, he allowed the story to be what Michael Blake had originally created. Costner showed great sensitivity in not only capturing the personalities of all the major characters, but making the land itself (in this case South Dakota) one of the major players.The land was not just a backdrop or playing field. It was the main character and very much alive. The cinematography was some of the best I've ever seen and in the tradition of the great movie director, John Ford. Ford had an ability to present the land in all its beauty, which also just happened to have a story occurring on it.In Dances With Wolves, the land of South Dakota might initially appear to be a bleak place, but as Lieutenant Dunbar (Costner) spends more time at his isolated fort, he somehow slowly merges his soul with the surrounding territory. The life on the land eventually stumbles onto his location, including a wolf and a tribe of Sioux. The Sioux and Dunbar mistrust each other initially but through curiosity learn how to communicate with each other, however painfully slow. The wolf too was curious about the soldier, but kept his distance for a while. Finally, the wolf trusts Dunbar enough to play with him on the prairie. The Sioux see them playing. Here was a white man not killing the animals. He had earned a new name: Dances-With-Wolves.The main difference between this movie and a John Ford movie was the way Costner humanized the Sioux characters. In a John Ford movie, most Indians were the enemy. The only 'good' Indians were the cavalry scouts, but we never really met these scouts as people. John Ford hired Navaho people to play the parts of Indians in his cavalry trilogy, Fort Apache, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon and Rio Grande, which were filmed in Monument Valley on the Navaho Reservation. Years later, Ford attempted to humanize the Native Americans in a movie called Cheyenne Autumn, but by then Ford was an old man and had lost most of his creative genius. It is a hard movie for me to watch.Costner's movie takes great pains to allow us to know the Sioux characters. The story is about them as seen through the eyes of a perceptive white man, who had been given a new life by the gods when his attempt at suicide ended with his recognition as a war hero.What I see when I watch the movie: I see ten thousand years of evolution and experience of a human tribe on the North American continent with the most recent characters at the leading edge of the current (1860) time. The character's lives are so well presented that I sense the history of their past In other words, I understand why they do what they do. What depresses me about the movie is that I know the ending but the characters don't. I know that their natural way of life is coming to an end. The characters don't know. To me, the movie is a story of the 4 billion, six hundred million years of natural evolution which is about to meet technology. Technology will be as devastating to this tribe and the land as if an asteroid had hit the earth.The beauty of the Sioux life is so precisely shown in this movie. Their everyday routine of just living off the land is seen the same way as a buffalo eating the grass. The Sioux adapted to the land the way it was. You see the grass move in waves like the ocean does when the invisible winds touch the surfaces. You see the effects of the same winds that blow across the face and hair of Stands-With-a-Fist. You hear the same winds. The same winds take the smoke from the lodges away from the village. The land and air and life merge in a poetic movement.The horses seem more natural and free in their herd next to the village. They are part of the tribe. You can see the magnificence of the Sioux riders as they become one with the horse as they hunt the buffalo. I suppose, in a way, the horse was a step in technology for the Sioux since they didn't have the horse until the Spanish Conquistadors brought them. But when they adapted their life to the horse, they became a great people. I look at it as a step in evolution, not a step in technology.We find that the holy man, Kicking-Bird, played by Graham Green, was a hen-pecked husband, something we can all identify with no matter what race or ethnic group. His wife saw more than he did, especially the budding love between Lieutenant Dunbar and Stands-With-a-Fist, who was played by the heavy-duty stage actress Mary McDonnell. She is important to our story because we understand the Sioux from her translations. As an actress, she was so convincing in her struggle to remember long forgotten English words from her childhood, from the time before she came to live with the Sioux. Kicking-Bird on the other hand represented the soul of the Sioux People. He was patient and was the type of person you would want as a friend.We have Rodney Grant playing the part of Wind-in-His-Hair, the warrior who was quick to anger but was smart enough to listen to his elders and not kill the white soldier. Rodney Grant represented the beauty and pride of the Sioux People. He speaks the last relevant words in the story by proclaiming that he is the friend of Dances-With-Wolves. Before Dunbar became Dances-With-Wolves, Wind-in-His-Hair would have been happy to kill him.`Red Crow' Westerman played the part of the chief, Ten-Bears. We've seen him play the part of a shaman in other movies. He represented the wisdom and of the Sioux People and was also their prophet.What movie about Native Americans could be told without Wes Studi? In this movie he plays the enemy Pawnee so convincingly that you really hate him. Not only is he the enemy to the white man but the Sioux also. Wes Studi can be very intense in his savagery, but in the eyes of the Pawnee, he was only protecting his tribal interests.So we see the Sioux and, to a lessor degree, the Pawnee in their soon-to-end natural states. We immediately feel at home with the Sioux. The Pawnee aren't quite as lovable, especially when we see Wes Studi scalping the muleskinner. The first disturbing scene is when the Pawnee attack the Sioux village and we see that to save themselves, the Sioux need the technology (the rifles) of the white soldier. The Pawnee were so fierce looking (again convincingly by Wes Studi) that we fear for the Sioux tribe but see that the rifles are out of place in this natural world. It is another technological step in the same magnitude as the horse. But for all their beauty and greatness, we know they cannot win the final battles with the white civilization because they are so grossly outnumbered.There is the core of the problem. The over-population of the modern civilization overruns their own land so they come to the land of the Sioux and destroy without asking. You could see it in the face of every tribal member as they walked past dead and skinned buffalo which were left to rot in the sun after the buffalo hunters had skinned them for their hides. They were absolutely stunned and sick at the sight. Whoever did this had no soul. I extend the message of this movie to today and see population running amuck, stripping the land of resources and changing the atmosphere. It is too painful to contemplate.To emphasize the loss and waste of the beautiful prairie life, near the end of the movie we see the soldiers shooting at the wolf for fun. The wolf is confused and doesn't understand that bullets are hitting near him. Eventually a bullet strikes the wolf and we hear him cry out. For me that was the most painful scene of all because I know that's what people do. I see people kill a beast for the trophy. They take it home and hang it on the wall. The soul of that animal has been cast aside by a human, which has no soul.The beauty is not in the trophy. The beauty is in the life. The ending for the wolf represents the ending for the Sioux and all the other tribes that lost the natural way of life. Therefore I am just as disturbed for the Sioux as I am about the wolf. I am disturbed for the future of the Earth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spectacular epic and one of the greatest 90's movie classics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the type of a film that's never boring no matter how often you watch it. It deserved every single award it got. It's touching, it's timeless and it's downright beautiful. I'm not a huge friend of extended versions because there's usually a perfectly good reason to take something out of the film and none whatsoever to put it back again, if pleasing hardcore fans isn't a good reason - that's totally a matter of opinion. However, "Dances with wolves" is certainly an exception.The nearly four hour version is the only one to be. Sure it sounds like it's too much but when you watch the movie it doesn't look a minute overlong and cutting even a second out of it would seem like a horrible crime. The original theater version was 52 minutes shorter which sound too cruel to be true. I mean really, what's there to cut? If you haven't seen "Dances with wolves" yet you have missed one of the greatest motion picture experiences of the 90's and you should do something about it instantly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like to watch lots of films, pretty much any film in fact, therefore I can tell you i have seen a fair few duds. I have also seen some spectacularly brilliant films. Dances With Wolves is one of them. For me to have the patience to watch a film more than a couple of times then the film needs to make me want to watch it over and over. Let me tell you I have seen this film more than a few times. I think you know when a film is special to you when you watch it and you keep thinking to yourself "oh this scene coming up is great", if you can say that continually whilst watching a film then you know you are watching a great film.As for the film itself, cinematography has never been bettered, Costners acting is OK but it his presence rather than his acting that has brought gravitas to his movies, you certainly cant argue with his directing, which along with Orson Wells, Tarantino and a few select others must rank alongside as one of the best directorial debuts. The supporting cast is excellent especially Graeme Greene who is the wonderful Kicking Bird and of course Rodney A Grant.I shamefully dont know too much about the history of the Indian population in America, so I dont know whether the events or portrayals in the film are accurate, however artistic license is surely allowed when making what is first and foremost a piece of entertainment. Being British I have seen many an American film with British stereotypes, not once have I been offended or appalled, as I see them as interpretations, God knows British filmmakers are just as guilty of such generalisations when it comes to "foreign" characters.Marvel at the wonderful film-making in this film not political inaccuracies after all this is a story, and a damn fine one at that, remember King Kong didnt really climb up the Empire State Building and you dont here gorillas complaining about being misrepresented. This is a point of view expressed in a great film.Personally films dont get much better than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lt. Dunbar's worst fears have come true.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a sweeping epic that you'll never forget whether you liked it or not. It tells the tale of love, loyalty, friendship, and self-realization in a magnificent setting among a great people, and during a time of strife. This film put Kevin Costner on the map as a Hollywood star. He could use a hit like this one right about now.The first thing a viewer is struck by is the amazing landscape of western South Dakota. If any of you have never been out that way, do your self a favor and check it out. It will blow you away. The musical score is also very beautiful. The Indians look so authentic that they almost blend into the scenery even as we get to know them as individuals. It's hard to imagine that Plains Indian culture could have been depicted more realistically.The story deals with Lt. John Dunbar (Costner), a disillusioned Civil War vet who asks to be transferred to a western post so he can see the west "before it's gone". He is then sent to a deserted fort where he finds himself in the precarious position of being the only white man in a land of Indians who seem intent on stealing his horse. He decides to try to get to know the local Sioux tribe and eventually becomes one of them. In finding a place in their society, he finds himself, so to speak.Dances With Wolves is a very good film. I think it belongs in the top 250 to be sure. It is a little slow at times, but so what? A lot of great films are. Other than Dunbar, there are really no positive white characters. This is understandable considering the subject matter, but the barbarism of some of the soldiers seemed a little over the top. Other than that, no real gripes.For me, the most memorable scene was when Dunbar and Kicking Bird were discussing the number of whites who would be coming into the territory.Dunbar: You've often wondered about how many white people will be coming. There will be a lot, my friend.Kicking Bird: (in English) How many?Dunbar: Like the stars. It makes me afraid for all of the Sioux.Unfortunately, this fear has come true. All one has to do is drive out to White Clay, Neb. and see them sitting there. Along the street. Drunk by mid morning. The descendants of people like Kicking Bird and Wind in His Hair. These men would have been out hunting buffalo or battling with their enemies 150 years ago. Now, there is nothing for them to do. They have two choices: Stay on the reservation and live out a life in poverty while keeping their traditions alive, or try to make it in the cities and cast off their traditional ways. A tough choice to be sure. Watch the movie Thunderheart to get an idea of what these reservations are like. It's not a pretty picture.The destruction of Indian Culture was not the goal of the United States. It is merely a CONSEQUENCE of the idea of Manifest Destiny. The Sioux are a magnificent people. What has happened to them could be summed up in one word: tragic. 10 of 10 starsSo sayeth the Hound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Native American Film Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is certainly one of the finest films out of Hollywood in recent years. It accuratly shows how "The White People" ran roughshod over the native americans and eventually took everything they had (their land, buffalo, etc.). The end of the film is heartbreaking where it says on screen that the Indians and the Horse culture were "passed into history." I suggest every history teacher show this film in their classes so future generations can see what a proud race of people the native americans are, and what we did to them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dances with Wolves is a great movie, make no mistake about that, Kevin Costner had lighting in a bottle. Costner has not come close to movie success since wolves. The cast is excellent, Kicking Bird, Stands with Fist, Wind in his Hair and my quiet favorite smiles a lot, smiles a Lot had trouble with growing up and becoming a brave, until it is forced on him, his mood after he has killed the first time is priceless. Some people say Dances with Wolves was an anti white movie, that is total bull, it tells the true story the way few movies have of the cruelty of the white people. People don't want to admit this movie is a true telling of the way white people treat other races and nature. It is a hard movie to digest.It is a hard movie to admit the truth. The other thought is a lot of movie fans want car chases and explosions. If a movie is thoughtful, it is labeled boring. Dances is one of the top 15 movies of all time. 9 out of 10 stars. Dances with wolves I am wind in his hair Do you see that I am your friend? Can you see that you will always be my friend?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best film of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people regard a lot of films as "top class" but I always keep a little shelf in my mind for the films that I regard as the best films of all time - films that are simply timeless masterpieces. Welcome to the top of that shelf! There are certain criteria by which films are judged and greatness is only obtained when all the criteria are satisfied in full. Dances with Wolves is the greatest timeless masterpiece of cinema to date because it satisfies all these criteria: 1) Cinematography: the sweeping landscape photography of the Frontier combined with the subtle night-time photography earns top marks. Aside from Oscars for Cinematography and editing, it also won the ASC award for Outstanding achievement in Cinematography - as well as a host of other industry recognition awards. In short - the cinematography is breathtaking.2) Sound/Score: the score is one of the best ever written. Again, awards rained from the sky for magical and moving score that combined seamlessly with the film/story.3) Screenplay: The dialogue and plot is magnificent. The film does not fall into the common plot formulas found in other films that attempt to pass themselves off as epics. The story combines as both of celebration of life and a somber rumination of the history of mankind.There are comical moments, dramatic moments and tear-jerking moments - that all make their entry (and exit) into the story with flawless timing.4) The Acting: for all that has been said about Kevin Costner, this was the peak of his career and he played the role of John Dunbar to perfection. A relatively unknown band of actors gave magnificent, heart-felt and down-to-earth performances in support. It was actually refreshing to see an "EPIC" where the producers didn't feel the need to throw famous actors in with cameo roles to improve it marketability. As far as I was concerned, there were no weak links in the chain on the acting side of things. Kevin Costner certainly proved his worthiness as a director by getting the best out of the cast.5) The ONLY film in history to.... Have an extended (director's cut) version that was better than the original. Due to concerns about the length of the film, Dances with Wolves was stripped back to three hours. Some complained that it was still too long, but I thought that the film was patient - it included good relevant detail but managed to keep the story moving at a good pace. The director's cut added an hour to the cinematic release and was, without a doubt, better than the original. It somehow added more intrigue to the story and included many sobering insights into the destruction of the American Indian race.Over all, I regard it as the greatest most masterful epic of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A magnificent tribute for a culture lost over time?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dances With Wolves" is another great period piece that I can watch at least once a year, never tiring of the western frontier against mesmerizing setting and John Barry's Oscar-winning stirring music? The motion picture is told through the words and experiences of a civil war soldier, Lieutenant John Dunbar, and Costner makes it an intensely spiritual journey which challenges the individual in so many ways?After his suicidal and successful ride on the battlefield, Lt. Dunbar accidentally leads Union troops to victory against the Confederates? He is allowed to select his own reassignment? John opts to retreat into the wilderness, to the furthest frontier, where both the Sioux and Pawnee Indians still rule?The film perfectly captures the finest kind of American audacity when Costner rides out alone in the Lakota plains, wearing full dress uniform and holding the large American flag to formally introduce himself to his Sioux neighbors? and the worst of America, the cruelty exercised by the army when it's found he's a Yankee soldier turned Indian and arrested as a traitor? But it's the gentle humor and intimate moments of the movie which give Costner's ambitious epic Western its special flavor: scenes with Dunbar and his wild wolf Two Socks not daring, at first, to eat from his hand; his funny first encounter with a peaceful man Kicking Bird (Graham Greene); his love story with a stolen white woman living with the tribe called Stands With a Fist (Mary McDonnell); his relationship with a fierce impulsive warrior Wind in His Hair (Rodney A. Grant); and many others as Black Shawl (Tantoo Cardinal) advising her husband on affairs of the heart?With its share of bow-and-arrow fights, joyous buffalo hunts, and unprecedented tender feelings for the American Indians, "Dances With Wolves" remains an amazing accomplishment and a magnificent tribute for a culture lost over time?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most beautiful movie ever made. And it is from Kevin Costner...........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can honestly say I have seen the face of beauty on screen, and it is in the form of the European version of "Dances with Wolves", an ethereal work of art that entrances, touches, inspires, and holds you in its grasp of angelic magnificence. If there is an afterlife for films, this would go straight to the pearly gates. Kevin Costner and his creative team are saints of modern film-making. Against all odds, they created a challenging, beautiful movie about a dark period in American history. And the movie, with its statements apparent, never shifts left or right, for which we are all truly thankful. It is a story, plain and simple. They would never make a movie this slow today. They'd never make a movie with this kind of character and story development today, either. The only thing that comes any where near close is the "Lord of the Rings" films. This is the best period movie, history movie, and Western all rolled into one. Make no mistake about it, the best film of the nineties is not just a flick, it will restore your faith in films for a long time. Unfortunately, after seeing "Waterworld", it won't restore your faith in Kevin Costner. It would take another "Dances With Wolves" to do that, and since "Dances With Wolves" is a perfect film, that would be impossible. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A not-so-average Western that still does the trick after so many years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dances with Wolves" is hated by quite a lot of people. Is it perhaps because the Indians aren't depicted as the bad guys for once or is it because this isn't the usual Western in which you'll not find a justification for the slaughtering of the Indians? Is it because it is very long or is it because Kevin Costner is in it? I don't know, but I do know it is very cool to dislike everything he has done, but I'm not following the masses. I can still think for myself and I must say that, even though the man has done some bad projects (for instance "Waterworld"), this movie is absolutely one of his best.The movie starts with showing us a wounded Lieutenant John Dunbarr (Kevin Costner) who is about to have his leg amputated. Because he wants to keep it, he decides to flee and go back to his troops. Than he does something stupid. He takes a horse and starts running in front of the rebel front line, but doesn't get hit once. His troops, overwhelmed by so much 'bravery' all jump up and start fighting again and eventually win the battle. Because a general has seen what happened, Dunbarr gets the honor of having his wounds being treated by the general's surgeon, who saves his leg. Now that he feels better again, he asks to be send to a remote outpost in the West. Arriving there, he finds himself in the middle of the wilderness, all alone and surrounded by hostile Sioux. His only companion is his horse and an old wolf that he calls Two-socks. Gradually he gets accepted by the tribe, where he is known as "Dances with Wolves" and falls in love with "Stands With a Fist", a white woman who had been adopted as a young girl and was raised by the tribe. But while he is living with the Indians, the West is very fast being conquered and one day he finds new troops in his camp and even though he is an American soldier, he is seen as a traitor.I've always had a weak spot for the not-so-average Western, so when this movie first came out I was already a fan. Now, so many years after it was first shown, this is still one of the best Westerns ever. I like the fact that it shows the Indians not as savages, but as normal, loving people who only defended what was rightfully theirs. I like the fact that the movie isn't sugar sweet, but shows every detail very realistically. I even like the fact that the soldiers are seen as the bad guys for once. Add to this some very good acting and directing and an interesting story and you know you've got something special. This is a very good movie that should be seen by everybody. I give it an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Moving and Superbly Made Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like most of the commentators here, I found "Dances With Wolves" to be a moving and superbly made movie. Others have eloquently talked about the wonderful music and score, the very real script, and excellent acting, so there is no need for me to elaborate. But another element of the movie that I found even more notable is its depiction of Native Americans as individuals with feelings, honorable if at the same time frequently peculiar customs, and as human beings with human urges and impulses. What a refreshing contrast to all of the pablum and nonsense that has been the staple of Hollywood and its treatment of "injuns" over the years.So it comes as no surprise that some of the criticisms here come from people who believe the movie is anti-white or anti-army or glorifies Native Americans. But I believe these comments completely miss the mark. First off, Costner in the movie himself portrays an army figure--the movie is trying to show that not all people in the army are beasts. This is again brought out by the young leader of the troops attempting to arrest Costner and bring him back to trial; this soldier is depicted as a fair and honest young man put in a difficult spot.Perhaps one of the reasons for the shortsightedness of some of the movie critics is their lack of understanding of the terrible plight faced by native Americans and the awful, holocaust-like consequences of the policy that was known as "Indian Removal." And yes, I am a professor who knows something about the subject and who uses this film in class (and I am not afraid to admit it). Please have a look at "As Long as Grass Grows or Water Runs" a chapter in Howard Zinn's famous book, "A People's History of the United States." It uses many primary sources to describe exactly what happened; the phrase, by the way, was a promise made by Andrew Jackson (later President Jackson) to Cherokee Indians if they would relocate (a promise later broken, of course). Jackson, by the way, refused to enforce a court order from the Supreme Court in the case of Worcester v. Georgia involving an individual sentenced to prison for questioning the legitimacy of laws repressing the Cherokees. Jackson also fought the Creeks killing hundreds of them and later boasted, "the truth is, the (Creeks) did not respect the power of the United States...We bleed our enemies in such cases to give them their senses." From 1814 to 1824, Jackson was instrumental in fashioning a series of treaties that deprived Indians of over 3/4 of Alabama and Florida, one-third of Tennessee, one-fifth of Georgia and Mississippi, and parts of Kentucky and North Carolina. These treaties were little more than land grabs and Jackson is widely known to have practiced extensive bribery and other dirty tricks in securing them. At the same time, Jackson and his friends and relatives received many patronage appointments as land agents, traders etc (I guess he would have gotten along well with Dick Chenney and Bush) and of course, he and his friends bought up much of this land that became suddenly available.Another good source for what happened to the Indians is the eyewitness account of a soldier who served in the mounted infantry. John G. Burnett in 1890 published his reminiscences, "The Cherokee Removal through the Eyes of a Private Soldier". "I was sent as interpreter into the Smoky Mountain Country in May, 1838, and witnessed the execution of the most brutal order in the History of American Warfare. I saw the helpless Cherokees arrested and dragged from their homes, and driven at the bayonet point into the stockades. And in the chill of a drizzling rain on an October morning, I saw them loaded like cattle or sheep into 645 wagons and started toward the West." This evokes images not unlike those showing S.S. officers putting Jews in railroad cars. "At this time, 1890," continues Burnett, "we are too near the removal of the Cherokees for our young people to fully understand the enormity of the crime that was committed against a helpless race. Truth is, the facts are being concealed from the young people of today." Burnett later describes the "streams of blood that flowed in the Indian country in the summer of 1838" and the "4000 silent graves that mark the trail of the Cherokees to their exile", again very much like a World War II death march. So what I find shocking about "Dances With Wolves" is that it shows, to a great extent, the brutality of the conflict between "settlers" from one civilization, and the people who already lived on the land. This stands as a testament to Costner and his willingness to take this brave position. It is precisely because this subject has become taboo and because most Americans haven't a clue as to their own history, because their image of America is similar to Pleasantville (before colorization), that many people find this movie revolting and unacceptable. Hence, they prefer to shoot the messenger of the "bad" news-- Costner.Finally, as others have pointed out, the movie does not glorify all Native Americans. It shows that there is a spectrum of behavior amongst them, and also shows that many of their customs (eating fresh meat from just-killed animals, for example) are shocking and barbaric to us today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring? Nah. Long live Dances With Wolves!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lt. John Dunbar wants to see the frontier before it's gone, so he by one heroic event has the chance to choose his post anywhere he wants. He chooses his post to be at a very remote location, far from towns and forts. During the time he spends there, he befriends with Indians, thus learning to value the way of life of the Indians.Four hours long, very much narration and no car-exploding scenes or people getting killed, what is this? It is what infidels call boring. Nope, this is one of the best movie I've ever seen (stands at my top 10 list).The way Costner befriends with Indians is believable and also interesting to watch. Some people here have been complaining about the coincidence of an American woman being at the Indian camp who teaches Dunbar Sioux / Lakota (don't know the correct term for the language, sorry) and the rather female-gendered speech all the actors have omitted. It doesn't matter, at least if you don't know how to speak Lakota, it still sounds very good and believable. The actors speaking Lakota truly brings authenticity, and I really think it was worthwhile.This movie is pure excellent. Costner's direction and John Barry's soundtrack are both really good. The movie being four hours long, I thought I would be quite tired after the movie. I wasn't. Never have I been following anything so keenly for four hours than this movie, and never has a life of an individual man been so interesting to watch.Dances With Wolves is for the favor of American natives, which I think is really good, for often Indians are depicted as the bad guys. This time the situation has been reversed; white-colored are the bad guys and Indians the good guys. Such radical division doesn't fit this movie though, because there are "bad" Indians as well. But still, clearly being Indian-oriented, it stands for their favor.The scene of Two Socks' end made me furious. Excellent movie, I would recommend this to everyone.My first movie review ever by the way, I think it shows</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best movies ever. The scenery with the characters and the fantastic music is overwhelming. One difference between this and other movies is also that the camera often is more away from the characters or the plot. So you know that what you see is exactly what is happening. That's why it feels all real: Real Sioux, real fights. You never have the feeling of missing something due to fast cutting and closeups. It's hard for me to believe this movie is not in the top 250 on IMDb all time list. Without question my favorite movie. We live in a strange world when Pulp Fiction ranks #18, and Dances with Wolves just misses the top 250.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is the trail of a true human being. I think you are on this trail and it is good to see.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dances With Wolves Is directed by Kevin Costner who also stars. It's adapted by Michael Blake from his own novel of the same name. Starring along side Costner are Graham Greene, Mary McDonnell &amp; Rodney A. Grant. Dean Semler provides the cinematography &amp; John Barry the musical score. Set during the American Civil War, the story tells how Lieutenant John Dunbar (Costner) goes to a military outpost on the American frontier, where confronted with alienation he befriends nature, the Lakota Indians and finds himself in the process."I had never known a people so eager to laugh, so devoted to family, so dedicated to each other. And the only word that came to mind was harmony"The critics were rubbing their hands with glee, getting ready to tear Costner apart for what undoubtedly would be a failure. An epic Western movie made in 1990, had he not learnt from Heaven's Gate? It was long in production, and with only a $15/$22 million budget afforded it, word came that Costner had to put in $3 million of his own cash to aid production. It was beset with production delays as the problems mounted up with the weather, animal training and with action scenes taking up to three weeks to shoot, all contributing to the belief that it was doomed to failure. "Kevin's Gate" they cried, what's that? It's partially sub-titled too? Never work.Dances With Wolves went on to make $424 million in Worldwide theatre tickets alone. Heaven knows what the total would be if we added the VHS &amp; DVD returns as well! Come Academy Award time the film won 7 Oscars, including Best Picture (making it the first Western to win the prestigious award since Cimarron in 1931) &amp; Best Director. It was also nominated in five other categories with Costner up for Best Actor, Graham Greene for Best Supporting Actor &amp; Mary McDonnell for Best Supporting Actress. It was, all told, a personal, artistic and commercial triumph for Costner. One can see him post Oscar night sitting there on his porch sipping sour mash and flipping the finger at all those critics who willed him to fail.Costner's movie is a simple tale, of that there is no arguing. But Dances With Wolves (the name given to Dunbar by the Sioux) is magnificently told, as enchanting a Western that has ever been made. It boasts everything needed to make a first class Oater. The story may be simple but it's rich on detail, the characters have real depth and it never sags, not even in its magnificent elongated directors cut that runs 236 minutes. The credit has to go to Costner, who in his debut as director lest we forget, has managed to blend everything together in the style of one of the old masters from the classic Western period. Every tonal avenue ventured down pays off handsome rewards, it all goes somewhere, awash with wistfulness, romanticism and elegiac poetry. The action sequences are expertly crafted, with a buffalo hunt particularly breath taking; no CGI here, the odd animatronic for a close encounter, but mainly the real deal, as are the wolves and the Lakota Sioux, too, who are played by Native Americans. Its humorous too, with its fun being intentional and aiding the flow of the friendships forming.As most Western fans will tell you, a lyrical horse opera needs great location work and a score to match. Thankfully Dances With Wolves has both, as both Semler &amp; Barry produce work that picked up the Golden Baldy on Oscar night. Lensed predominantly in South Dakota around the Black Hills &amp; Badlands regions, Semler infuses the film with natural landscapes that send the frontier bursting thru the screen, his framing explains things better than words can in this environment. While Barry's score, lifting nicely from A View To A Kill at times, is suitably grand, deft in touch for the main theme and blood pumping for the buffalo hunt and the Pawnee attacks. Acting wise the award nominations received for Costner, Greene &amp; McDonnell were richly deserved. The boys are quiet and undemonstrative, at one with the essence of the story and infusing it with a sincerity so lacking in many epics. Playing Stands With A Fist, a white woman raised by the Sioux after her family were slaughtered when she was a child, McDonnell has to reach different character levels as the story unfolds, and she delivers emotional depth on every level. No nomination for Grant, but his work is top dollar also, his latter scenes with Costner really nail the shift in tone.There's some historical missteps that will no doubt annoy the purists, like I don't believe the Pawnee were the aggressors they are painted as here. While the central romance between Costner &amp; McDonnell is delicate but not fully formed; tho it does improve in the directors cut. But it's hard to criticise little itches when such vision and ambition comes together as well as it does here. Structured with precision and showing respect for tradition, this is a movie about loving people for people lovers. And one can quite easily believe that some genre legends up in the sky were looking down and nodding approvingly. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Hymn Of Self-Praise From The Enlightened Saints Of Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a preposterous movie! From the very first, every Union soldier is a dolt, stupid, vain or cowardly. The Confederates are yahoos. Only Costner's Lieutenant is an Enlightened One. No wonder the Hollywood crew loved this cliché ridden rubbish; badly written, badly acted, badly shot (like a TV movie) with bathetic music that telegraphs messages along with the anvil necessary to deliver its sordid point on the heads of mindless audience members. The narration is delivered with a deadpan and passionless voice that sounds like something that has long been drowned in deep water.I think I liked Costner once. Yes, it was in "Tin Cup" where he played a bone-headed golfer without an ounce of subtlety or common sense but, with plain hard work "gets there" if you consider being a loser getting there. Who knew that Costner really is Roy McAvoy, shooting, shooting, shooting to get that ball on the 18th green, never laying up but going straight for the hole with blinders on.A wonderful self-congratulatory hug from all the people in Hollywood to all the people in Hollywood. Kiss-kiss. How do I look? Make-up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horribly Biased, But A Memorable, Entertaining Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I got caught up in Kevin Costner's manipulation, too, until I did some research and found out that this movie is a bunch of baloney. Nonetheless, except for the smaller beginning and ending segments, the long one in the middle with "Dances With Wolves" and his relationship to the Sioux Indians and his romance to "Stands With A Fist" (Mary McDonnell) is enjoyable to watch. It's also a visual feast, stunning in parts such as the Buffalo stampedes.The version you want to watch is the extended DVD one. Other good points besides the cinematography and three likable main characters, two mentioned above and Grahame Green ("Kicking Bird") The Indians' dialog is interesting throughout the film and McDonnell is outstanding in her role. Her romance with Costner is one of the best I've seen in a film.What makes the film click is that combination of drama/romance/action and even some necessary humor.What was unnecessary, and the bad part of the film, is the extreme bias shown in here where all the white soldiers (except our hero) are sleazy, profane, cruel or insane - every one of them!! Talk about prejudice! Also, if you do any history checking, you'll find the Indians portrayed in actuality were anything but the generally nice people shown in this film. The truth is that they were one of the more bloodthirsty tribes...one of the worst of the Southwest. It's pathetic to read some of these reviews from such naive reviewers who have no clue of the truth, or perhaps they don't want to hear it. Costner is famous for this sort of thing in his films....but they are so entertaining, people don't bother check his claims.The cruelty, bias and some uncomfortable scenes with bloody animals, don't always make this a pleasant movie to watch no matter what side of the PC table you're on...but, overall, it's a memorable, gorgeous film that digs deep inside you. A cliché, true, but it's one you don't forget, even if it's incredibly Liberal biased.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome Old West Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is to inform Matthew of NJ and others who continually bash this masterpiece that Dances With Wolves covered sacred ground. The western had long been forgotten in the movie kingdom. Kevin Costner single handedly brought it back---and brought it to life with flare, style, perfection, and beauty. He won Best Director in his first attempt at directing. That says it all. His vision into the past is like opening a book and reading the tale just as it was transcribed from one human to another. Imagine how Kevin must've felt riding horses amidst real buffalo, real Native American Indians, upon the open plains just as it was done 100 years ago. Put yourself in his boots. I guarantee you'd feel the exact same way he felt while making it, and the exact way I feel every time I watch it. There are none better, and nothing else can compare to Dances With Wolves. It deserved all 12 Oscars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Avatar": making "Dances With Wolves" look good since 2009</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Avatar" vs "Dances With Wolves". Round One. Fight! 1. Sam Worthington and Kevin Costner both play soldiers. Worthington comes across as a brain dead jar-head, whilst Costner's character is a bit more complex, at once naive, disillusioned, smart and funny. One point to Costner.2. Both films utilise extensive voice over narration. Costner's is better written. One more point to Costner.3. Cameron was an experienced director when he made "Avatar" and should have known better. Costner, in contrast, was young, inexperienced and on debut. One point to Costner for being a directorial virgin.4. "Avatar" was a zillion dollar enterprise. Costner partially financed this movie himself and based it on a script by a broke guy who slept in his house. One point to Costner's film for having a low carbon footprint.5. Both films have heroes who abandon a technologically superior race and "go native" by joining an alien tribe. In "Wolves", the tribe is slow to embrace the white hero. In "Avatar", Cameron cheats by making his hero "prophecised by the planet"; they have to embrace him. One point to Costner for not trying to rip off George Lucas' "Force".6. "Avatar" looks like a video game. One point to "Wolves" for not looking like "Avatar"7. "Wolves", though stupid, is filled with nuance, subtle details and quiet moments. "Avatar" bashes our heads with everything. One point to Costner for not damaging our heads.8. "Avatar" has horses with six legs whilst "Wolves" has horses with 4 legs. One point to Costner for not making stupid crap up.9. Costner's film emphasises the communication barriers between the natives and the hero, albeit clunkily. In "Avatar", communication issues are quickly brushed aside. One point to "Wolves".10. Cameron's film doesn't show much of the customs or daily activities of the natives. One point to Costner.11. Costner is embraced by the tribe after taming a wolf, rescuing a woman and hunting buffalo. Worthington is embraced by the tribe after riding a dragon. Dragon's are stupid. One more point to Costner.12. Colonialists are portrayed as one-dimensional villains in both films. In Costner's film, however, these villains only appear during a brief climax. One point to Costner for serving less crap.13. Both films portray the natives in a romantic, "noble savage" fashion. In "Wolves", however, the tribe is shown at war with rival tribes and massacres a white homestead. This does not quite counteract the sentimental portrayal of the natives throughout the rest of Costner's picture, but on the flip side, "Wolves" has the arduous task of revising 80 years of racist cinematic portrayals of Native Americans. "Avatar", in comparison is...well it's just stupid. One more point to Costner.14. The natives in "Wolves" belong to the Sioux tribe. The natives in "Avatar" are at once Native Indians, Rastafarians, Africans, hippies, Smurfs, cats, aliens, Disney creatures and Egyptians. One point to Costner for offending less races.15. The characters in Costner's film have cool symbolic names like "Stands with Fist". In "Avatar", we have symbolic names like Navi (naive), Selfridge (selfish), Grace Augustine (possesses grace like St Augustine?), Pandora (trouble when opened) and Sully (he's tainted). One point to Costner for not being Cameron.16. Cameron's film has unimaginative action scenes. "Wolves" has no real action scenes. It's more of a tone poem, and aesthetically thwarts genre expectations. One more point to Costner.17. The first five decades of cinema portrayed native American Indians in an incredibly racist fashion. "Broken Arrow" was the first film to rectify this, before revisionist westerns began to appear in the 1970s, with masterpieces like Altman's "Buffalo Bill", "Ulzana's Raid", "Hombre" and marginally interesting films like "A Man Called Horse", "Soldier Blue" and "Cheyenne Autumn". When "Wolves" was released, films about Native Americans became increasingly melancholic, mourning the loss of a race which history had now accepted as being "ethnically cleansed". Is Costner's film more melancholic than "Avatar"? Yes. One point to Costner.18. Both films have been praised for their cinematography. Costner's compositions are simple and lack any significant depth, purpose or weight, but he should be commended for the poetic and ethereal style of the film. It's Malick-lite, but it's brave. "Avatar" looks like fluorescent vomit. One point to Costner.19. Bizarrely, both films have the white hero having sex with a native girl, as though this transfer of bodily fluids unifies races and symbolically brings rival cultures together. Insultingly, the native is deemed inhuman unless accepted as a white man's object of desire. Half a point to Costner.20. When "Wolves" was released it was fresh and relatively original. "Avatar" is one cliché after the next. One point to Costner for not being an unimaginative plagiarist.21. "Avatar" was bashed for the "white saviour" cliché. This cliché, or fantasy, involves white heroes "saving" a "victimized tribe" by becoming a top dog within the tribe, the white man always retaining his dominant position. In "Wolves", Costner remains inept throughout, is rescued by the natives and ABANDONS the natives when the white man attacks. In the "director's cut" we even become aware that he never understands Sioux traditions and will never be able to assimilate. One point to "Wolves" for being intellectually defensible.22. "Avatar" ends with the white man attacking the natives. "Wolves" has no crowd pleasing action scenes and instead hints at the slaughter of the natives with a simple shot of a Spanish helmet. One point to Costner for poetry.8/10 ? "Wolves" wins. The 4 hour cut in particular is a great film which avoids the sentimental pro-Sioux feel of the 3 hour cut. See too "Ulzana's Raid", "Hombre" and Altman's "Sitting Bull".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wanted so much to like it, but . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, of course this picture's heart is in the right place, and it features some nice acting, too--not from Kevin Costner, who's such a blah presence that we barely remember his scenes afterwards. But owl-eyed Graham Greene and sleek Rodney A. Grant keep their broadly-drawn characters from feeling like the noble-savage clichés they are, and acting doesn't get much better than Mary McDonnell's first hoarse, tentative 'Hello . . . ?' The problem is that good intentions don't always make for good art, and what we get here, yet again, is the kind of PC Hollywood gloss on this period that we saw on the 'Little House on the Prairie' series. (John Dunbar is every bit the sensitive New Ager that Michael Landon's Charles Ingalls was--basically an enlightened modern liberal zapped back to a 'primitive' past.)Not that there's anything wrong with that, per se, but it's sad to think of the opportunities missed here. 'The Godfather' is a good example of style and technique overcoming an empty, obvious narrative, but Kevin Costner is not the director to do the same thing with Dunbar's simple story. Instead, he usually just takes the easy road, overblowing and soap-operacizing things, laboring just about every point. It's not bad enough that the white men are pursuing their ruthless Manifest Destiny--no, Costner has to hammer the idea home by having them shoot his magically tame pet wolf. Et cetera, et cetera.To be fair, Costner doesn't milk the same kind of awfulness from 'Dances With Wolves' that Mel Gibson would with 'Braveheart' or James Cameron with 'Titanic,' and I almost wish he had decided to make this film a musical, or even an opera. After all, so often singing can transform the sentimental and the overstated into something profound, or at least beautiful; it can turn cheese into gold. It's painful, too, to give a negative review to a film that gave work to so many Native American actors. Sacheen Littlefeather may have been a phony, but she had a point--there's a lot of untapped talent out there, and it's nice to see so much of it being used, for once. But while there are things I want to like here, my reaction is really too much of a compromise to recommend this whole-heartedly. 5.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That's the only word that comes immediately to mind when hearing this title. Quite simply; it's awful.This film is not about one man's fight for equality as it would have you believe. It's about Kevin Costner and how great he thinks he is.This is nearly three hours of self-indulgent crap that grows even more offensive when I think about the awards that were showered onto it. Costner was even made an honorary Sioux tribesman.Costner turns in a bland, boring performance which can't hold my attention for more than a minute at a time. He directs the film entirely around himself and there is barely a shot that doesn't contain his face, framed in a look of heroic self-admiration.The dialogue and characterisation are about as gripping as a wet fish and the film relies too heavily on Costner's ridiculous imagery.This would get zero out of ten if it wasn't for the fact that it somehow manages to exist. And so; one out of ten is all it qualifies for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It may drive home the meaning of being human more than any other film I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best Western I've ever seen. One of its greatest strengths is its even handed portrayal of both sides of what was a gruesome bigotry ridden fight for land, opportunity, and way of life, between two very different cultures in the late 1800's. The Civil Wars' leftovers were a maliciously violent and frighteningly ignorant bunch, pit them against a culture of genuinely primitive &amp; savage people (scalping &amp; yelping pridefully about it ? wow) and you have a perfect breeding ground for intolerance, impetuous violence, and never ending retaliatory fighting. "Dances with Wolves" provides a context for understanding both sides' humanity (for better and for worse) concerning this scar on our nation's history. Said understanding is permitted through an engaging story told on a stunning backdrop of our disappearing plains and enriched with beautifully moving music. In 2007, "Dances with Wolves" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant." It may drive home the meaning of being human more than any other film I've ever seen. It won 7 Academy Awards, including Best Picture 1990; I'm not at all surprised and support the Library of Congress' decision.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dances With Wolves is three hours long, but that is not long enough, it is so wonderful. It is set in the Civil War-era prairie, and it captures the encounter between a white man and a Sioux tribe. However, it is timeless. It is romantic, adventurous, active, comical, tragic, and educational. It demonstrates the color of one race and the cruelty of another. It forces us to view our own culture with a different eye. It features redemption, nay, salvation. The camera captures the prairie beautifully, the bluest of blue skies and the whitest and puffiest of white clouds, the most colorful of colorful ground, the roundest of rolling hills, and the largest of buffalo herds. This movie was a risky project. The story and the symbolism is simple, but it was filmed and performed masterfully. It deserved the seven Academy Awards it received and then some. A must-see masterpiece. Ten out of ten does no justice. See for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Truthful and Correct portrayal of Characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think anybody that considers this movie "boring" is simply dead in the head and has no taste at all. Those types of people obviously have been brought up on to many shallow, no taste movies.There are so many facets to this movie that are simply the best that it is hard to stop at a thousand words. The character development,individual acting, the scenery, the music, what more could you ask for. The topic is probably hard to confront for some people because it is about the total abuse of a culture and that cultures view of the white race. I am white but don't happen to like the past transgressions and abuses done by the white race. I recently bought the extended version DVD of Dances and highly recommend it if you love collecting DVDs.Also, if you liked this movie and it's topic, read the book "Buckskin Bregades" (don't know about the spelling) by L. Ron Hubbard. A very good read on the native American story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always been fascinated about Native Americans especially their customs and believes. I didn't like some of the films that portrayed them all as savages because like any society, there are good and bad people in them.Finally with Dances with Wolves, we have a balanced story where we are shown that the Indians are not savages, they are just trying to live on their land, the white men are the invaders but that was never shown before. This film shows what the Indians were like before the white men flooded their land, ordering them off it and moving them where they could keep an eye on them. The Indians see Lt. Dunbar (Kevin Costner)and wonder what this means, as he is the first white man they have seen in a while and know that his arrival will have consequences for their people and we know that it did for them and the film comments on this, at the end. I have to say, watching this movie and thinking what happened in real life, I felt anger on their behalf. What right did these white people have for invading their land, arrogantly deciding they knew what was best for these proud people and dictating to them about the beliefs they should have, the clothes they should wear and how they should behave. It was a terrible injustice and it was about time someone showed the other side to the Indians.The film is just so beautiful. The locations are stunning, the music fits with the action, the characters you couldn't help warming to, accept those nasty army men who I was glad was killed as if anyone deserved to die, it was them and makes a change because in the 50's and onwards, the audience would be cheering them on and not the Indians but the positions are reversed in this film and we are cheering the Indians on. The film is funny in parts but still manages to convey a serious message about the mistreatment of the Native Americans in the past. There are some amazing scenes. One at the start of the movie where Dunbar overhears doctors saying they will have to cut his foot off and he escapes and later decides he doesn't want to live without his foot so rides into enemy fire to be killed and at one stage let's go off the reins and raises his hands as if to say he is ready to die. Another incredible scene was when the Indians were hunting buffalo, the sequence was so huge, the action seemed to take over the scene on what seemed a never ending canvas.People have moaned about the length of the film but I think it is just right. Every scene Costner has added to the film is justified and the movie is never boring, it keeps the audience focused on the screen.I loved the romance between Dunbar and Stands with a fist (Mary McDonnell). The chemistry between them sizzles and yet there is such tenderness.I also like Dunbar's relationships with Kicking Bird (Graham Greene), Wind in his hair (Rodney A. Grant) and Ten Bears (Floyd 'Red Crow' Westerman.' This is a very emotional film that had me in tears at times especially when Cisco the horse and Two Socks the wolf are killed. I got so caught up in the film that I was screaming at the screen and that is the power of the film where it sucks you so completely into the story. Cisco and Two Socks are just as much characters as the humans in the film and you have watched them throughout the film and are devastated when they are killed in the way they are. I laughed my head off when Cisko kept escaping the Indians and going back to Dunbar. And Two Socks who learns to trust Dunbar by the end and even takes food from his hand.I think what is also so unique about the movie is that the characters speak Lakota and it is so interesting listening to a different language other then English all the time.Well done, Kevin and the rest of the cast and crew for making such a moving film.</fullReview>

OK this last one is really great realized, but how to compare a good action movie and a great one on loving life and nature ? I didn't found it too long, and they didn't really treated about medicine and shamanism... It could be really longest, in many episodes ! Now I am in a hurry to see the extended cut ! :oD Overall, this film is a great way to describe how to change from a suicidal behavior to a new blow and passion of living changing the way we can see life !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An epic like Lonesome Dove: Outstanding, beautiful...........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An incredible film! This shows Kevin Costner's skills as an actor/director at the height of his stardom. Too bad his other films didn't reach the heights of this one, but it's not too shabby to have one's name associated with such a masterpiece. This is his Mona Lisa! This film, along with Lonesome Dove, are the two best Westerns by far to come out of Hollywood in the last 25 years (and maybe the best ever!). Both are sheer epics, with wide ranging vistas and story lines that sweep you up and carry you away to another time.The movie is also very similar to another done in 1970, "A Man Called Horse", with Richard Harris, and both do an honest portrayal of the Native American.It is truly sad, near the end of this film, to see the eventual decline of the Native American way of life, and the appalling savagery of the "Christian" white man.Needless to say, the whites didn't come off as heroes, as they did in so many of John Wayne and other stereotypical pieces from earlier decades.Dances with Wolves is so natural. I love the pieces of humor especially in the first part of the film (ie. Costner bumping his head against the door frame of his cabin and knocking himself out). Although this isn't a comedy, there is nothing out of place. Everything fits together perfectly! Costner's a natural here.Lt. Dunbar says that the Indians aren't the bogeymen they were made out to be. I suspect he would've thought different had he fell into the hands of the Pawnee, for the few minutes they'd have allowed him to live.The Sioux were portrayed as civilized and dignified, with all of the Native American cast, headed by Graham Greene, doing a SUPERB job! And Mary McDonnell. She was outstanding! Too bad we don't see her or Costner in such films anymore. They both seem to have faded into the background, with Costner doing standard grade romantic flicks.This, along with Lonesome Dove, is a must for everyone's personal collection; to be viewed and enjoyed over and over again.If you haven't seen it, SEE IT!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deserved All 12 Oscars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What an incredible movie. It truly deserved to win all 12 Oscars. At least they got the 2 main ones right---Best Picture and Best Director. Kevin Costner did a brilliant job of directing this huge epic. But he should have been awarded Best Actor as well. He mastered a long forgotten language---Lakota. That was amazing. Every character in this movie was excellently portraited. The book is a classic and we're lucky it was adapted to this great movie. There are a lot of people complaining that the white race was bashed around in this movie. This is simply the interpretation of the writer. His characters were both representations of the worst of humanity and the good of humanity. If you'd rather see the white race massacre the Native Americans then you need to find another movie that will show you that. Try one of John Wayne's. His are good. They'll give you what you want. Try "The Searchers".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This this movie cursed or what?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dances with Wolves was the best movie of 1990 and took home seven Oscars and yet like Poltergeist it seems to be a victim of its own success. First the death of Robert Pastorelli (actually from a drug overdose in response to his imminent arrest for murdering his wife) then the suicide of Charles Rocket. There is an ugly pattern here if Kevin Costner gets crushed in a freak buffalo stampede then we will know for sure. With that out of the way, this is a landmark in film. The likes of which may not be seen again in Western films for quite some time. I can't think of one that captures the beauty and intense savagery of the west in such an appealing fashion. Kevin Costner gives his career best as Lt. John J. Dunbar, a soldier who, in response to an unparalleled act of bravery on the field of battle, gets sent (quite by accident) to a remote outpost in the middle of Indian country. Alone and inexperienced, he makes friends with the local tribe and finds love, eventually becoming one himself. But the ever expanding Western frontier and its new conquerors will not forget him even if he chooses not to be a part of it. The scenery is magical and the casting was terrific. While not what you would call a happy story with a feel good ending, the ending is appealing to all of us and above all, makes sense. Clearly the accomplishment of a lifetime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dances with Hacks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The sentimentality that this film oozes is just too much to bear at times. Apparently the American public, who is accustomed to such trifling immodesty, swallowed this up when it was first released and hailed Costner as the "new genius of American art films". Well, since then we've learned two things, that first of all, this film is another foray into the "John Wayne" bias of American dogmatism and secondly Costner is a ham who hasn't scored another big hit in years. The film gives us the once again undefiled view of an idealist who was born in the wrong ethic group. Costner plays a Union troop in the Civil War that is merely a "misunderstood" progeny and suffers physically and spiritually as a result of it. He gets a new command and like a dim witted simpleton he picks the one that is the furthest from civilization. He soon learns that solitude is not an easy thing. One day he encounters a group of Indians in one of the most ridiculous scenes I have ever seen put forth to a group of adults. The film goes down hill from there and fast. One unrealistic example is when he shows his new Indian friends some ground coffee and they react like dumb founded buffoons, it was a fact in history that the Native Americans ground corn, and other seeds so they would in no way be surprised like this exaggerated claim. Why render them childish? Costner then becomes a part of the tribe, merely walking into it like a new found brother. He learns the dialect, and sits with the chief while exuding pensive thought. Of course, instead of falling in love with an Indian woman, he falls in love with a captured white who mumbles her way through like a drought minded wench. How convenient that the evil Sioux captured an English speaking woman who is both beautiful and robust! Instead of portraying the Indians in a truthful manner, Costner singlehandedly misinterprets their culture as something bordering on vanity and he does so by extinguishing their intelligence and ability to live in harmony with nature. Also, the scenes that dealt with the Pawnee were merely used for action sequences and in no way understood the vital role that other tribes had in relation to each other. The only decent portrait is of the stupidity and narrowness of the virulent white people who were shooting at everyone and everything. What more is there to say about this lousy film except that it had no 'truth' about it and it wasn't a loving portrayal as some people claim it to be?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pawnee! Villains??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I have to say that I enjoyed this film, but I have a couple of persnickety questions though about native American tribes. 1) Why was the main tribe changed from Comanche (as in the book) to Lakota (Sioux) for the film? 2) Why does Hollywood always seem to cast the Pawnee as the villains? This was the case in this film and in others - Little Big Man immediately springs to mind - again, in the film version, the Pawnee replaced Cheyenne as the murders of Jack Crabb's family. As far as I can make out, the Pawnee gave great service to the US as army scouts. I would have thought they deserve some recognition by Hollywood, rather than always being cast in the role of villain. Seems a little ungrateful? Just a thought</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Way better than Avatar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just can't for the life of me understand why this movie is rated below Avatar...After having seen this movie again for the first time in years, and after having seen Avatar, it is my opinion that Dances with Wolves is in an entirely different league in terms of story telling. The main ingredients of the story between these two movies is fairly similar - however, the pace and finesse with which Dances with Wolves portrays the development of the relationship between John and the Indians is masterfully done. While Avatar has huge flaws in its story-telling including some scenes with very weak dialogue - it might have gotten away with it as the audience is perhaps distracted by the bombardment of impressive CGI effects!If you thought Avatar was good and haven't seen Dances with Wolves in a while - I highly recommend it. An excellent move that I think deserves a much better review score - and also should definitely be on IMDBs top 250 list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kevin Costner's ego, in glorious Panavision</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kevin Costner tries to single-handedly revitalize the Western Epic in this long but often engrossing story of a disillusioned Union soldier during the Civil War who, with unlikely foresight, wants to see the Frontier "before it's gone". Making his debut behind the camera, Costner attempts to purge the Western genre of its racist overtones and cowboy clichés, but he does so by introducing anachronistic attitudes and expressions: his protagonist is too obviously a late 20th century hero transplanted to the Wild West. The impressive wide screen photography certainly captures the epic scope and expansive visual scale of the Prairies, and the depiction of the native Sioux (speaking their own language, through subtitles) is, for once, altogether free of condescension. But the script is little more than a long, transparent apology for the mistreatment of Native Americans, with Costner carrying all the sins of European culture on his back and sharing the Sioux agony like a born martyr. If any other paleface were even half as human the film might have been more credible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dances with Wolves is an amazing movie. It is mainly about the American soldier Lt. John Dunbar who is tired of the Civil war and wants to die and tries doing just that...but he fails with that and instead he becomes a hero. He is, at his own request, transferred to a deserted fort and his stays there while waiting for reinforcements. After a while he makes friends with some Sioux Indians...This is a very beautiful film, which despite the violence and bloodshed shows an amazing landscape and gives a true picture of the Indians and the white! Even though the films is long it is never boring and you wish it would never end. Graham Greene, Kevin Costner and Rodney A. Grant are all outstanding in their respective roles, especially Greene who you really "was" his role as Kicking Bird, instead of acting it.I urge anyone to see it. Young or old. Boy or girl.

		<shortDescription>Tastes Slightly of Watered Down Spielberg</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kevin Costner wowed everyone with his Civil War-era western epic back in 1990, and he's been riding the wave of its success ever since."Dances with Wolves" is a very good movie, beautifully filmed, beautifully scored, well acted. And it has noble intentions, for which I give it credit. But it's hard not to be sort of annoyed by it upon subsequent viewings, in the same way I'm annoyed by Steven Spielberg movies when he's trying to atone for his white guilt. In order to puncture stereotypes about a group of people these directors think their audiences don't know enough about (in Costner's case, native Americans), they resort to making caricatures out of the white people instead. Spielberg is a much worse offender than Costner (see "The Color Purple"), but Costner is guilty of it too. There's an air of condescension that turns me off.But I will restate that the film has noble intentions, and Costner was taking quite a risk in bringing a three-hour film about native Americans to a mainstream audience and banking on mainstream audiences caring.Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was filmed when Kevin Costner was at the height of his popularity. It is the story of how John Dunbar takes a sole position on the Western Frontier and gradually befriends the Sioux tribe. I'm sure in reality he would have been scalped early on, but that wouldn't have made much of a story would it.The finest feature of the film is the cinematography. I'm not sure whether it won an Oscar for this, but if it didn't it's a travesty. The great thing about the film is that all the characters are treated sympathetically with the exception of the soldiers. The contempt and arrogance of the soldiers is as relevant and topical today as it was in the time it depicts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>510th Review: 7 Oscar Wins and An Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dances with Wolves won 7 Oscars, at the time it was hailed as both the first truly blockbuster ecomovie, with recurring themes about caring for the environment, and for its recasting of Native Americans, who had been portrayed pretty shoddily by Hollywood as the hooligans and villains of the West.It won because it is great storytelling that suited perfectly the mood at the end of the greedy 1980s, a rejection of consumerism and greed - and instead here was a film filled with images of a world we wished, we could be part of - simple, thoughtful, respectful of each other and nature.And it is a great watch. It falls into the same category as Braveheart and Lawrence of Arabia - classic adventure tales, romanticized, and just plain watchable. The plot is a simple one - a calvary lieutenant John Dunbar after attempting suicide in the Civil War requests a post on the edge of the Frontier and there encounters Sioux and finally turns native. It is the arc of John Dunbar's growing awareness that the Indians are not the true savages here that makes the film - he is an everyman, he is us, and we gladly join him on that journey.Dances with Wolves remains a terrific watch, Costner is as handsome and charming a hero as a Peck or Stewart, and the supporting cast are winning. All in all, it not only holds up well, it still lifts the spirit, and inspires.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Particularly, I found sad that a great western like "Dances with Wolves" is mostly forgotten in the recent years, being only remembered when some people on Internet make a bad joke about how "Avatar" from James Cameron "ripped -off" this film. That kind of comments made me think that the people that keep saying things like that doesn't even saw this excellent film in first place: Only the premise of this movie has some vague similarities with "Avatar": The characters, story, development and setting are completely different. And both are very good.While "Avatar" focus more in action and in the incredible visuals, "Dances with Wolves" is more slow-paced and meditative, being more focused in the drama and the relationship between the characters, without being boring.The characters are quite different too:John Dunbar (Here wonderfully played by Kevin Costner, a great and underrated actor) has almost anything in common with the hero of "Avatar", Jake Sully. And don't get me started in the rest of the cast:Most of them are not even remotely similar.Sure, the premise of a military man who eventually became part of a tribal culture is the only thing that both movies have in common, but besides that, there is almost none similarity.Anyway both "Avatar" and "Dances with Wolves" are both good movies, but very different between each other. The absurd comparisons that are constantly made reveal the fact that most of the viewers have forgotten almost everything about this great movie, remembering only the basic premise of it. Which is a shame, because this is an excellent film, with a great story and many beautiful scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rediscover "Dances With Wolves"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen "Dances With Wolves" for years but recently rediscovered its brilliance. Released in 1990, the story involves Lt. Dunbar (Kevin Costner), a Civil War hero, singlehandedly manning a desolate prairie post in South Dakota. He becomes intrigued by his Native American neighbors, a small tribe of Lakota Sioux, and slowly develops good relations with them. He ultimately adopts a Sioux name - Dances With Wolves - and assimilates with the tribe. When the U.S. Army discovers his actions he is treated as a treasonous deserter. Mary McDonnell and Graham Greene have key roles. This is, simply put, filmmaking of the highest order. Everything magically works in this absolutely engaging 3-hour epic Western. The extended director's cut is an hour longer and most of the added material is worthwhile and fleshes out the characters more than the theatrical cut. I recommend watching the 3-hour version and, if you want more, check out the expanded version.Over the years I've heard some grumbling about the film's PC-influenced negative portrayal of whites in general and also its supposed romanticized portrayal of Indians as super-virtuous. Hence, before viewing the film again I was braced for the worst. After seeing it, I must say that most of these grumblings are hogwash. No kidding. Really, only a rigid white redneck "patriot" would take offense to this story (and, don't get me wrong, I'm patriotic but not mindlessly so). The film rings of authenticity and the characters are anything but one-dimensional. Want proof? (No major spoilers).- The Pawnee are the first Indians the viewer encounters in the film and they are portrayed as completely hostile to whites and other NA tribes - so hostile that they'll kill a white person on sight without mercy. I'd say this is a negative, stereotypical portrayal of Indians, wouldn't you agree? - Also, Wind In His Hair (Rodney A. Grant) clearly states that the Sioux should kill Dunbar at the council meeting; I'm sure there were others who agreed with him but it was ultimately decided that killing Dunbar would likely cause more problems than solve.- Not all white people are shown in a negative light; in fact, Dunbar himself - the film's protagonist - is white. What about the "foul" guy, Timmons, who escorts Dunbar to the abandoned fort? I've met people just like him. He's not portrayed as evil, but merely uncouth in dress and manners. Anyway, when Timmons gets savagely murdered by a band of Pawnee he begs over and over that the Indians not hurt his mules; his dying words are words of love (for his animals!). Also, when he says goodbye to Dunbar at the fort he says, "Good luck, Lieutenant" and you know he means it; the words show love and respect. Obviously this was a disgusting guy with a heart of gold. Again I know people just like him; it rings of authenticity.- The story takes place during the Indian Wars where there's very little love &amp; compassion of whites towards Indians and vice versa. The U.S. Army is there to do a job and, as usual, go by the book. Is this a negative portrayal or simply the way it was? The answer is obvious. Hence, most of the officers are not shown in a negative light but merely as military leaders carrying out their duty. Although some of the main enlisted soldiers come off as clueless sheetheads, again, the characters ring of true life. I met people just like 'em in the military.- Besides, I repeat, not all Natives are depicted as virtuous. The Pawnee are obviously ruthless villains and quite a few Indians are shown helping the U.S. Army and are, therefore, traitors to their people.- Is the small tribe of Lakota Sioux really super-virtuous? Is their lifestyle really a paradise? No, they're merely portrayed as real people living, pursuing happiness, uncertain about the amassing whites, fighting and persevering through hardships (like the winter camp).- Is the massive annihilation of Bison (leaving their skinless carcasses to rot in the sun) a negative depiction of whites or just the way it was? Such people would likely shoot a wolf for the "fun" of it. Again, it smacks of reality.This is just a taste. Clearly, the people in the film are not as one-dimensional as some maintain. Neither is the movie as pro-Indian/anti-white as some insist. It's more complicated than that.As to the accuracy of the story itself, the fact is that many whites have "gone injun" and many Natives have assimilated with whites. The story explores the possibility of what would happen if a white man dropped all prejudices and tried to get along with some Sioux neighbors; and what if this small band of Natives was open and curious enough to accept him? Is it unlikely that this band would have an available good-looking white woman amongst them that Dunbar could fall in love with? Is there a bit of romanticization? Yes, but it IS a Hollywood movie, after all. Regardless, it's presented in a believable, compelling and captivating way."Dances" is almost 20 years old but remains timeless like most great films; it is the definition of why films are made.The film was shot mostly in Western South Dakota with additional shooting in Jackson, Wyoming, as well as Nebraska and Kansas.

Such pictures as The Awakenings, GoodFellas and Millers Crossing was released to theatres. Yet surprisingly yes Kevin Costner directs a film around and greater then some of the three. Maybe a tie between GoodFellas. As for a classic up building whimsical cow boy and Indians film. Costner has made hands down the best.An epic masterpiece that will stand the test of time. Just in case you have not seen this show yet I'm not saying any details. If you like the experience of watching a good story unfold before your eyes and ears. This western is going to take your mind and hart into the wild frontier times.One the greatest films ever created. 10/10 for me.

		<fullReview>A classic film, beautiful scenery and wonderfully acted."Dances with Wolves" is beautiful. The detailed conversion on my new Blu player is and was phenomenal. The individual blades of grass stood tall and at moments I felt as if I was right there with Costner as he chased Two-Socks, or crossed the sweeping frontier. Costner's film, if anything, gave a modern technology country a view of a world that nearly feels fictional. No computers, no cell phones, nothing facing you except nature, and the power of Mother Earth. Costner captures this feeling with perfection. Not only does he have the time to cultivate this sensation, but he uses both audio and visual references to assist with his imagery. There was no doubt in my mind that Costner felt dedicated to this project that his creative eye wasn't at the peak of its existence. His passion bled through the film, giving us that moment when "Dances with Wolves" transforms from Hollywood project to Costner's dream come true. For that I applaud Costner for following his heart and creating a visual treat that goes beyond your average film.</fullReview>

Generally, it is an extreme long art work which it runs almost four hours; meanwhile it is fulfilled with visual shocks and a thoughtful story for me, at least.As the beginning, the scene which Dunbar requests transferring him to western frontier, gives me different feeling than other western genre films which I heard about or have seen before, because Dunbar does not seem like a traditional hero who is muscular or physical strength. When he arrives at Fort Sedgwick and starts to rebuild the fort there, I recognize this movie presents the real life which frontiers had to deal with all problems by themselves at that time. Dunbar has to face to the wild environment and his neighborhood, a Sioux tribe, whose members have attempts to steal his horse several times and threaten him. In this point, the movie gives me convictive evidence about individualism and self-reliance for Americans.Belonging to the development of the story, Dunbar not only lives at the frontier but also starts to talk with Sioux tribe through the white woman, adapted daughter of Kicking Birds. As a "hero", Dunbar is depicted as an honest and kind-hearted man instead of cold-blooded killer, which I imagine every soldier will be. Meanwhile, Sioux tribe does not seem to be unfriendly or aggressive. They are native people who live in the western America for a long time. To adapt such wretched environment, Native Americans have their unique lifestyle. In my opinion, it is also one of the reasons why inventiveness is regarded as an American spirits. At last of the movie, the last free Sioux is conquered by western frontiers. It means another "new world" has been established; also it shows other hints about current Americans' personalities.Although the story has been ended, I cannot help stopping my imagination and thoughts. It tells me not only the fantastic history of American frontiers, but also guides me to rediscover the profound contexts of Native Americans. It should be said, no one likes bloody wars, I hope all "heroes" who we know will be just seen in movies, while their spirits should be left in our lives forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Epic Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To celebrate my 750th review for IMDb, I turn to another of my favourite films. By 1990 the Western genre seemed all but dead. There had been few notable examples since "The Shootist" and "The Outlaw Josie Wales" in 1976; Clint Eastwood's "Pale Rider" is probably the best of the few from the eighties. The last attempt to make an epic Western had been Michael Cimino's "Heaven's Gate", which had proved a financial disaster. It was therefore a brave move by Kevin Costner, the film's star, director and co-producer, to attempt an ambitious Western on the same scale as Cimino's.Lieutenant John Dunbar is a Civil War hero who is posted to Fort Sedgwick, a remote frontier outpost. When he arrives at the desolate fort, Dunbar finds it deserted. The only humans nearby are a group of Lakota Indians, with whom he makes contact. At first their relationships are marked by mutual mistrust and inability to communicate, but eventually Dunbar befriends the Lakota. He finds himself drawn to the lifestyle and customs of the tribe, and falls in love with a young woman named Stands With A Fist. (She is not an Indian by birth, but a white woman who was adopted by the Lakota as a child after her family were killed by the Pawnees, the traditional enemies of the Lakota. Perhaps even in the nineties Hollywood was still uneasy about mixed-race romances). Eventually the tribe accept Dunbar as a full-fledged member and rename him Dances with Wolves after seeing him playing with a wolf. Dunbar marries Stands with a Fist, and lives for a time as a member of the tribe, whose language he has learnt, but his idyll ends when he is captured by the military, who threaten to shoot him as a traitor.During filming, budget overruns and production delays led to the film being dubbed "Kevin's Gate" by sceptics who felt that the project was doomed to failure. (The "Kevin's Gate" tag was later resurrected, with greater justification, for another Costner film, "Waterworld"). Cimino had deliberately set out to make a masterpiece, and though he failed his was an honourable ambition. Moreover, "Heaven's Gate" has many positive virtues, and Cimino's margin of failure was not as great his many critics stated. Costner, however, succeeded where Cimino failed: "Dances with Wolves" is, in my view, one of the cinematic masterpieces of the nineties.My view was not, admittedly, shared by everyone, although it was shared by the Academy who awarded the film seven Academy Awards including "Best Picture" Some felt that it was overlong, although in the case of an epic like this a running-time of three hours is amply justified. Trying to cram this story into a ninety minute, or even two hour, film, would have resulted in something unnaturally cramped and rushed. (I have only seen the three-hour version, although I understand that there is an even longer "director's cut".Some people disliked the film on political grounds; in his "Hollywood vs America" Michael Medved claimed that this was the first major Hollywood picture in which the hero is a traitor to the United States. (Strange that so experienced a critic should never have seen "Gone with the Wind" or any of those other old Civil War films that glorify the Confederacy!) It is, moreover, doubtful whether Dunbar actually is a traitor. He does not fight for the Lakota against the US Army; the only battle he fights in is against the Pawnees. He is guilty of, at most, deserting his post, but it could also be argued that it is the Army which has deserted him, by allowing him to be sent alone to an isolated and abandoned fort. Dunbar has to decide whether he owes a greater allegiance to the US Army or to the Lakota who have befriended him and whose culture he has come to admire.This was not the first Western to take a pro-Indian standpoint, although it is the grandest and most ambitious. There were earlier examples such as "Broken Arrow" or "Cheyenne Autumn", and such portrayals became fashionable during the sixties. Although "Broken Arrow" was praised when released in the fifties, it was later criticised for casting white actors such as Jeff Chandler and Debra Paget as Native Americans and having them speak English rather than Apache. Here, however, much dialogue is in the Lakota language with subtitles, and all the Lakota are played by Native American actors. "Dances with Wolves" ends on a sombre note, explaining that a few years later the last remnants of the free Sioux were subjugated by the U.S. Government, ending the conquest of the Western frontier states. Perhaps criticism like Medved's stems from the fact that some Americans might not like to be reminded of this less than honourable episode in their country's history.Everything about the film is on a grand scale, including John Barry's sweeping musical score and the stunning photography of the landscapes of South Dakota and Wyoming. Costner's acting is, I admit, not to everyone's taste, but to my mind he is one of the few modern actors with a genuine epic sense and the ability to convey the heroic. There are a number of other good performances, too many to mention individually, although I will say that Mary McDonnell and Graham Greene well deserved their Oscar nominations."Dances with Wolves" led to a partial rehabilitation of the Western as a genre. It was followed two years later by another great Western, Eastwood's "Unforgiven", and Costner himself has made further examples such as "Wyatt Earp" and "The Postman" (essentially a Western with a futuristic setting). The film's importance was recently recognised when it was selected for preservation by the National Film Registry, as "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant", one of only a handful of films from the nineties to have been so honoured to date. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of our greatest western epics...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kevin Costner's great epic Dances with Wolves is one of those films that I've been meaning to watch for years and years and just never got around to it, mostly because of the prodigious running time. At almost exactly four hours, it is something of a commitment, but never for a second does it get slow or boring. Actually, I should say a majority of the movie is slow, but it's a testament to how good it is that it is still never boring. Kevin Costner stars as a Civil War soldier sent to a remote outpost with vague instructions. His orders were given by a general who is clearly out of his mind, which sort of throws a veil of mystery over his assignment, which is perfect for making us wonder how long he is really going to be stuck out there in that sea of prairie before relief arrives. Maybe forever. Hopefully forever, as it turns out.The major accomplishment of Dances with Wolves is that it so thoroughly and so personally allows modern American audiences to relate to the plight of the Native Americans as the white man plowed across the frontier, destroying so much of the untouched natural environment and the peoples and cultures that lived there. Lieutenant John Dunbar (Costner), takes his post and faithfully performs his duties and awaits his relief, gradually becoming more and more comfortable in his surroundings and, most importantly, forming amazing friendships with a nearby Sioux tribe and a wild wolf. For much of the film, nothing much is happening other than the slow development of these relationships, and it is one of the most delightfully entertaining and watch-able things I've ever seen in a western. The only thing that I had a little bit of a hard time was accepting Mary McDonnell in one aspect of her role. She fits the image of a white girl raised by a Sioux tribe, but when she attempts to speak English as though she hasn't spoken it since she was a little girl, her supposed stumbling is not very convincing. Then again, this could be because I am an ESL teacher in China, so I am surrounded all day every day by people who speak broken English for real, so to see an American actress trying to do it doesn't quite work for me.Nonetheless, The relationship that Dunbar forms with her and her tribe is an amazing piece of film-making. A friendship between an early American soldier and a Native American tribe has never been done before, so this is a major accomplishment and a major contribution to our knowledge of American cultural history. And on top of that, the movie is astonishingly beautiful.It is genuinely heartbreaking when the whites arrive near the end of the film, as we all know they will. They are so callous and vicious and uncaring, interested only in killing anyone and anything in their way, rather than trying to understand them, the way Dunbar would.The character depth is also amazing. It is interesting to wonder, for example, how Dunbar would have handled the approaching Sioux had he not been alone or had been better armed. I don't think he would have reacted differently, although around him almost certainly would have. But he and the Sioux are civilized men, and civilized men are more curious than brutal. There is some tension when they meet, but neither of them are inclined to kill without reason. The Sioux, also, are complex characters. They are clearly a very spiritual and loving people, but they also have a lot of the characteristics of what were, and are, called "savages." They murdered and scalped the white men who brutally killed and skinned all of those buffalo. They had reason to do the killing that they did, but their style of punishment illustrated a chasm between them that Dunbar knew could never be completely crossed. Because of this, the movie ends in the only way that it really can, which is another thing that it does so well. A good movie should have an ending that seems perfectly natural, that seems like the only thing that could have really happened, but still be a surprise. Dances with Wolves has that and so much more. This is one of our greatest modern epics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After the buffalo are gone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those rare Hollywood films that works in all departments. Even its nearly four-hour length is just right, any shorter and the required leisurely pace with emphasis on the Remington-like photography which makes one think of a moving painting would have been lost, any longer and the movie would have become boring. "Dances with Wolves" is one of the few occasions when the long time slot is required to tell the story the way it should be told ("Greed" is another example). Kevin Costner is not much of an actor but he is one hell of a director. "Dances with Wolves" will stand up against any western John Ford made. Even Costner's acting is much better than the low point it would reach in his next film, "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves."Though not all that original, the story approaches its subject from a fresh angle. A somewhat mentally distraught cavalry lieutenant who was driven nearly insane by action during the Civil War is assigned a distant frontier outpost by a deranged commander who proceeds to p*ss his pants and shoot himself. The post has been recently deserted. So Lt. John Dunbar (Costner) lives as a hermit, befriended first by a lone wolf, then later by a tribe of Sioux. Living with the tribe is a white woman to whom Dunbar takes a liking. The tribe is anxiously awaiting the arrival of the buffalo for survival. The encroachment of the white man begins taking its toll with the buffalo slaughtered for tongues and hides, leaving the meat to rot. Dunbar must decide which way to go.Though long, the film moves with not a moment of respite from beginning to end. The viewer becomes part of the story and is carried along by the sweep of the lonesome, beautiful, and at times deadly, great plains, inhabited by native Americans who like all humans live lives of pleasure, pain, fleeting glory, desperation, and dreams, now threatened by outsiders who want the land and its creatures for themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Changed my mind ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This post refers to the extended DVD special edition of DANCES WITH WOLVES. Rarely does a film improve with the addition of 50+ minutes of film, certainly not a multiple Oscar winner. DANCES is that rare beast. A fine film at its original theatrical running time; it is a true masterwork in its extended DVD presentation. I'd viewed the film but once in its original theatrical run in 1990. I was impressed by Mr. Costner's directorial debut, though I felt much of the same material about the Caucasian race's shameful treatment of Native Americans had been stated as eloquently in LITTLE BIG MAN. Seeing the 4-hour cut of DANCES renders my initial reaction invalid. I recently viewed LITTLE BIG MAN for the first time in 15 years, and then bought my copy of the extended DANCES. Comparing the two works is like saying THE LONGEST DAY covers the same turf as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. They may cover the same history but they are different poems in different languages. Get the new DANCES extended edition and treasure it as one of THE great American films.</fullReview>

DWW is the best western I've ever seen or hope to see. The book is an outstanding work of fiction. The movie is an outstanding adaptation of the book. The only difference is that in the book the Indians were the Comanche. In scouting a suitable site for the movie, Dakota territory was chosen. Thus the Indians became the Lakota Sioux.

		<fullReview>Pros: Cinematography, acting, score, directing, costumes.Cons: Not long enough, ending to snug.If I say that I was p***ed off that Dances with Wolves was only 180 minutes, that's saying how good this movie is. Kevin Costner is brilliant as Dunbar and his love interest, Mary MacDonnell, is terrific as Stands With a Fist. Graham Greene brings integrity to his character. What impressed me about this film is that it was Kevin's first directorial debut (although I think he got plenty of help from another Kevin, Kevin Reynolds who is one of my favourite directors and also a genius at epic films like this). It does say, however that the thrilling buffalo hunt scene was done by Kevin Reynolds. This movie shows us the beginnings of Manifest Destiny and also what noble creatures the indians were instead of being savages ass they are often portrayed in westerns. It is sad to see a once great civilization resort to gambling to keep its people from being wiped out.Premise: Leutenant John Dunbar, because of his heroism, is given any post he wants and he chooses to go to the frontier.Dances with wolves won 7 Academy Awards including Best Picture and DirectorGrade: 9.9/10 (True classic).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A three-plus hour postcard for revisionist history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a perfect example of the power movies have to convey ideas, experiences and history, and of how that power can be used to rewrite history. Not since Birth of a Nation has a film worn its racism so blatantly. Aside from the plodding pacing, simplistic dialogue and wooden performance of Costner, the film is rife with historical innaccuracies and half-truths. Who would know from watching this "historical" film that the Lakota Sioux were ruthless, vicious warriors who were not above scalping, mutilating and raping their victims? Who would know that the Pawnee actually had a reason to attack the Lakota, because they had been forced off their own land? It is exactly this sort of half-baked revisionist history that does an injustice to the very people the film tries to ennoble. Costner and Blake must not think much of their audience to portray every soldier as a buffoon and/or coward, and to make the "bad" Indians noticeably darker-skinned than the "good Indians? This film should have come with a disclaimer stating that it is a work of fiction, because from reading and hearing people's responses to it, I am not sure the average viewer is smart enough to distinguish a well done movie from a piece of feel-good PC ego-stroking.</fullReview>

Dances with Wolves is made up of human soul; what we see on the screen is nothing less than a deposit of soul.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very poor to mediocre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally had the chance to watch this 7 Oscars winning movie. Winning Best Movie against titles like Goodfellas and Awakening, two amazing and impressive movies. After watching Dances with Wolves, my question was: why? Why the seven Oscars? Why all the fame?The first hour I was tempted to turn off this movie. I could not believe what I was watching. Great actors acted very mediocre. The story was mainly about mad people acting weird, the storyline was very weak. Then the story changed and it was mainly about Costner and his solitude. The movie was now very similar to one of the pseudo-documentaries set in the nature. One of those scripted documentaries where an animal is followed. The animal has a name and an artificial voice-over tells us what the animal is feeling and what the animal's motivation is. These pseudo-documentaries are usually poorly made and very much made up. This part of Dances with Wolves is even worse.The final part is acceptable. When Costner joins an Indian tribe, finally the movie starts to be a bit worth watching. But still not great.The movie was, in my opinion, definitely not worth any Oscars. Not even nominations. I gave this movie a 4. The average of a 1 for the first part and a 7 for the second part.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, Endearing, Timeless Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the opening scene, we are shown Lt. John Dunbar (Kevin Costner), shattered and sensually dumbed by the hardships and horrors of the Civil War. His mind has also suffered under the brutality, shown by his suicidal ride along the enemy entrenchment; Costner noting in his superb commentary that the 'soldiers were rotting' physically, mentally and aesthetically.However, it is this act by Dunbar that leads to his reposition to Fort Sedgwick, where he can begin his rebuilding and eventually rebirth as "Dances with Wolves". For me, it is most important to see Dunbar's initial fears a)of being alone amongst the grass, and b)sleeping with the light on, cradling his gun. His fears of isolation showing him to be broken down to the primal fear of a child, but ultimately, and contrasting to the fellow soldiers we see, still civil and humane.Dunbar describes war's effect on nature as 'abruise to the landscape , that will be slowly healed'. But for me, it is his recognition and empathises for nature that brings him closer to Two Socks and later the Sioux tribe. It is Dunbar's detest of man, brought on by the unreasoned horrors of the war, that allow him to reassess the nature of the savage wolf and the supposedly savage, native Sioux. Dunbar, scarred by the war, sees past the necessary brutalities of their lifestyle, and is compelled by their mutual respect and humanity; as he learns to socialise and love again.Directorly, Costner is both bold and dynamic, and it is a credit to him and producer Jim Brown that the film was made for just $15m. Central to this was the bold castings of Mary McDonnell (Stands With a Fist), who perfectly performs a role that could have easily come across as comically or even absurd, and Rodney Grant (Wind In His Hair) who takes the generic 'noble savage' role, and eloquently builds on it, growing to a multi-layered performance from naive racist to capable and humane potential leader. Alongside these are highly competent performances from the familiar Graham Greene and Tantoo Cardinale.Equally, it is Dean Semler's photography and John Barry's score that superbly frame and enhance the picture without encroaching on it allowing, at all times, the story to take centre stage. As has so often been said , a glaring omission from the top 250, which is perhaps more of a comment on the quality of viewers than the quality of cinema.An outstanding piece - well done Kevin and all who helped make it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beauty of the Indian Myth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Costner's Dances With Wolves is an aesthetically beautiful film that displays Hollywood's ability to represent changes in social perspective and the Indian myth. America's turn towards the sympathetic Western, initiated around the 1950's in such films as Delmer Daves's Broken Arrow (1950), helped alter the mainstream image of the American Indian and further develop the "noble savage" myth. It should be noted that Dances With Wolves is not an attempt to portray the history of the Sioux and their interactions with white men as an absolute truth, rather it is a symbolic work that explores the inner desire to find the American self as it relates to the Indian. Multiple myths intertwine through the narrative to weave a cinematic masterpiece that captures its audience's minds and astonishes them with its lush visuals. Hailed as a terrific film by those who see it, it is also a thought provoking film by those who study it.The protagonist of the film, John Dunbar (Costner), is the vehicle for many statements about the search for a distinct American identity. The quest to find oneself in the wilderness and shed the stain of European ancestry is pivotal in the film. John Dunbar "goes Indian" and finds the Sioux way of life a truer model for a human being, devoid of the hypocrisies and evils of industrial WASP society. White to Red is developed throughout the film, and Costner delivers the transformation piecemeal, discarding Dunbar's uniform, language, loyalties, and eventually his name.The film stands apart from much of the early Western genre in that the Indian is the benevolent good guy, and the white man is the enemy. Many polar relationships are at odds (and also viewed as American): industry and nature, nomad and settlement, innocence and decadence, Red and White. The film uses clever strategies to validate the Americanness of contradictory poles of each relationship dealing with Indian and Western myths. For example the contradiction between savage and noble Indian is treated by including both kinds of Indian myth-types. The Pawnee are shown as bloodthirsty warmongers, while the Lakota are seen as peace loving defenders of their hunting lands. This representation also affords the film the capacity to show American Indians as both good and bad guys. So the violence in the film elicits an identification with the good guys, which should startle the viewer from typical notions of the Indian myth. Can all Indians be bad? All they all good? Are only some tribal nations good? And if so, who determines which one are? Be sure to question any and all generalizations that you may recall about the American Indian when watching this film. Its vivid cinematography and musical score help create an epic story feel, as does its length of 3+ hours. Its length isn't cumbersome and allows a lot of material and character development due to its relaxed but captivating pace. I recommend Dances With Wolves not only on its technical and visual achievements, but especially with its treatment of the contradictions inherent in modern American perceptions about the history of its original inhabitants.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is my Bible. It touches on everything that is truly important to me: beautiful love and friendship not just between people but also between people and animals, loyalty &amp; dedication, harmony and victory. The cinematography is breathtaking, the music score is lovely and the cast is absolutely superb, including Cisco and Two Socks. I take my hat off for Kevin Costner's genius as director and actor. The film is difficult one to make, considering the treeless scenery and the fact that John Dunbar spends a lot of time with no one to talk to, and yet it is very entertaining. The battles are crafted tastefully, the love scenes are special with no unnecessary details and the humour is just the right dose. Dances With Wolves is an exquisite masterpiece and the two-disc extended edition is the wonderful treatment the film deserves. The transfer is high quality and it comes with stylish, cleverly designed keep case. The personal touch from Kevin Costner and Jim Wilson makes it even more special for every true fan of the movie. Take your time to indulge in this wonderful experience! I had an amazing weekend viewing the video. Had the feeling that Kevin and Jim were in my screening room when their commentary were on and I learned a lot about these remarkable men and what they have to go through to make it happen. I will treasure my old disc and will often go back to it, but when I need a dose of pure inspiration and motivation, I will play the extended version, listening to the last few words that Kevin says in his commentary. Absolutely fascinating!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest Movies of All Time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, by far, is my favorite of all-time. However, to see the edited TV or cable versions does not do this film justice! To get the most appreciation out if this movie, the DVD version is a must! There are extra scenes on the DVD which give you a better understanding of their respective scenes, such as when Stands With A Fist's husband is brought back dead by his fellow Sioux warriors after a battle against the Ute tribe. You then realize why she was slashing her wrists when John Dunbar (Kevin Costner) finds her on the prairie. Anyhow, this movie has something for everyone: Adventure, romance, action, and just overall wonderful human drama. Dances With Wolves basic plot is that Lt. John Dunbar, a recently decorated Civil War Union officer, requests to be assigned to the most remote Army outpost on the American frontier. His main reason is that he wants to see it "before it disappears", as he puts it. To his astonishment, he realizes upon his arrival at the fort, it is deserted. He doesn't know what happened to the soldiers who were supposed to be there but decides to stay anyway. During his time at the fort, he meets and befriends a group of Lakota Sioux Indians, although not with some apprehension on both sides at first. Eventually, he realizes that his pre-conceived notions and prejudices against this race of people are totally unfounded. He, for the most part, falls in love with the tribe after realizing what a peaceful and harmonious they prove to be. Dunbar then fully adopts the customs and culture of the Sioux and rejects his own past. This film has a terrific moral to it as to how we all have certain prejudices against people who are different from us and if we just take the time to know them, we can become better human beings. Also, the musical score in this film is unsurpassed. It was so instrumental in conveying the mood in each and every scene of this film.</fullReview>

The first third rewarded that with gorgeous visuals, an excellent opening set in the American Civil War, an interesting main character and wonderful scenery. Particular praise must go to a single shot of a rain cloud that is the second best bit of weather on film that I've seen, after the ending of THE DUELLISTS. After this everything started going downhill rapidly.At heart the problem is that this is a vanity project adapted from a novel by the novelist. Hence a running time at least one-third over-long (plenty of material could and should have been cut). Hence long, dull, often quite stupid voice-overs that are novelistic in length and badly delivered by Kevin Costner, whose voice is far less impressive than his whiskers (which are shaved off halfway through, leaving him with an absurd mullet haircut). Hence also the ridiculous portrayal of both Indians and Americans. The American characters are handled with all the subtlety of a propagandist, being uniformly cruel, stupid and close-minded. The Indians meanwhile are, beyond the token bad Indian (played by the same amazing hawk-faced Indian that always plays this role), wise and tolerant to a fanciful degree. There is absolutely no complexity to either side, nor is the story put in any kind of historical context. So, a beautiful but badly-flawed film with an interesting concept that goes on and on until you're practically shouting at the screen for the 7th Cavalry to storm on in and slaughter all the Sioux, thereby ending the never-ending turgid voice-overs and fire-lit pow-wows. Read J.T. Edson instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best film of all times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dances With Wolves is the best because it's about the most important thing in life - to live the longest possible and the closest possible to freedom,unlimited,ideal as a being can. The art is communication and the greater value the art form is relating to, the higher quality it has.Because what is more valuable than the objective representation of lesser limiting.You can use it and get to the knowledge and of course ameliorate your life and lives of other beings.That is precisely what Dunbar did. He went over the limit (the border)closer to freedom (the plains).The experience of higher value, better life was obvious to him. But we can't be free. We can only get so close as our potentials permit. Unfortunately, life is war, which we will lose, but we can decide how long and of what quality it will be.So Dunbar lived it to the fullest possible, but he was not narrow.Every being is fragile and because he knew it, he helped his friends (the warning about the arrival of the army and his escape in other direction from that of the Indians)as they helped him (the rescue from the army).In this way the Indians too could live it the best possible.The gratitude was expressed especially beautiful by the legendary scream from the cliff by Wind In His Hair.This is the reason why Dances With Wolves will be watched by many future generations.Similar can be said for The Shawshank Redemption and Papillon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seldom have I come across a film that has stirred so much emotion and passion about the story of the mid nineteen century conquest of the frontier states of America. There surely can't be a person who watched this movie who was not moved by this story of the Sioux nation portrayed as a people who were in harmony with the land on which they inhabited and who demonstrated a respect for each other. Driven towards extinction by the inevitable migration of white Americans, the story is told with grace and candour with a remarkable John Barry score and fine performances by Costner, McDonnell, Greene, Grant plus ensemble.Worth revisting from time to time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some movies are meant to just stay in their own place, however, "Dances with Wolves" is meant to be in more than one place.Kevin Costner shines in this movie as the witty and wonderful John Dunbar, who gets transported to the West to be inhabited by Indians in this Oscar Winning film. Costner plays a Civil War veteran that is sent out West after getting a great honor, and hope that troops would come with him. When he realizes that the people he lives with are Lakota (Native Americans), he starts to adapt to their lifestyle, learning their language, and learning some of their values, such as following the buffalo, and even falls in love with a white women (Mary McDonnell), who became a Lakota following her family being massacred by Pawnee Indians.The movie is both touching, and tragic, as we all know what happens as a result of what happens to them, but the movie tries to show the happiness in how they each try and make the best of hard situations (killing off Buffalo, taking away land), as the movie progresses, it gets a bit slower, but its worth some of the wait.Excellent film making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My thoughts on "Dancing With Wolves"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although some of my Native American friends are quite angry at this film, I would point out that it was not made as a definitive history, but as a story to entertain. As such, it did not need to be factually correct, but I think it shows the native peoples in a very favourable light and is sympathetic to their plight over a hundred years ago. I would also point out that not all buffalo hunters were white - many tribes slaughtered thousands of buffalo so that they could sell the skins to other natives as well as to whites.One last thought - The Indian Wars happened over a century ago so nothing we can say or o today will undo any of the wrongs committed by either side, so isn't it time we all moved on and lived as the world is today? To quote a Native saying, "We Are All Related." Sheila</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic now borrowed by other film makers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dances With Wolves is such a powerful story that it was transposed almost directly into Avatar. I have the extended DVD and would recommend anyone who truly loves this film to see it. It explores in greater depth, the lives of the Sioux Indians and is more sympathetic to the destruction of their lifestyle than the standard version. In one extra scene, we see Kicking Bird taking Dances With Wolves on a journey to a sacred place where they believed all life sprang from. Once there, they see the unwarranted and indiscriminate killing of both the environment and wildlife. Two extra scenes also deal with the early differences between John Dunbar and the tribe. One is where the white hunters who butchered the buffalo had been caught and the tribe were celebrating by waiving their scalps around a fire, and the other is where a Pawnee warrior has his head bashed in by a elderly female Sioux. They were apparently cut from the film because they showed a more naked savagery, but I feel they show the truth in the difficulties faced by a people fighting for survival. I really can't praise this film enough for its sheer breadth of vision, its powerful emotions and the way Kevin Costner draws out the majesty of the plains, its changing seasons and the ebbing and flowing of the life that clung so desperately to their land, only to lose it to a people who, as Dunbar narrates, have no souls, no honour and no regard for Sioux rights.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is hands down one of the best I've ever seen in reference to the American Indian. It does a fantastic job of portraying the Sioux as they really were, without bias or embellishment. The inclusion of the Pawnee in key scenes reinforces the fact that not all American Indians were the same - something that most Americans don't know or simply don't care about. It also makes a strong statement on the ignorance, cruelty, and disregard for the land that the whites showed when they settled the United States, and through the story of Dunbar, illustrates how that could have been avoided with nothing more than respect for another group as people and interest in their culture, instead of blind contempt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not many films deserve the title of 'Epic'. This is one of the exceptions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Had to write this review on here as I have always loved this film and it is still in my top 10 of all time. A lot of people call some films 'Epic' and this is up there with the best of them.I am writing this though as it was the first time I had watched the film on blu-ray recently. I only watch the extended version, even though both the theatrical and extended are both excellent. But like with many of Ridley Scots films (Kingdom Of Heaven is a classic example) and The Lord Of The Rings trilogy, I prefer to watch the extended versions as I always think they add a lot more to the film.This movie though is without a doubt a 10/10. Beautifully shot, beautifully acted and definitely beautifully scored by the late great John Barry providing the best score of his entire career. The film deserved its success and it is without a doubt Kevin Costners best film to date after Field Of Dreams. A superb supporting cast too where you actually care about every single character.This film should be watched by everybody at least once and now that we have IMAX cinemas, I really hope that one day, the film is remastered for the format and has a re-release in IMAX in its extended form as it would be just incredible to see it on a screen of that size.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is great about this film is that the plot itself completely fits in Costner's directing view which has easy pace and deep processed content. Furthermore, the way Costner displays such strong feelings as friendship( for example how wolf sacrifices himself for Lt. Dunbar and even how wolf hesitates to eat Dunbar's ham until it makes sure that he means well) and patriotism( in its true sense: battle for your people not country) and of course love( in a way that is not sneeze to watch, quite opposite). He dares criticize the way how American's treated Indians which sends humane message and shows how Kevin Costner's views are wide and beyond the limits( those opinions initiated the creation of the movie).Costner did the job perfectly and I'd like people not to question academy's decision to award this movie before Goodfellas for example( which is also a fantastic movie). I would recommend this movie to anyone because it will make an impression most likely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all there are way to many haters of Kevin Costner on the Internet. Second of all I can't believe this film isn't in the top 150 list of IMDb and absolute overrated cack such as Avatar, the Avengers and Pulp Fiction are rated over Dances with Wolves. This is a wonderful breath taking film which Costner put his heart and soul into, its a film which people love to snide out for being to "PC". Me however I didn't really care for the politics of this film and just enjoyed the story, the acting, particularly Costner's lead role as John Dunbar, the beautiful cinematography and production value and great score composed by John Barry. In my opinion people who don't like this movie probably think Michael Bay is a genius and think the Big Lebowski counts as an intelligent film. Go watch this film if you haven't already, the Oscars it won, especially the award for Best Director for Kevin Costner was well deserved, I'm also glad it won Best Picure over Goodfellas. An epic ground breaking masterpiece with heart and soul which also stands to mean something. A faultless film and is probably my favorite film of all time. Solid 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always read that Native Americans (NA) are typically portrayed as bloodthirsty savages. To which I say, where? Through most of my adult life they have been these tree-hugging, talk-to-the-animals spiritualists who can almost do no wrong. Dances With Wolves shows the warm and cuddly side of NA life, centering around the horse-culture Sioux with the occasional dabble into the raider culture of the Pawnee.The film deifies NA culture, focusing on their spirituality and oneness with nature: the NA use all parts of the buffalo to honour the animal's spirit. The fact that they are a Cro-Magnon people who *necessarily* need food, clothing, tools and weapons is not addressed.Dances With Wolves presents the other stereotype, but a stereotype still. Check the four-hour version if you can find it, tho. They put the deleted scenes back into the film (where all deleted scenes belong!) instead of tacked on a separate disc.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Western-Drama-Romance-Action-Comedy-War masterpiece....what else can anyone ask for?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The talented and famous Kevin Costner during his great career he never received a deserved recognition for his impeccable performances. He had to sit on the director's chair and act at the same time to be finally awarded, and it wasn't for nothing. But to be able to start talking about the work of Costner and his great team, let's start talking about the wonderful story."Dances with Wolves" begins during the American Civil War with the Lieutenant Dunbar (Kevin Costner), tired of all the war and after facing a near-death experience in the middle of a battlefield, he asks to be transferred to the unknown area of America, " The Frontier ", a vast green area with only animal and native life. Dunbar always dreamed of know and explore the frontier before she disappeared with the economic advancement of the Americans. But on this trip he is faced with the indigenous tribe, the "Sioux", and with them the great change of his life.A film that works as a Western with a vast Western environment and even moments of fantastic action in the Western style, but the film manages to go much deeper than that. From the beginning, the film manages to put ourselves on the feet of Dunbar, from the output of the world he was born into the unexplored world. The 1st hour of the film we only see Dunbar with his internal monologues and dialogs with his horse and a wild wolf that serves as their only company, but always with "Kicking Bird" (Graham Greene), a member of the Sioux tribe, watching him. Michael Blake's writing is just fantastic (who also manages to be loyal to his own work) making a fantastic job deepening Dunbar since a lonely man to a great friend of the Sioux.The film not only puts us at Dunbar's place but we get to feel the same feelings that he has regarding to the Sioux that goes from admiration to love. The Sioux can not only be an indigenous people with a great culture but nourish a huge intelligence and respect between each other, and they also have a innocent and good sense of humor (they fart; insults jokingly) making each one very realistic and human. We even feel a bit of the relationship between Dunbar and "Stand Fist" (Mary McDonnell), no big surprise, beyond beautiful she is smart and brave and also be the only white people among the tribe.Not only the writing of the film is fantastic maintaining an excellent character development but Costner's direction is just superb. Behind the camera he delivers a flawless direction putting us closely to the action scenes and makes us feel in the midst of the beautiful green desert with beautiful scenery magnificently filmed.The cast also stands out without difficulty: Kevin Costner is already superb behind the camera and in front of it would be no different with a sparkling gleam in his eye and his way of speaking the language of the Sioux without difficulty is just stunning; Mary McDonnell fantastic in every detail; Graham Greene honor his Native heritage perfectly.Kevin Costner was able to show a real talent for management and shines with a sparkling performance with a superb cast, all included in this beautiful story of a man who went out to find his place and eventually found himself. A wonderful writing and direction and an ending that made the strongest gets wet in tears, "Dances with Wolves" is a true classic masterpiece.</fullReview>

A development in unison with nature as a companion, not something to be exploited.And I always cry at the end, when Wind in Hair shouts out his sorrow to see his friends go. It touches something very deep inside me, as this whole film does. Dances with Wolves should be shown in schools as an important alternative view on life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deserves its Oscars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a film wins multiple Oscars, it is usually because there is something worthwhile about it - Dances With Wolves well deserves its 7 Oscars.John Dunbar is a man who is completely out of place in his own society: following a suicidal but inspiring action during the civil war he requests, and gets, a posting to a frontier outpost, where he is forgotten and left in welcome solitude until he makes contact with the Sioux (or, rather, they make contact with him). This uneasy contact gradually turns into grudging respect and, finally, full kinship as Dunbar realises that the values these people hold represent the qualities he has been missing all his life.This film runs three hours. It is never action packed, but there is always something of interest happening as the story of Dunbar's voyage to his spiritual home unfolds. One of the joys of the movie is the way the telling of the tale matches the elegiac beauty of the visuals. The performances - including Costner's - are all top notch, and his direction is superb.A wonderful film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>..after the last bad review..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read them all, and seem to find that most bad reviews on IMDb are saved for last. Although everyone is entitled to their opinion, I think this was truly an epic masterpiece in every way - bad acting from Costner (Dunbar), included. We have to consider perhaps that is how his character was written.....Does ANYONE click on the "more" button for "Trivia"? If you had, you'd have read that Costner wasn't the only actor considered for the lead. You also would have read that he was interested in the story BEFORE it was written into the novel, and encouraged Michael Blake to do that first, then the script. I feel it was a big plus that Costner was involved from the very beginning. Paid-off well in his directing.In the "goof" department, I found a huge one which no one else mentioned. When they have captured "Dunbar" and have him all banged-up in the tent, some soldiers are standing in the doorway looking at him. One was of Asian descent, which plays well for not showing discrimination today, but there would NEVER have been an Asian in anyone's army in this country in those days - they were forcefully segregated. Maybe a reminder that "Native"-Americans walked over land-bridges from China? Did anyone else notice that Dunbar started to become Indian when his moustache disappeared? No scenes to show Indians shaving....."Dancer with Wolves" is a fabulous movie to get lost in, no matter how long it is. Gotta get the DVD ! Costner surely got it all together for the cinematography, the casting was very good, costuming authentic. I don't find anything to dislike and a lot to really like in the film. I, too, think "Kicking Bird" (Graham Greene) should have won an Oscar for his brilliant performance, as should have Rodney A. Grant (Wind in his Hair). I saw him shopping in Ralph's and he looked exactly as he did in the movie - very friendly, what a hunk. Mary McDonnell was perfectly cast, and did a great acting-job. "Red Crow" was the ultimate chief, as Nathan Lee as "Smiles a Lot" was stellar. Every role was played to the fullest, whether the film was actually authentic or not - I didn't care, I'm not a stickler for authenticity so long as I enjoy the whole thing. Films with good stories that show the breathtaking beauty of this continent always get me - I'm so glad some people are filming it before the condos go up.I loved the score. Few people caught the fact that the officer who sent "Dunbar" to the last post was a trifle insane. He apparently couldn't have handled any combat, but was put-out that he was assigned to do nothing in some remote outpost. The actor who portrayed "Dunbar's" guide was absolutely fabulous, as nasty as he was. His death was how we are used to seeing Indians brutally act-out in most movies and was touchingly played. "I bet someone back East is wondering, 'why doesn't he write'?" What a line !!....badly delivered by "Dunbar" to "Two Socks" after a long visit with his neighbors.....The battle with the Pawnees was so beautifully filmed. Just like today, they were battling to keep their country and take the spoils of who were weaker. The romance between "Dunbar" and "Stand with a Fist" were poetic; so glad there wasn't a lot of sex-scenes in here.....completely unnecessary. It was thrilling to see the huge herd of buffalo, no matter where they came from.It matters not to me that some critics, professional or amateur, panned this movie. It was/is a true escape for me into a beautiful world that has no equal today. What a pleasure to remind me that Native-Americans were intelligent humans, also.....and lived with dignity in their own life. My gratitude is for everyone who had a role in bringing this film to the screen - what a great movie for children. Thank you ! A 20.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly powerful...and just think, this was Kevin Costner's first ever job as a director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And he deserved those two Oscars he won for what he did on this movie. "Dances With Wolves" is definitely a classic epic motion picture, one that should not ever be remade or redone in any way. Because nothing and nobody will ever be able to do what Kevin Costner and his team did on this movie. It won seven Academy Awards and countless other ones, and it deserved every single one of those and much more.One of the main reasons why I loved "Dances With Wolves" is not just because it's a great movie, but because it's a very realistic movie. For the first time in a long time--or probably ever--we are shown what Native Americans were really like. Throughout history, Native Americans have been shown as barbaric savages with no intents but to murder and kill. But this movie shows that they were nothing at all like that, and it is correct. Native Americans were people, just like us. They only killed when they deemed it necessary: self-defense, protection of their land, beliefs, and so on. And it shows that just like us, they can hate, love, laugh, and cry. This movie also shows that Native American societies had both good and bad in them, no different than us."Dances With Wolves" is over three hours long, especially in the extended addition, but like many other classics, if you have a good sense of what a good movie is, you won't even bother with the time. Because this movie is so epic and powerful and realistic, it's incredile. And it's remarkable what Kevin Costner did, seeing as how he had NEVER done a director's job until he made this movie. And he also played a very convincing lead role.Overall, this epic Western is a classic movie. And it should never be remade, because it was made in the right times and by the right man, so every aspect of it is perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Not only does it provide a full-absorption perspective of a culture that is virtually non-existent, it also depicts a sadly accurate portrayal of life in the Midwest plains. Kevin Costner did an exquisite job of playing a disenchanted soldier looking for fulfillment and purpose in his life. Graham Greene, Rodney A. Grant, and Mary McDonnell all played their parts of Sioux Indians magnificently, stirring the needed amounts empathy and hope for an epic movie such as this. Despite some very minor historical inaccuracies, I believe this movie delivers a message about American History better than any book can, and one that we should not be so quick to forget. There is majesty in freedom, and that was taken away from many Indians, not just the Sioux. They are the true American natives, and watching this movie with an open mind and heart is the least tribute we can pay to them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lt. John Dunbar is transfered on his own wish to an outpost located in the western America. There he makes friends with Indians and becomes one of them, called Dances with Wolves...I don't like westerns. I'm not a big fan of any actor in this film. I don't like 4 hour movies. I don't like conventional stories. But "Dances with Wolves" remains one of my favorite movies ever. The only way for me to describe it is to say that it's simply pure magic and a beautiful allegory of a man finding out who he is and what he wants to do with his life. The 7 Oscars and 3 Golden Globes are well deserved. Basically, all of the scenes are simple, but have some intense power to them. For example, the scene where Dunbar sees the wolf for the first time and wants to shoot him, but then changes his mind for some reason, is wonderful ( the music by John Barry there is perfect ). Or the one where Dunbar and Stands with a fist sneak out of the forest to have intercourse. Or when the captured Dunbar spots his dead horse. All very emotional and powerful situations, so heart wrenching that they turned my mind upside down. I do have some complaints here and there, but they are ultimately minor flaws.-----------Now, I'm quite surprised how cold some critics are towards this film. I'm not buying that stuff that the reason is that they don't like Kevin Costner because I, for example, don't like Clint Eastwood either and still have to admit that the man made a great film with "Unfrogiven". Honestly, I would prefer "Dances" over top 250 films like "Pulp fiction", "Silence of the lambs", "American Beauty" and "Goodfellas" anytime. Now that I mentioned "Goodfellas" I have to clear something out. Many complain how that mafia epic should have won the Oscar for best picture and by going on the critics site rotten-tomatoes.com I found out "Goodfellas" average grade is 8.8/10, while "Dances" is only 7.1/10. Scorsese's film from 1990 really is excellent, but it's also cold and mechanical and can't be compared to the sheer beauty of the intimate film with a soul like "Dances with Wolves".Grade: 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dances With Wolves is one of the BEST movies i have watched and i really admired it the first time i watched it when it came out. I have always loved movies that involved native Indians and of their reservations. Kevin Costner has always been a big favorite of mine and i love all movies he has been in. The "Dances With Wolves" movie was very well put together and i have watched it so many times. The story of the movie is beautiful and outstanding. Other actors in movie i have also admired were Rodney A. Grant, Mary McDonnell, Graham Greene, and Tantoo Cardinal. This is a movie i would watch everyday and never get tired of it. It is rated to be THE BEST!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright, granted I haven't seen this movie in a while ("Dances"), and although I do recall liking it, I wouldn't consider this a masterpiece, not by along shot. Something puzzles me. I recently watched Goodfellas again(for 80th time), and marveled its complexity,cinematography, outstanding acting, and artistic merit. Its for sure in my top 3 favorite movies of all-time if not #1....Can someone please tell me how a movie like "Dances with Wolves" could even be mentioned in the same sentence as Goodfellas, and even more importantly - how could it have possibly received more Oscars that year (including Best picture)???

Grant turned in fascinating performances.Costner is a punching bag, I guess because of his perceived politics, or maybe just because he picked the wrong time to be a straight white man who plays heroic characters.He has made some stinkers, but this one, like Bull Durham and JFK, is a great film.

		<shortDescription>An magnificent movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I sometimes think "Dances With Wolves" and "JFK" were the two WORST possible things that could have happened to Kevin Costner. They're TOO great! With the exception of "Thirteen Days", he hasn't done one really good film since, ("The War" as okay-but that was more of an Elijah Wood film). I know a lot of people are down on Costner. Like Bruce Willis, Sly Stallone and of course John Revolta...err Travolta, they have done so many bad films people give up on them. But unlike those actors, Kevin Costner really does have great potential and true star quality, as much as any leading man Hollywood has ever had. He absolutely proves it with this great movie! "Dances With Wolves" plays like an American "Lawrence of Arabia". It's flawlessly photographed, cast, paced with powerful and totally captivating ideals and performances. Many people dump on this film for it's alleged 'sermonizing'. Name me one major film that doesn't 'sermonize' to some extent though!The fact that Alfred Hitchcock never won a best director Oscar, that fact alone, proves the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences fraudulent, (and just how did "Gigi" beat out "Vertigo" in 1958?). To say nothing about Orson Welles! I will never be a fan of the Oscars, but there are two exceptions when the Academy went out on a limb and really got something right in giving a film a bunch of awards. "Dances With Wolves" is one of those exceptions, (the other being 1984's "Amadeus" by Milos Forman). Everyone on Earth was expecting Martin Scorsese's "Godfellas" to run the table, and don't get me wrong...I LOVE "Goodfellas". It's one of the best films of the decade, but it doesn't have the rare texture, detail and rich feel that "Dances With Wolves" has.If you haven't seen this film, don't believe all the negative talk from the other users here...go rent it at once, preferably the special edition which has much more to offer, but even if you can't find that version, see the regular anyway. It's one of only three movies of the entire 1990's I will give a full '10' to. It's THAT great!Final rating: 10/10 "The rarest of all films. Not just a 'flawless masterpiece', but that kind of film you can enjoy for the rest of your life and never tire of."</fullReview>

The way in which he builds a relationship with the Indians, whilst also gaining their respect is brilliant. He forgets the politics and the fact that his fellow countrymen are trying to get rid of the Indians so that they can poach their land is totally enthralling.

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most films benefit from a bit of objective cutting in the editing room, but there are some that suffer from shorter running times. They are few and far between. The director's edition of Dances With Wolves, clocking in at almost 4 hours and just released as a Special Edition DVD by MGM, is a shining example of such a film.I'm convinced that Kevin Costner's sole reason for ever working in Hollywood was to make Dances With Wolves. Everything he did before or has done since is irrelevant. It's one of those transcendent experiences that is greater than the sum of it's parts. All of the necessary ingredients were in the right place at the right time for this movie, and magic happened. Like the extended edition of Peter Jackson's The Fellowship of the Ring, this version of Wolves is what should have been in the first place, test audiences and people with short attention spans be damned. Everything here is pitch perfect, with the additional character development and plotting bringing a sense of grace and fullness to the story that was previously missing. A film with conviction and heart containing enough wonderful performances to decorate a Christmas tree. A must have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dances With Wolves is a Timeless Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dances with Wolves" remains as one of the best movies of all time. It takes you back to another place and time, the Frontier, to a place that you wish still existed. The movie has excellent actors-Rodney A. Grant, Graham Greene, Wes Studi and so many more. I loved the beautiful scenes of the endless prairie, of the Lakota Sioux camp, and the wonderful music of John Barry. The story centers around the life of Liutenant John Dunbar, and his trek of self discovery. In the beginning we see him as a disillusioned Union soldier, lying wounded in the surgeons camp bed. He attempts to take his life, but instead ends up saving the day. He is promoted and given the opportunity to leave the fighting grounds of the Civil War for the posting of his choosing. He chooses to be posted in the Frontier, in order to see it before it is gone. Once he arrives at the camp, he finds out it is deserted. He remains there, alone, hopeful that new troops arrive soon. Yet they never do. He finds out that he alone must learn to live in an environment he knows nothing about. Then he makes contact with a Sioux, and several times they try to steal his horse, Cisco. The movie, to me, begins really when he travels to the Lakota Sioux campsite, to make contact. It is here that a relationship with the Sioux really begins, as well as Dunbar's relationship with Kicking Bird. Gradually, John Dunbar realizes that the Sioux are not the way he envisioned them. He had had preconceived notions about them-about all Native Americans, to be exact. He finds himself identifying with them, with their way of life and beliefs. Eventually he comes into contact with his own former world, the world he left behind. He finds out that he no longer identifies with his former comrades or with the US government. It is then that John Dunbar discovers just how far he is willing to go to protect his new adopted family-the family he learned to love. I deeply recommend Dances With Wolves. It is timeless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very few movies can be called true masterpieces, movies which change the way you think, feel and ultimately stay with you forever. Dances with Wolves is one such film. It is so refreshing to see a 'WESTERN' portraying the Native Americans not as beggars and thieves, but as thoughtful, caring human beings. The relationship struck with John Dunbar and the tribe makes great cinema with a timeless story of courage, discovery and friendship. This film is rich and colourful from its awe inspiring landscapes to its fabulous array of talented actors, most notably Graham Greene whose portrayal of Kicking Bird is absolutely perfect. I urge people who have not seen this film to open your heart to what most must agree to be one of the greatest movies ever made. The music score by John Barry is my favourite movie soundtrack and I suggest that you listen to the soundtrack if you can. Perfect, perfect, perfect, this film is a very precious thing which will transport you to the American frontier, presented in all its wonder and glory. A MUST SEE!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems that films that achieve both critical and financial success, directed by successful actors will always gain their share of controversy. Mel Gibson's "Temptation of the Christ" comes to mind as a recent example, as well as Kevin Costner's "Dances With Wolves". The critics may have their say, but Costner's 1991 Best Picture effort is epic in all of it's facets, from the gorgeous cinematography to the heartfelt saga of Native American peoples and their treatment at the hands of the white man.I'm constantly enthralled by the lyrical names of Indians; this film offers Chief Ten Bears, Wind in His Hair, Stone Calf, Kicking Bird, and Stands With a Fist. Generally the names say something about a person's character or physical traits, certainly a lot more colorful than Smith or Jones. Even Indian language contains reverence for nature and life that is not found in most other tongues, and sadly so in an increasingly furious paced world.Lieutenant John Dunbar (Costner) learned this for himself when relegated to an abandoned 'soldier fort' by a pants pissing, suicidal commanding officer at Fort Hays. His journey would be filled with physical demands and frustration attempting to communicate with his newly discovered Sioux friends, yet the relationship goes both ways, and the Sioux are in constant amazement at this soldier who 'dances with wolves' on the prairie. One of the movie's great scenes and a favorite of mine as well is the one where Dunbar, Kicking Bird (Graham Greene) and Stands With a Fist (Mary McDonnell) attempt to teach each other their names. At least 'Dumb Bear' didn't stick with the lieutenant.Set in 1863, the movie does well not to mention any of the famous historical figures of the era from either race, as many films are prone to do. So we have no reference to Custer, Sitting Bull or Crazy Horse. Also unusual is the placement of a warring Pawnee raiding party in hostile opposition to the more peaceful Sioux tribe. Depicting their savagery in the attack on wagon driver Timmons (Robert Pastorelli) who pleads mercy for his mules, director Costner appears to be offering a balance to his film, showing that good and evil can be found in all races and cultures. The message running throughout the film is that taking the time to learn about someone who's different can be a life changing experience."Dances With Wolves" can be viewed, understood and enjoyed on many levels, and it has aged well since it's 1990 release. It transcends it's Western genre limitations and offers the viewer a glimpse of what could be a better way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll save you the time it takes to watch this film. White = bad. I don't know if Costner simply took at face value what his "Native advisors" were telling him, but he should've done more homework. (Were there any Pawnee advisors on this film, by the way?) Some of the period details are right on, many are not. Books such as "Death on Horseback" will give a much better idea of the "frontier" at this time. Costner's hamfisted, cliched direction not only obscures many facts about the pacification on the "west" (both pro and con from the "white" point of view) but does so in WAY too many frames. To think that this bloated, slow, snoozefest beat out "Goodfellas" for best picture! Good thing, too, that he happened to stumble across a good looking white girl with a nice feminist name! "Stands with a fist"...(groan.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kevin Costner's 1990 epic won a bundle of Oscars for a moving, engrossing story of a white soldier (Costner) who singlehandedly mans a post in the 1870 Dakotas, and becomes a part of the Lakota Sioux community who live nearby. The film may not be a masterpiece, but it is far more than the sum of good intentions. The characters are strong, the development of relationships is both ambitious and careful, the love story between Costner and Mary McDonnell's character is captivating. Only the third-act portrait of white intruders as morons feels overbearing, but even that leads to a terribly moving conclusion. Costner's direction is assured, the balance of action and intimacy is perfect--what more could anyone want outside of an unqualified masterpiece?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As others have noted, this is politically correct but that is the only way in which the word "correct" (meaning not wrong) could be applied. In every other way (especially factually), it is so unlikely so as to be almost a parody. These vignettes are as realistic as all the good teeth on display. In fact, there was good behavior and awful behavior on both sides and while it is pretty to watch, by being so simplistic and one-sided it does more harm than good in terms of stating the obvious, that there was plenty of cruelty on both sides. Certainly, white captives, if they lived, rarely looked like the first runner up in a beauty pageant. In this case, a more balanced version would have been more intelligent and helpful but perhaps less pretty to watch. It is a pity that an opportunity to teach rather than preach was missed and all those gorgeous 20th century smiles went to waste.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I understand that criticism of Kevin Costner's epic is that it takes a simplistic look at the Old West. I don't think that does "Dances with Wolves" justice. Even though much of the movie did have a similar plot to "Little Big Man", it was still a fine piece of work. Having the Lakota speak their own language gave the movie an extra feeling of realism. One could say that Costner's character started to live authentically only after he befriended the Lakota.We could be cynical and say that the movie features a white savior - and also note that Costner's next directorial effort was "The Postman" - but "Dances with Wolves" is still a movie that people should see. Like "McCabe and Mrs. Miller", it refutes the idealized image of the Old West that audiences saw in John Wayne movies. It shows the true history of the United States. I don't know if I would call it the best movie of 1990 (a year that also gave us "Goodfellas" and "Misery"), but it's still up there. It's good to know that in the 25 years since the movie's release (to the month), people have taken a more serious look at our treatment of the indigenous peoples, to the point where some cities no longer celebrate Columbus Day.I recommend the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films in cinema history!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whether you are a fan of Kevin Costner or not, "Dances with Wolves" is a must see! Despite this film's impressive running time of 3 hours, it actually feels shorter than that once the powerful story plot draws you into the world of the Civil War era. Costner, Greene, and McDonnell should have all received Oscars for their performances, as this film was that good! I was amazed at how well the writers were able to portray the Native American life, too, as it is hard to come by a film that does this so well.Costner basically plays a Civil War lieutenant that comes across a Native American Sioux tribe while on his journey to the frontier. Over time, he eventually befriends the tribe. Not long after, he falls in love with one of the tribe's family members, named Stands With A Fist, a woman who they took in from another family after she tragically lost her husband. They end up marrying each other.Costner's character, John Dunbar, is then given the Sioux name "Dances With Wolves" after the tribe leader, Kicking Bird, played brilliantly by Graham Greene, notices Dunbar playing around with a wolf that he names "Two Socks." Later on, Dunbar is captured by some soldiers of the Civil War and is pressed for answers as to why he is wearing Native American clothing even though he claims to be enlisted in the Civil War. He later tells them that his name is "Dances With Wolves" and that he is a member of the Sioux tribe. Knowing this information, the soldiers attempt to kill Dunbar, but their plans are foiled when the Sioux tribe intervenes and takes back Dunbar. Back at the tribe's camp, Dunbar then announces to the entire tribe that they should move their camp so that the soldiers won't know where to find them. They quickly object Dunbar's proposal. In response to this, Dunbar then announces that he plans to leave the tribe behind, and his wife, Stands With A Fist, also agrees to go with him. As they are leaving, the film ends with the tribe giving Dunbar a Native American salute as a way of thanking him for all that he has done for them.In summary, "Dances With Wolves" is one of those films that makes you feel like you are really there. It is simply an extraordinary masterpiece. The bottom line? See this film. You won't regret it!</fullReview>

John Dunbar a Civil War Hero Stationed out West. Mary McDonnell(Battlestar Galactica) as Jack Dawson as Stands With A Fisthis movie probably disappoints viewers who are looking for sheer entertainment. It's a quiet, thoughtful story, and although there is action in it the focus is on how the action transforms the characters (particularly Dunbar) rather than on the action itself. You won't see any computer-generated comic-book characters in this movie, but you will see real people having real conversations, and you'll see Costner and costar Mary McDonnell engaging in such intimate and convincing love scenes that you'll forget they're acting!If I could rate the musical score for this movie by itself I'd give it a perfect 10, because it's one of the best I've ever heard, able to stand on its own but fitting the movie like a glove. It is sentimental without being schmaltzy, noble without being pretentious. Best of all, it captures the hesitant emotions of the story, the sense of curiosity overcoming fear and becoming trust.Only this movie's extreme length works against its total success, particularly in the special edition that runs nearly four hours. The three-hour theatrical version is still long, but it's difficult to say what should have been left out of it.Some people still resent the fact that Costner won the Best Director Oscar over Scorcese's Goodfellas. There's no question that Scorcese is the better director, but I believe the direction of Dances With Wolves is better than that of Goodfellas. If you disagree with me try this test: imagine that Scorcese did this movie, and Costner directed Goodfellas. It's a question of which directing job is better, not which director is better.Unlike most epics, this movie ends exactly as it should. The final images, such as the journal floating down the river, the white man and the Native American speaking English to each other, and the brave shouting his farewell from the top of a cliff, are so beautiful and dreamlike that they. Even Though The Good, The Bad and Ugly is great Costner's Dances With Wolves tops its and Its The best Out of the Western Genre 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A multi-Oscar winning film starring Kevin Costner as Lt. John Dunbar, who accidentally leads Union troops to a victory during the Civil War. While in the western frontier, he meets a wolf and a Native American tribe. There he befriends the Indians, learns their way of life and falls in love with a woman within the tribe. What results is an interesting story of friendship, culture, adventure and romance. At four hours long, there is plenty of room for this movie's plot to lose steam and drag on for several minutes; however, I've found this film to be somewhat captivating, from what I remember. This film didn't need to rely on hardcore action, over-the-top comedy or crude humor and tear-jerking love relationships to make the plot entertaining; instead, (politics aside) it relied on the beauty of the Native American setting, their culture and how Dunbar assimilates into his new life, his romance on the side with Mary McDonnell's character and the adventures that awaits him in making the story interesting. A pretty good movie, overall.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd heard plenty about DANCES WITH WOLVES over the years and suspected it to be a war film, akin to BRAVEHEART. Instead, it turns out to be something completely different; it's a slow-moving drama, filled with romance and pathos, in which the action is limited to just a few brief scenes.Instead, this film is an ode to the Sioux Indians in the same way that THE LAST SAMURAI is an ode to the ancient warriors of Japan. Through a process of gentle reflection, we get to witness their customs, their rituals and the way of life they enjoyed shortly before their culture was subsumed by the new-wave Americans. As director and star, Kevin Costner is in his element, carefully crafting what is undoubtedly his best film.It's a thorough and compelling piece of film-making, featuring fine performances (particularly Graham Greene and Rodney A. Grant) and some quite wonderful cinematography. Although the narrative is very slow-moving - and the theatrical cut alone runs for 3 hours - it's never boring, instead completely engrossing. I particularly liked the way the animals - such as the horse and the wolf - have characters all of their own. There's a sense of foreboding as the story progresses, and the last hour in particular is tragic beyond belief and had me in tears. A masterpiece.</fullReview>

Like walking all the way across the river, to take a shave. And in the process leaving rifle and gun far behind in the cabin, even when he knew there were Indians around, and he could just as easily have done it 10 paces from he's sleeping quarters. But It got it's humorous moments too, and its not a bad film. It's nice that they have taken the time and effort to make all the Indians talk native instead of fluent English. Kevin somewhat overplay he's part a lot in a some places. But all in all I'll give it full house cause of the visual scenery</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A revolutionary Motion Picture.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a movie. I have no word to describe how much I've enjoyed this movie. It is one of the best creations I have ever experienced. And Kevin Costner,he acted fantastically. He made this movie with unparalleled skill of direction. The Sioux people, their lifestyle,dialect,and culture has been depicted and detailed in a very artistic way. The background music was excellent. A 10 out of 10. I think the relation between Lt.John J Dunbar and Sioux people was the most interesting and significant part of the story. It happened in a very naturalistic and realistic way that it will easily win anybody's heart. I loved the first kissing scene of Dunbar and Stands With a Fist. It was very emotional. Surely a revolutionary motion picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching this movie, I felt a little depressed. At the end of the movie, Indian died and lost their land. All their properties were taken by the white. I am sad for those friendly and lovely Indian guys. White groups acted as robbers invade the land where Indians lived generation to generation. The white, Evils in Indian eyes, unfairly conquered their land by weapons. However, the main role, "dances with wolves", in the movie is a brave and insistent guy who deserve to be venerated. In the wild environment, he could only rely on himself and struggled for his life. It was really tough for him. In his tough time, an Indian tribe helped them a lot which reversed his attitude on Indian people.Finally, he become a member of that Indian tribe and married an Indian woman. When everything was going well, white groups came. They arrested dances with wolves and cruelly treated him. Eventually, they took over the Indian land. The old wolf which is the only company of dances with wolves left me a deep impression. There was a particular emotion between dances with wolves and the wolf. When dance with wolves set a fire near his camp and danced round the fire, the wolf was the only audience. The wolf was following dances with wolves when he was riding a horse. Many scenes could tell the harmony between dances with wolves and the wolf. Nevertheless, what a shame that people could get along with wild environment and cruel animals but could not get along with other people who have different background. In the end of the movie, it seemed to be a satire that the story of dances with wolves began with that he tries to get away from the white society and ended with that he arrested by white people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lt. John Dunbar, who was less ambitious, became the survival and even hero in the end of the Civil War, which was out of imagination.Dances with Wolves, which is a about 4 hours lasting movie, makes me lost in thought for a whole afternoon. Although it is pretty prolonged, the narration is quite concise in this movie. In my personal point of view, generally, this movie tells a story about the harmony between human races and nature. Dances with Wolves takes more emphasis on "fusion", which means human beings, animals and nature can be in empathy even though their languages are not commonly used among them.It seems to me that it is the desire from humans breaks the harmony. In the end of the movie, it said that "Thirteen years later, their homes destroyed, their buffalo's gone, the last band of free Sioux submitted to white authority at Fort Robinson, Nebraska. The great horse culture of the plains was gone and the American frontier was soon to pass into history." Those white man who stands for advance won the war finally, they destroyed the Indians' home and even despoiled their lives. Just like the Anti-Jew situation movement in the Second World War, the alarming unfairness should be paid more attention, however, it happens everyday indeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie "Dances with Wolves" it is the first American western movie in the decades. So it has special position in the film history. The director Kevin Costner choose an unpopular theme, and revive an almost dying kind of film. Secondly, the most important point in this movie that it is changed value of traditional western movie. It is not just a film just talk about white personal heroism, it is jump out of the personal heroism. But talk about the culture conflict and understand between the North America and original people. I think "Dance with Wolves" has become the most anthropological spirit of the western movie.The first half of the film is based on the perspective of U.S. Lieutenant Dunbar went into a strange world. The film was showed the white people and original people in the same place to the audience, is not just the white people as an explorers to identify the Sioux life, actually it is an observation based on western value. There is a very long time they spoked Sioux language. The purpose of this I think the director is going to create a view, which Sioux and white people stood outside the value and let the audience to evaluate and think the main conflict between them. And the make audience stand on the value neutral attitude towards the history between the whites and the Sioux.I think from this movie it has related to the class I am taking now, American Ways. The contradiction in the film is the core value. The white people is intruder and they from Europe it has so many different with original people. So the movie showed a culture conflict between them, and through the story let audience understand the difference between them . At the beginning Sioux and Dunbar have been tested of each other. To Dunbar he faced is the "barbarians"&#xff0c;when he found Sioux were not as he heard to burning and looting, he tried to get close to them. Among the many Sioux elder, there are some people want to learn the strange thing, but even both of them are willing to lay down their own subjective value judgment, try to understand each other, it still has a lot conflict, culture conflict. There was a plot impressed me is when Dunbar achieved tribal trust and help them hunting and lost his hat. In the evening banquet, Dunbar see his hat is on other people's head and he proposed him to return his hat but they were rejected, and it almost lead to conflict. Because Dunbar think hat is his, after he lost ,pick up the man should return it to him. This is a typical Western-style thinking, obligation. But Sioux think as a trophy should not only belong to him nut also for all people who has question of ownership, are considered to be his challenge. Because in Sioux society, brave and skilled warriors have very high social status, and the warrior is also the best hunter. From this we can see different types of people have different cultures, different experience in their life and lead to a huge difference in the values.From this movie I have a deep recognize in American history and their value and culture. The different of national value and the self-centered civilization are all come from their own life experience. Because of way of production and the objective environment, so that all knowledge of the entire world, philosophy are derived from the experience of their lives. So I think it is really difficult to accept strange culture and value because of our own life experience so we could go to understand each other's lifestyle and habits, and think about their own civilized society works.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beautiful film that tells a heartfelt resurrection story with Kevin Costner doing magnificent work behind and before the camera. His performance is his career best as it slowly shows his progression from being a Civil War soldier to becoming a Native Indian. Sadly it has become undeservedly bashed throughout latter years, without no particularly good reason, as the film was somewhat revolutionary in its time and tells a simple, square story that holds a fine pace and precision. Great cinematography shows some stunning North American landscape and is brilliantly accompanied by John Barry's soundtrack that undermines the political aspects, the loving relationships and the quest for soul.</fullReview>

Sure, Shawshank is #1 but DwW is about something that the world is mostly scared to admit - the sufferance of indigenous populations under the 'civilisation' of more aggressive nations. There are lessons to be had here, and I do hope that we come to acknowledge our historical misdemenours and this film should be part of a curriculum in certain places!The filming is amazing, the pace is excellent and the finale is filled with emotional triumph.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kevin Costner's best..... hats offffff !!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I got an opportunity to watch this movie 6 months ago but never got time to review this title @ IMDb... This movie is truly spellbinding. Although i never prefer Hollywood films which are so long but with 'Dances with Wolves' you can sit for 3 hrs. without getting annoyed at any point.The film directed by Kevin Costner is artistic yet very simple. I don't know if he has any other title which is so much popular. The story portrays the terminal era of Red Indians with different perspective.. It is normally believed that the tribes including these people were cunning as well as brutal. But in this film the other side of the coin has been highlighted. It has been shown how American armed forces try to conquer their land so that they can exploit it for their own advantage. Their operation almost leads to the extinction of a community in whole.Kevin Costner has crafted this film so beautifully that the ethical beliefs, customs and rituals of the Red Indians are shown in the most mesmerizing fashion. This film clearly delivers us a message that if someone wants to form a bond of care and affection then language is certainly not a barrier.There are numerous reasons due to which one can go for this film. The set decoration, the costume, the direction and of course, the plot. Overall, this film has truly justified with its 1991 Academy Award nominations and wins.Go and watch this movie... you'll never regret it !! 9/10 Highly recommended ....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most spectacular pictures EVER!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a 14-year-old boy who enjoy the classics. My friends said they are so old and so boring. I used to think the same, though. And not until I watched Dances with Wolves did I realized why all classics are said to be the foundation of the film industry. I started to enjoy watching classics since that day. But none of other classics, in my opinion only, can surpass Dance with Wolves.Now, I'm gonna talk something about the movie. The story was so good that it could be the best story ever told. It's a pity that 19 years later, Avatar use the same story. But trust me, Avatar, by no means, can surpass this magnificent classic. Not only because it's the 1st movie that brings us the story, but also well written and carefully made.The acting was good too. But I don't think it's the best that Kevin Costner could give us. He could have done better. But what am I thinking? He did such a great job in direction and producing, I cannot blame him for not winning the Academy awards, can I? The rest of the cast did fine job too.The sound was great, it's so suitable with the view of the wilderness of the place. I could barely realize when I started to got suck to the movie by the sound, and the view.In short, Kevin Costner was the right man for the job. He made a masterpiece. It's a pity that Dances with Wolves didn't get high point on top IMDb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Totally Baffles Me How This Could Be Considered One of The Worst Oscar-Winning Films Ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What do Oliver!, Annie Hall, Gandhi, Shakespeare in Love, and Chicago all have in common? All won the Academy Award for Best Picture and are said to have unrightfully snubbed the win from superior movies of that given year. Unlike the films I just named, Dances With Wolves was very deserving and I consider it to be one of the best Oscar- winning films ever made. People say this robbed Goodfellas of 1990's win--an argument I completely disagree with. Taking place during America's colonialism days, Dances With Wolves is about a lonely, depressed Lieutenant named John Dunbar. He is assigned to a remote outpost near Indian tribes. He spends a few weeks alone, and is eventually befriended by the Sioux tribe where he finds a new purpose in life and is more happy than he has ever been.Don't get me wrong, I love Goodfellas. But it honestly shocks me to see how many people trash this movie just because they liked Goodfellas more. Honestly, that is pure immaturity. It seems like any movie about the mafia is everybody's choice for the year's best film. When you really watch both films, Wolves is clearly the superior achievement. Let's examine why Dances With Wolves is so much better than Scorsese's masterpiece.In Goodfellas, Martin Scorsese uses pop tunes from respective eras that fit scene well. Problem is, the tunes are so good that they are distracting. John Barry is one of the greatest composers in the history of cinema and the music he creates for Dances With Wolves is so monumental. Compare the song "Then He Kissed Me" to John Dunbar's theme. Obviously Dunbar is victorious.Martin Scorsese uses every tool he knows to create a fun crime pic that really explores the regular life of a mobster. The dialogue is dynamite, the acting is great, and the filming techniques are awesome. Check out the "Funny How?" scene; Karen and Henry going to the nightclub; Henry becoming a drug addict. These are all iconic scenes well done by a talented director. Problem is, the entire movie glorifies the mafia! It makes the mob out to be great fiends who have your back no matter what and you can live the life of a king. That is sending the wrong message! This must've really inspired people to join mob families. When the mafia betrays Henry Hill, it is his fault. He blew it. He was an idiot! The other big problem I have is you can tell this is a movie. Goodfellas feels like a super long trailer. Voiceovers happen way too much, there's lots of freeze-frames, very short shots, ultimately failing to sweep the audience up into the movie's world. No let's get back to Dances With Wolves. Dances With Wolves, Barry Lyndon, and Gone With The Wind are the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. Kevin Costner's epic creation is enthralling and involving, anybody that sees it will be blown away. Sure Scorsese uses great filming techniques, but what about Costner? Certain shots of the people in the landscape and rising the horses are just as (if not more) affective. The cinematography, costumes, music, sets, landscape and weather are all as gorgeous as can be. Just because it is long does that automatically make it good? No. But Dances With Wolves is truly amazing and will guarantee pull the viewer right into the movie's world. This is still one of the most immersive movies I have ever seen.So Dances With Wolves clearly has the better look, acting (as a whole), music, and feel. But it also has the better premise. This movie is about a man who has always been involved in violence and hate, but wants peace in his life. Goodfellas is about a kid who sees violence and wants to become a part of it, using everything to his advantage. This is about how man can change himself for the better. Calling Goodfellas the far superior films is severe immaturity. I remember my first beer too.If Goodfellas was an instrument, it would be a harmonica. If Dances With Wolves was an instrument, it would be a harp. If Goodfellas was an accessory, it would be a headband. If Dances With Wolves was an accessory, it would be a 24-karat diamond ring. Every frame in Dances With Wolves looks like it belongs in a national art museum.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are movies you can't just never end to love. Movies which touch you to the very deep of your soul and never leave it. Movies which are there to teach you a lesson in life you should never forget.I consider Dances with Wolves as such. Despite its amazing length of 3 hours, I wish it would last more as I feel inhabited by the spirit and the beauty of this movie.I'm mesmerized by the beauty of the Frontier. It's revealing its majesty throughout the picture with those gorgeous mountainous and woody landscapes. It gives you an impression of freedom far away from our civilization. It's also powerful as those herds of buffaloes are running in the wilderness. It's a tribute to the Nature beauty before it's slowly taken over by humanity which is not such a good thing as all we are able to do is to destroy everything.The story itself is a life lesson about trying to learn from each other despite our evident differences and live together instead of destroying each other. It's a story about humanity, tolerance and respect. Some values we tend to lose so often. Throughout John Dunbar, we learn that the best way to survive is through peace and that people we consider as ruthless enemies can become our friends if we start to understand and learn from our differences.The casting is just awesome. Kevin Costner is inhabited as Lt John Dunbar, a US Army officer who survived the horror of the Civil war and on his own request decide to retire as a Frontier man. There is a feeling of freedom transpiring from him. The scene when he dances around the fire is so emotional and beautiful. Mary McDonnell's performance as Standing With Fists is as aerial and gracious as she can be. She is making such a sweet couple with Kevin Costner. The duo is perfectly completed by Graham Greene as the watchful and protective More Kicking Birds.To be honest everyone is playing its part well even the US soldiers who torture Kevin Costner as they consider him as a traitor. They are giving chills and despise, a sign of their acting talent.I cant give anything else but a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Easy Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dances With Wolves is directed by Kevin Costner and stars Kevin Costner as Lieutenant Dunbar, a Civil War soldier that decides to stay at a soldier outpost for a few years, all by himself. He eventually makes friends with the nearby Sioux Indians, and begins to understand their struggle under the white man's rule of America. He eventually earns the Indian name "Dances With Wolves," hence the title. Now, this movie is just a few minutes under four hours, and every minutes worth it. This movie won best picture in 1991, and it really earned it. In my opinion, at least, this is among the best films ever made.This was Kevin Costner's directorial debut, and that blows my mind. He does so good behind the camera, as well as in front of it. The directing and cinematography in this film make the prairie look so beautiful. Just as with a more recent movie, The Martian (2015), the cinematography makes something that seems bland or boring look stunning.As mentioned above, Kevin Costner does great in this movie. I honestly think this is the best he's ever done on screen. His co stars, Mary McDonnell and Graham Greene, do amazing as well. All of the acting is great. The score is also great. The score sucks you right into the film, and portrays the tone of the current scene wonderfully. Thanks to John Barry for that.The last great thing I'd like to praise is the run time. I normally don't enjoy an over longed movie, and believe that it can take away from the pacing of the film. This has been common in films such as Interstellar (2014). However, if the crew shaved off an hour or so of this movie, it would be too quick. Clocking this film in at four hours was a perfect choice. Absolutely perfect. By the time the credits rolled, I had almost broke tears, and was gasping for more of this masterpiece.Overall, I loved Dances With Wolves. It is definitely a classic, and will stand for a long time. I give Dances With Wolves an A+, or a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

It was a thoughtful, funny, exciting, literate, suspenseful and a gloriously beautiful movie which truthfully showed an embarrassing part of white colonialist history (the same of which occurred in many countries throughout the world). It had a lot of the spectacle and intelligence of "Lawrence Of Arabia", another of the best 15 movies of all time. Please don't be offended by the criticism of whites...we deserve it.

		<fullReview>This is a beautiful fairytale. It is a movie, it is well done, beautiful to look at and get caught up in. It is not a history lesson, it is not the truth. It is a beautiful fairytale.Why is it a fairytale? Because homo sapien is a mixture of good and evil in all races, creeds, and colors. Understanding that this is the way real people are, then it should be clear to anyone that views this that the Sioux are portrayed as a perfect people - full of life and inner character. Clearly then this is a fairytale.But this is "LaLa-land" at its best. It's called entertainment. And indeed that it did for the 2+ hrs. it caught my attention. (I tuned in ~25 mins. late w/o missing anything of substance - Costner (aka Dunbar) settles into the far off fort.)About thirty years ago another similar "Indian noble, whiteman is death" genre film was made that everyone applauded called "Little Big Man." The style, story, and movie are basically the same. So as entertainment goes, we haven't changed with respect to this genre. Why? Because it's entertainment - an escape into a beautiful village filled with beautiful people living a beautiful life... unlike anything any of us have ever seen on this (or any :) planet past, present, or future!You want the truth? Read plenty of books. I wanted to be entertained, and I was.Just as I stated in my comment about "Once Were Warriors" this movie is really about a technological people's culture clashing with a non-technological people's culture. Technology will always win... unless you're a Martian, then only non-technology will save us. (ahem, remember War of the Worlds? :)Ok. So my point is that IT'S ONLY ENTERTAINMENT! It is not the truth - you want the truth? Start learning about/reading history. You may find out that history is far more fascinating, interesting, dramatic, and intriguing than any Hollywood movie can ever be. Why? Because it really did happen :)- ZafoidPS: Maybe one day, when we finally meet a native people when we step out of our spaceship we will be smarter. But as for now our past history is rife with the mistreatment of a native people. Will we change? ...don't ask Hollywood, they'll still be making the same good vs evil flicks... and I'll still be going to get entertained. :)- Z</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Western Re-Invented</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an occasional series I look back at films I have loved (to death) and muse on why with the vain hope that some of you will dust them off again and plunge right in all over again. They need to be re-watched. They're worth it.This time; Dances with Wolves, brought to us by a very wise and brilliant young actor (at that time) called Kevin Costner (you've probably heard of him!)NB: This was what turned Kevin Costner into gold dust for a few years (remember Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves). Costner was King Midas basically until his sparkly, shiny star reached its apogee with his untimely filmic demise in the utterly ridiculous and overblown (and over-budget) Waterworld. (Holds head in hands; Kevin what were you thinking!)I fell in love with Dances With Wolves in 1990 and then recently again when I tried to force my 13 and 15 year old to watch it. Their response was the inauspicious; "It's a bit boring dad," as they vacated the sofa 32 minutes in. But I contend here Calum and Adam that you're just not quite ready for it yet and don't be surprised if it cycles round again sneakily one Friday Family Film Night soon. Dances With Wolves is genius, a slim novel of 1988 vintage written by Michael Blake with his eyes on a possible screenplay prize, it was bought hook, line and sinker by Costner who yummed it up so much he starred, directed and drummed up the finance for it over the next few years. It became Costner's labour of love and at the same time he re-invented the Western form for Hollywood so they could fall in love with it again in a post-modern way with a whole lot less stubble and a whole lot more human heart.Dances With Wolves has Oscar written all over it and I fell head over in heels in love with it when I was a (still extremely naive and immature) twenty-two year old. Where to start then on this gorgeous-fest of love, hope, humanity and sheer cinematographical brilliance?Is it with Timmons the hapless mule-train driver who first takes the naive and idealistic John Dunbar (the solider fresh from the horrors of the Civil War) that Costner plays out to the Frontier, a sea of prairie where so-called civilisation hasn't reached yet? (Poor Timmons dies brutally - and brilliantly - the victim of some Pawnee Indians tracking back to their home-lands after a patrol. His scalping is so visceral we can almost hear (at an appropriate distance) the skin unzipping from the skull!)Or perhaps we should start with Kicking Bird (played by Graham Greene) the thoughtful and wise young brave who first visits the decimated Fort Sedgwick after John Dunbar first arrives.Or perhaps it is simply the vast, swaying grasslands of the mid-west, an ocean of Buffalo for mile upon mile? A landscape the sky was invented for, a landscape to put us in our mortal place.Or perhaps it's the sweeping John Barry soundtrack or incredible long, lugubrious shoots of the Dakota Badlands and the in-your-face wilderness of a country as yet untamed.At root the reason why so many of us love this film is the production values for the whole project, from cinematography through to the language coaching the Native American actors underwent so they spoke Lakota convincingly. Everything on this movie is sumptuous (except perhaps the budget, note to self Mr Costner) and it is strong and powerful theme of the story, revisited endlessly in mini-echoes throughout its three hour duration, that brings home such a resounding narrative success. Dances With Wolves works because the story is simple and straight as a Pawnee arrow and it strikes right to our hearts. It is about what we truly are, as individuals and as a species. It is about heart and head, family, connections and the wisdom of living together with tolerance and in harmony with our world. It is about the wind in our hair and the sun on our backs, it is about simply being as opposed to being something.The story is a back-to-nature tale of John Dunbar's gradual re-education about the so-called Savages the great White Man is expunging from America's heartland. It is an Alice Through The Looking Glass narrative where Dunbar very soon realizes, whilst amongst the metaphorical wolves of the title, it is his own kind, White Man, who are the savages. The story of this film was totally ripped off in Avatar, same idea, just with eleven foot smurf aliens and some eye-popping CGI. What Dances With Wolves has in spades which its newer and bluer rip off didn't (and I totally loved Avatar too) is that it helped reinforce a revisionist tack on the Great American West, actually much more like genocide than a heap of swaggering John Wayne gunslingers ever let on. Of course the Native American life-style is romanticized in this film, the wars between tribes, the pointless politics and the diseases and famines of a neolithic society are all glossed over, but we can forgive all that. It's ultimately an extended apology for all the Cowboy and Indians nonsense that went gone before. The Wild in West was the White Man's rapacious and violent land-grab and in Dances With Wolves we get to see that barbarism from the other end of the telescope. Not pretty or pleasant, but a truer account than most Westerns.Go on, buy it again and re-watch it. It deepens our humanity and succeeds in upsetting me deeply every single time I watch it.***** (Five Stars)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Simple Story That 's Magnificently Told</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dances with Wolves is an epic film that stars,produced and directed by Kevin Costner. It is a film adaptation of the book of the same title by Michael Blake that tells the story of a Union Army lieutenant who travels to the American frontier to find a military post, and his dealings with a group of Lakota Indians.Mary McDonnell,Graham Greene and Rodney A. Grant co-star to play key supporting roles.This historical drama about the relationship between a Civil War soldier and a band of Sioux Indians was also a surprisingly popular hit, considering its length, period setting, and often somber tone.The movie opens on a particularly dark note, as melancholy Union lieutenant John W. Dunbar attempts to kill himself on a suicide mission, but instead becomes an unintentional hero. His actions lead to his reassignment to a remote post in remote South Dakota, where he encounters the Sioux. Attracted by the natural simplicity of their lifestyle, he chooses to leave his former life behind to join them, taking on the name Dances with Wolves. Soon, Dances with Wolves has become a welcome member of the tribe and fallen in love with a white woman who has been raised among the tribe. His peaceful existence is threatened, however, when Union soldiers arrive with designs on the Sioux land.The film may not be a classic but it is definitely a masterpiece since it is far more than the sum of good intentions. The characters are strong, the development of relationships is both ambitious and careful, the love story is captivating. Only the third-act portrait of white intruders as morons feels overbearing, but even that leads to a terribly moving conclusion. Costner's direction is assured, the balance of action and intimacy is perfect.It is a simple story that is magnificently told.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm certain that scripts like this one come along maybe once, or twice (if lucky), in a Director's lifetime. It takes such a high level of expertise and talent to convey a story in such a way that it moves an audience emotionally. This film contains all of the elements necessary to do just that; capture someone's attention and in the process entertain both satisfactorily, as well as thoroughly. I can understand the accolades given for the cinematography of this film, the beauty and majesty of the open plain was captured here in its most basic of elements. In fact, I can understand all 7 of the Academy Awards this film has garnered, the story is told with such great skill you don't even mind that more than half the film is in subtitles. In fact, this element just seems to reinforce the impact of this cinematic epic. Kevin Costner has always been an interesting, accomplished actor, however, he has attained pure excellence in his direction of this film.When I think of excellence in dramatic films few come to mind, this just happens to be one of them. Brilliant, beautiful job!! Par excellence!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not in the top 250??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since when a movie has been quoted "bad" because of it's lenght? I know Die Hard 4.0 was too long, I know Alexander was too long but I really can't understand the complains about the lenght of this masterpiece. In my opinion the length of a movie becomes a trouble when the viewer starts watching the clock. I remember sitting in my chair gasping over the tremendous amount of feelings this movie makes me feel.Dances with the wolves (1990) is a story about John Dumbar, a "hero" of the U.S army which decides to go to an abandoned little fort in Indian land. Without spoiling the storyline the movie tells the story of an era where the colour of your face and the culture of your people rejects you from the right to be treated like a human being.I really cannot praise this movie enough and I really advise EVERYONE to see the director's cut, which is over 3h long but really, after seeing it, where would you cut?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic of the New Western Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some spoilers ahead.This movie deservedly won its Oscars and its accolades. It s a wonderful film of the "New Westerns." This movie moves beyond old stereotypes of cowboys and Indians, and who is heroic and who is not to provide fleshed-out characters and anti-heroes. In this instance, the American Indians are not portrayed in simple black-and-white terms, but instead are portrayed as three-dimensional human beings. Graham Greene is terrific as the Sioux chief in this movie. Kevin Costner does well as the complex and mentally troubled John Dunbar, who finds a renewed sense of being when he lives among the Sioux.Some people have criticized this movie for engaging in "reverse stereotypes," i.e. that the whites are portrayed as villains and the Indians as noble savages. Those with a background in Indian history will also argue that the Sioux were the aggressors on the Great Plains, and that the Pawnee, here portrayed as the villains, lived at the Sioux's mercy in real life. I do not think this movie should be considered perfect history, but I feel that the reverse stereotypes are not extreme, and that, as a work of art, this movie succeeds in providing a compelling story of Dunbar's transformation on the Plains. The historians' complaints are legitimate, however, and I argue that people viewing this for a history class exercise caution when viewing this movie as an example of history rather than a work of fiction.Great acting and a lovely score round out this classic film. My favorite scene is at the very end, where the macho warrior Wind-in-His-Hair tells Dunbar, "can't you see that you are my friend?" Watch it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kevin Costner's greatest work.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a big Kevin Costner fan, either acting or directing. I am not a big fan of 4 hour westerns. So anyone who knows me will tell you it's strange that I like this movie. I hated Kevin Costner's 3 other attempts at directing, and yet this movie is one that I truly enjoy watching. Perhaps because it doesn't involve a post apocalyptic earth covered in water or featuring a postman as the main hero. This tells a believable tale.An American soldier is sent to guard an outpost station and wait for his fellow troops to arrive. Instead he begins to observe local natives who live on that land, and a wolf he nick names "Two-Socks." He ends up getting sucked into the native lifestyle and falls in love with a white woman in the tribe who was raised by them from childhood.Kevin Costner did a good job directing this movie, and it's an epic story that flows really well. This is one of those movies that will last through the ages because it's always going to be relevant. The acting in this movie is really stellar from all except Kevin Costner, who I still feel isn't a great actor. Perhaps who should stay behind the camera and make more movies like this, instead of crap like "The Postman." This isn't a movie that you can sit down and watch over and over and over again, however every once in a while it is a great movie to just sit down and enjoy.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Director's Cut is a great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't watch the theatrical version upon release, I was too young. I'd heard conflicting reviews that it was a) great and b) self indulgent and sluggish.I rented the Director's Cut on DVD not expecting much. After 20 minutes I nearly switched it off - I thought it WAS very self indulgent, over slow and a huge ego trip for Kevin Costner. But I stayed on and about an hour in it suddenly took off and breathed a life (probably around the time the Costner character empties a lake of corpses). I realised that it took time to get into because the world it conveyed was merely being set up. Once into the thrust of the story I was emotionally involved and very impressed with the direction, locations and music. There are some moments of genuine tragedy and real bonding between the Costner character and the Indians. It isn't a documentary about the period, but it does give you a glimpse into that bleak time in American history.Once the film ended I felt that I'd seen a truly epic piece of work. I couldn't imagine watching the theatrical version - goodness knows how you can take an hour off the movie (thank God for DVD). I watched it on a massive projected screen, and in DTS - so it was a truly cinematic experience.Costner deserved his Oscars, but I think it was a one-hit wonder for him. I usually can't stand him but in this instance I take my hat off to you, sir.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the last good western worth watching.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie a long time ago, however I still remember some details. It was a bucolic chant to the nature, even the human nature, and to the Indians' traditional way of living (not always understood). This film doesn't try to transform points of view (like most 1990s movies tried to do later), but only tries to give each one's position (though I still consider that many white men of the US army aren't correctly depicted). The scene in which John Dunbar tries to feed "White Socks" (the wolf), and finally makes it is by far my fave. The way he earned Indians' respect made me feel great. But when he fell prisoner of his own army and caged just like a wild beast, I must confess I felt quite disappointed. Anyway, the whole result is wonderful and, if you user, haven't watched this yet, don't waste the chance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So many have romanticized this era, despite the pall of death obviously borne by the red men. This realistic presentation by default wears a mask of sadness, occasionally and realistically grins (or at least grimaces) when appropriate, and the 'hero' is never certain to win the prettiest girl -- but we're all glad for his choice and her acceptance -- they very much deserve each other.The military is realistically mediocre at best, save for the officers who are worse than chance would have it, proving our suspicions that the good ones always leave to be rid of those diluting the quality pool.While I genuinely loved it, I have only watched it 3 times in 5 years, allowing time to mellow the actions, thereby better objectifying my impressions.

		<shortDescription>Why it was meant for Lt. John Dunbar to encounter the Lakota people.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was very well made throughout because it looked at what Lt. Dunbar did to find his true self. His quest to "see the frontier before it disappeared" was very successful since he met the Lakota people who showed him what life was truly about. I believe Lt. Dunbar found his true inner self among the Lakota people. He never found that among the whites. He felt that there was something wrong, like something was missing in his life and he rightfully needed to go to the frontier to pursue what he needed to find and he found it with ease. However like any other film, there are the usual misconceptions about certain things. For example, the scene where Lt. Dunbar rescued Stands with a Fist from committing suicide before taking her back to the village. When Wind in his Hair approached him to grab her out of his arms, he ordered Lt. Dunbar to leave the village and to leave the Lakota people alone altogether. If this kind of thing happened in real life back then in the 1870's, the warrior would have not only took the woman from him, but he may have wanted to kill him too for just showing up like that among the villagers without warning. If this kind of thing occurred, (with him bringing the woman back) it would not have mattered if he did the right thing. The fact that a WHITE MAN showed his face would be a cause for major concern.Another possible misconception may be that the Pawnee were NOT traditional enemies of the Lakota like the way the film portrays them. Unfortunately the Lakota fought among other Indian Nations at the time but what made it worse was when after the whites arrived, they lured the Indian Nations to each other so that they could fight among themselves. It was sad to see that kind of thing happening. But............. anyways............ thank you kindly once again for allowing me to review on this great film. See ya in the next review. :D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meaningful appreciation of a vanishing culture.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I watched this movie, I almost fell asleep half way through seeing it. I was only 13 years old, so the movie's contents were above my adolescent expectation. Furthermore all conversations in Sioux and Pawnee languages were subbed in mandarin; itself a foreign tongue for me.Today, ten years later, I just have watched it again in its original English format and I'm deeply at awe at the beauty of this film. Physically speaking, the cinematography, setting, lighting and costumes were very well executed/done. But the real strength comes from Blakes' great storytelling and Costner's engaging directing. This film deserved all the credits it is dued. I felt fortunate to also see the movie the second time in its intended 4-hour version, which I believe brings us a fuller picture of a man's journey of self-discovery. What he found is the heart of the land for which he fought for (during the Civil War) and thought he knew. A transformational quest of consummation between the heart, cultures and ways of life. There are moments when I feel that the performances were not genuine enough, but if you think about it, the actors and movie staff had done a great job in capturing the essence of a vanishing culture. Costner's character for instance, is too naive and sweet for a white soldier of his time, but the movie must be made accessible to a wider audience in the US, hence the story is mostly told from his point of view. Having said that, the real heroes in this movie are the Native Americans, who tried to survive the wind of change brought by colonialization.The character of Dunbar has become a tool of narration that essentially tells us a beautiful story. A story about a vanishing culture, a people whose spirit and way of life are the very essence of America. The true America. When this movie was released in Asia, most of the local audiences labeled the movie as being a watchable bad-movie. The truth is the movie's contents resonanced with the local histories. We are doing exactly what the white colonial movement of that time, were doing against the native people. So those who didn't accept the message and learn from it, were disturbed. I have learnt something and absolutely love this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...And what was that, you ask?Quite simple - remind as many people as possible that millions of Native american men, women and children were slaughtered by murderers that stole their land.First-hand accounts are still widely available, senate approved plans of Genocide are similarly available, yet the American public as a whole prefer their history to be served up a la John Ford or refer to it in a silly, tart phrase such as "Manifest destiny".It is, after all, a lot easier to believe what you want to, rather than what is (and which is usually less attractive)I digress. This film has a lot of very good things going for it, The cinematography, the script (mostly), the way the story flows and explains in a believable way what is happening to Lt John Dunbar, it also shows the increasing trepidation on the part of tribes just beginning to come into proximity with the expanding towns and forts. (The way in which the elder presents Dunbar with a Conquistador helmet as his belief that they will remain unaffected is very poignant)It's not a perfect film, but this was Costner's first attempt at directing, and was a whole load better than the laughable "Robin Hood".Costner's not the first actor to want to make such a statement in film and wake people up, Brando tried for twenty years, but the studios did'nt think it would make money.I hope this film will make some people find out more on the subject. Some of what they will find is harrowing, but the truth, already there, needs to be spread to a populace that basically does'nt care.Still.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3hrs running American history lesson: a true masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At last, an historical western epic where most of spectators (except the Lakota ones) feel like intruders. Along with the genre usual tools (roaring music, breath-taking landscapes, etc.), Kostner provide us with the most authentic native tribe portrayal ever captured on film. Here, every single element of the indians daily life is depicted in detail, but far from the documentary style: in fact, everything is showed as part of the story-telling. Then, the linguistic choice. It is here that the movie raises from excellent to memorable: we hear the true language of the natives, their voices sound distant and fascinating, exactly as they must have sounded to Lieut. Jhon J. Dunbar at his first meeting with the Sioux (Michael Blake's novel was about Comanche, though, but while the Comanche language happens to be disappeared with its speakers, Lakota is still spoken in North Dakota Sioux Reservoir. No one ever attempted such a task, not even the righteously famous "new Hollywood" western films, like (Blue Soldier) between many others. The original novel is carefully respected under every other aspect, and the result is a powerful, moving picture of what America once was, and of the people at which expense America has been built. In his directorial debut, Kostner displays what eventually has remained his distinguished mark: a style both magnificent and visionary (the buffalo hunting scene is masterful), with a notable sense of what cinema has to be: something larger than life, but made of life itself.This movie stands, in movie arts, as the greatest tribute Hollywood has ever made to Native Americans, and as a great lesson of national awareness for all who desired to know the dirty, mixed, deep roots of the United States of America.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth Mr. Costner's Career</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes I think that maybe he made a deal with the devil to be able to produce a film with this kind of beauty. I only say that because Kevin Costner has not been very lucky since 1990 when he directed this masterpiece. But that hardly matters. This one film is worth a career. It is a lyrical, savage, and profound work of love and every frame shows it. This film also changed a lot of perceptions about Native Americans at the time. Not many films make it that far into the culture. A look a time when the European culture was beginning to supplant the civilization that preceded it, it has echoes of John Ford in its portrayal of the expansiveness and impermanence of the west, but it has a generosity of spirit toward its protagonists that Ford did not share. It is unfortunate that the film paints such an unqualified picture of the white man as Satan, but in the end, that is how he was perceived by the races he wiped out. It is a moving film set against a huge panorama. It's hard not to say that it is even "important" because that term is usually the kiss of death. But this film sustains your interest from the first frame to the last and leaves you begging for more even as it rips your heart out. See it.</fullReview>

Historically, they did an excellent job of bringing this story to life as a period piece, representing a glimpse of the expanding Western Frontier. The filming was wonderful. The character development of the main character could have used more body. Mr. Costner was excellent in his role; but it felt a little like he was holding back and could've given it more passion. The main Sioux characters were better developed. The story is compelling, and worthy of its awards; but perhaps some of what I was looking for was left on the editing room floor?

		<fullReview>Every time I see it, "Dances with Wolves" touches something ancient in me that still grieves for the loss of the way of life and for the place that was once this land. The line at the end in which the Indian says "I will never forget" especially triggers something within that knows that in another time I lived on those plains and loved them deeply, that I, too, made promises to guard the earth and never, never to forget... Feel the tenderness for the earth as the Sioux man caresses the grasses of his beloved prairies...Feel the passion as Dunbar dances around the campfire. Feel the gentleness of his love for the people and the land. I treasure the sensitivity and spirituality in those who created this masterpiece and find it hard to understand how anyone could seriously fault this brilliant movie. Dunbar's/Costner's transformation into the Sioux way is compelling, stirring, agonizing, funny, beautiful. Thank you, Kevin Costner, if you ever read this, for letting those of us who have these feelings know that we are not alone and that we will never forget. For me, this is more than a film; it's a spiritual journey to the homeland of my soul, perhaps to all human souls, who lived in this way for far longer than we have lived in this modern, built world. This film gives a voice to my heart. And is it the ancient heart of us all?</fullReview>

The ending was sad and left me feeling like it wasn't worth watching. I also didn't like how most of the Indians were portrayed. They seemed blood thirsty and most of their decisions were unjust.

		<shortDescription>Pure Hollywood drivel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie ended up on my TV set against my desire for the 500th time, I have never reviewed it so here goes: This movie was created unwittingly as the poster child of Hollywood political correctness. Everything about it is makeup fantasy that shows no relation to 1870s reality. First of all no one who fought in the Civil War walked away from it resembling a Hollywood pretty boy. The ones that survived lived through dysentery, amputation, blood poisoning, disease, or death. Don't forget in movies you can die and still walk away.In this drama an individual single handedly wins the Civil War by charging on a horse with a sword. In reality he probably would have been made a bureaucrat with a cushy job in the Johnson administration. But no, our pretty boy wants to go west because he is too pure to live in nineteenth century white world. He may be pure but he is still a stupid white guy who doesn't yet know yet how wonderful other races are. Follow closely.Instead, cut to the chase. Evil white world follows him out west and you know the rest. On the way Dances meets a beautiful Hollywood bimbo. In a politically correct western no Hollywood pretty boy (who saved the Union) is going to marry no toothless Indian woman even though (wink wink) Indian women are superior to white women. You see the hierarchy in Hollywood is this: Hollywood bimbo is the center of the universe, the buffalo are next. Then come the Indians who are all equally good - no judgement here. Then comes white women then the rabid dog, then the white male. And That's Hollywood. The cinematography was nice. Of course if made today Dances would by played by a LSMFT - Jim Parsons, Neil Patrick Harris, or Ellen Degeneres? One last note: If a black person had sneaked onto the set all involved would have gotten confused into a catatonic state. What to do then?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched it when it emerged and it was sensational, and not necessarily in a lasting sense. The direction was professional in its ability to bring in the level of response that the audience should have at its very melodramatic points, yet they were indeed melodramatic.On repeated watchings, this film becomes more dull and uninteresting. Films should last more than a decade. This film will not. It is more about late 80s hair styling in the nineteenth century wild west than it is about substance or intrigue. It's not terrible, but it is not lasting.Such is the legacy of many popular films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's with good reason that the AFI regards this film in it's top 100 of all-time ... it's an outstanding film. The authentic scenery in the cinematography, the fascinating characters wonderfully nuanced by great acting, the compelling story, and last but not least the beautiful musical score all combine to make this one of the best films ever.Some of the actors in this film should've won Oscars but didn't. Many people slam KCostner's acting, but i like his style. He never over acts, stays within himself and was absolutely believable as Lt.John Dunbar.Bravo Kevin Costner, well done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw the long version.. Again.. For the 10th time.. And It cracks me up... I laugh.. I cry.. I get mad... I smile.. That film is just what defines perfection.. Kevin Costner does it just as well as an actor... As he does as a director!.. Got to love Kevin for all his work and effort in the movie history.. Its around 4 hours long the special 3disc edition.. But actually.. I wish the film was even longer.. Such a wonderful ferry tail could go on forever for my taste.. I think or KNOW the movie was meant for a lot of things.. To show us how the Indians lived for example.. To show us that the simplest things in life, can be just as great as the big ones.. I don't think I have one bad thing to say about the film. I really, and truly love it.. If you don't like these types of motion picture films, like The Shawshank Redemption, or The Green Mile.. And of course, Dances with Wolves.. Then I guess you have little to do on a site thats meant for true movie fans.. Not that liking the never ending bad Hollywood files thats just meant for raising money is BAD or anything.. I just mean that, someone, who does not like such films.. Should really just stay away from it.. It wasen't even a sad moment when I started to cry... I just wepped because it crossed my mind that... Damn... This movie is extremely well put together.. But, OK... I think I said what I had to say about one of the greatest achievements in the world... So.. I bid you a farewell.. Good night world.. See you tomorrow. ! Peace out.. Eivind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you consider this film awful then you can't say different from The Last Samurai (a film that borrowed the concept from this one), which in fact is in Tom Cruise's part self-indulgent. Although there's been a lot of bad rap about this film gaining awards people forget that this year (2004) a totally undeserving film was showered with Oscars, Lord of the Rings 3. Of course no one complains because it's an adventure fantasy epic containing lots of action (CGI) and pretentious drama. It's easy to hate a film like this one. What's not to hate for today's audience in a film that takes place in the old West with "indians" and a Union captain becoming friends with them. Westerns are not as popular as fantasy epics or even epics at all. By epics I don't mean grandeur quality films like Russian Ark, The Thin Red Line, Andrei Rublev, or The Seven Samurai, but mediocre ones such as Troy. This is a film that John Ford, Howard Hawks, David Lean, and maybe even Kurosawa (who was still alive at the time) would have loved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie left me speechless. It is a Hollywood epic without the "Hollywood epic" feel. It is beautiful in form and content. Costner's camera directs our gaze along the raw, beautiful West without forcing our emotions. It doesn't settle for cheap tricks. The dialogue is devoid of cliches - it is Hemingwayesque in conciseness and in poetry. The story is both a deviously simple tale of a Union soldier encountering Sioux Indians in the unexplored American West and a profound contemplation of deep compassion and love that can develop between people who do not even speak the same language. It is about almost metaphysical, no, entirely metaphysical connections between cultures that transcend our regular forms of communication. It is also about communal and intensely personal growth through an unquenchable curiosity and a desire to understand and learn. "Dances With Wolves" is about listening, not speaking and it is probably the first, and the greatest anti-Western made. It is a phenomenal predecessor to the great "Unforgiven." The cinematography in this movie alone is enough to make one sit through the entire three or four hours (depending on which version you are watching). The cast is phenomenal, the chemistry between them not forced or full of histrionics. In fact, "Dances With Wolves," despite its length, is actually full of profound restraint. More often that not, it is the silences that speak in this film, not the words - a pattern which runs hand in hand with its main themes. And, finally, it is a deeply American movie. It serves as a perfect elegy to the American West as it was in the 1800s and far before. However it is not a movie that seeks to blame (though, as many have pointed, it does not shed good light on the whites), but it is above all a love story which is evident in nearly every frame. Kevin Costner, regardless of whether you like some of his other movies or not, has made a great, deeply intelligent and sensitive film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie You'll Ever See As Long As You Live! Period!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am listening to the soundtrack as I pen these words.For those few folks who have not yet seen this movie....STOP!Go buy the DVD and watch it now.The fondness and attraction I have developed for this Oscar-Winner Squared 10 is beyond what one might expect to receive.In any/all areas of "measuring a films worth" I give it all 10's! It is an adventure,a love story,a cinematic history lesson,a unique and moving journey through time.One of the more striking components is it's absolutely unique treatment of real old west "Indians".A complete departure from the under-done,over-the-top,campy,old west movies which have been slung upon us from birth...Dances With Wolves portrays the most genuinely realistic view of what it must have been like back in that time.Dances completely satisfied this unexplainable yearning in my heart for "us" (the white people)to interact realistically with "them" (the indians).The emotions this true masterpiece has brought out in me places it in a category all by itself.Okay, a word about the soundtrack:Uh, go buy it!If you have ever been moved by a movie score in the least.....go get this one. To say this movie is "well written" does not do the truth justice.You will be drawn in from the first syllable to the last.Your heart will be torn right out of your chest when "Wind-In-His-Hair" shouts..."Can't you see that I am your friend"! Or, again when earlier those wicked U.S.Cavelry guys are shooting at "two socks"!I swear to God,This film will tear you up and wring you out.To any pathetic soul who dared to say it is "too long" I would simply reply....I feel sorry for you,as it is obvious you do not possess a soul.If God put a "soundtrack" together which represented your life......it would sound close to the Dances With Wolves Soundtrack.This glorious film will magically take you into a world from the past which you might not otherwise enter.It is a bonafide once in a lifetime experience.If you think you might enjoy a vicarious trip to the old west...out on the plains:Go see this honest to God work-of-art!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will not belabor the obvious. As the more acute critics of this film have pointed out, this film sentimentalizes and sanitizes Sioux culture.It is, in fact an interesting example of the American equivalent of what Edward Said called "orientalism"., which could be called "indianism". An ideal "indian ' culture is created to act as a kind of American pastoral, an "anti-Industrial" mythos.Of course, there is nothing wrong with good pastoral, nor with an intelligent critique of the excesses of industrialization.However, sentimentality and falsification do not make for good pastoral, nor do self righteousness and pseudo -intellectualism make for intelligent criticism of industrialist materialism. Note here that I do not mean to denigrate or insult the Sioux-or any other American tribe.Their REAL cultures are fascinating. In fact the American Indian actors are uniformly excellent in this film. I have a sneaking suspicion that they were laughing behind their backs at the pompous , guilt ridden, hypocritical naive, paleface, who had come among them to make this film praising their culture. Not a single White man ( other than Costner ) is portrayed as anything other than brute. The only white character other than Costner who is portrayed as having a soul is Stands with a Fist..and she had the good fortune of being kidnapped and having her family massacred by the peace loving Indians. Let me reiterate. This is NOT a pro -Indian film. It is a patronizing, pompous film, with Costner portraying himself as the benevolent Great White God, Finding Himself among the Noble Savages.Repeatedly, Costner echoes Christian iconography and language in an effort to transform his character into some "crucified hero" out of Peckinpah. Someday, people will marvel that Kevin Costner beat out a genius named Martin Scorsese for best director</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see the original movie when it came out in the theaters. I thought it well presented. It drove me to purchase the novel. Now one thing I should point out is the novel and hence the movie is purely fiction.Having said that and reading some of the negative reviews and scorn surrounding the depiction of white people in the movie, I would like to say, are all white people evil? No. Were all Indians evil? No. However, being part Indian I think I have a valid point to make and that same point was made in the movie, "The white man comes and he takes. Without asking." What is not said is because the American mindset is we kill and get what we want because we are better. Manifest Destiny is no more than excused genocide. The US slaughters because it can. If anyone doubts the nastiness of the US all one has to do is to read the letters of General Sheridan, Sherman and others of their ilk. BTW I would also point out the quote, "The only good Indian is a dead one!" didn't originate with Indians. If I have one issue with this movie is it the depiction of white soldiers being the predominant race in the Union Army when they were slaughtering the Sioux. I have no sympathy for the black race calling for reparations as they helped wipe out what was left of the indigenous population. As a matter of fact, the dominant race in the US Army during the Indian wars of the plains was black with white officers.So a movie was finally made that shows the people of the plains as being human. As for the Pawnee, as history shows, all enemies are always reviled. This is true of our time, to whit the Iraqis, so let those of us without sin cast the first stone. I'm sure if a story was presented from the Pawnee point of view they'd be depicted as saints.Notice that all stories show their subjects in the finest of lights, this is true from Beowulf to the present day. Even Romeo and Juliet two suicides are portrayed in the best of light. So LIGHTEN THE f**k up.Go to the movies and enjoy yourselves for 90 minutes to 9 hours. Oh and by the way GET a LIFE!My recommendation? Get the movie's extended version if you liked the novel. This version more closely follows the novel than the one released in the cinema. Then watch it with a grain of salt. However, I do advise reading actual material from the period, especially what Col. G. A. Custer had to say regarding the issue of the black hills and the Sioux. Also the novel was originally about the Comanche. It was thought at the time of filming that depicting the Comanche as benign would offend some people hence the change to Sioux.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable patient epic but you need to accept the na?ve and simplistic way it is presented to get into it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tired of the war and facing the loss of his legs, Lieutenant Dunbar rides towards suicide but finds only glory for his "brave" actions on the front line. The reward is the posting of his choice and he selects an outpost on the western frontier so that he can enjoy the country while it still remains. Arriving there he finds an abandoned fort with plenty of supplies but decides to make the best of it and enjoy the quiet. After initial tension and mistrust between him and his new neighbours, Dunbar gradually makes acquaintance with the holy man from the nearest Sioux tribe. With time he becomes friends and slowly starts to bond with the tribe and be accepted. His appreciation of their ways grow but at some point he knows the frontier will move and other white men will come, and in greater numbers.With the box office, awards and critical acclaim that greeted this film, it is easy to embrace it as the greatest film ever or to deride it as part of the traditional backlash against anything successful. However, watching it again 15 years later the truth is somewhere in-between. There is no doubting that the film has problems but it does have an epic sweep to that works well with the slow, steady pace to it. It is certainly not dull but it is hardly the fastest film you will have ever seen. If you can buy into this approach then it is actually quite engaging and the film develops nicely along with Dunbar as a character and as a person ? although this is not to say it is perfect. To the detriment of the film both Dunbar and the narrative are too na?ve for their own good. His narration is clunky and simplistic, which is pretty much what could be said of the black/white view of the Sioux (noble people without any real fault) and white people (ignorant, heartless and boorish people). That it does this is no surprise but it still reduces the value of the film by how simplified things are.Despite this I still enjoyed the basic story and it did engage me sufficiently. The ending was obvious and a bit cloying and some plot devices seemed more sentimentalised than they really needed to be but otherwise it did the job. Costner was at the height of his powers with this film but personally I didn't think his performance was overly sincere and laboured, failing to produce a "real" person and focusing instead on telling his version of history. McDonnell is more convincing early on but she doesn't really help the idea that this is very much a white version of the story. Greene adds a touch of the genuine to a role that really doesn't have much more than "quiet dignity" written across it. The support is mostly good although they do tend to all fall into the cliché roles based on their race. However the film mostly belongs to Costner and, although not as strong as he was in JFK, he does enough to match the general, rather na?ve approach of the material. As director he does well with the vast landscapes and the action while making good use of the score so that it tugs the heartstrings without it feeling like you're swimming in syrup.Overall this is not the classic that history would have you believe, nor is it a terrible, revisionist piece of garbage that others claim. It is somewhere in-between, being a patient epic that is worthy while also being too na?ve and sentimental to really convince and have lasting value. Worth seeing then for what it essentially does but be prepared to buy into its approach and its simplification of the issues.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unrealistic Hollywood formula movie. The main reason I mention 'Black Robe' is that it was released a few months later, hardly seen by few, and the difference is (literally) like night and day. The costumes in Dances With Wolves look like they just came freshly pressed out of the dry cleaners, everyone's hair is washed and perfect. In 'Black Robe' their is dirt, oil, grime, and a gripping realistic story to match - much more believable. Great portrayal of the differences between Native American and European religion.For another extremely realistic movie concerning Native Americans, see 'Windwalker' - where the actors speak in the actual native tongues. This one is top-notch, with a a great surprise plot-twist that lifts this movie above and beyond.And of course, a superbly filmed, acted and directed movie about the clash between Native Americans and Europeans, between thier cultures and religions, is 'The Mission', which takes place in South America, with Robert De Niro, a young Jeremy Irons and Liam Neeson.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**May Contain Spoilers** I like Westerns, and Kevin Costner doesn't really bother me; but this movie just wasn't as good as I had heard/hoped.The things I dislike most? (1) The simplistic approach to good guys/bad guys: Lakota=good; white people (except John and Stands With Fist)=bad. Give me a break! (2) Kevin as John Dunbar wasn't a horrible casting decision, but his narration was terribly wooden and sleep-inducing. (3) Mary McDonnell's portrayal of Stands With Fist. Okay, first of all, her whole existence in the movie just screams, "Contrivence!" Second, MM's performance was awful. Her attempts to remember English were bizarre and not believable. It was the reverse awfulness of someone doing a bad foreign accent. Third, the hair, OMG, the hair! Why was Stands With Fist wearing bad Eighties hair with highlights? I would think that after spending most of her life with the Lakota and adopting everything else of their lifestyle (dress, work around the village, marriage into the tribe, language), someone would plait that woman's hair. The hair just completely took me out of the movie every time MM showed up on screen. Kevin's was pretty bad, too; but it was not nearly as 80s as MMs. (4) Kevin's complete "grasp" of the Lakota's language. Was he a savant? I could see if he were still kinda stumbling and fumbling with the language, as many adult learners of other languages do; but Kevin was having long, meaningful discussion with tribe elders in a language he couldn't have begun learning more than a few weeks before. I know I'm supposed to suspend my belief here, but some things are just too incredible to believe.I wouldn't call this a turkey, but it was about two hours too long and full of enough faults to make me believe that it only garnered the Oscar because of the preachy, PC message, not because of any real substance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What happened to Kevin Costner?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After 1991, Kevin Costner should have retired, because since "JFK", he has not done anything worthwhile. Most of his films have actually been terrible ("The Postman", "Message in a Bottle", "Dragonfly" to name a few). Some might argue for "Thirteen Days", which was a good attempt but it just lacked something that his movies from the 80s and early 90s achieved. "Dances with Wolves" is an excellent film which is all the more impressive since it was Costner's directorial debut. Costner's acting isn't outstanding but it didn't have to be. Graham Greene, Mary McDonnell and Rodney A. Grant are the real stars here and Costner just coasts along and thankfully doesn't ruin the film with his monotone acting style. Great use of scenery and some of the most beautiful cinematography ever. I commend Costner for not cutting the movie and making it shorter because the 3+ hour length is necessary to adequately show the changes of the characters. I just watched the director's cut, which is actually 4 hours long, and I still didn't mind the length because this is such a great story of how we should not always judge a book by its cover. Even though it won 1990 Best Picture at the Oscars, "GoodFellas" was a better film and should have won.9 out of 10 stars for "Dances with Wolves"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just saw this film for the first time, 20 years after it was made! But the film had NO balance, so I can't mark it up. All the Native Americans are sensitive in their way, heroic, understanding, reasonable, and at least fairly good looking. All the whites, besides Costner and Mary McDonnell, are two-dimensional villains and/or oafs, jerks, morons, and not good looking. This is a stacked-deck look at the two ethnic groups if there ever was one.Not one white soldier is even willing to listen to Costner for a minute? They are all incredibly cruel from the get-go? ALL of them are also stupid? Not one of the Sioux tribe harbors jealousy, mistrust or resentment toward Costner, or is just not that great a guy? Then there is the scene where the white soldiers shoot the wolf. This REALLY strained one's willingness to believe because it is a movie. What wolf is going to hang around while being hammered with the sound of gunshots and seeing guns pointed at him? Even if he loves Costner, the wolf called Two Socks is going to take cover, wouldn't you think? He just stands there, waiting to be killed. This means he is supposed to be a spirit or angel I guess, not really a wolf. But that point is not made clear.Finally, I have to agree with those who say that Costner is not much of an actor or a narrator. Since he's the big star, and in all the scenes, that really detracts. I will say that the buffaloes were impressive and some of the actors playing the Sioux were easy on the eyes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Personal And Professional Triumph For Kevin Costner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Continuing my plan to watch every Kevin Costner movie in order I come to Dances With Wolves from 1990.Plot In A Paragraph: Lt. John Dunbar (KC) is a hero after he accidentally leads Union troops to a victory during the Civil War. He requests a position on the western frontier, but finds it deserted. He soon finds out, he is not alone though. One of, if not THE movie KC will always be remembered for. For this Zoner, I think it is sheer perfection. I know it's controversial amongst movie fans, but I think the movie and KC himself deservedly beat Goodfellas at the Oscars. It's even more of a personal triumph as a professional one for KC, as it's a movie nobody wanted to make, and those willing to, wanted to make a host of changes. The major studios wouldn't provide the proper funding. They took issue with the script's length and the amount of subtitles, the latter something that KC would not budge on - on top of the film being a western, when the genre was considered dead. Because of budgetary overruns and general industry reluctance to invest, KC was forced to dig deep into his own pockets to make up the film's $18 million budget. That caused rumors that the film would be another out-of-control, embarrassing flop. In fact, some studio people were referring to it as "Kevin's Gate" and a vanity project etc.I remember going to see it with my childhood sweetheart at a packed screening. I have never seen such a diverse audience, my girlfriend and I were teenagers, there was a couple in their sixties or older sat next to us, and two women in their 20's who giggled like school girls, at how cute KC's butt was when he was naked. It's incredible that this was KC's first movie as a director, it's beautifully shot, brilliantly acted and John Barry's score is a winner too!! I could wax lyrical about this movie all day!! But I won't bore you all with it.The highest grossing Western of all time, with a domestic take of $184 million. Danced with Wolves ended the year, the third highest grossing movie of 1990. Beating movies such as Pretty Woman, Die Hard 2, Goodfellas, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Dick Tracy, Back To The Future 3, Gremlins 2, Rocky V, Total Recall and Kindergarten Cop. Only Home Alone and Ghost made more money that year. It achieved this, without ever reaching #1 on the US box-office charts.I can't say enough good things about this movie.

He gave a truly great performance in showing how the U.S. Army treated not only the Lakota, but those soldiers they considered sympathetic to them. It was a story that was long overdue...entire generations were lied to about the injustices and downright hatred the Lakotas and other American Indian tribes suffered. The film accurately portrayed how the Lakotas embraced their land, taking only what was needed, never anything more. Graham Greene and the other actors who played the Lakotas and Crow were outstanding. They were believable...real humans who were driven off their lands due to "manifest destiny". In my humble opinion this film should be shown to kids in school...so they know what really happened while the West was "won".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's more than apparent that Kevin Costner has such love and reverence for the western, continuing the long tradition of epic Hollywood film making with Dances with Wolves. In this revisionist western the Indians are the good guys and white men are the villains, with Costner playing a character that likely would have been played by Gary Cooper 40 years earlier. The white man is shown killing mass amounts of Buffalo only for their horns, throwing their trash on the ground and polluting the water. The Native American mentality conflicts with the white man's use of resources, much like America's carbon footprint today. I can't say if Dances with Wolves is a movie intended to carry an environmental message, but that is an impression I get from it. John Dunbar's desire to see the western frontier before is disappears is comparable to the Arctic and Antarctica being the last great frontiers today which are apparently on risk of eventually disappearing. John Dunbar doesn't want to take advantage of the land, but to admire and bask in it.I find it refreshing to see westerns which include the Indian point of view. The insight in Dances with Wolves into the Sioux culture and lifestyle as well as hearing a not often heard language is fascinating. The Indians in Dances with Wolves are humanised with moments such as when Dunbar sees Kicking Bird having sex in the tipi, a relatable awkward moment; or with the Indian children of the tribe having the desire to be grown up and act older than they are. The Indians however are not saintified ether; some members of the tribe are vicious killers and display prejudice against the white man. The movie presents both douches and more noble individuals on both sides. The passage of time in which Dunbar very slowly over the course of a four hour movie becomes assimilated into this culture and learns the language represents an astounding piece of storytelling. Unfortunately social justice warriors will look upon a movie like Dances with Wolves and decry it as offensive for its display of so called "cultural appropriation", because apparently the embracing of other cultures doesn't represent unity between races but thievery of one culture's ways by another. Although not many people share the fondness I have for Kevin Costner, dismissing him as a dull, monotone actor. I point to Dances with Wolves as a showcase that the man is a great screen presence; a four hour long movie which he carries on his shoulders with no dialogue for long spaces of time, and at other times exuberating his commanding narration voice. The scene in which Dunbar is being held by US soldiers as they assault him, denying him to return to his new found way of life, as well as killing Two Socks and using his diary as toilet paper is so painful to watch. I've become so attached to the character at this point that I can't bear to watch everything he has worked towards being destroyed. Who needs CGI when there's a world of scenic and natural beauty out there to capture on film? Simply look as the majestic landscapes of the badlands accompanied by John Barry's score evokes a real sense of wonder. "Why go out to a location when you can just create it on a computer. Isn't that so much easier?" Sigh. Likewise the famous buffalo hunt scene is the real deal. How do you recreate a buffalo hunt? Why get huge herds of buffalo of course. Like the chariot race in Ben- Hur, history is brought back to life with buffalo as far as the eye can see, with stuntmen on horseback right in the middle of it all; pulling off something as huge as this and retaining continuity is astounding. Dances with Wolves doesn't come off as cold, callous Oscar bait, but sadly it is another movie in which its Best Picture win has hurt its reputation; "Dances with Wolves is just that movie which beat Goodfellas".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kevin is not only a brilliant actor but one of the greatest directors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People who say this movie is long and boring have obviously never sat through, oh, "Lawrence of Arabia," "Patton," "Doctor Zhivago," "The Godfather," "Ran," "Seven Samurai," or probably even "Brave heart." Thank God that not every filmmaker believes that a car must explode every 10 seconds in order for his movie to be a success. Kevin Costner is one of those directors who prefers the long format. David Lean, Francis Coppola and Mel Gibson, to name a very few, also worked in that format, and produced lasting works of art that also packed theaters. There are plenty of options for people who don't like movies that take the time to build character, drama and suspense, movies like "Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle," "Freddy Vs. Jason," and "Weekend at Bernie's." I don't think any of those movies has ever been called "boring," but they sure are crap cinema.Onward. "Dances With Wolves" thrilled audiences way back in 1990 and made so darn much money precisely because people had forgotten the pleasures of the long narrative, the Western genre, and movies that weren't special effects schlock-fests. It remains an inspiring and moving experience, especially on DVD, which preserves the movie's theatrical sound and picture quality.Costner's direction is first-rate. He's able to blend intimate drama with big, sprawling action that covers a huge canvas. I'm amazed at how smoothly the film segues from movement to movement -- action, alienation, suspense, social commentary, romance. Heck, Spielberg could take a lesson or two from this movie.He also gets great performances out of his cast. I don't think of these people as actors, but as the characters they play. That's a compliment not just to the actors themselves, but their director. And, yes, Costner is terrific as John Dunbar.Sure, it's easy to call "Dances" politically correct w/ reference to the Indians. But it also treats them as people and, better yet, as fictional characters whose lives are made part of a fascinating narrative. I just consider all the complaints about the politics of this movie as total hogwash.Finally, the movie is beautifully shot, has an unforgettable score, and is very well-written. I've never thought of "Dances" as a Western, but a modern action picture/character study that avoids all the boring clichés of the Western genre. Here is a movie that stands for something, means something, and deserves at least as much respect as some of the overrated deck we've gotten saddled with lately.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After viewing this movie several times I still have the same high opinion of it. The plot and acting at all levels was well above average Costner is not my favorite actor but has a creditable performance in this. What troubled me was that the tribe he affiliated with were the Sioux, deadly enemies of the settlers and the U.S. Army. The enemy of the Sioux were shown to be the evil Pawnee. However, this tribe was not an enemy of settlers and even provided scouts for the army in its war against the Sioux. It seems to me that proper research would have discovered this. This officer could just as easily adhered to the Pawnee rather than to their enemy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bumpy first half and an odd mood but still a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A number of scenes in the first half of this film left me wondering, "What the hell did I just watch?" I was wondering whether I was supposed to laugh or not. If a scene ended violently I guess it was meant as serious?*shoulder shrug*.In fact, there was something odd about the entire tone of the film and it dawned on me after a while: Dances with Wolves feels like a kids movie. Whether that feel was intended or not is unclear, especially considering all the blood and violence, but the movie definitely has the feel of an adventure for kids. There is a subplot with befriending a wolf and another one about a loyal horse. This movie features farts, some slapstick and I swear at one point I heard a bouncing noise like in a Hanna-Barbera cartoon?but then someone had their scalp removed.Throughout the film, the main character is narrating his experiences on the frontier and his style of narration as well as the wording sounds like that of a curious child discovering the world.While there are a few scenes that drag on for too long or seem unnecessary all-together, overall this movie is interesting and well-paced. At almost 4 hours long, it does not feel too long because the story works. Intelligently, bits of story are introduced that do not resolve right away thereby making you want to keep watching to see how those seeds will grow. The movie gets better as it goes on and as you get more attached to its characters.There is another minor complaint: the film attempts to be respectful to Native Americans, but a number of elements in the story damages the integrity of that respect. The natives who are friendly to the immigrants are portrayed as good. The natives who attack the whites are bad savages. The main character tries to train a wolf to eat from his hand and I cannot tell if this is intended or unintended symbolism but it sure is not a pleasant one. There is a white woman living amongst the natives (Mary McDonnell) because she was supposedly adopted, but was this character written into the movie to act as the English translator for the main hero or was this just another way of ensuring that the main hero's romantic interest is a relatable white actress. As always, the two main heroes are a white western couple. This is still a Hollywood movie.Kevin Kostner's main character is perhaps least interesting as he is the most wooden. His face is frozen in the expression of confusion for much of the movie. This performance fits the story as the character is mostly alone and remains cautious and unsure as he is pushing social boundaries on the frontier, but it does not make for interesting acting. The rest of the participants are more emotional and interesting, especially Graham Greene at the top of his game as the holy man.The music in this film is a soundtrack for epic exploration, some of it sounding like a tune that would accompany a scene of a kid discovering some magical house, and again contributing to the children's adventure movie feel described earlier.In short, what an odd film?I like it. It is not a great movie. Some of the acting is stiff and some scenes are questionable but the off-beat mood is curious enough and the story starts to really grow on you, so that it feels like a complete and rewarding experience after the movie is over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An epic story of love and cultural exchange</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DANCES WITH WOLVES was Kevin Costner's directorial debut, and what a debut it was. It's not just an epic in terms of length, but also in terms of the themes of love, adventure and cultural exchange which it addresses. It is a richly detailed portrayal of one man's enlightenment and transformation that should cut to the heart of anyone who watches it. Kevin Costner plays Lieutenant John J. Dunbar, wounded during the Civil War in Tennessee and, at his request, transferred to the frontier. When he arrives there, he finds his post deserted. While there, he eventually meets the Lakota Sioux and strikes up a friendship with them that develops over the course of the film. One thing (among many) that this film does right is portray Native Americans in a more sympathetic light compared to film portrayals in the past. Here they aren't "noble savages," but people just living off the land who have a rich culture and history. The Pawnee aren't portrayed as kindly, but in the context of the film this is OK as they are enemies of the Sioux. This leads to the bigger issue of American imperialism and the Monroe Doctrine which, while never directly addressed as such, was a major source of tension between the US and Indian tribes in the 19th century. Yes, we stole land that they had been living on for generations and the film is bold enough to admit that. Aside from issues, DANCES WITH WOLVES manages to just tell a good story with richly detailed characters that has dramatic heft and palpable emotional impact. There are a number of sequences which display Costner's eye for good cinema and show a firm directorial hand at work. One such sequence takes place about halfway through and shows Dunbar and the Sioux hunting a herd of buffalo on the plain. There are also a few battle sequences which are brilliantly filmed. The only minor complaints I have are that the US soldiers towards the end are portrayed as villains in a somewhat cartoonish way. While certainly not saints, I feel like they were portrayed that way on purpose so as to make the Native Americans look that much more like the heroes. I can see why this was done, but I don't feel like it was entirely necessary to vilify them in such a broad way. I also think that despite the importance of the events that the film portrays, and the way in which it portrays them, that in the end it's merely a crowd-pleasing epic. Nothing truly profound is said about the human condition and our relationships with one another, as seems to be the film's intention. It has the slight air of being a cinematic apology: a rather sincere one, but still a little pretentious. I'm not quite sure if this film deserved to win Best Picture in 1991, as there were a lot of strong contenders that year, but it certainly was a high point for Kevin Costner's career and is definitely worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic and compelling human drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Union soldier Lt. John Dunbar (Kevin Costner) is horribly wounded. Instead of allowing the surgeon to cut off his foot, he rides into the Confederate lines intending to commit suicide. It proves to be a distraction that wins an Union victory. The admiring visiting general gives him any position and he chooses to go west before it's gone. The isolated outpost is deserted after the disappearance of the soldiers. He is alone with his horse with only a wolf to keep company. The neighboring Lakota tribe makes contact and gives him the name of Dances with Wolves. Kicking Bird (Graham Greene) is the leader, Wind In His Hair (Rodney A. Grant) is the wild young buck, and Stands With A Fist (Mary McDonnell) is a white woman adopted into the tribe ever since she was a child.This is both an epic and a compelling human story. It's a western but even more than the old formula. The comic relief that is usually in the old western like Maury Chaykin and Robert Pastorelli are instead used as characters of quirky madness. Kevin Costner gives the film's quiet leading man. The thing that truly sets this apart from the normal Hollywood western is the authentic attempt at native characters and culture. It's not only their sincere attempt at the language and the use of native actors. It is that they are human beings. The communication problems is done expertly. That doesn't always happen even in modern movies. Graham Greene is excellent as a leading voice of the Lakota Sioux band.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review - Dances With Wolves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Dances With Wolves for the first time sometime within the last several months. It wasn't as great or memorable as I hoped it would be, but it's pretty good nonetheless.As the story starts off, we are introduced to Lieutenant John Dunbar, who does something stupid during a Civil War battle and inadvertently leads the Union troops to a victory. As a reward, he is given a post at the western frontier. Upon arriving, he finds the post deserted. Soon however, he starts to befriend a curious local Indian tribe. Gradually, over time earns the trust and respect of these people, and eventually becomes one of them. Along the way, he also falls in love with Stands With A Fist, a white girl raised by the tribe. Also, along the way, he even receives a tribal name, "Dances With Wolves." It's a simple story. It's that old man-befriends-natives-and-turns-against-his-own-people type of story. There's no originality in it whatsoever, and it's almost completely predictable. However, it is very well-told, with soul and emotion. The movie follows Dunbar and allows the viewer to feel his emotions and experiences as he gradually falls in love with the tribe and the land. In terms of the script, and other aspects, the movie is pretty good. The dialogue is pretty good, and the story is well-paced. Performances by Costner and everyone else are good as well, and the actors really bring out their characters. John Barry also composed a great score for the film, which also helped bring out the emotion, mood, and tone of the film.I do have a few criticisms of the film. My first criticism concerns Mary McDonnel. She was effective as Stands With A Fist, and her performance was good, but there's something about her that took away slightly from my liking for her character. I didn't think she was quite right for her role. Also, I should have had more emotional attachment to her (not that I didn't, but I did feel that it lacked a bit). My second criticism concerns the length of the film. I can see what Costner was trying to do in terms of storytelling, emotion, length of scenes, and all that, but, in my opinion, the film was too long. I have to admit, I liked the film, but I did get bored in some areas. Also, while the character development is solid, I think the story should have gone more into character complexity. The story itself had more potential too. There's hardly any plot at all, but it's enjoyable, but nonetheless, if the movie did have more of a real plot it could have been a lot better. Next, I didn't really feel much tension/worry for the inevitable fight with the American military coming up at the end. I really did need to feel much more of that. Also, while the movie is pretty good, it only has a few memorable aspects about it. It needed more.Overall, I feel that Dances With Wolves is more of a moral message experience than entertainment. It's not something I'd want to watch more than once, but it's a good movie all the same, definitely worth watching. But it did have a lot more potential.My Rating: ***1/2 (out of ****)For more reviews, visit my website: http://robertsreliablereviews.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My friend went away because you were coming....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a tale of exploration and adventure of the most unusual kind ? almost a fantasy. It is a fictional story about a soldier who 'turns Injun' in crude terms. It is not as if no one had ever lived with and become like the Indians. J.W. Schultz who wrote 'My Life As An Indian' is a classic example, well known because of the book, but there have been several, mostly unknown, because at that time no one was really interested to know about the life style and social, cultural values of the Indians. Some fictional tales can become more powerful by the excellence of their presentation, and Costner has been able to achieve this in Dances With Wolves. Lt. Dunbar is a desperate hero, who is given the choice of any station that he desires. He wants to go towards the frontier. Some mysterious force is pulling Lt. Dunbar towards the frontier (compare Schultz's account). The only reason he can give is that he wants to see the frontier before it is gone. The mood of the story builds up slowly and gracefully. Dunbar will gradually and surely discover why he wanted to come here, leaving behind the comfort and security of cities and forts...he will find who he really is inside. And to find all that he loves...the open, beautiful, unspoilt land, the wild but friendly wolf Two Socks, the tribe of Indians with whom he develops a social bond, and finally - Stands With A Fist. The good days can't last long....more troops have come to the frontier, and the frontier is shrinking. Dunbar sees that the tribe of which he is now a member is going to be decimated. He decides that he must go back to civilization to talk to those who would listen....that the existence of the frontier is actually the last chance for civilization to learn from. The frontier here is not just a physical boundary, but also a metaphysical one - a metaphor for the unknown, and if the frontier dies, so does the chance for civilization to learn from what lies beyond the frontier. He sets on his journey back....will anyone listen?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>review of "dances with wolves"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the movie is trying to speak for Indians. It describes a white officer Dunbar in the United States who volunteers to go to the west front to station. At last make friends with Sioux warriors who even have a different language and culture. Later on, the white people regard him as a traitor, and treat him with violence. What's more, they even want to execute him with hanging punishment. After Dunbar seeing what white army did, he starts to feel shameful for the white army and he stands totally on the Sioux's side and insists that his name is "dances with wolves". Dunbar tries to persuade Indians to move the camp because he knows he cannot change what is going to happen, but in the end, the Indians' leader, Ten Bears only smiled and talked of simple pleasures. He reminded Dunbar that at his age, a good fire was better than anything. I think Ten Bears was an extraordinary man. Finally, the Indians were suffering from a massacre.The movie's title is "Dances with wolves", there really is a wolf that always stays around Dunbar in the movie, and I think the director is trying to express something; he wants people to meditate. When someone mentioned wolves, the first impression comes to my mind is "loneliness". The wolf in this movie metaphors a belief of grief and strength. When I watched over this movie last weekend, at that night, I thought much about that movie and I lied on bed and even cannot sleep as early as before. I am not sure that's because of the regards of the friendship built between Dunbar and the Indians or because I felt sad when I realized the harsh reality that the tragedy came from human's nature of desire and cruel.The white people think the Indians are ruthless and rude who cannot have a conversation with. Actually brutal and rude Indians are exceptional. Just like what Dunbar says when he knows more about the Sioux people:" nothing I have been told about these people is correct. They are not beggars or thieves. They are not the brutal men they have been made out to be. On the contrary, they are polite and have the familiar humor I enjoy. The communication is slow however. The "Quiet" is frustrated as I am. Most of our progresses were based on failure rather than success". I like these words in Dunbar's journal, so I wrote these words down when I saw the movie. I always thought that if I were him, what would I do?"Dances with Wolves" is the name of the movie, the name of a white lieutenant Dunbar, but it also give us a feeling of beauty and sadness. It shows the close contact between people, between people and animals, between man and nature. However, "wolf" is alone after all and is not comprehended by "the people", I like the howl of the wolf at the end of the movie, and I think we can feel its destiny as well as Dunbar's from this sad howl. I think the misunderstanding is one of the crucial reasons leads to the massacre to Indians other than exploring frontier. Besides, we should have lived in harmony with Indians together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching this movie, I have some special feeling. It is no word to say. Maybe at that moment, as a normal person, I think our ancestors are hard to build a harmony city or a town. I really expect John Dunbar. He is one of a hero, not only in civil war, but also in expanding western area.In this movie, Dunbar lost his friend ---"two-stocks", a wolf. Also he lost his horse. I think losing is not terrible. The most important thing is that as a soldier, even a hero, Dunbar could stand up from losing. Facing to threaten, he could insist his position. It is worth for us to learn.In history, I think the conflict between native Americans and "Europeans" is hard to judge who is right. Just because the culture shock, they involved in war. For example, Dunbar lost his hat in a hunting. But at that night, when they sat around the compfire, he found a person wore his hat. When he asked him to get back, he get refused, even became fighting. Because Indian thought that he picked the lost hat, so it belonged to him. But Dunbar thought the hat belonged to him, the one who picked it up should give it back to him. From this thing, we can think about the difference between two cultures.We would learn from Dunbar. As a white person, although he doubted on another civilization and even contempt, but he dared to take the initiative to understand them which had a different thinking and living habit. As opposed to their own life experience, unfamiliar cultural values &#x200b;&#x200b;are so difficult to accept, then go to understand each other's lifestyle and habits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I talked about movies with my friends, I was always felt proud that I have watched a lot of classic movies. However, I was wrong. When I finished this movie, I was so surprised and asked myself why I never saw it before. At the first part of the movie, when Lieutenant Dunbar could not get even one shoot on his horse, I was thinking that this was may be a boring movie only told a story about a deathless hero, however, I was totally wrong. That was a clue to make audiences clear how the lieutenant went to the frontier. The first character I saw from Dunbar was brave, and then I saw his responsibility when he was being in his new post, although there was no one else. His still decided to stay there. However, these were not this movie's main part. The best parts came after Dunbar arrived at his new post, he made friend with Sioux and even the wolf. It made me think a lot during the movie. The wolf in the movie is real impressive. When I saw the wolf, I thought about a word?alone. The wolf is alone just like Dunbar. It seems like a symbol. I am not a critic, so I can't describe something what I saw in beauty words, but I can feel that. Feel the idea which director wanted to deliver to the audiences. It is an excellent west movie, not only because of showing us the landscape and lifestyle of the frontier, but also implying a lot. I think, the frontier which mentioned in the movie doesn't only means the real American frontier, it also means every human's heart. Inside everyone is a frontier waiting to be discovered. There are something good and honest need us to discover by ourselves. I am so glad I have this chance to watch this impressive movie. It touched my heart!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dances with Wolves' review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lieutenant John J. Dunbar became a hero accidentally because of that he wanted to suicide but led Union to winning. After that, he volunteered to go to frontier. On the way, he heard some bad things about Indians. When he got to the Fort Sedgwick, there isn't anything. He was there by his own, and met Kicking Bird who is medicine man of Sioux tribe and was attracted by Sioux's culture. They became more and more friendly to each others. Dunbar felt that they have a lot of difference, because Indians are optimistic and innocent. He was with them and help them to defend their children, women, and food. In addition, he felt he is a part them. They help him to be marry, even poor families did so. It's a little different to what I know in the movie. In other movies, cowboys are always very tough. In this movie, it is more emphasis the difference between Sioux and pioneers' concepts. Dunbar isn't very rugged, but he has higher technology than Sioux. There are lots of difference, but it doesn't comment which one is true, it even makes me feel Indians' concept is more important than modern concept. At that time, the bad conditions make people hard to live, pioneers only can rely on themselves, I think that's why Thanksgiving is so important to Americans. Dunbar has a hero ability which is can-do spirit, he can live in the Fort Sedgwick, but he go to Sioux tribe and help Sioux to find buffaloes and defend their village,We are always threatened by environment nowadays, I feel that Indians' concept is completely good for us. In this movie, Dunbar doesn't really want to fight to nature and native Americans. Primitive life style is sort of cruel. However, living in that style can be really sustainable development. Dunbar is a hero whose type is what I like, because he is sensitive, brave, and kindhearted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A harmony with the land, interspersed with savage tribal warfare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dunbar speaks of the "harmony" with nature the Sioux have with the land, which he came to experience himself, sharing their lives. But how many viewers get this from watching the movie? I suspect it worked better on the big screen, feeling the vast expanse of earth and sky and silence. But unless you have ever been out in the empty prairie or a vast silent wilderness (something that simply does not exist in Europe) you may not understand the peace and silence of mind it produces. To attempt to recreate this is why the movie must be slow and long. This vastness and isolation is key to any good Western. In a classic Western the lone individual (or family or group, such as a wagon train) is on his own, isolated from the social norms and rule of law of civilization. He is typically pitted against raw nature and the brute force of lawless individuals, and must rely on his strength of character and wits to survive. It is a form of anomie, spiritual and social. This is what Dunbar encounters, in its purest form, in his posting to an empty frontier fort.In Westerns it is good guys vs. bad guys, which, in the old days, was cowboys vs. Injuns. Hollywood went beyond that stereotype long ago, at least since the 1960s, if not 1950s. But it is still interesting to see, through Dunbar's eyes, the transition from prejudice to understanding of Indians as human beings with families and personalities, to acknowledge the stereotypes were lies, up to a point. Those "stereotypes" would have killed him with an arrow in the back, as they did his muleteer guide and Standing with a Fist's family, had circumstances not intervened. We see the macho young Indians urging that he be killed and we see the motions of war with another Indian tribe. Though living in peace and harmony with the land, showing their bravery through killing, and risking being killed, is a fundamental part of their culture. The Whites are no different. We see White men at war, first in a clutzy Civil War battle, which is probably more typical than the dramatic scenes more often portrayed; in the early stages, the leadership was often not the boldest. Later we see the frontier soldiers, who seem to be the bottom of the barrel rejects. But they all feel they must demonstrate their warlike spirit, much like the Indians, though sometimes foolishly. People are people, regardless of their skin color or country. Have not soldiers elsewhere been equally vicious, and have not other countries, including Europe, committed genocidal murders? Does anyone remember the Belgian Congo?The viewer's first impulse is to view the Indians as the good guys, but they were not saints. But it was their land, and the Whites had no right to take it from them -- that is the bottom line. They know, thanks to Dunbar, that there will be so many White men coming that they will inevitably be overwhelmed, yet they cannot find the wisdom to know how to respond, aside from futile battle. We can see in hindsight that killing and more killing is not the answer, but that is the only way the humans on both sides know how to respond. The viewer feels sadness knowing this, and knowing that the Sioux's harmonious lifestyle will be lost.Some viewers, especially foreigners, will also feel anger and contempt for the White man, and for Americans. But what are you watching? A film made by Americans, primarily for an American audience, missing the caveats a foreigner should keep in mind. Should Americans feel ashamed? Of course, and we do, for the injustices committed against Indians in the past. One of the strengths of America is its willingness to engage in honest self-criticism and to strive for historical objectivity. America changes with time, over and over again. American movies can be a force for change, and a collective acknowledgment of that change. That is what you see in Dancing with Wolves, made two decades ago. You see a similar pro- Indian statement in A Man Called Horse, made two decades earlier, so this is not a radical new attitude, as much as a beautiful restatement. How many nations engage in such brutally honest self-criticism through their cinema? We find this in Europe and the West, and I have seen some from Japan - though not nearly enough, but such a movie of self- criticism that also glorifies individualism and repudiating the values of your society and government is unthinkable (and probably illegal) in China, and much of Asia. And so I do not consider this as an anti- American film, but very much a pro-American one, one I am proud of. A side note: I mostly agree with nebukanezer from Norway's comparison of Dances with Avatar. It does seem that James Cameron used Dances as a draft outline for his screenplay. Cameron should get over his ego and hire a real scriptwriter.Also, as to the Indians living in harmony with nature, anthropologists now know that the Plains Indians would periodically set fire to the prairie to prevent trees and bushes from growing, and to promote vegetation favorable to the buffalo. These fires, of course, killed many other animals and did significant ecological damage.Still, the White man could have learned a lot from the Indians, spiritually. The history of man's inhumanity to man is filled with sadness and regret.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simply the best film of its genre that I have ever seen and am ever likely to see:the score, the cinematography, the acting, the theme, the narrative and the humour it has the lot! Without a doubt my favourite film - EVER. It is a complete traversty that it is not in top 250. With the recent death of John Barry who composed the score I am reminded to watch it again, but the extended version this time. What a pity that the longer version is not yet available on Blu-ray. Worthy of all awards it received.To say Costner could not act is nonsense, he is excellent in this role and his direction par excellence. They say that the Western is dead but when films of this quality are made there will always be a great audience. Costner is a fine director and therefore it's a pity that he wasted his time on inferior films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film to Remember</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Twenty years after winning 7 Academy Awards, this film is still one of the greatest American epics of our time. Now available on Blu-Ray, I can only hope that a new generation will discover - and the rest remember - what an enduring classic this is. Based on the 1988 novel by Michael Blake (the e-book of which was also just released this week), Dances With Wolves tells the story of Lieutenant John J. Dunbar as he retreats from the battlefields of the Civil War to the expanses of the American frontier. Left alone and forgotten at the abandoned Fort Sedgewick, the lieutenant's solitude is broken only by the strange visits of an old wolf and the constant companionship of his horse, Cisco. That is, until a nearby Indian tribe returns to their summer home a few miles away. Though initially fearful of one another, the Native American people introduce Dunbar to a new way of life - a life that gradually draws him away from his identity as an officer of the Union Army and into a new identity as "Dances With Wolves."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A modern epic!...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have only seen this film once before, it was on a commercial station and (with commercials) it was so long they had to split it over two nights. The BBC finally got the rights and we get it over one afternoon (thank you BBC!). The trouble is, because it's shown in the afternoon, we get a slightly tamed down version, not that I'm complaining. But more of my nonsense later, here's a very brief summary first (summary haters please wait back at fort Hays while I write the next paragraph).Having fought and been decorated in the American Civil War, Lt. John Dunbar is offered any posting he would like. He decides to go and see the frontier, in his words, "Before it's gone." He gets a posting to Fort Hays where the commander, clearly insane, posts him on to a far-flung outpost, which he finds deserted. Finding himself alone, he is befriended by a lone wolf he calls "Two-Socks". Eventually he attracts the attention of a tribe of Sioux Indians. After a rather faltering start the two sides slowly learn to trust one another. Dunbar makes friends, including, Kicking Bird and Wind In His Hair who show him the ways of the Plains people. There is also a white woman among the tribe, Stands With a Fist; she was taken in when she lost her family at a very young age. She acts as interpreter and, eventually, she becomes very close to the young Lieutenant. There is a cloud on the horizon, however, Dunbar knows that the white men are coming and this cannot be good for the tribe.This is an epic film with some tremendous vistas; I would love to have seen it on the big screen. I love the way that Costner made all of the white people in the picture particularly loathsome (with two notable exceptions). Decent performances all round, so honourable mentions go to; Kevin Costner as Lieutenant Dunbar, Mary McDonnell as Stands With A Fist, Graham Greene as Kicking Bird, Rodney A. Grant as Wind In His Hair and Floyd 'Red Crow' Westerman as Ten Bears.I think you have to be prepared beforehand to watch this film? Three hours is a long time so plenty of refreshments and control of the remote is always good (for bathroom breaks). There is a pretty slow pace to the way the story unveils, but it's worth sticking with. The final chapter does go on a little and I feel could have been cut slightly. Apart from that, it's an epic film that is well worth a viewing? Recommended.My score: 8.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dance with Wolves is a very gripping, magnificent film. I put this film off for years because I thought it would be horrible despite winning Best Picture. Well this movie is a true epic of the 1990's. My only complaint that this movie is a little too long. I am not a big fan of three hour movies even if it's Avatar or Lord of the Rings. Like those two, I dealt with it and watched the whole film.This is about a Civil War soldier named John Dunbar who is exiled out in the middle of nowhere. While he is there, he and the local Sioux tribe becomes friendly with each other.Kevin Costner is pretty good here. His haircut in some scenes reminded me of Mel Gibson from Braveheart. Graham Greene is magnificent as Kicking Back or whatever his name is.The score for the film is truly memorable. I can't remember a good score from the 1990's as good as this one. The cinematography is unbelievable too.There are a few scenes that choked me up. They were written very well. This is a very good movie certainly better than Goodfellas. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well made movie that is like a breath of fresh air</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very few movies are made with so much attention to detail. Kevin Costner deserves wholesome praise for this movie. It is one of those rare movies that takes a look at American Indians as human beings. Indians are also a fiercely proud and brave race. But in most of the movies they are revealed as savages and thieves. But it is different in Dances With Wolves. For his first movie, Costner impresses a lot. The camera work and direction are absolutely breathtaking. It is very difficult to understand that such an honestly and well made movie is not listed in IMDb Top 250. There are many stupid movies listed there but not this awesome and touching movie. This movie will always be among my favorites. A rare masterpiece that succeeds on more than one level.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Dances With Wolves" won seven Academy Awards for 1990, including best picture and best director, both of which were claimed by the film's star, Kevin Costner, whose performance was also recognized with a nomination. There's been grumbling from film buffs that Costner's triumph was undeserved, that Martin Scorsese's gangster epic, "Goodfellas," should have won, with Scorsese taking the director prize, and there's been a tendency to sneer at Costner's directorial debut ever since. If the Academy was turned off by "Goodfellas"'s violence and misanthropic characters, they could feel safe voting for "Dances With Wolves" since it seemed more noble, in the same vein as "Gandhi." As Kevin Costner's Calvary officer makes peace with an Indian tribe and they welcome him into their fold, it speaks well of the human race, certainly more so than Ray Liotta talking fellow mobster Robert DeNiro out of "whacking" a fellow hoodlum. "Dances With Wolves" has its villains, all of them white U.S. calvary soldiers, whose anti-Indian actions make them racists, and, therefore, deserving of the audience's hatred.Native American issues were big at the time, thanks in part to the critical and popular success of Forrest Carter's "The Education of Little Tree," a "memoir" of the author's childhood as the member of a Cherokee tribe that continued to be popular long after Carter was exposed as Asa Carter, a pro-segregationist former Klansman and speechwriter for Alabama governor George Wallace, and definitely not a Cherokee. A true Native American author, Sherman Alexie, was also making a mark at this time with such novels as "Reservation Blues." In short, Costner's feel-good epic was the right movie at the right time, very appealing to audiences, who made it a several hundred million dollar grosser, and the Academy, who could vote for it and feel as though they were finally addressing the grievances that Marlon Brando introduced when declining his Oscar for "The Godfather" 18 years earlier in protest of Hollywood's treatment of Indians in all those John Ford westerns.I avoided "Dances With Wolves" for years, having dismissed it as politically correct, New Age slop in a pretty package. I finally caught up with it in 2006 and was impressed. Slow moving and rather boring at times, especially when Costner reads from his diary in a monotone that would have gotten him kicked out of any high school drama class, it is nonetheless an extraordinary achievement overall, with lovely cinematography and a John Barry score that's already a classic. When it comes, the action is well-staged, particularly a buffalo stampede, and the Indian's attack on the Calvary troop that has taken Costner hostage. There's a lot of mystical nonsense, including the shot of a wolf howling from a cliff, but it's moving regardless, especially set to Barry's majestic score.Although it's often classified as a western, "Dances With Wolves" is more of an historical epic, though a fictional one. I don't think it deserved the Oscar over "Goodfellas," but it was far more deserving of that prize than many other films that the Academy has honored through the years, and Costner gambled with his career to make it.Brian W.

		<fullReview>If you've been on the online forums and boards for long enough, you definitely know that when it comes to arguing, there are various sorts of people who you should never engage in such activity with, for it would be a vain waste of time. One sort of such people is the guys who post huge walls of text, so huge that any point of yours gets literally smothered by those. No matter what you have to say, you'll simply be flooded with tons of text of very questionable relevance, and there will be no one else to actually care enough to dig through this mess and back your point. So much for believing that being logical and consistent is enough to win any argument.Watching Dances with Wolves was a bit of a relevant experience. Not that it was an awful movie that makes you go WTF all the time. Quite the contrary, this is a movie with a lot of positive moments, most notable of which is a stunningly beautiful cinematography, above-par acting and a very extensive use of the Sioux language, which adds a rather delicate touch to the movie considering it was made in 1990, when attention to such details wasn't as revered as it is now.But every now and then the movie takes a shortcut, feeding you with oversimplified, cloying or plain stereotypical views of things or digressing onto the secondary plot paths only to abandon them in a few minutes later. The most screaming example is the image of the Indian tribe that let the protagonist in: they are all good people, noble savages to the brim who simply shine with the wisdom of simplicity. On the other hand, almost all the white people are arrogant, insane, cruel or dumb, which leaves no chance for the audience to have any sympathy towards them.This might be tolerable for an average 90-minute movie, but Dances With Wolves is an almost 4-hour epic, and, honestly, it could benefit from some trimming. Yet, instead of using this huge time span to actually show us things from different points of view, the film rams home its single chosen perspective, in case we have any doubt that what US did to Native Americans was a bad thing. Kinda like what Avatar did in 2009.I am actually surprised that this movie is so critically acclaimed. Apparently, Costner got all those Oscars and other rewards because political correctness and historical revisionism were reigning supreme in 1990's. Or maybe it was epic and sentimental enough so that people could forgive it for being somewhat shallow and one-sided. After all, it's still a beautifully looking movie, especially if you like the views of Kevin Costner's naked butt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best western movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I was watching Kevin Costner's Dances with Wolves (1990) I was reminded of a book excerpt that I read which was from a book called Black Elk Speaks because both stories talk about the Sioux tribe, but the book was based on real life events and this movie is fictional. Costner's film tells the story of Lt. John J. Dunbar(played by Kevin Costner himself) who is a Civil war veteran who served with the Union army who is under exile all by himself in an empty farm while looking for buffalo and at the same time befriending the Sioux tribe. Costner's movie is very well made but I really don't think that this film should have won the 1990 best picture Oscar over Martin Scorsese's masterful mob picture which came out in the same year which was Goodfellas because to me it was more deserving, Costner's film is on a par with some of the best western movies ever made along with The Searchers (1956), Unforgiven (1992), Rio Bravo (1959), The Good, the bad, and the Ugly (1966), Pale Rider (1985), and so many more. Like Driving Miss Daisy in the scenes where Dunbar tries to make friends with the Lakota Sioux tribe it is a story of skepticism and later it becomes a very inspiring story of friendship and love for one another. As well as the scenes where Costner's character is about to be hanged by his former military friends his fellow native American friends come back to save him and those scenes prove to us that people from different races can still be very important people in a particular point of your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>in this day and age, people prefer high speed movies, with one event after the other. I'm no different than that. when a movie is too slow or too quite, I loose interest. in the case of "Dances with wolves", the pace works in favor of the magnificent picture portrayed in colorful shades. it allows the watcher not only to understand the protagonist, but also identify with his process, and to experience what he experiences. I don't know much about Indians, so I cant assess the truism of the story. then again, it's not a movie about Indians: it's a story about cultural differences. it's a story representing a sad reality.

		<fullReview>Unfortunately, for some reason Kevin Costner didn't have the reputation of a talented actor. It would seem, that he has everything: he is a courageous, handsome, textured. He could play both brave daredevil and degraded debauchee-ribald. And he played, but evidently didn't convince exacting critics. Well, let so be it. All the same we love him. He nevertheless won critics' hearts by his director's talent. His epic western film «Dances with Wolves» - the confirmation of that.This is an extraordinary story about extraordinary man. Each of us makes strides along the road of life with one or another destination, leaving the tracks by acts of various kinds. Somebody sows the good seed, somebody destroys everything, somebody creates for the welfare of science and culture and somebody aimlessly goes down with the stream in expectation of opportune destiny. The character of « Dances with wolves», First Lieutenant John Dunbar doomed to be a hero. His heroism is not the ostentatious prowess and thirst of recognize, it's his self, his way of life. His conscience, his spirit and his desperate heart lead his acts. His vital desire don't come to conquest of all possible and impossible heights, he violently persists in discover the frontier within himself.Growing roots in an uninhabited fort, stoically and thoroughly overcoming the harsh natural conditions, John Dunbar conscientiously and patiently waits for other soldiers. At first sight, he's absolutely lonely. But he realized very quickly all advantages of his loneliness: finally he was left alone with himself. Getting acquainted with Sioux, with their way of life, rituals and law, he doesn't look for personal gain. His aspiration to become closer with new neighbors, to be imbued with their traditions and, in the end, to become a part of their tribe, was dictated not by desire to relieve the lonely pastime or establish the good neighborly relations with strangers. All his acts ? are heartfelt needs heart and soul. The destiny an incredible way throws John in the dizzying centrifuge of even more incredible circumstances, which frenzied rotation only strengthens his will and morale, opening him his true capabilities and personal orientations. Going over to the Sioux side and fighting against the U.S. Army, Dances with Wolves has no doubts in his right choice and actions. He doesn't compromise with his conscience, he acts jointly with it. He had found himself, the meaning of his way, and he didn't betray these acquirement.John Dunbar stepped into a heroic way from his birth and relentlessly moved on it even on unconscious level, without changing neither his route nor to himself. Ha was a hero even before accomplishment of his heroic feat. He went all his life to these and subsequent feats. John Dunbar didn't become Dances with Wolves, he became himself. And those circumstances, which thick he gets into, only push him to the frontier within himself, his genuine predestination.The staggering movie! And staggering Kevin Costner!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the best "going native" film to date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film that manages to combine deep and meaningful character study with exotic locations and the feel of an adventure. Dances with Wolves is one of those rare films where time becomes transcendent and you're no longer able to perceive the usual story arcs or acts. They're there and the film has a rock-solid foundation, but you're still surprised when something new happens, because the film has managed to lull you into its world, its prolonged seasons. This is a movie that is able to portray the passage of time properly. It's a film in which events don't take place over a weekend or even a month. Rather whole years just glide by. Or perhaps just months, it's impossible to say for sure, but it feels like years, a sizable chunk of a whole life.And what a life that is and what a person living it. Lieutenant Dunbar - masterfully played by Kevin Costner - is a war hero given a dead end assignment according to his wishes, so that he can resign there to die a slow death. Thus the film starts as a macabre portrayal of a man giving up, but unable to just lay down. And it never becomes clear whether he manages to shake that initial attitude towards life. The events slowly give him more reasons to live, but Costner always plays him slightly detached, like he's always just one step away from giving up again. It's an amazing story and one that requires space to flourish. Quite many films since this one have managed to recreate the same "going native" storyline, which of course existed before this film though never quite like this, but none of them have seemed to realize that the film needs to dedicate most of its running time to the actual "going". Because that's the story, that's the attraction. The action scenes and battles have their place, but the magic is in the community, in the bonds that slowly grow between the main character and the natives.It's very hard to find any flaws in this film. Its slow pace is not for everyone, especially in the extended cut, but I personally never complained or even noticed the hours. It's a captivating film from start to finish and every minute is well spent, be it a minute of quiet landscapes rolling by or a minute of blazing battle. All has its place and every scene tells a story, reveals another layer.One of the greatest westerns ever filmed, if not one of the greatest films. In my opinion a film that everyone should watch at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie " Dances with Wolves " is very especial and has very important position in the film history. Director Kevin Costner audaciously choose this genre which is recognized unpopular themes at that time. And he successfully revive this almost dying genre. Secondly , and most important point is that it changed the central values of traditional Westerns, from old- fashioned in white as the lead out of personal heroism , to the continent of North America between whites and Aboriginal cultural conflict and explore mutually and understand the thinking, so that the " Dances with Wolves " has become the most anthropological spirit of Westerns.This movie begin with Lieutenant Dunbar's unsuccessful suicide action in the Civil War. After that he choose go to the frontier as a hero, because he want the peaceful life. Unfortunately, Major Bulu suicided and the transport team is killed, so Lieutenant Dunbar lost the connect with the white world. Then he become the friend of the Sioux tribe which is the native American. After Dunbar lives in the pueblo, he find there is a team of whites soldiers come to his camp. Because Dunbar totally becomes a native people, the whites soldiers treat Dunbar traitor, and they want to kill both Lieutenant Dunbar and Sioux. At last, Dunbar leaves Sioux with his wife, and the Sioux is survived.The first half of the film is based on the perspective of U.S. Lieutenant Dunbar into the strange world . The second half , the director show the white world and the Sioux world as the same plane to the audience. It is no longer the identity of the white explorers into Sioux life , because it is not object that observed with the core of Western values. As a very long time, the roles speak the Sioux language , playing "alternative" masterpieces with English subtitles. Kevin Costner wanna bring the audience to such a viewing angle, which out of the standard value of Sioux and whites. Let the viewer to evaluate the main contradiction of their way of their thinking and the conflict between them, and to the maximum extent advocated by the audience-selves.To connect with the America frontier culture, I think that Dunbar is totally a typical American hero, especially with the braveness and the can-do spirit. He come to the desolate strange place without any complain, even negative mood. He is not afraid of the terrible environment. He adjusts to the tough environment very well and open his mind to accept the totally different culture and value standard. Of course, Dunbar is a tough guy. Anyway, he is the hero of the Civil War, because he is so strong at both physical and spirit. So he survives from the culture conflict and the different life. " Dances with Wolves " is the excellent movie not only because its anthropological angle, but also because the art aspects. Only the Academy Awards, " Dances with Wolves " got 10 Oscar prizes, include the best picture, the best director, the best cinematography, the best film editing, the best sound, etc. There are enough evidences to proof my opinion that " Dances with Wolves " is one of the most excellent movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lt. John Dunbar is dubbed a hero after he accidentally leads Union troops to a victory during the Civil War.He requests a position on the western frontier, but finds it deserted. He soon finds out he is not alone, but meets a wolf he dubs "Two-socks" and a curious Indian tribe.Dunbar quickly makes friends with the tribe, and discovers a white woman who was raised by the Indians.He gradually earns the respect of these native people, and sheds his white-man's ways....It has taken me almost twenty years to pluck up the courage to watch this movie. it had many mixed reviews, and a three hour long western just didn't appeal to me, despite enjoying Wyatt Earp.How stupid have i been, ignoring this classic film for so many years. Costners acting may not be the best in the world, but the man knows how to direct a beautiful setting and connotations, and how to tell a story.For the majority of the first and second act, we are almost in castaway territory with Costner, one man trying to rebuild something, maybe himself, but it's so intimate and well shot, you cannot help but be compelled by every scene that is on screen.His relationship with the Siousx tribe is beautiful and very unpredictable, you would expect them to hate him, but he is such a placid character after cheating death, you cannot help but like the man.everything about this film oozes class, from the child like encounters with two socks, to the exhilarating buffalo stampede.A fine piece of cinema,,</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Going Native American</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kevin Costner directed and starred in this rather incredible tale of an army officer who goes to live with and then identifies with Sioux Indians. If this was British India instead of the American west the British colonial officials would be saying Costner had gone native.Dances With Wolves tells the story of Lieutenant John Dunbar who after a suicidal act that gets him a medal also gets him transfered to the western frontier where only a corporal's guard of an army remains while the country is engaged in the Civil War. The post that Costner is assigned to is completely deserted so he and his supplies are just left there and Costner sets up house and prepares the place for occupation when the troops do come. But before they come, the Sioux Indians come calling.During the early part of the 19th century what Costner did could be considered groundbreaking diplomacy if he were not a military officer. He did nothing more than what the trappers and mountain men did before him, learn the ways of the Indian and live peacefully among them only looking to do their trapping thing. Someone like Kit Carson would have understood Costner's John Dunbar very well. But what a colossal mistake this guy makes when after riding with the Sioux into battle against their enemy the Pawnee, incidentally supplied with army rifles and ammunition that came out with Costner; he comes into the now occupied fort by a company of soldiers wearing Sioux regalia. Of course they shoot at him and certainly he's going to be thought of as a renegade, a latter day Simon Girty if you will.John Ford would certainly not recognize the cavalry troopers from any of his films. These guys are a real scurvy lot. However those who stayed in the army at the end of the Civil War were a bunch who saw action in such places as Shiloh, Chickamauga, Cold Harbor, and Antietam to name some of the bloodiest battles of the Civil War. Seen in that light their attitudes toward Costner are understandable.Dances With Wolves won a flock of Oscars including Best Picture and Best Director for Costner and a bunch of technical awards. The cinematography one was really earned, especially with the buffalo hunting sequence which reminds one of the Robert Taylor MGM classic, The Last Hunt. Director Costner couldn't direct actor Costner to the Oscar though, he lost to Jeremy Irons in Reversal Of Fortune. Ditto for Mary McDonnell who lost for Best Supporting Actress to Whoopi Goldberg for Ghost and Graham Greene who lost for Best Supporting Actor to Joe Pesci for Goodfellas.Dances With Wolves is an epic western in the tradition of Cimarron which was the last western before Dances With Wolves to come away with a Best Picture Oscar. It's the tragic story of the American Indians facing the inevitable triumph of a hunter/gatherer society being trampled by an agricultural/industrial society. The sociologists would assign no guilt or blame, it's just a fact of life. It's also the story of a decent if horribly misguided man. In fact not since Alec Guinness in The Bridge On The River Kwai have we seen a character like Costner's John Dunbar who just takes the wrong tack in trying to deal with a bad situation.If you like your westerns mature and intelligent than Dancing With Wolves is a film to treasure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic Western dances with magic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes we forget how great some movies are. Dances with Wolves feels as if it were flickering on the big screens of America yesterday, not 19 years ago. It's been sitting on my DVD rack for a long time, and I figured would make a fitting viewing for a Labor Day evening. Captivating is a word that's been overused, as is magic, but the scale, natural beauty, and plot of this film transcend the extraordinary. It also received seven Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director (Kevin Costner). That's big potatoes in anybody's book....For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com.Brian Wright Copyright 2009</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie gives value to cinema! The approach with the indigenous people is absolutely realistically done. The film also has a sublime anthropological touch. In the past many movies did not handle well the indigenous issues. Often they are abused for pure entertaining reasons rather then being historical factual. It isn't easy to reflect the past in a reasonable way but dances with wolves is very close to it even if the characters are fictional (as far as I know). This movie is a top favorite. Kevin Costner shines in this movie as I never saw him acting before and he's not the only one performing brilliantly.. It is my wish the movie is used in many educative projects. The Pawnee ? Sioux conflict scenes might not represent the Pawnee correctly. One more love story would have been adding more suspense (egg Pawnee ?Sioux) but one has to make choices not to overload the movie. The indigenous tribes had their conflicts but rarely they ended in violent conflicts before colonisation although life was difficult and far from an idyllic paradise but their philosophies, views on the world were and are more advanced and profound then often mentioned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Dances with Wolves" is marked as a western, but it is far from a typical entry into the genre. The film's focus isn't on gunslingers, but rather Lieutenant Dunbar, an officer in the Union army during the American Civil War and his relationship with the Sioux tribe. The film has a superb Civil War scene to introduce the disillusioned officer. Following this is a memorable performance from Maury Chaykin, who sends the lieutenant on his mission to the frontier.Slowly Lieutenant Dunbar learns about the Sioux tribe and integrates himself into it. This leads to several episodes that include such things as breaking the language barrier and making war on the Pawnee. I liked the fact that the Sioux spoke in Lakota, albeit a simplified version. These episodes are portrayed with high caliber cinematography and the aid of an excellent score by John Barry. The film can be slow-paced at times, but is interesting overall. Kevin Costner is decent as Lieutenant Dunbar and the supporting cast gives excellent performances.The theatrical cut is a good one, but I enjoyed the additions in the extended cut. The additions are appropriate and aid in characterization. "Dance with Wolves" is a key film dealing with Native American culture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Western but Rehash of Romantic Tradition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dances With Wolves is a great epic Western with strong supporting roles. The message, that there are sympathetic Indians, is nothing new, however. But much of the story stems from the Romantic tradition in literature, with a white hero removed (and fed up with) civilization and the indigenous people the "children of nature." Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote about it, and Dances With Wolves follows through with many of his themes.Speaking about writing, an excellent interview with screenwriter Michael Blake appears in "Making the White Man's Indian: Native Americans and Hollywood Movies." (Praeger, 2005) The book contains many behind-the-screen anecdotes about Indians in Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Dances with Wolves" is about soldiers, Indians, and the frontier now gone. True.But it is about a frontier much greater than any pioneering could encounter: a frontier always present: the love between a man and a woman.The film peaks at the point where Mary McDonnell ("Stands with a fist") runs to embrace Kevin Kostner (John Dunbar/"Dances with Wolves") upon his return to the Souix camp after being rescued by his Souix friends. All the rest of the film serves that end: the enchantment and 'romantic' sentiment of a people tragically ended against their will, is encapsulated in the love that "Stands with a fist" and John Dunbar have for each other.Highly recommended. To be watched with the phone off the hook.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first watched this film when I was eight years old. I had a hard time staying up to watch the entire movie, but I did, and at the age of eight years old I managed to think this is one of the greatest films of all time. Kevin Costner plays John Dunbar, a Civil War soldier who chooses to go to an abandoned outpost far out in the Dakotas. He has ample supply, and is all alone. However that situation is soon to change as he realizes that there are Indians that live close to him. The Indians, who are Sioux are supposedly hostile, however Lieutenant John Dunbar soon finds differently. This is another movie that is all acting, very little violence, and when there is violence it is not Hollywood violence with all kinds of explosion and special effects. This is a movie that is sweeping in it's excellence and unrelenting in it's execution. The movie does not stop, it is without a doubt one of the finest films of all time. Kevin Costner turns in a nothing less than brilliant performance. Graham Greene plays Kicking Bird, Rodney A. Grant Plays Wind in His Hair, and Mary McDonnell plays Stands with a Fist. Also watch for Robert Pastorelli, who does an excellent character part. Before this movie I generally watched a lot of action movies, and really did not appreciate movies like this, but when I saw this movie I think I saw it close to ten times in the theaters, and I enjoyed it every time. What is there not to like about the film? The cinematography is excellent, the writing is excellent, actually a lot better than excellent. The direction is spectacular, everything is great. Remember the wolf, Two Sox, I loved that little wolf, he was so cool. This ranks among my top ten films. The movie is just an all around masterpiece. Everyone in this movie does an excellent job, and I will probably watch this movie a lot more. Another great aspect of this movie was the attention this movie gave to the Sioux culture. Unfortunately even up to this point many films portray Native Americans in a bad manner, with many stereotypes, or in a bad manner. This movie does no such thing, it actually has a very good portrayal of Native Americans. There really is not one week point in this film. Every point, whether John Dunbar is actually fighting the civil war, or going with his guide to the Dakotas, the movie keeps your interest the whole time.The guide, played by Robert Pastorelli does an excellent job. He is very funny, until (SPOILER) he meets an untimely demise. The ending is very ad, but it didn't make me cry. When I was very young I thought this was the best film of all time. As I have gotten older, and watched a few more films I don't think it's the greatest, but it remains among my top ten. This is just a very emotional, very well told, and all around brilliant story without one single weak point. Now you have to ask yourself, Kevin Costner has proven himself to be a fine actor in this film, in fact one of the best of all time. Now why is it he chooses to do this brilliant film, and then turns around to do crappy films like water world? What makes this man go from such brilliance, to sheer idiocy?I don't understand how such a great actor can go from making a brilliant film like this to some other mediocre film like Waterworld. What happened? Why did this great actor go from making a brilliant film like this to some of the stinkers he would produce in the future? Despite Costner's future movies Dances with Wolves is the art of movie-making at it's best. People should look at this movie as an example of great film-making. This is a sweeping epic, that is rarely found in this age of film making. This movie is in the tradition of Lawrence of Arabia, Ben-Hur and Others. This movie is just wonderful, and I recommend it to almost anyone that likes to watch movies, as almost anyone (to me anyway) can like a movie like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS!!!!!! SPOILERS!!!!!!!!! SPOILERS!!!!!!!!! This film is a romanticized and sympathetic look (finally) at the Native American side of US expansion in the 1800's. A solitary US Army officer is sent out to manage a vast area of territory and is befriended by the Native Americans, without whom he would not have survived. Eventually, though, the Army comes through and is not pleased to find that he's "turned Injun". The film accurately paints the white man as encroaching upon land that they had signed a treaty that gave that land to the Native Americans. The white man indiscriminately kills the Bison that the Native Americans needed for food and shelter. Altogether, not a pretty picture of the white man and a somewhat romanticized picture of the Native American. The acting is superb and the story, unfortunately, is most likely similar to one played over and over again in the west.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I have mixed feelings about this film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First let me talk about what I consider to be the strengths of this movie. John Barry's score is excellent and well deserves the oscar it won. Dean Semler's cinematography is magnificent and, to me, the highlight of the movie. For many years I considered the cinematography of "Lawrence of Arabia" to be the best I had ever seen. Now I'm not so sure. To me, the filming of the buffalo hunt/chase is one of the great achievements in movie history. And the filming of the vistas and the land under different lighting conditions is outstanding.I did not see the performances of any of Mary McDonnell's competitors, but was very disappointed that she did not win for Best Supporting Actress. And the nominations for Art - Set Decoration and Costume Design were very well deserved.Another top achievement was getting to know the Indians very intimately and coming to realize that individually, the Indians of the 1860s are very much like white people today. And it showed, to an extent, how Indian culture of the 1860s differed so vastly from white culture of the same time. It would have been a good idea, I think, to have developed this aspect some more.That is one of the weaknesses, in my opinion, of this movie. Another is the tendency to portray the Sioux as 100% good and the whites and the Pawnee as close to 100% bad. I have a handful of reputable books that all point out that there were a significant number of whites who were sympathetic to the Indians during this time. Unfortunately for the Indians, there weren't enough of them and most were back east.Regarding the Pawnee, it is true that they were enemies of the Sioux. But so were the Crow, Shoshone, and some lesser tribes. From what I have read in my books, the various tribes of the Great Plains competed against each other for enough land to support them. They needed water, grass for their horse herds, wild game for food, and buffalo for just about everything. They warred against each other. But that doesn't make one tribe "good" and another tribe "bad".Finally, there is too much of Kevin Costner in this movie. I don't know if he realizes or agrees, but it seems that he was trying to make himself, not the people of the Sioux village, the centerpiece of the movie. If someone else had done the narration, that would have been a big help. Or if someone else had played the part of Lt. Dunbar, that also would have been a good idea.</fullReview>

Remarkably winning epic about a Civil War Union Army lieutenant who befriends a tribe of Plains Indians and falls in love with a white woman accustomed to her native clan. Grand undertaking by novice director Costner (who won Oscars for Best Picture and Director) with incredible results including one wild buffalo stampede sequence. Oscars went to Michael Blake for his screenplay adaptation of his novel; Dean Semler's breathtaking photography; editing; John Barry's musical score; and sound.

		<fullReview>Possible Spoilers!Dances With Wolves was my favorite movie for a long time and still is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I saw it for the first time at the movies,in 1990.At that moment I was 11 years old and it made a huge impression on me,because this was the first "mature" movie I had ever seen in the cinema,maybe together with Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.I remember that I thought that the scene in which Timmons,the dirty mexican,gets butchered by Pawnee Indians was very gruesome and it still is,as a matter a fact.My favorite scene was and still is the scene with the Buffalo's,a beautifully made scene. And then the surroundings,the beautiful country in which the Indians lived freely until the white men showed up.The movie shows the Indian life from the Sioux point of view,which makes the Pawnee bad guys.But still,the real evil men in the movie are the white men and rightly so.Costner(his best role in his career together with "the Untouchables") plays an American soldier called John Dunbar who wants to live in the Indian land peacefully.He meets with the Sioux Indians and starts to become an Indian,especially after he gets named Dances With Wolves(Sioux see him fool around with a wolf) and marries an Indian/white woman. Costner,who also directs the movie,gives the white soldiers their true face as brutal killers.The scene that gives the best image of that is when the soldiers kill Costner's horse and shoot on the wolf.In the end the white soldiers get killed by the Sioux Indians and that makes the viewer happy.The real end of the movie is rather sad,though.Costner leaves the Sioux with his wife and as we see them leave the camera goes away from the two and a text shows us that almost all the Indian tribes get killed or captured by the white soldiers.The version that I saw at the cinema was 3 hours long,but I've got a version of 4 hours on video that is as good as the 3 hour version. A must see for everybody we wants to see the story from the opposite side of John Wayne,the Indians. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Twelve years old and still a hit!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Dances with Wolves' begins in 1863 during the Civil War. John Dunbar(Kevin Costner), a Lt. for the Union Army, earned a high honor from his heroism. The Union Army rewarded him when it assigned him to an empty Fort Sedwick on the frontier. Gradually, John and the Sioux overcame their fear of one another and learned each other's way of life and language, with the help of Stands With A Fist(Mary McDonnell), a white woman raised by the tribe, whom Dunbar marries. Dunbar befriends a wolf he named Two Socks. Dunbar receives the name Dances with Wolves, because the Sioux witnessed him playing with the wolf in the field. Dances with Wolves' conscious catches up with him, and he tells the tribe that the white men will be looking for him. The best thing for the tribe is for him and his wife to leave.The intention for this movie was not just to entertain, but to teach a lesson about American History. `Dances with Wolves' demonstrates how much love the Sioux Indians had for their land. The purity of the land tended by the Indians compared to the land taken over by white people shows that the Indians' respect for nature ran more deeply. Kevin Costner(director) cared deeply about the making of this movie, because he wanted to show every minor detail possible, particularly from the way the horses ran freely along the land to the way the tribe congregated around a fire at night to celebrate their victorious hunt of buffalo.The length of `Dances with Wolves' is 180 minutes long. I did not think that was too bad, compared to the four hour editor's edition. South Dakota is marvelous for the setting. `Dances with Wolves' is packed with drama, romance, action, and comedy. Even though this film is twelve years old, it is still a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie I can watch over and over again, even though it has a long running time. This was truly a gift of love for Kevin Costner. You can tell that he really cares about the subject by the way he paid attention to the smallest details. The music is one thing that really impresses me. It is so beautiful and uplifting. I find myself humming along while I am watching the movie. The scenery is incredible. You find yourself wanting to run in those fields, maybe not with the buffalo; that could be dangerous! The actors that were chosen by Costner were perfectly cast. I could not picture anyone else in the roles. The Lakota are beautiful people and are portrayed as a noble, caring, brave and close-knit community. They take pleasure and pride in family. This movie has everything; action, drama, suspense, humour and yes, a gratuitous butt shot. Kevin Costner is a fine male specimen and a joy to behold. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wishes they could have seen the west before it was tamed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes Westerns don't need to have the typical "stranger comes to town" or "hero goes on a journey" type story line in it. Kevin Costner created a marvelous film, one which will stake his place in Hollywood. I've always felt John Barry's score will be one of the most revered musical scores in the history of cinema. Even today, we still hear 'John Dunbar's Theme' in commercials and public service announcements. Even though he scored most of the James Bond films, this will be his opus. The only part I didn't like about this film was the aftermath. Costner stuck to too many similar story lines, and eventually became his undoing. His own ego has caused his slide in Hollywood, and he may never regain the artistry he greedily adorned us with in regards to this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good story line makes this one stand out from the others</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The history of the western has gone through several traumatic changes: from the good guys (sherriffs and soldiers) killing the bad guys (usually feather-wearing and painted in ochres) with chaps like Hoppalong Cassidy or John Wayne doing their bit, but usually without much serious subject matter. Sergio Leone with Clint Eastwood (and the great music by Ennio Morricone) tried to make the western into an art form, which had also been tried with Yul Brynner in `The Magnificent Seven'. Kevin Costner has made more mistakes than good films: Dances with Wolves is probably his best. Well filmed, good story-line, mostly good acting, and of course the only really good music from John Barry, who is usually so repetitive he gets sickening (apart from his really majestic apportation in `Zulu' 1964). `Dances with Wolves' stands out from most films related with the Civil War and/or general Westerns in that there is more sincerity, more human compassion and feeling, without forgetting the superb photography. The buffalo hunt was just simply superb, really great filming. I've just seen this film for the second time, and even so it did not seem too long in its cinema three-hour form. I shall watch it again some day......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fable, not history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Predictably "Hollywood-esque", but sometimes surprising (no doubt stemming from its literary origins), this Costner-directed story is certainly well made. Strangely, I've never been able to determine the depth of the star's acting talent in any film in which he's appeared. In DW, his oral narration is weak but his passive presence throughout the rest of the film is adequate for the role. Regrettable is the movie's attempt to be both (historically) realistic and morally abstract. The ethical simplicity of the plot and its characters does not lend itself to a stern history lesson, in which we are taught that the White man is (almost inherently) corrupt, the Sioux is a noble savage and environmental guardian, and the Pawnee, a bloodthirsty barbarian. What I mean is that these characterizations are fine outside of the pretension that they are the truth; the stock nature of the story is suitable only for drama (as opposed to realism). I would not be too concerned if it were made in an age where the audience was more sophisticated, because it is clear to me that one should not be deceived by the film's historic appearance into thinking literally about the nature of the plot. Rather, Dunbar (Costner) is a man who confronts the frontier within himself after a flirtation with suicide. The western limits of America in 1863 happen to form the concrete setting--the dramatic effect of pathetic fallacy--for his internal struggle. We must also remember the extraordinary influence on the American character that was the frontier--Indians or no Indians. While watching Dunbar's notebook being borne away by the river after a brutal--and decisive--struggle with Union troops, I found myself admiring the metaphor, but was also a little disappointed by its naiveté; but later, when he again comes into possession of it, the implications are problematic, more serious.Other comments: I found the narration confusing, in that it wasn't clear what chronological perspective was being adopted. What is the deal with the officer with whom Dunbar speaks before departing into the hinterland ("I p***ed my pants, and there's nothing anyone can do about it", etc.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently saw this movie for the first time. Except for all that killing, I thought it was really good. Kevin Costner's performance as Union soldier John Dunbar was wonderful and using real Native Americans in the film was a good idea. In fact I know a chubby, crude-talking Native American girl who said that one of her relatives was in the movie. I guess it could be possible. It really had some emotional moments such as the scenes where the soldiers were shooting at the wolf who came to Dunbar's fort often (thus this is how he got the Indian name, Dances With Wolves) and where they were attacking the Sioux. What's interesting to note is that my mom pointed out that normally in movies, the Indians are portrayed as being the bad guy and they never showed any positive characteristics about them, whereas in this movie, the white people are portrayed as the bad guys (except for John Dunbar) which in a way was true. That was the Indians' land and white people took it away. This was a wonderful film and is worth watching several times.</fullReview>

At times painful to watch, but that is the reality of our history. At the very least it may encourage you to do some research into native American life. I wasn't there, so I can't say whether Costner's representation is exactly true, which is a point that seems to bother many people. I found it to be a tribute to the Native Americans and not a glorification of some wonderful white guy who showed up to save them all. Costner's character in fact brought danger to these people ( which leads to a very emotional, powerful ending ). It is clearly shown that *they* taught *him*, not vice versa.A masterpiece of a movie, worthy of the awards it won.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dances With Wolves is a tremendous Movie! It's stunning visuals by Cinematographer Dean Semler, and stirring music by John Barry capture each mood of the film as we follow John Dunbar's ( Kevin Costner ) travels from an Army Field Hospital in the Civil War, to his friendship with the Sioux Indians on the plains. Kevin Costner's direction of the Movie is superb too, with his obvious feel for not only the characters and story-line but for the landscape also. Costner shows great imagination, particularly when the story leaves the horrors of the War in the East and moves onto the endless sea of waving grassland in the West, catching the loneliness of the windswept frontier and the sadness also of the Plains Indian, ever hoping the White Man would not come their way. The film spends much of it's time exploring the Indian perspective, in particular their language, as Dunbar slowly learns their ways and culture while falling in love with Stands With A Fist, played by Mary McDonnell. There are some sad scenes in the Movie, Dunbar losing Cisco his horse after being fired on by his own Calvary and seeing also his friend the lone wolf get shot by the same Calvarymen, but the most poignant part of the film came, ( as expected ) in the end when the Indians were fleeing the Soldiers and Dunbar, with Stands With A Fist now his bride, left to go their own way. Dances With Wolves is an outstanding Western, beautifully photographed and along with many other accolades the film has attracted, supports a balanced view of the struggle for culture and civilization.</fullReview>

After seeing it in the theater and then purchasing the movie and watching it at home, it was a little disappointing. On a regular TV screen is an injustice to the film. Actually, I first read the book and even enjoyed that more than the film!! It portrays Indians in a more realistic manner than the old black and white movies where the Indians were ALWAYS bad.

THE WHOLE MOVIE WAS THOROUGHLY ENJOYABLE DESPITE ITS LENGTH, NOT ONCE DID I FIND IT DRAGGING ON OR LACKING IN ANY WAY. THERE AREN'T MANY FILMS THAT PORTRAY NATIVE AMERICAN INDIAN LIFE IN SUCH A WAY. EVEN IF IT WAS A COMPLETE FABRICATION I WOULD HAVE FOUND IT ENJOYABLE BUT IT WAS VERY TRUE TO THE ACTUAL LIFE EXPERIENCE IN SOME WAYS, GOING FROM THE MANY BOOKS I HAVE READ ON THE SUBJECT THAT WERE WRITTEN BY ACTUAL NATIVE AMERICAN INDIANS.IN CONCLUSION, DANCES WITH WOLVES IS A FILM THAT I HAVE WATCHED OVER AND OVER AGAIN WITHOUT EVER HAVING FELT BORED WITH IT. IT MAY NOT BE EVERYONE'S CUP OF TEA BUT IT CERTAINLY IS MINE!THANKS FOR READING, KELLY.</fullReview>

The performance of Kevin Costner is believable, and all the performances, as well as the direction and photography are really good.

		<fullReview>The idea behind this "epic" is well-intentioned. However the film is over -rated. Showing the sufferings of Native Americans in the face of ruthless "manifest destiny" has been done in a number of films. This depiction is fair but not really believable mainly because of Kostner who delivers his usually bland performance and never really convinces me that he is the hero he wants me to believe he is. At the end of the seemingly endless film, I felt as if I had been at a sermon instead of a drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This rambling and hokey film has Costner becoming best friends with Sioux Indians. Within weeks he masters the Sioux language. Meanwhile, a white woman kidnapped by the Indians when she was a toddler suddenly starts speaking fluent English. And of course the two of them speak the language of love. This is basically a vanity project for Costner, as he lovingly puts himself front and center in just about every scene. The narration is mostly superfluous, and Costner's voice lacks the gravitas needed to make if work. The pacing is extremely leisurely. It appears that the intent was to break the three-hour mark whether the story was worthy of it or not. Also, there's too much blood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Costner can't act, way out of his depth here, even in this dreadful film which portrays the extermination of an entire race like a romantic Rock Hudson matinée. Its a good job the film is mostly set in the great plains instead of forests as the trees would have probably out-acted the leading man. The film follows the Hollywood formula for peaceful whiteman meets indians.... the love interest of course must be a white women and the leading man must then earn the respect of the natives by out performing them at almost every facet of their own lives (Tarzan?) Watch Black Robe. 1991. instead for an altogether more realistic depiction of a native people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Photographically Beautiful, But Overlong And Stereotypical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw it several weeks ago at a house party, and the people who did see it before said they didn't remember the whole movie. Which turned out to be no real surprise, as the movie is chock-full of beautiful nature scenes and massive movements of people and buffalo, because once you get past all the window dressing, the storyline is simplistic and slow-moving and the characters are mostly stereotypes.The Sioux are the "good" Indians, the Pawnee, enemies of the Sioux, are the "evil" Indians, and the American soldiers (except for Lt. Dunbar) are all complete buffoons who make the Keystone Kops look like models of professionalism. The reality, of course, is that cruelty, violence, and imperialism were practiced not only by the white man but by Indian nations against one another. The white man won because the Indians hated each other too much to unite (and still do). But Hollywood movies rarely make genuine attempts at telling history accurately anyway.I should note that MAD Magazine, when it satirized this movie by comparing it with several others, said that none of the movies (Dances With Wolves included) were a serious depiction of the American Indian. I agree.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just a short note because i got angry seeing this 8.0 rating for this movie.Surely that was one of the greatest movies ever. People decided otherwise. OK. Dark knight and Alien for example get a 8.8 and 8.5 but Dances with Wolves just an 8.0? I wonder if i live in the wrong world. Either i'm a moron or the others are. An 8.0? What else do you want to see from a movie??Anyway this movie left me with a sense of multiple different great feelings throughout it as it was developing and of course in the end. Sorrow and grief for sure, admiration for some things, forbidden hope and definitely made me re-evaluate some things even changing me as a person a bit. And that is because of showing with such a great way about how we, "modern" humans are changing/destroying the natural world, the earth, our home. Without caring at all for anything but ourselves. This is depressing to realize it. But i guess only for a small portion of people since others just want to see things to explode to understand a movie. :-(</fullReview>

The scenes of the buffalo hunt are something that we've all read about but until this movie could never really imagine, this movie is packed with just such memorable scenes from the old west! I was elevated out my modern day existence and dropped into an incredible world which has now sadly disappeared! Finally the native American is humanized in this film and what we find are people just like us, just trying to survive and raise their children in an increasingly dangerous and changing world. Of all the great performances in this film Graham Greene's performance stands out as one that is truly incredible and he should have won an Oscar for it. IMDb must shake their heads if this is not in the top 10 or 20 all time movies. Remember it won several Oscar and Golden Globe awards, far more than some of those that IMDb have listed in the top 20 or 50 or 100 or 250.

Above all, it was a tribute to the spirit, courage and selflessness of a man who wanted to see the frontier before it disappeared.I still find it hard to put the feelings it evoked into words. Any picture from the movie can say it all. The cinematography is gorgeous and the actors are clearly dedicated.

		<shortDescription>The Last of the Great Hollywood Romantic Epics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very few films get better the more times you see them. Dances With Wolves is that film - for me at least - or one of them. I specificy me because the last time I saw this was when I was a young'un and today I am delighted to discover a film that is just as beautiful and moving as I remember it. I was judging it for its pure surface value then - and now I could judge it on that or anything else - on every level this film manages to succeed. It is one of the last of the Great Hollywood Romantic Epics tailored for for the spiritual grandeur of John Ford. Luckily for us, director Costner happens to be Ford's near-exact size. It's sad Ford died 17 years before the release of this film, because it is one while watching, one wishes Ford had seen it too. You know he would have been pleased. This was also that brief point in Kevin Costner's career where he was suddenly likable, and charismatic, and INTERESTING. Wow! Dances With Wolves is to Kevin Costner as is Wonder Boys is to Michael Douglas. Here he brings it together with a superb directing job that finely rivals Martin Scorsece's work that year on Goodfellas. Many have called Dances' win one of the worst, but I'm fine with it winning. Both this and Goodfellas are near perfect films in completely different ways, and some days I have a hard time deciding which is better. When Hollywood has neglected the subject of the Native Americans' plight (there are a few notable exceptions, such as Ford's "Cheyenne Autumn" and "Little Big Man") this film officially does all that has been missing justice in one grand, beautiful film. It begins with a spell-bindingly ridiculous sequence where Costner somehow fails to commit suicide riding a horse in front of enemy Confederate lines - it climaxes thrillingly, a battle on the creek where we twitch furiously happily every time our Sioux take down another Union'er. It ends with the devastating tragedy of a historical fact. David Lean died in 1991, and I have to wonder whether he ever saw this film too. This film is very much the mix of Lean and Ford, and I can't imagine any two director's who could be more perfectly combined. There are empty spaces in their works that could be filled by the others' - and thanks to Kevin, the space is filled. It wins Oscars for Best Supporting Actor - Rodney A. Grant Best Original Score Best Cinematography Best Costume Design and Nominations for Best Picture (and on some days I give it the win) Best Director Best Adapted Screenplay (see Best Picture) Best Actor - Kevin Costner Best Supporting Actor - Graham Greene Best Art Direction/Set Decoration Best Sound Best Editing</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How many "westerns" have you seen where the dominant action scene featured the "good guys" killing a bunch of Indians? Or how many times did a white man play an Indian on TV? I'm not blaming "white America" for this, perhaps the blame lies in Hollywood. I do allow that I probably played cowboys and Indians as a child, and the Indians are always the bad guys who die first. Maybe all of that stuff made me really appreciate "Dances with Wolves". The movie showed two very different races and yet also showed that the two could peacefully co-exist. It wasn't one of those "hey, we don't know what it is or understand it, so let's kill it!" kind of movies. The movie had great scenery, a fantastic score by John Barry, and plenty of action. There was even a love story to keep the lady viewers tuned in. Yes, John Barry did write scores for some of the James Bond movies, but nothing like what he wrote for this. Perhaps the material inspired him. This movie resonates with me, and I can't say that about many movies. If you can only own one western, get this one!</fullReview>

I was put off originally by the very long running time and the genre not knowing if i would enjoy a 3 hour western but that was soon forgotten about when watching, the music is dramatic and the scenery and cinematography are stunning.

		<shortDescription>Very Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I avoided seeing this movie for quite a long time as I generally don't like straight dramas, but was surprised when I finally did see it at how much I enjoyed it. The movie is about a civil war soldier, John Dunbar (Kevin Costner), sent to an outpost in the western frontier. There he encounters an Indian tribe camped a short distance from his outpost. He gradually becomes acquainted with the members of the tribe and, in time, becomes friends with the tribe. What makes this movie so good is being able to see and feel sympathetic to how the indians' land was more or less taken from them by the white man. It was done very cleverly by showing how John Dunbar went from the attitude most people have ( the indians were savages ) to understanding their culture and coming to appreciate it and understanding they were only protecting their way of life and territory. Most of the really good movies, like this one, will have you come away with an altered point of view or, at least, make you look at something in a way you haven't before.</fullReview>

It definitely IS the groundbreaking masterpiece in depicting the American natives' lives from a different viewpoint and still deserves all the Oscars it got at the time. My only objection is that Kevin Costner puts himself in the frame just a bit too often and for too long. As for the rest, the performances are impressive, the story heartwarming and heartbreaking, totally believable, the production design just awesome and the direction, though sagging at times,as good as it can get. Kevin Costner should stick to direction, here he shows a wonderful talent.

		<fullReview>This is an amazing film--particularly from an artistic point of view as well as the film's ability to convey emotion. When I saw this film in the theater, I felt totally drained and very sad, so it's obvious that Kevin Costner did a great job in directing this film. It was just wonderful.Now this isn't to say that the film is perfect. While great, in many ways the film makes the same mistake old-time Westerns used to make--they present characters in simple and black/white terms. In the old days, Indians were seen as savage, stupid and brutal--and for the most part, that's exactly how the Whites are portrayed in the film. Plus, the Sioux are practically perfect in every way. It's nice to see the deficiencies of older films are being counter-balanced--but it isn't very accurate either. In fact, twenty years earlier, I think LITTLE BIG MAN did a better job in showing the natives in a more realistic manner. The characters weren't quite as one-dimensional in this earlier film.Now despite this handicap, DANCES WITH WOLVES is still a marvelous film and deserved Oscar recognition--and not for reasons of political correctness. A combination of great evocative music, breathtaking cinematography and excellent acting made this one of the great films of the 1990s. However, from a purely historical point of view, it isn't the best history lesson--though it is a darn bit closer to the truth than you'd see in most other films of the genre.</fullReview>

I've seen the Dances With Wolves more than a hundred times...and look forward to seeing it again. It shows that a man can be tough, have dedication, love, and find his true self. If you've never seen it, sit down on a long winters night and watch it, you'll laugh, cry, get angry, and finish with a new feeling of hope...for yourself. That last thing may sound strange, but watch Dances With Wolves, and you'll see what I mean.I can't believe that it didn't rank on the Best 250 movies, and Pulp Fiction did. Honestly, when I read that fact, it made me angry! Pulp Fiction seemed to me as a "blood &amp; guts" film with no real meaning. Dances With Wolves was more than just a movie...

		<fullReview>Years ago I realised something, awards don't go to the best, but to the things we would like to do. Hollywood most wants to make long winded epics that relate to something people feel is important, without really saying anything (Eg, Titanic, Lord of the Rings).This slow meandering tale lacks any great impact, but works (unlike nearly everything else Costner did later) because it suits the story. Set during the American civil war, Costner plays a war hero who is sick of the war and goes to the west where a different war is being fought. With no men to command (they have disappeared before he arrives) he first makes contact with, then befriends the plains Indians.Yet so called civilised man is not that far away and that will bring tragic results.Everything that is wrong with Costner movies is right here, and you can't help to leave this movie a little bit moved from this journey into a another world that has been destroyed by our own.</fullReview>

He is a great actor and most of all a great director. "Dances With Wolves" is a grand and touching story of a wounded soldier in the american civil war, who chooses to take service in a small outpost in South Dakota. When he arrives, he finds the fort to be empty and abandoned. The only contact with other beings he get is with a wolf called Two Socks and with the local sioux-indians. After a while he gets interested in the indians and their way of life, and eventually becomes a member of the tribe. But the american soldiers are coming...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are few things wrong with this film. The writing is naturally paced, the acting is solid (with one exception), the cinematography is some of the most beautiful ever put on film, and the sound immerses the viewer in the environment. Kevin Costner's direction is nearly flawless as he gives the viewer a glimpse into the Native American culture and its decline.One of the only things I do not like about this film is Kevin Costner's inadequate, monotone performance. But that is hardly anything to balk at, when the surrounding material is so well executed. While the 3-hour theatrical version is great, I highly recommend the 4-hour cut. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fine Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most films this long would be better if they were shorter, but this isn't one of them. Somehow the slow pace of the film - especially near the beginning - is essential to establishing the isolation of the outpost. Other than the generally simplistic Indian good, White Man bad attitude of the movie it was a great flick. Well worth the Oscar nod, I'd call it one of the top 5 big epics, and for me I'd say it was second only to Lawrence of Arabia, and not by much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I got a kick reading the negative reviews for this film because they're all based upon: 1) technical aspects; 2) the fact that the white guy ends up with the white girl; 3) dislike of Kevin Costner. I don't like Costner but I think he made a great film. Anyone can make a film about politics but few can capture what it's like to befriend people when you don't share their language or culture and have no help from interpretors. I've had that experience and think this film captured it beautifully. People are individuals first. That's a simple message but it's powerful because it's easy to forget. Great job. A must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the all time greats</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a western, yet you never hear it mentioned with other all time great westerns, but it should be. One of the few pictures that won best picture that actually deserved it, the film follows the alienated Lt. Dunbar, who ends up befriending an indian tribe (Sioux). Indians are portrayed as human beings, not savages. The white man is the bad guy. As Dunbar gains the trust of the Sioux, we become more entranced with their interaction. You want to shake their hands, befriend them, know about them. You enter their world and forget about the rest of the world.The writing is crisp, the characters have depth and everything about this film is great. It's one of those films, that despite its three hour run time, you wish it was longer. No matter how many "Postmans" Costner directs, he'll always have this classic.Absolutely brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The First Great Film of the 1990s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dances With Wolves", along with "GoodFellas", helped to start what was, for the most part, an excellent decade for the cinema. Kevin Costner (in an Oscar-nominated role) plays a Union soldier during the Civil War who, after becoming a hero, requests a leave to see the American West before it is gone. While out west he becomes friends with the Lakota Sioux and soon finds inner peace and harmony in spite of the fact that the tribe is slowly disappearing because of the white man. Graham Greene (also Oscar-nominated) is the primary member of the tribe and Mary McDonnell (in an Oscar-nominated part as well) plays a white woman who has lived almost her whole life with the Lakota Sioux. However, this is Kevin Costner's show from start to finish. This is his greatest acting achievement and his amazing direction was enough to put "Dances With Wolves" over the top in 1990, allowing the film to capture seven Oscars, including one for Best Picture. The greatness of this film inspired other great film epics of the 1990s. "Unforgiven", "Schindler's List", "Braveheart", "The English Patient", "Titanic", and "Saving Private Ryan" all benefited from the dominance of this film in 1990. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is so bad!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's start with the technical aspects. The scene construction is clumsy, the cinematography is uninspiring and the story wreaks of condescension. I know Native Americans are a much maligned group, particularly in film, but surely they should demand better than this piece of drivel. This film's story defines contrived. Isn't it convenient that Costner, the only decent white man on the prairie, just happens to find the only white woman (decent or otherwise) on the prairie? What? Couldn't he fall in love with an Indian woman? That did happen back in the Old West on a regular basis. But I guess that was too much for Mr. Costner's sensibilities. It also smacks of racism. Costner is exploiting Indians, not illuminating them. Back in the 70s, Tom Laughlin made a series of Billy Jack films in which Laughlin played the white knight, schooled in the martial arts, taking up the defense of downtrodden Indians. This movie is just Billy Jack without the karate. What really gets me is the critical response to this worthless film. Have critics lost their minds when they fall for this? I've never trusted them since this movie came out. The critics' reaction to this film so soured me against them that I now go to movies that are panned by critics. There is nothing redeemable about this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dances with Oscars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An awesome epic that the Academy Awards righteously awarded 7 Oscars to. Like other monumental motion pictures (Casablanca, Titanic) it sets the story against a huge backdrop (in this case, the Civil War). After I saw this movie I wanted to buy a wolf for a pet. Later reality kicked in and I figured that would be a little dangerous and illegal. So I went and danced with my cat. I honestly do not understand why so many people put this movie down. Costner's performance was good not hideously bland and boring. Graham Greene would have won an oscar if Joe Pesci did not give a career performance in Goodfellas. The soundtrack is so good Mozart couldn't have done it better. My favorite scene is when Costner sees the Indian camp for the first time, simply stunning and timeless. I still believe Costner's direction rates among the best of all time, right up there with Coppola's "Godfather" and Kazan's "On the Waterfront." The cinematography (beauty of the movie) looks better than heaven probably does. Costner's horse was fabulous and can outrun Black Beauty any day. For all those history freaks that declare this movie inaccurate, hello - did you see "based on a true story" anywhere in this motion picture. That comment is so bogus it's like putting down Star Wars because it's not a true story. If you enjoy history so much go read a history book. Some people say this movie is filled with Costner's conceit and greed. That's bogus too. You reward Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven and Mel Gibson's Braveheart when they both did the same thing (by the way I think both those movies are awesome as well). Just because a man in Hollywood does a huge amount of work on a particular picture (Stallone did the same thing with Rocky, as well as Thornton for Sling Blade) that d oesn't mean there character has to be so humble. I am happy Costner made himself a great character because he deserved it. I would have done the same thing if I did all that work and so would all of the critics out there who cut this movie up. Three thumbs up for a masterpiece. I recommend this movie to anyone who is alive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DWW is a great movie all about the shrinking frontier, survival, bravery, friendship, trust and love. I have this DVD and watched it at least ten times. When I want to watch a movie it's easy for me to skip past DWW. It's somewhat long with not too many laughs or tears. A good romantic comedy seems more like chicken soup. When I do slip in DWW and get into the movie I'm never sorry that I did. With kicking Bird and Wind In His Hair at different ends of the spectrum makes it very interesting. Stands With A Fist plays a super part. Her acting is fantastic. The one thing that bugs me was when some of the braves shot a half dozen arrows into the mule driver then scalped him while he was still alive. Later when Dunbar writes about how caring, loving and all for family I had a hard time buying. Should have not had the scene of the mule driver in it. In the end with Wind In His Hair yelling at DWW sends chills and tears through me. A really good movie.</fullReview>

There are big great cinematic moments like hunting the buffalo herd, but there are also some memorable, more intimate, smaller moments, and it is in these moments that the music really shines through and the characters feel real. So real, that I feel that I can sense their vulnerability and inner thoughts. Overall, an incredibly honest and impressing movie. Not to be missed!</fullReview>

(heh)so im able to watch this movie without being distracted by costner. in fact, nothing about the production distracts me, and i can really get into the feel of mid-1800's american frontier. that feeling is truly well concieved throughout this movie. the visuals are beautiful. the sound is, well, undistracting. and i dig the music. everyone elses acting is great too. graham greene really stands out as the sioux holy man kicking bird. he's the mvp of this movie i think. its mainly his character that makes you love this native american tribe. and its this love of the tribe that makes you loath the inevitable army of *#@%# white men that barges in and ruins everything. the story is indeed uplifting and touching, and finally saddening.if you havent seen it lately, you should pick it up on widescreen and watch it on a weeknight. if youve never seen it.. GO. go now and rent it. it will instill in any decent person a fresh feeling of morality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first film that ever made me feel ashamed to be white</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was perhaps 10 years old I saw the mini series Roots. That story affected me, but I was too young to really understand and grasp everything that it was showing me. It wasn't until ten years later when I saw this film that something about the destructiveness of white people really hit me. There have been films that I have seen since that bothered me. Films like Instinct and Boyz and The Hood were eye openers as well, but this was one of the first ( along with Mississippi Burning ) that made me embarrassed for being white. I wanted to go outside and apologize to the world for the race that I belong to. It is that powerful of a film. This must have been something that Costner was building up to in the years past because this has to be an incredibly personal film to him because there is so much raw power and emotion put into it.DWW shows us that in-spite of what we have been taught by watching old Westerns, the natives, like any other race of people had their good points and their bad points. They weren't the war mongering people that we have been taught to believe. They had families, basically wanted to be left alone and were good at living by their own code. Once the white man came along and destroyed their world, everything changed. Although I am white, watching films like this and Mississippi Burning makes me ashamed of what white people are capable of. I realize people of all colours of skin can commit acts of genocide, but watching this film reminds me of how terrible my ancestors were 100's of years ago.I really applaud this film and I am so amazed that Costner did the job he did in his first effort. This film deserved every Oscar it received and if it wasn't for such an incredible performance from Joe Pesci, then Graham Greene probably would have taken home a best supporting actor Oscar.This is a really important film and it has something to say. Not many films actually can do that and still maintain it's entertainment value. This is a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OVER-RATED!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To many, Dances with Wolves may appear as a beautiful window into a lost culture. If you think so, take a closer look, its not. As a white person myself I find it amusing that every "great" movie about foreign culture features a white protagonist who must integrate. Why not skip that crud and just make the lead character an Indian? What a novel idea, there are surely many candidates (especially since Hollywood can make someone who most of history until 1995 referred to as a tyrant, William Wallace, look like a saint.) Kevin Costner butchers yet another lead character in this movie (his Elliott Ness was just pathetic, I won't start on JFK) as a Union soldier who befriends a group of Indians and begins to adhere to their culture. Luckily for him there just happens to be a white girl kicking it with the tribe, (nothing against Mary McDonnell, her performance was about the only bright spot here) other wise he'd been out of luck. God forbid his integration would go so far as him marrying an Indian, no, no, that might actually have been interesting. Also, every other character in this movie besides Costner and McDonnell falls into one of the following three types: good Indian, bad Indian, absolutely completely despicable rotten white guy. The Scenes with the buffalo are equally ridiculous. We watch the Indians tracking the buffalo down, "Horay! isn't this great, they're slaughtering them but they will use the entire animal!" as opposed to the white people slaughtering them, with disgusting looking skinned carcasses covering the fields (we didn't see any gross carcasses when the Indians killed them) and as if that wasn't enough we get sappy sad music blaring while a baby buffalo wanders the fields looking for his slaughtered mother. PUUUUULLLLLLESE!!!! Do not subject yourself to that kind of manipulative crap! Why didn't the Indians just go collect the dead animals and score an easy meal and a few pairs of liver skin shoes? And besides, I'm sure Indians killed quite a few baby buffalo's parents, AND DIDN'T CARE. This movie is painfully slow, and can basically be partitioned into scenes of Kevin Costner getting his butt kicked, scenes of Costner recovering from the butt kicking and beautiful clips of the country side over a span of only three hours. This movie is totally overrated, stereotyped and racist, the fact that it won the Academy Award is ridiculous but consistent.</fullReview>

There are some places in the film that seem a little sketchy, but overall, it is a wonderful story.This movie contributed to my interest in local Native American history, though this movie is set in the mid-west and not the Pacific Northwest. It is incredibly sad how the Native Americans were treated across America during this time period. There is no excuse for the atrocities that occurred, yet it was also inevitable, given the circumstances. I would recommend this movie to anyone who would like to lose themselves in a story with a great ending. It's a great weekend movie where you just just kick back and relax, grab a bag of popcorn and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Costner's best movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(89%) One of the stronger westerns to be made after the genre declined in popularity during the 1970's and 1980's; although it could be argued that this deserves to be among the very best. This really does mark the highpoint in Kevin Costner's filmography, made at a time when he could do little wrong. His direction here is typical of all the best, well-shot films of this type, with great location work and a fine eye for detail. It's best strength though lies in the mix of emotions that bombard the audience. Pain, beauty, sadness, joy, and by the end a strong sense of anger toward the savage white land-grabbers; the like of which is very powerful and implemented superbly well. Despite the plot using the overused white person adopted by natives theme, everyone still should watch this film at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More like a spiritual experience than just a film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw "Dances With Wolves" again, the four hour extended version with an added overture, intermission and extra hour of footage. Wow I'm speechless. It's a lot more than just a movie. It's like a spiritual experience and a great epic as well. Every moment in it is meaningful and moving. And the masterpiece musical score makes every moment moving and soulful as well. I've never seen such a musical score complement a film so well.What's special and unique about this film is that when the protagonist character John Dunbar (Kevin Costner) slowly transforms into a Native American soul, you (the viewer) feel like you are going through the transformation process along with him. That's what makes it like an experience, rather than just a film.What's more, if you are a white American guy with a deep observant genuine soul and personality, you will relate to John Dunbar's character - his alienation from his white culture, as well as his connection with the Sioux tribe. (Thus this film has a Happier Abroad theme to it as well) Dunbar is the only deep observation genuine white character in the film, along with his lover, because the rest of the white characters in this epic seem so degenerate and hollow, or robotic, in comparison.I would try to see this on a big screen though, so you can appreciate the scenery, which most of this film focuses on, even more than the characters. Set aside four hours and dim the lights to see it. Then you will understand what I mean. I think it's one of the top ten best films of all time. And it's Costner's best role as well. On IMDb, almost everyone gave it a 10 out of 10. Also, on Amazon.com nearly every reviewer gave it 5 stars out of 5 as well.You can get the DVD version on Amazon.com for 5 dollars or download it from Amazon.com for a few dollars.I think it's a Happier Abroad film (referring to the movement I started at HappierAbroad.com) too because in the story, John Dunbar (Kevin Costner) experiences social connection, harmony and genuineness with the Sioux tribe, and then realizes how hollow and empty his white culture is. His soul slowly becomes Sioux, to the point where he doesn't fit in anymore with American life. The soldiers at the end who capture and persecute him look so degenerate, soulless and depraved compared to the Sioux tribe he joined. Only then do you realize the comparison.Anyway, this is a must see film. It reflects the spirit and feeling of our movement at HappierAbroad.com. Everyone should see it to understand our point of view better.</fullReview>

The performance of Costner, Greene and Grant added a lot to the movie, while the cinematographer wasn't awarded an Academy Award for nothing. However, the most important reason why everyone should watch and remember this film is its message; white man's madness has destroyed ancient cultures and spoiled Mother Nature.McDonnels's role wasn't bad, but she seemed to try too hard. The somewhat abrupt ending is something I didn't like, too. What is more, I believe the movie could be much more powerful in some scenes.This film is an all-time classic western and one of the best costume dramas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Historical movie in more ways than one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Kevin Costner epic will undoubtedly never blow away with the wind, as a memorable and historical western, which for one - marks a new phase in relations with Native Americans. Most importantly "Dances with Wolves" sets a point in time, where native American culture can no longer be portrayed as savage, with incoming immigrants bringing with them technology, progress and the American dream. Now tainted, it could be said that one myth (of the civilisational conquering of the wild west) was supplanted by romanticised wigwams, but the latter for one thing is a much closer account of historical facts. Despite certain elaborated idealisation of Sioux life, this is a far cry from your mystical tree-hugging pacifists (aptly portrayed as being ruthless in warfare).However pointless this may be given the far-reaching recognisability of the movie, a short recap of the: Lt. John Dunbar (Kevin Costner) is sent out to the west to guard the frontier, while the rest of the country is in civil turmoil. The post is completely deserted apart from a stray wolf, who slowly grows an affinity to the kind-hearted man. Waiting for reinforcements to arrive, the first to contact him are his neighbours, the Sioux, with whom he soon forms a close familial relation, slowly immersing into their culture and way of life. Meanwhile chance encounters with bison hunters, cavalry troopers and loggers, have Dunbar grow increasingly disillusioned with his own kind...Rewatching the movie over twenty years after it received a multitude of Oscars (including Best Picture and Best Director), the widespread appeal of the movie has not faltered, still a touching, awe-inducing epic of stark significance to mainstream perceptions of American history. Certain aspects of the story-telling are simplistic and unrefined, often supplanting more cognitive portrayal of Sioux society with opportunities to bring in a hearty laugh. This doesn't however take away the charm of Costner's legendary feature, as comedy basically offers light-hearted respite from the inevitable downfall of the American Indians and the natural habitat in which they resided.The extended four hour cut undoubtedly has its coherence issues, as some scenes are visibly less well-rounded, often superfluous or just jarring. Nonetheless they do add to the overall scope and emotional pull of the story, hence all in all they largely feel best kept untouched.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I used to like Dances With Wolves so much as a child, that I wanted to change my rating scale and give this the first six stars out of five. Yeah, I was a kid.I watched it then, in the early nineties, maybe a half-dozen times. Then stopped and moved on. Even when the (nearly) four hour version came out, I avoided it to savor the experience I had for a special time.Sixteen years later, the Bluray was given to me for my birthday ? my only request ? and finally, I watched the 3 hour 58 minute version. Reaction?Well, I still love it. It's a beautiful, adventurous, wonderfully written and excellently acted epic. But, I'll hold off on the 6/5 star rating. Which would be hard to explain anyways.Some call this overrated, that it shouldn't have won the Best Picture Oscar and way too preachy. I disagree on all aspects. It's an epic yet small and intimate film ? that's not something just about any filmmaker can do. It's very deserving of the Best Picture Oscar ? sorry, Goodfellas ? and besides, it fits with their love affair with epics. And watching this time, I paid close attention to see if I was too preached at. I didn't feel so. These are facts: Greed came over Americans ? shocker ? and we devastated these lands and more importantly, these people. (They got their revenge and my money when I gave up probably a year's salary at the Indian Casino over a period of a few years?) Not once did I felt talked down to, or at school. If anything, I wanted to get educated on these wonderful people: the Sioux.Anyways, if you haven't seen this by now, John Dunbar (Kevin Costner) fears he'll lose his leg in the Civil War and when his suicide attempt fails, he requests to be stationed in what he thinks is Nowhere, USA. Only, he befriends and is adopted into the Sioux tribe and takes allegiance to them over his own "white people."Wow?what is almost 4 hours I summed up in a few seconds. Believe me, there's so much more to the plot.The movie is gorgeous ? it has both some of the best cinematography I've seen and one of the best scores I've heard. The love John does have for Stands with a Fist (Mary McDonnell) is genuine and fun to watch. And the camaraderie within the group, the peaceful and playfulness of the members and productive and loyal stands makes you feel as you're with them as well over the course of the movie.Highly recommended?although, just stick with the 3-hour theatre version. I found the changes (additions) in this one-time viewing, even after 16 years of Dances silence. And the deleted now inserted scenes didn't add much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would have voted TEN if it weren't for the lack of English Subtitles for the Hearing Impaired. Ever since the movie released, I have yet to find a DVD with ESHIs encoded on it, so I can enjoy watching and reading all the dialogues, voiceovers and background. Instead I have to watch other people enjoy this movie and I am unhappy. It's been something like 21 years since this movie was made and it's still do not have anything for the deafs to read what the characters talks about. Oh sure, I read the book, but it's not the same, man. I liked watching the action happens and read at the same time any words that appears, like normal. Watching people flaps their mouths all the time and being unable to understand what they say just about riled me up a lot these days. I'm sick of it. I bought the DVD anyway, and now I'm watching it and as usual mouths flappings and no idea what they say, even though I hear their voices and that distracts me to no end. So I decided, to hell with you hearings, I'll find my subtitles somehow and burn a clean copy just so I can see if I can get the ESHIs up and running, and if so, then, finally, after 21 years I'll read what the characters say simultaneously while the action's going on. I don't give a damn if it's illegal or not. I'm just sick of cheapskates hearings who can't be bothered to includes ESHIs on ALL DVDs for all of us deafs who really loves movies. So there. Bleah! (tongue out, making raspberry noise.) And the funny thing is, the people who made this movie made billions and yet they are too cheap to make DVDs with ESHIs. How cheap can you be? I'm so disappointed with hearing people's lack of consideration, instead they all greedy and don't care about anyone who would like to enjoy a simple movie like this one that just are powerful. Thanks a lot.P.S. I loves it when the Indians were talking in their funny language, and there it is, English Subtitles showes up to show what they was saying. I wish this could be the same for the English speakers, so their words would show up for the deafs to see and read and understand. When will you hearings realised that the universe do not revolves around you hearings. So come on, pay up and get the new DVD version with ESHIs on it, OK? Thanks, I would appreciated it a hell of a lot. Hasta la vista, baby!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rather than play it safe for his directorial debut, Kevin Costner tackled an epic tale in a moribund genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In his directorial debut, Kevin Costner brings a rare degree of grace and feeling to this elegiac tale of a hero's adventure. The story is about a disenchanted US cavalry officer and Civil War hero who finds fulfilment living with Sioux Indians.Dances With Wolves is an epic award-winning Western with a sentimental script and a tendency to labour obvious points. Still, it remains a powerful labour of love (on Costner's part), a passionate story of the oppression of native American decency. Serious-minded acting and stunning cinematography cannot disguise its excessive length. In 2007, the Library of Congress selected Dances with Wolves for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captivating and emotional drama...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st watched 5/15/2010 -- 7 out of 10 (Dir-Kevin Costner): Captivating and emotional drama about a Lieutenent in the civil war sent to an abandoned post who discovers friendship and family with a Sioux Indian tribe. This first Kevin Costner directorial effort is a mostly well done chronicle with a few very strange characters near the beginning of the movie but once Costner's character is by himself and encounters the tribe the movie gets much better. This is one of the first movies that depicts things from the Indian's perspective when it comes to the whiteman's discovery of the West. The whitemen are portrayed as mostly selfish buffoons while the Indians are portrayed as thoughtful and wise. This one-sided vision is a little overdone, but I guess we need to makeup for all the times when the cliché Indian-whiteman portrayal was done in so many other movies. Costner's character befriends the tribe, falls in love with a white woman adopted by the tribe at an early age, and fights with the tribe defending their colony and then eventually has to decide which life he should hold onto. The love story is well done and Mary McDonnell as the love interest as well as the other Indian portrayals are done very well. This is overall a good movie that was possibly a little over-heralded when it first came out, but it is definitely well worth the viewing despite it's 3 hour length.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicely constructed and unfolded piece about a man's isolation in a location he's in so as to fight, but ends up encountering so much more.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Dances With Wolves from which the title derives is the name given to Kevin Costner's Union Army Lieutenant, named John Dunbar, by the Native Americans he'll come to reside with. It's a touching moment, one of rather a few in a 1991 piece directed by Costner himself, and gets across a sense of equality between two sides whom come together through an entire clan representing one and and a lone individual representing another. The film sprawls over a number of various genres, ranging from war to romance to western, but is never sprawling in the negative sense; all this eye for scope and extravagance nicely reigned in by a man doing just as well in front of the camera as behind it. Set during The American Civil War and running on hostilities between the north and south as well as the Native Americans and the issues they have with rival clans of their own kind, the film is wonderfully low-key in its dramatisation of all this conflict and hatred boiling up between individuals; Costner's presence as this Lieutenant acting as this rock on which to map onto and observe. After all, the film unfolds in the beautiful locale of 19th Century North America - the film obliging in focusing on all the beauty of this place at times such as these amidst all the hatred and warfare, in the views; naturality of the place and eventually the love with a young Native American woman.In Dunbar, we have a lead the film is unashamedly proud in detailing as softly centered and understanding as possible. Positively pacifist in mostly everything he does, Dunbar represents the very antithesis to a Spagetti Western lead; adopting traits that are more suited to more classical western leads of great honour, courage and moral value whom are only ever as violent as they need to be when drawn into duels with the wicked. Dunbar's first action is to essentially win a battle between Union and Confederate soldiers without shooting or harming anyone. He does this by way of engaging in a suicidal act that'll come to double up as one of sheer bravery, but without ever actually killing or harming anybody; a riding up to the enemy on a horse, sacrificial Christ like pose in-tow, as enough confusion and doubt is implanted within the minds of the enemy that a frontier charge occurs.This heroic act, in the eyes of his superiors, is enough to warrant a repositioning to another front; something Dunbar requests when his dream, it appears, is to get as much out of this conflict as possible by journeying far and wide so as to lap up the surroundings amidst the ugliness of war. His posting does not go so well in the initial stages, the camp is devoid of other people and that sense of being all alone and rather vulnerable is put across by way of some uncanny stumblings across of dead animals in nearby ponds of water and an interruption to his stay in the cabin on behalf of his horse giving him a jump. It's here the film gives itself time to construct a sensitive and methodical portrait of Dunbar, a man that writes a journal in a warm and reassuring manner getting across a sense of caring to go with prior positive traits. The film goes on to use the inclusion of an animal, in this case a wolf whom Dunbar names Two Socks, to reaffirm positive; uplifting and caring traits so as to assure us our siding with him. To enhance positive characteristics, the film has Dunbar refrain from deeming the wolf a pest and therefore killing him, instead opting to write about him, in a glorious tactic designed to evoke a sense of creation in reaction to the wolf rather than destruction.But in doing so is not enough to criticise the film, rather acts as a necessary place so as to point out the time the film takes to establish character prior to the meat of the piece, that being the coming together of Dunbar with some local Native Americans; the kind that are far peaceful than certain other tribes in the area. Dunbar is bathing when the Natives first arrive, a moment in which he is at his most vulnerable and in the rawest of forms; an event that sees him cleansed of his uniform and all things that I.D. him as what he is just as those he'll come to bond with arrive for the first time. When time comes to interact with the clan on a greater scale, it'll be by way of Stands With A Fist (McDonnell), a young Native girl who's attempted suicide but is found by Dunbar, and then we remember well into his bond with them that mostly all of the people of his own kind he's interacted with so far have been anything but relatable: eccentric higher-ups and grotty waggon drivers, the latter of whom Dubar describes as "probably one of the foulest men I've met in my life". Dunbar connects with her because of a shared sense of alienation to the group, Stands With A Fist initially being an outsider adopted in much to the relevance of Dunbar's eventual arc towards these people.The film runs on the idea of finding solace and peace in times of war with those that you ought to be fighting, its foot entrenched in documenting the ordeals of a more classical western lead in Dunbar is deliberately clashed only with the idea to come to terms with the Native Americans, or Apaches, and come to understand them rather than utilise them as some persistently ominous, deadly off screen threat. Rather, Dances With Wolves reserves this role for that of the Ameircan soldiers as the film progresses; completing Dunbar's realisation of both the beauty of the locale and the people that inhabit it. The film is an affecting effort, broad in a sense of scope and style.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Story of White and Red on the Frontier</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the American Civil War, Dunbar (Kevin Costner) requests to go to the frontier for assignment. His request is granted (after a really unusual scene where a man announces he has just soiled himself). He then meets the natives, who are understandably worried about the white man's moving in on them. But Costner just wants to be friends -- how can he make this work? Kevin Costner appears in and (in this case) directs epic films. At three hours and fifty-six minutes, this is the most epic of them all. But it's a good kind of epic, holding your attention with a rich story and strong characters (thank you, Graham Greene). I may not personally enjoy this as much as "Waterworld" or "The Postman", but it is probably the better film critically.There has been some complaint that this is a "liberal" movie. I can understand the complaint. This film definitely gives a more sympathetic point of view to the natives than the Americans. Reflecting on the situation, we now recognize the natives were wrongfully massacred. However, this is not the traditional view. Also, Dunbar says he wants to see the frontier "before it's gone", implying a liberal anti-sprawl stance. I don't have a problem with his views, though I do think they were not common at the time.The film is full of good surprises: fights, love, historical oddities and Costner's bare bottom. I think you should see it if you haven't. My brother has watched this film a dozen times, so it has to be worth your watching it at least once. I'd write more, but this film is such a classic that it's hard to say something a viewer won't already know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An exercise in self-aggrandizement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are things which warrant this film to be revered as 'beautiful' at times, but there also exists a shameless show of grandstanding by Kevin Costner.What purpose did it serve for him to sacrifice his life at the beginning of the film by riding his horse into enemy fire with his arms out-stretched as if he's Jesus on the Cross, followed by the praise of the army commander.... "We got an officer who's worth something lying here". No doubt Costner did that to win the emotional adulation of his audience. He himself narrates that the result of this "elevated me to the status of a living hero".Still later, when setting up his post all alone, he writes in his journal how he "is not the whole affair".... an attempt at being noble, but that appears to be exactly how Costner wants others to see him -- and I mean Costner the actor, not Dunbar the soldier. And again during his stay with the Sioux, he mentions in his droll narrative how the people see him as a "celebrity". And still much later he states how the soldiers "hate me like no other".... there's that tin-plated nobility again. The hate for him has to be 'special', more than the hate for anyone else.And speaking of nobility, how noble - or even realistic - was it for this seemingly dedicated soldier to abandon his post and become an Indian? That is rather hard to believe, as is Costner forgetting all about his rifles and journal at his post, even though he knows that white men could show up at any time. This development only extended the film for another half-hour, which leads to one of the technical errors: the film's running time is severely too long. These are the things which prove that Costner was preoccupied with blowing his own horn, and that's a shame. His Personal Ulterior Motives belittle an otherwise well-made film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An epic dedicated to the human civilization</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not an American. I have no right to judge this history and I'm not going to. The saddest thing about this movie is that we all know the end but we don't want it to come. We hope the harmony situation can last long, longer than the movie showed. But there's no way to expect that the tragedy of the Indian culture never come. Ancient civilization is bound to be replaced by modern one, though it may take blood, tears, darkness and sin to go through this. It's inevitable. As one saying (in China) goes, men are created to die. Though this analogy seems pretty sad, it's quite true. As soon as a man is born, he is moving to death every day, every hour and every second. So does human civilization. Human beings have gone through the original society, agriculture society, and now we are going through industrial society. It's impossible for us to foresee what the next society will be like after, say, 10000 years. So we can say that the industrial societies we build today are made to die, just like the original society and agriculture society. It's cruel to say this, but it does expose the cruelty that the world we live in and history we went through truly posses.This movie showed us this bloody and glory,miserable and honorable substitution process. So it's sure to be an epic. It's an epic dedicated to the human civilization.Also, being an epic requires magnificent scenes. This movie created a quite perfect one with the prairie, the sky, the buffalo and the wolf. Why do I count "wolf" in? Well, this movie spent a lot on that, didn't it? First, the name, "Dances with Wolves". Then the real wolf, there are lots of scenes about it. More importantly, this wolf, "two socks", is a symbol of Indian civilization. Outside the Indians look like cavemen, which is terrifying, this is similar to the wolf. But inside, they are kind, generous and warm-hearted, just like the development of the relationship between "two socks" and John Dunbar. So the denouement of the wolf marks the denouement of Indian culture.P.S. The music played in this movie is so wonderful and it contributed to the epic atmosphere. I think the only music which is better than this one is "My Heart Will Go On" in Titanic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The all-time "best western" motion picture ! More than a fiction, this movie is an actual documentary film about the life and history of the American Indian people. The picture includes a well written plot, with Act 1 "the War", act 2 "the Wild", and act 3 "the People"; each act is full of short stories that really stick together and eventually build an extraordinary human adventure with nature. I suggest to consider this "western opera" as part 3 of the Indian history trilogy, with the 2 others : part 1 "Cheyenne Autumn" by John Ford, and part 2 "Jeremiah Johnson" by Sydney Pollack. Each time I have watched one of these movies, I urgently need to watch the 2 others !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A marvel from beginning to end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Along with Edward Scissorhands and Goodfellas, Dances with Wolves is one of my favourites of 1990. It is a wonderful film, and a marvel from beginning to end. I am not a Kevin Costner basher, he has done some work I don't care for, but this and a few others(Field of Dreams for instance) actually does show he has talent. He does do a heartfelt job directing, and his acting isn't too shabby either, in fact he gives a certain decency to Dunbar which I had difficulty not empathising with. He is very well supported by Graheme Greene and Mary McDonell who is especially brilliant. The cinematography and scenery are just magnificent, while John Barry's score is nothing short of amazing. The moving climax gives further emotional weight to an already poignant story, while the script is wholly credible and the characters feel real. In conclusion, a fine film and I had no problem with its Best Picture win. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This arguably did not need a remake(and if you don't see how Avatar can be called another version of this, you must not have seen them both, or remember them), being a mere 20 years old, but one can hope that Cameron's film will reach the new generation, many members of which would not even consider putting this on. If that were not the case, I might be upset by it having been made; however, I'm not, and rather, I'm thrilled that it is as entertaining, engaging and communicates its important message well. Just as this does. This is involving right from the start, and the drama is effective and does not feel forced. It is epic and on a grand scale, helped by the immensely high production values and the amazing score. The visuals are stunning, with magnificent cinematography and editing, aside from those few and far between shots that are too close. This is largely credible, if admittedly black and white, and very clearly siding with the Natives, to the point where they almost couldn't allow any Americans to have attractive features. The battle sequences are masterfully done. This delves into the society and culture nicely. The narration is used well. Every acting performance is impressive, and Costner isn't the only one to shine. It is a credit to this that 25% of the dialog is not in English. There is great humor, and this is fun and exciting at times, not only serious. This holds some strong, graphic, bloody and occasionally gory or otherwise disturbing violence, a little moderate language, and very brief male nudity. The regular DVD contains four trailers, one of them for this. I recommend this to anyone mature enough to handle the subject matter, that can be intense. A smart Western that still holds up. 8/10</fullReview>

Costner's Dunbar deals with any number of personal issues that come into conflict with his martial position until, in his isolation he is forced to re-assess his priorities and relationships with a nearby Sioux tribe, literally going native.An appealing film for the grand photography alone, Dances With Wolves also sports a significant and strong contribution from native American actors which set a fine precedent for the likes of The Last Of The Mohicans and latterly Apocalypto and The New World. John Barry's score is also a winner. My one caveat is the weak performance of Mary McDonnell whose role is beyond her. 7/10</fullReview>

I will separate out into pluses and minuses:Pluses: Great scenery Very good cinematography Interesting effort to portray the Lakota Sioux view of the coming of the white man to the Great Plains Use of Lakota language Interesting use of wolf actors Efforts made to portray the Sioux as not quite "noble savages" in that they do some things that we find repulsive like revenge killing/killing white folk/stealing horses etc.Minuses: Kevin Costner's acting Kevin Costner's voice over The fact that Kevin Costner's hair always looks like a stylist just went over it The whites in the movie with the exception of Costner and Stands with Fists are pretty uniformly "savage".On the whole an epic that is worth watching but also not particularly deep or intelligent.

Many differences are small and subtle... others are easy to spot; but all are important in building the combination of emotion and understanding that makes this an important work.Without the benefit of the director's choices, you are left wondering about some scenes and ignorant of some others. I haven't read the book, but let's face it.... if it hadn't been for "the director" (Costner), there likely wouldn't have been either a novel or a movie.

		<fullReview>An epic in every sense. Though Kevin Costner is no Sean Connery he does have that "Midas Touch" that turns overlong, boring, stories into box office gold. While the screenplay is based on Michael Blake's novel, many important details were changed, or omitted completely.Perhaps the audience is to be granted "omniscience" andfully understand key plot developments that were not shownor explained (eg: do we know why Stands With A Fist/Christine attempts suicide? The book goes into great detail and makes one fully appreciative of Her story.), or are they merely to be overwhelmed by a magnificent soundtrack (scored by John Barry of the "007" music fame) and breathtaking cinematography? I was. I suppose that to include all that "needed" info, The Human Bladder Co-efficient would have been exceeded. I did not read the book until last year, but have seen the movie several times on video, and originally on the big screen (a very bad 16mm print with poor sound @ a college auditorium). I am by nature a very skeptical, detail oriented person who enjoys History (especially Civil War Military History) but yet my eyes still well up with tears everytime I watch this film.

		<fullReview>Continuing my viewing of the AFI's 100 best, I recently rented the four hour version of Dances With Wolves. I had never watched such a lengthy film before and after I had been told by a few friends that this movie was at times tedious and slow, I feared the worst. However, this film is a work of greatness and kept my attention so well, I didn't notice the time at all.This movie is an eye opener to the struggles that the Sioux natives and I'm sure many other factions of natives had to go through during the second half of the 19th century. With the huge migration of people heading west it was only a matter of time until they were wiped out by the white man and his machines of war.This is a special movie for many reasons in my mind. First, it does a splendid job in describing the relationship between the Sioux and Lt. Dunbar from the beginning to the end. It is this relationship that the movie is based upon, and what makes the movie work so well. While watching the movie, I felt that I was Lt. Dunbar, not a third party watching the happenings. Secondly, the cast of Costner, Greene and McDonnell plays well together and perhaps should have been recognized by the academy. I can't really understand all that I've heard about how Costner's performance was lacking, because after all it is the center of the movie. Thirdly, the direction and cinematography of this film rank up there with such epics as Schindler's List and Lawrence of Arabia. It is basically flawless and plays the second most important role in the film.The story is told to every last detail and blended together perfectly. The ending also fits well and doesn't disappoint. I find it amazing that this great film was also Costner's directoral debut. This adds even more to the total greatness of the film which in my opinion is the best that has come out of the 90's.9/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A moving experience of film as true art.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without doubt, one of the finest moments ever to be found when true art emerges in the form of cinema is the epic "Dances With Wolves". The Oscar winning cinematography is sublime and breathtaking, the acting superb and genuine in a way that seems to only come about when performers truly believe in the project at hand as perhaps having meaning beyond commerce and thus being worthy of more than mere acting perchance even allowing actual expressions of soul. But here there is yet another great force at work, and that is surely the beauty and majesty that is the North American landscape in its unbridled glory. Having first seen the movie in it's original three hour cinematic release, I was moved in a unique and profound way that has remained with me for almost two decades now. Furthermore, I was priviliged enough to see the four hour "Director's Cut" some years later again in a full cinema setting. Here I felt the story was given even more depth and indeed some of the meaning conveyed originally to important aspects of the storyline turned out to make a very different point altogether. There is, therefore, no doubt in my mind that (far from always being the case) in this instance the longer cut is the one into which to immerse oneself into if given the opportunity.Naturally I have since procured a DVD version and was fortunate enough to find a release that provided both 'cuts' of the film in full wide screen format. This brings me to what I regard as a very interesting point. Over the years I have met a surprising number of people who have conveyed to me that they do not particularly care for this film. This deeply puzzled me for some years. Dare I say, and to my delight, thankfully none had ever declared anything even remotely resembling loathing. Naturally being curious as to how someone could feel unmoved by what I regard as one of the most moving of moving pictures, it emerged that every single one of these poor souls had had their first and any subsequent encounter with this masterpiece on a television. With the screen chopped off at the sides and all the other shortcomings of the now technologically quaint Cathode Ray Tube this outcome was surely inevitable for a film that realises so much of it's magic through the amazing cinematography of what can truly be described as sheer aesthetic majesty. Thankfully, large wide-screen high definition home cinema has arrived with excellent sound so as to allow the superb score some justice as well. In closing, might I strongly suggest should the opportunity to see this masterpiece in a cinema setting once again present itself, especially if you have as yet not had the opportunity, do yourself your loved ones and anyone you care about even remotely the immeasurable favour to experience this epic in the environment it was created for. Moreover, should the unexpigated version ever appear in a cinema near you... run don't walk, buy plenty of popcorn, and let yourself be mesmerised for the full four hours of cinematic heaven that is "Dances With Wolves"!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. Everything about this movie is amazing. The acting, the scenery, the music... It's one of my mom's favorites, and I remember hearing the music when she and my dad watched it. (I was to little at the time) An appropriate word for it would be bittersweet. Near the beginning it's kind of boring and startling; John Dunbar tried to kill himself by riding in front of the enemy. In the process, the others named him a hero and awarded him a horse and a new rank (I think) The commanding officer which send him out with Timmons is perfectly revolting, and Timmons himself is disgusting but kind of funny. I find myself laughing at his morbid humor when he points to the skeleton and mentions the folks back east must be saying 'Why don't he write?' The first encounter with Kicking Bird is so funny! Dunbar's taking a bath, and chases after Kicking Bird (who is trying to steal the horse Cisco) naked. Mom says that in the book, Kicking Bird described the naked Dunbar as 'so white it hurt his eyes'. Another funny thing about this movie is the reaction of the Soux to the coffee and the sugar. After tasting some, Wind in His Hair likes the sugar so much he begins putting some in Kicking Bird's cup. This annoys Kicking Bird and he covers his cup so Wind In His hair will stop adding sugar. One of my favorite scenes in the movie is John Dunbar doing the fire dance back at the soldier fort. It always gives me goosebumps.The bitter part of the movie is bitter indeed. It's heartbreaking when the soldiers shoot both Cisco and Two Socks and treat Lt. Dunbar like an animal. When the Pawnee attack the Soux, it makes me feel sick to watch them pull the arrows from the dogs. The saddest part is the ending. As John Dunbar (now Dances with Wolves) rides away with Stands With a Fist and Wind In His Hair hollers at him from the clifftop. "Shumani Tutonka Obwa Chi!" "I am Wind in His Hair. Do you see that you are my friend?" I always tear up when I see that.With the gorgeous scenery, the flawless acting, the moving story, and the stirring music, I'd recommend this movie to anyone old enough to understand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great movie with a beautiful pace</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is an epic, sweeping work about a man's journey and the death of a civilization. Watching Dances with Wolves it's easy to see why Kevin Costner has been trying to make the same movie every time since (usually with awful results). It seems like the pace of the movie matches that of the people it's trying to portray, and it forces the viewer to take it all in at Costner's graceful speed. Cinematography is lush throughout the film, and it serves as a great reenactment of the time of the American plains. Mary McConnell puts in a great performance as Stands With a Fist, and Graham Green is his usual subtle self. I would highly recommend this movie as a good way to round out your viewing experience - this is Costner's masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ONE OF THE GREATEST</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dances is one of the greatest westerns of all time. Some racists and others may feel uncomfortable with this more realistic and adult version of the west, but it needs to be told. Some claim that the movie makes whites looks bad. Anyone who saw the film knows this isn't true. First there is Dunbar, then a Union soldier only doing his duty, then a white woman and other good whites who do not harm anyone. What some really object to is not showing American Indians as all unhuman beasts. There is a tribe of Mohawks who scalp, but there is also kind good Indians as there are and was in real life. (You should read the lying racist "Detroit News" article on this film)This is a great movie. Give it all the stars. Whites feel bad when they realize they murdered peaceful people as did the Nazis. But the rich colors of the burnt red hills, the beautiful score, give a view of a romantic, sad, but real American West.</fullReview>

A huge room is decorated for a convention, a banner reads "Welcome people who didn't like Dance with wolves - World con" and there a just 4 people in it.Back then when the movie was shown on the big screen everybody was in awe, a cultural phenomenon. I liked it, but it had lengths and it was almost too beautiful to watch. Man, the big country is awesome...I kept thinking to myself "please let it end, they will die in the end anyway, so make it quick!" And I did not like the black and white view of the two Indian (native American) tribes. Come on, show some shades of gray! It's the idealization of the natives that bothers me, at least sometimes. It's so cliché.But anyway, it's a nice story and it could have happened like shown in "Dance".So I'll rate it: 8/10Macaulay J. Connor</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is very well done; along with a great story it is shot with beautiful scenery and costumes. Very well done all around.The story starts off with a man who just wants to die but becomes a hero, because of his new status he given any military post he wants and he chooses the frontier, that he has always wanted to see.Once arriving at his new post he discovers he is alone and must make things work until others arrive. During this time he slowly begins a relationship with the Indians and becomes a friend to them, living with them and falling in love with their way of life, in the end he must leave to try and fight for their way of life with the white people.I have seen others say they don't think Costner made a good hero but they missed the point, He was not a hero nor did he want to be one. Costner played this part very well and did even better as the director. Watch this one you will love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After leading a team to victory in the American Civil War era, Lietenant John Dunbar requests to be posted on the Frontier. Finding it deserted he discovers that he isn't alone. The land is mostly inhabited by Indians and wolves amoung other animals. After a while, John makes friends with the tribe and becomes one of them. But with his comrades marching onto their land, Dunbar must figure out how to protect the indians who have become his tribe.An Excellent film of beauty and adventure that ignites the human spirit. A bit long yes, but you don't seem to care while watching it. Costner's film is amazing and should be viewed by everyone. Too bad that Costner's other films weren't as good as this one.****/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Costner's Magnum Opus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERS???I'm not a fan of any of the Kevin Costner movies out there, except for this one. No, I'm not here to bash him. I am just saying that trying to top the scope and beauty of DANCES WITH WOLVES with over-budgeted stuff like WATERWORLD is impossible. This is the one great work that he can be proud of for eternity.Based on a book by Michael Blake, DANCES WITH WOLVES is a story of a Union Soldier during the Civil War who takes an assignment in the west, far out into the prairie and "Indian" country. He finds the fort deserted and has no idea what's happened to the other soldiers who lived there. They might have been kidnapped or murdered or both by the fearsome "Injuns" who reside in the country, or they might simply have left their belongings and trudged out into the prairie during a freezing blizzard and froze to death. Lt. Dunbar (Costner) feels lonely and isolated, except for his horse and a friendly wolf who comes to visit now and then. But the beauty of the prairie is enough for him to feel content even without human company. For a while anyway. He meets several members of the Sioux village several miles away and slowly comes to trust, admire and befriend them. He realizes that white people have labeled "Indians" as savages, heathens and bloodthirsty murderers, and that the people are exactly the opposite of that. In time, Dunbar is re-named "Dances With Wolves" by the Sioux people, and he falls in love with an adopted Sioux of white ancestry called "Stands With A Fist" (Mary McDonnell), whose parents were killed by members of the Pawnee, when she was no older than five or six. Very much like the child SWAF was, Dances With Wolves is adopted as a member of the family of Sioux and his life takes on meaning for the first time he can remember.The People are worried and hope that Dances With Wolves will answer their many questions. The whites began to emerge in the 17th century, after the Spanish Conquistadors had been in and out of the land. The whites, unlike the other groups, seem intent on staying. The People are being driven further and further west, and their buffalo, the staple of their lives, are being slaughtered in such huge numbers that they are on the verge of extinction. In the early part of the 1800s, buffalo hunts were commonplace and successful. In the 1860s, buffalo were already threatened with extinction. Times were changing so fast that the People had no idea what would become of them. This film illustrates the mindset of the Sioux, and other Native American tribes, like no other film in existence. There are many memorable cinematographic scenes: The great buffalo hunt, the battle with the Pawnee warriors, the battle with the Union Soldiers, etc. But the best part of this picture is the human element, the struggle to communicate, the realization that a bunch of people that are thought of as "ignorant" or "animal" are actually very warm, compassionate, human, the understanding that even though someone is "white", it doesn't make him hateful or "dirty" or soul-less. Prejudices on both sides are resolved.A great story, as fresh and insightful as it was fourteen years ago. Wow has it been that long???</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is this film better than "The Goodfellas"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was a major surprise for me when I heard, 11 years before, that "Dances with Wolves" wom the Academy award for best picture, over "The Goodfellas". So, I went to see the film when it reopened after the awards. And, I may say so, it was not a bad film. Not at all. It was a wannabe masterpiece, who lost it's way even before the filming started. I could give it a 6/10 but nothing more than that. Ofcourse, this is a personal opinion, so if you are into that kind of films - big, impressive, rich, hyped, meaningless - and if you have enjoyed "saving private Ryan" (for instance) rent the tape or DVD and watch it. If you are into something else than the above... well, you have many choices.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An outstanding story of the conquest of the Frontier within a man and his country. Kevin Costner portrays the emotions and righteousness as a human being and a soldier. The realm of understanding within the storyline is painful, yet inspiring. It makes me jealous to see the world "back then", and realize too, that it somehow was able to exist, atleast for a time, right now. The understanding of the misdeeds towards the Indians and their lifestyle is truly heart pulling. The issues portrayed in this film really don't touch the surface of the injustices done, but the movie holds true to love and sacrifice up to the very end. The crying "brother" at the end always makes me cry, even after the 15th time. A real tear-jerker this one! I love it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>lee1888s education level is, 6th grade?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As to the comments of lee1888, You know nothing of Native American culture or of history itself. The Sioux got a pretty good deal you say? It just so happens to be that the Sioux occupy the two poorest reservations in the U.S. Suicide rates are amongst the highest in the U.S. as well, how does this tell us that they got a "good deal". Every weekend you hear the ambulances taking off to try to save drunk Sioux. With populations so small the death rate is abnormally high. The U.S. allowed over zealous companies hunt the buffalo to near extinction and then gave the Sioux plows and seed to plant fields, who in their right mind tells a hunting society to plant for a living and expect them to accept it automatically. If at most they should have asked them to become cattle ranchers. In Sioux culture you did not toil day after day just to make a lowly income, nature had all you could want and if you needed something you went and got it, of course you had to hunt and make the things you wanted, but generally these were saw as activities rather than work. There was no plowing the earth, they had deer, buffalo, and other game. There was no standing in a factory for 10 hours a day making one thing, you learned how to make almost everything and you could make it the way you wanted. They still had struggles but other than that why would they want to change? They in their mind, had achieved a state of life that was comfortable and prosperous. That is why it has been hard for the Native American to find their place in white society. There is nothing glorious about our society today other than our traditions and family. My father born in 1950 grew up in a three room log cabin with 11 brothers and sisters and so far has been the only one to leave the reservation to make a life, which he has been successful in the natural gas industry(ask anyone in the area and they will know his name),a decorated Veitnam War veteran(he volunteered rather than be shamefully drafted). He left behind tradition and family which makes him sad and that's his sacrifice to give me a decent life that he didn't have as a child. That is the problem that most Native Americans face today, do I stay at home in poverty but keeping my tradition, family, sacred land, and friends. Or, do I go into the world and leave that behind. The two cannot or very rarely co-exist, if you have money or objects of value you are the main person to ask for handouts which in Sioux tradition you are supposed to help friends and family, but when the amount borrowed grows and grows and no change happens what are you supposed to do then? Rarely do you ever hear of anything good happening on the reservation, government officials using funds for their own personal uses, deaths, alcoholism, and etc. Before you make any statements about the lively hood of the Sioux let alone any Native American population you should live amongst them on reservation, then tell me they got a good deal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is without doubt my all time favourite movie - and I have seen literally thousands. I have also done a LOT of research and, whilst the Oglala Sioux in particular were a bloodthirsty lot, the same cannot be said for all the Sioux. Many US soldiers in those days WERE uneducated, lecherous, dishonest and plain dirty. And the way new settlers in the mid west recklessly and stupidly slaughtered thousands of buffalo is well documented. The storyline is believable, well laid out and entertaining.The cinematography, acting, directing, sound, editing and overall 'everything' of this movie in my opinion may never be equalled. It is a audio and visual masterpiece, and the haunting themes leave one with a wish that Costner would do another such film. No wonder it got seven Oscars - should have been at least two more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree that Dances with Wolves is a cinematic beauty! Everything about the movie is beautiful, the music, scenery, dialog. But, all of this talk about how bad the white people were to the Indians is way over the top. A lot of the tribes in the Americas (North, Central and South) were fighting and killing each other long before the Europeans arrived. They fought over land, hunting grounds, etc. Someone else arriving in the Americas was just a matter of time. First there were the Scandiavians, who didn't stay long. Then it was the Spanish who obliterated the South and Central American tribes. Then the English and French took the example of the Spanish and at first and used the tribes against each other to get what they wanted. After a couple of generations and Manifest Destiny, it was westward for the whites and lot's more Indians. Yes, some white people treated the Indians horribly, as did some of the Indians to the whites. But, someone had to prevail. Since the beginning of time people have been migrating. The Indians of the Americas came from somewhere else too. And, unfortunately, most migration by humans results in bloodshed. Dances With Wolves is a great movie, but it is still just that, a Hollywood Movie. And, no, it should not be shown in classrooms as a "history lesson".</fullReview>

And the soundtrack - One of the best, if not the best available.

		<fullReview>The film is an epic in its own sense. I have found after a long time that films which are of longer duration tend to be more interesting. The film involves a man who had to live at a place for a long time and wait for his team. How he develops relations with people whom he was required to fight, is very nicely presented in the film. The last samurai in 2007 has a similar theme and both the films are epic for me in their terms. The story is very interesting and has been dealt with full justice to the characters. It also shows how people who have a great language barrier communicate effectively. The pace of the film is slow and some of the times you would feel drifted but when the lead character starts his narrative voice at specified intervals, you will find it interesting again. The acting by all was good. Without including too many characters, the film is worth sitting for 3 hours.MESSAGE: "Kindness in heart can win many situations."VERDICT: "A recommended onetime watch."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic film of immense proportion.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only took one star away from this film ... primarily because Kostner (or perhaps Blake) used the standard villain in such films ... the Pawnee. Long before the white man appeared in the Plains, various tribes were fighting one another over territory. No one single tribe was less brutal than any other in such disputes. A plus for the extended version of the film was the mention of another adversary, the Utes, and that it was clear (or apparently clear) that the Souix initiated the battle. Certainly, the Pawnee people were no better or worse than any other native group.Other than that, no flaw in the film was so terrible that it detracts from the film's purpose ... to show the Plains native (primarily the Souix) as a relatively cultured and sophisticated group that bore no "specific" ill will toward anyone unless it was perceived that they were infringing on their territorial rights. And, it showed them as people who were good stewards of the land ... unlike white settlers (and for that matter, white people even now).However (evil grin), as much as I liked the film, I felt that the theatrical version had a lot of unnecessary footage in it. And when I saw the extended version, I felt that if some of the scenes were added to the theatrical version, it would have made more sense to the film-goer. To test this theory (grin), I used my video capture device to capture the extended version from Comcast "on-demand" and edited the video based on my own parameters. I ended up with a video that's only 3 minutes longer than the theatrical version ... yet covers all the "making sense" bases and guts out the "fluff" scenes. The theatrical version DVD I got as a gift from my son is now retired (grin) since I like my edit job better.Example of cuts - On the wacky Major at Fort Hayes, I cut out the eccentric salute, the "Sir Knight" comment about soiling his pants, and his suicide. I left plenty of that scene in so that people would know he was a nut case. One controversial edit (grin). I cut out the scene where Spivey and a fellow soldier were taking dumps out in the high grass. True, this scene shows Spivey with Dunbar's journal. But later, when the Sergeant is the last person killed at the river, the next scene shown is the journal floating down the river ... leading people to believe that the Sergeant had it on him all the time ... that he purposefully withheld it from the officers because he was a bigot who wanted Dunbar to be hanged (ie., "Ya turned Injun, didn't ya ... didn't ya!").Example of scenes retained from the extended version - The scene showing Captain Cargill giving his speech to the assembled men ... and telling them to gather their things to abandon Fort Sedgewick. The scene showing the aftermath of the raid on the Utes, showing what Stands With A Fist had to mourn about ... before she was found by Dunbar. The brief conversation between Stone Calf and Kicking Bird after seeing Dunbar "dancing" with the wolf ... where Kicking Bird first suggests they give Dunbar a "real name."Therefore, my 9 of 10 rating is for the extended version since the theatrical version left me puzzled on a few points. I'd give MY version a 10 out of 10 (grin). Of course, I'm biased, hehe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a film maker pours his heart and soul into a film,it shows in the final product.This is the best film that Kevin Costner has ever made from the standpoint of directing as well as acting and for that very reason.It is obvious that this was a project he believed in very strongly and whenever that is the case,you take no shortcuts toward making it a great film.It is a film about friendship and about how sometimes friendships develop from the unlikeliest of places.As human beings,we develop perceptions of certain types of people based on what others tell us about them.Very often those perceptions turn out to be wrong if we choose to get to know them ourselves.Dances With Wolves will take you on a ride during which you will visit a wide range of emotions,that is,if you have any humanity in you whatsoever.It should not be missed.Well done,Mr. Costner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest films of all time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dances With Wolves is not only the highest grossing western of all time, but is considered by many to be one of the greatest films of all time. I couldn't agree more. I have a special place in my heart for this movie especially since I have taken a missions trip up to Pine Ridge, SD where the Lakota reservation now exists. It is deplorable, but that's a whole other subject. Back to the movie... Despite the fact that the movie is over 3 hours long, it never really drags because the story is so good. Costner's character, John Dunbar, is determined not to lose his leg, which was badly wounded in battle. It is an excruciating scene when he has to slip his leg back into his boot! John Dunbar wishes to see the frontier before it is gone and his request is granted. The journey that begins there changes him in a positive way when he befriends the Sioux (Lakota) Indians, finds a sort of companion in a lone wolf (which he names "Two Socks"), and falls in love with "Stands With A Fist", played by the wonderful Mary McDonnell. The experiences John Dunbar has with the Indians teaches him that not all the natives are hostile and savage. That they are a simple people who live off the land, waste nothing and only desire to be left alone to live in peace on the land they inherited from their ancestors. He particularly grows fond of "Kicking Bird" played by Graham Greene. There is plenty of excitement between the Buffalo (ttonka) Hunt, the fight with the Pawnee and the clash between the Cavalry Soldiers and the Sioux. The scenery is sometimes breathtaking and at least for me, makes me long for a more simple landscape than the one I see when I drive to work everyday. Truly, our country should always preserve whatever huge chunks of land can be preserved for future generations to be able to observe, walk, ride and breathe-in the wonder of God's creation. Add to the mix a sweeping and inspirational score by John Barry (his magnum opus IMHO) and you have one solid, beautiful film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as Costner's reputation might lead you to expect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nineteen ninety was a different time for Kevin Costner. This film, which he directed and starred in, won seven Oscars (unjustly overshadowing "GoodFellas" in my opinion) and cemented his status as one of Hollywood's heavy hitters. Fast forward nearly twenty years later and he's equally famous (or infamous) for a couple of massive flops ("Waterworld" and "The Postman"). However, this early directorial effort shows some of the promise of what might have been.The story concerns a Union lieutenant who requests a post on the frontier so that he can experience it before it fades into history with the westward approach of 'civilized' man. In his solitude he connects with nature and then strikes up a friendship with Native Americans in the territory. It's a fairly engaging story but I feel that there were a few concessions made to give it a broader appeal. I could have easily done without the romantic angle and I feel that the film would have had more resonance if it had been cut off a little earlier.Costner's not too bad of an actor but I would have preferred someone else in the role. It's not that he's particularly unconvincing but rather that he lacks personality. The supporting cast is hit and miss, with Graham Greene standing out as the best of the lot. He managed to nab an Oscar nomination along with Costner and Mary McDonnell, neither of whom I would have singled out.Costner's direction is fairly accomplished and there is some nice cinematography at times but I wouldn't have chosen him over Scorsese for Best Director. The score by John Barry sometimes seems overbearing as well. I would have rather had sparser instrumentation to go along with the sparseness of the frontier. However, the score won an Academy Award so I may be in the minority regarding its merits.Considered as a whole, "Dances With Wolves" isn't a bad film but, as we've seen many times, the Academy got carried away and made some now-questionable Oscar choices. As for myself, I believe that with a few tweaks this could have been a great film rather than just an okay film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Benign</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a benign representation of a nation and a culture that have been virtually "genocided" by the American government and its representatives. This film is not sh-t as suggested by an American Indian commenter. Only a film crafted by Lakota filmmakers could adequately and honestly represent their culture, history and people. Perhaps Lakota filmmakers wouldn't have gone to such great pains to represent everyone in a Lakota village as an upstanding human being, realizing there are, and have been less than sterling individuals among their people, as with all people.But the American Indian nations, and the Lakota in particular, have been very grievously wronged by this country. This, and the fact that not every film-goer is exquisitely sensitive and perceptive, may have led the filmmakers to accentuate the personal virtues of the Sioux, and to represent each white, except Dunbar and Stands with a Fist, as reprehensible. For the American public, that rarely gives a thought to Indian peoples, and even less often a kind thought, this film is a gentle introduction to an extraordinary nation and people that preceded us to, and created a thriving culture on this land many thousands of years before we came.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DWW is an excellent movie. It has excellent performances, wonderful cinematography and moments of great power (Kevin Costner's character dancing around the fire, the final farewell from the clifftop, etc.)At the time it was released, I didn't see it. My moviegoing companions weren't into film epics, and I assumed, and I had heard that it was basically a piece of propaganda to discuss the plight of the Native American. However, when I saw it recently, I was pleasantly surprised. There is very little overt preaching. The movie simply portrays the Native Americans as more than cartoonish villains or "noble savages". Westerns with well-developed, three-dimensional Native American characters are rare in American cinema.The only weakness in the film is that in order to make its points, Costner chooses to portray the U.S. soldiers and other Whites in the film in broad negative strokes. Except for Costner's character, they are all bigoted, violent, and ignorant. Costner basically reverses the stereotypes of the traditional western, and the same way it was unfair and ineffective to portray the Native Americans as one-dimensional, it is unfair and ineffective to portray the Whites of that time period in the same way.Overall, however, a rewarding film experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An excellent film that chronicles one man's search for himself, adventuring into the American frontier immediately following the Civil War. Reminiscent of the old Eastwood-Leone films, but done much more professionally. Costner never so much resembled an animated corpse as he does in this flick, yet it works marvelously. He is a poster boy for stereotypical Indian stoicism, and the Sioux embrace him with open arms. I think the politics of Cowboy Bad, Indian Good isn't too heavy handed either. The message is certainly there, but is told in a fair manner, as it points out that not all of the American Indians were saints. Ill leave that all alone. Its rather long, and I don't think Ive seen the end more than once. But I never tire of attempting to rewatch it. The cinematography is as good as it gets, and Costner's Direction is more than worthy of the praise it received.</fullReview>

On the other hand, I am quite sure what I do remember: the impression from Dunbar (the main hero) meeting Kicking Bird remains strong even after years. How two enemies, both being very proud fighters, but also tired by live, become friends - these scenes of "Dances with wolves" have something archetypal about them. Their first "discussions" about bulls (how was the word for bull? Takanka?) etc. belong to my favourite moments in cinema at all. Beautifully done, it inspires to thinking about many aspects of their stories: is not the intelligent Kicking Bird also alone among his people as Dunbar among his? Isn't it the ridiculous shyness and helplessness of the Kicking Bird that make the viewer understand his real authority? Conclusion: very sentimental, but I cannot remember anything disturbing in this movie.</fullReview>

He played a soldier who fought during one of the most destructive and deadliest wars in U.S. history. I'm sure that soldiers of that era learned to become emotionally numb and as unemotional to the events around them (outside of the war) as much as possible. The only drawback, outside of its lengthiness, was the one-dimensional characterization of the Union soldiers who came to find Dunbar. I wasn't convinced by them at all.

		<fullReview>Why didn't Epic Movie spoof this is all I want to know? Kevin Costner who stars and directs in the sweeping film 'Dances with Wolves' has delivered an epic of all proportions. It is a human drama, it is a classic Western, a civil war film and a film about understanding of Native Americans. Costner plays Lieutenant John Dunbar or as he will come to be known by the Native Americans - 'Dances with Wolves.' The story goes that Lt. John Dunbar, exiled to a remote western Civil War outpost, befriends wolves and Indians, making him an intolerable aberration in the military. The film is one of the first of it's kind to treat Native American's with respect, this is an intelligent film about breaking down the barriers of communications between a tribe of Native Americans and Dunbar. The story is brilliant and the acting is wonderful. The music score by John Barry is brilliant and his best alongside his score for 'Out of Africa' and I won't mention the Bond theme because no one really knows who really did it. The cinematography is brilliant and in my favorite scene from the film that is in perfect showcase. Late at night Dunbar is woken by the sound of buffalo. He can't see anything through the fog as he runs into the open field and as he stands there he is surrounded by a herd of buffalo who emerge from the mist and on the characters face emerges a look of wonder and amazement. How wonderful it is that the audience shared the same reaction throughout the whole movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's ironic that this film should come up as the random title given that I just rewatched it the other day. And, I could not believe how terribly outdated and self-serving it seemed now that time has gone by and it is not as current. The indians and their customs and way of life were not what was outdated. Both the indian characters and the actors portraying them stay true to life and timeless. But Costner seems like a fish out of water. He makes the fatal flaw of being overly sentimental, both for himself in front of the camera and behind it. Perhaps I felt this way because since then I've had the pleasure of watching another actor step behind the camera and direct his own epic: Mel Gibson in Braveheart. After having seen the way he portrayed the English-Scottish conflict and the amazing cinematography and script that he incorparated, Dances With Wolves comes across as a B movie. With Gibson, I see no sympathy for self - he seems to trust in the work and the subject matter to carry his film along vibrantly and with truth. Costner, in turn, seems to feel the need to constantly show his empathy and courage in order to make sure that you see him in the light which suits him best. I wish I could vote higher, especially as Graham Greene gave the film such heart and truth, but Costner just blaringly stood in my way.Still, a good film to watch. Enlightening and a bitter reminder of what America once was and the people that were it's true inhabitants only to be treated in a despicable fashion. A good history lesson, but the lines are just a little too blurred for my taste.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dances With Wolves is one of the most overrated films in existence. It made a bucket-load of money and got a whole bunch of undeserved Oscars -- including Best Director and Best Picture.While this movie really wants to be a sprawling epic, its nothing of the sort. The film's only message seems to be that Native Americans are not the stereotypical "How, white man" caricatures they are often portrayed as, and that they have suffered injustice after injustice at the hands of American expansionism. While this is certainly true, it is a point repeated often both before and after Dances With Wolves. It is also a point that has been made a lot better. One should also note that Kevin Costner is being horribly self-righteous in telling everybody else how horrible they've been to Native Americans as if he (the millionaire celebrity) has suffered alongside them.The insufferable preachiness of the film is compounded by bad storytelling. The movie bludgeons its simplistic point home with clunky voice-over narration from Costner's character's diary. There's plenty of films that have expressed subtler themes than this one's without saying a word.Subtlety is one big thing lacking in this movie, in all respects. rather than letting scenery speak for itself, Costner simply has to tell us how beautiful the frontier is. His performance is, as usual, bland and boring.Don't waste your time on this Hollywood trash. Go see an indie movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a review of my second viewing of "Dances With Wolves", the first being right after its release in 1990. This viewing was the DVD edition, in Digital Dolby 5.1. The DVD picture is truly remarkable, one of the the best I've seen. However, the sound is mostly "stereo" - the surround channels often have nothing, and at other times you may hear insects chirping, fire crackling, or some of the music. Not a very good example of use of surround sound.As most know this film won the oscar for 1990, as well as Costner's direction. As good as the film is, I feel it is a bit over rated. I give it 8 of 10, but in truth not much better than Costner's "The Postman", which I actually like a lot and think is generally under rated. Go figure!Much of this film seeks to portray the Sioux as a gentle, intelligent, family-oriented tribe. I suspect they really were. At the same time it seeks to portray the invasion of the white man as something cruel, which it probably was. Although it isn't intended to be a documentary, I'm sure it gives viewers a fairly accurate, sympathetic view of the Native American plight during the mid-to-late 1800s as we expanded west.The filming was done in the rolling plains, and the Badlands, of central South Dakota. Having been through that region a couple of times made watching this film even more enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Dances With Wolves" is another great period piece that I can watch at least once a year, never tiring of the western frontier against mesmerizing setting and John Barry's Oscar-winning stirring music... The motion picture is told through the words and experiences of a civil war soldier, Lieutenant John Dunbar, and Costner makes it an intensely spiritual journey which challenges the individual in so many ways... After his suicidal and successful ride on the battlefield, Lt. Dunbar accidentally leads Union troops to victory against the Confederates... He is allowed to select his own reassignment... John opts to retreat into the wilderness, to the furthest frontier, where both the Sioux and Pawnee Indians still rule... The film perfectly captures the finest kind of American audacity when Costner rides out alone in the Lakota plains, wearing full dress uniform and holding the large American flag to formally introduce himself to his Sioux neighbors... and the worst of America, the cruelty exercised by the army when it's found he's a Yankee soldier turned Indian and arrested as a traitor... But it's the gentle humor and intimate moments of the movie which give Costner's ambitious epic Western its special flavor: scenes with Dunbar and his wild wolf Two Socks not daring, at first, to eat from his hand; his funny first encounter with a peaceful man Kicking Bird (Graham Greene); his love story with a stolen white woman living with the tribe called Stands With a Fist (Mary McDonnell); his relationship with a fierce impulsive warrior Wind in His Hair (Rodney A. Grant); and many others as Black Shawl (Tantoo Cardinal) advising her husband on affairs of the heart... With its share of bow-and-arrow fights, joyous buffalo hunts, and unprecedented tender feelings for the American Indians, "Dances With Wolves" remains an amazing accomplishment and a magnificent tribute for a culture lost over time...</fullReview>

They raped and slaughtered these hundreds of people with no warning and no mercy. This is a historical fact. This is the reason the Lakota were hunted down and attacked. Also, they practiced slavery. The white woman in the movie would in fact have been a slave. Historical facts are sorely lacking in this film. These facts are little known because the Civil War overshadows them.

He is assigned to an abandoned fort where a (Native American Indian) Sioux tribe is his only neighbor. Overcoming the language barrier and their mutual fear and distrust, Dunbar and the proud Indians gradually become friends," according to the film's official synopsis."Eventually, (Costner) falls in love with the beautiful 'Stands With A Fist' (Mary McDonnell), a white woman raised by the tribe. He learns the culture of the Sioux, lives with them, and even experiences the breathtaking excitement of a buffalo hunt, but his knowledge of the fate which will ultimately befall the tribe torments him. Finally, he is faced with a crucial decision that will cause him to examine his heart and soul before making a heroic choice that determines his destiny." Some of the criticism regarding "Dances with Wolves" misses the point; it's intentionally about role reversal.Mr. Costner was a neighbor of mine during the 1980s. He lived on Palm Drive, past the old LCUSD building. I'd never seen a Costner movie, but knew he made them. After "Dances with Wolves" came out, you could measure his success by the amount of long, dark cars coming to pick up Costner for award ceremonies. There were quite a lot of limos, and the film's honorees included the aforementioned, plus writer Michael Blake, photographer Dean Semler, composer John Barry, and editor Neil Travis.Costner's film is very beautiful, and he looks very good in it; much like real life, but with more feathery hair. He's a nice man (very zen) just like the character he plays herein. I was surprised to see one of his daughters in the opening, playing "Christine" (Ms. McDonnell as a child); why didn't anyone think to match the character's hair? A great dad, Costner took his children on walks, and jogged when in town. Backing out of our car port, we always checked to make sure Kevin Costner wasn't behind the vehicle.******** Dances with Wolves (10/19/90) Kevin Costner ~ Kevin Costner, Mary McDonnell, Graham Greene, Rodney A.

		<fullReview>Watching Dances With Wolves again after many years, I noted an historical error. In the scene out west when Dunbar arrives at his new station and looks through the old structure, a Dove lands on the sill. The Dove is supposed to be a Mourning Dove but is obviously a European Collared-Dove. European Collared-Doves did not arrive in the United States until the late 1900s, and probably did not get to South Dakota until nearly 1990 when the movie was filmed. The first were seen in the southeastern U. S. and did not get west or north for many years. Eurasian Collared-Doves originated from the Indian Sub-continent and arrived in Florida in the late 1970s. This bird is now common throughout the U. S.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Believe it or not, romance has a role in film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dancing with Wolves is a monumental romantic film about a time that was far, far more bloody and disgusting than anything seen in the movie. Having said that, I believe that there is a place in cinema for these beautiful, expansive films that yes, colour the reality of history but anybody with a brain knows the movie is doing this. However, it is okay because there is room for a little romance in the movies. Not necessarily stupidity but something between the harshness of a documentary and the silliness of something out of the Disney studio.The negative comments that centre on the influence of what these commentators call Leftywood is fabulously funny because they show themselves to be totally ignorant of history of their own country. Just because these conservatives do not wish to believe that the depredations of their country were so horrendous, does not detract an iota from the fact that it happened.Dances is a fabulous film and I will admire it for decades.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie Was Good; Costner's Acting Was Not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, the movie was very good. However, what marred it for me was Costner's performance. I did not find him believable in the role of a Cavalry officer. To me, he always seemed to be Kevin Costner, a 20th centrry actor, not Lt. Dunbar.Another aspect that was hard to swallow was the white woman's accent and attempts to speak English. She really hasn't spoken it since she was a child of 4 or 5, yet it all comes back to her fairly quickly, when she is asked to communicate with Dunbar. It is a major stretch to believe she could so easily begin to converse in English after all of this time. Also, her accent was very strange and very annoying.All of the other actors were top-notch, as was the cinematography and just about everything else about this movie.However, since Costner's role was the most important one and key to the whole story, his performance cast a pall on the movie for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remarkable, moving story stars Costner as a U.S. Army officer who becomes a hero after he unintentionally leads Union troops to victory during a key battle of the Civil War. He's given his choice of assignments, and chooses to be stationed at an abandoned fort on the western frontier. Alone and without standing orders, he forms an unlikely bond with a local Sioux tribe, gradually abandons all he knows, and eventually becomes a member of their tranquil society. Long, but gripping every step of the way with strong characters, some truly breathtaking scenery, and a story that's always involving. Never a dull moment in this powerfully in-depth character study, an extraordinary, riveting story masterfully told by Kevin Costner. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My brief review of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A spectacular epic western, well done in a number of aspects, but yet the film is uneven in its execution, resulting in a film that is far less than perfect. It is often involving and some of the scenery is captured by the cinematographer very well, but yet at times it drags and tends to bore. The acting is generally good, overall it is a very well-done film and was well awarded seven Oscars, but at twice the necessary length it is a shame that it cannot go down as a masterpiece. If it had been a half or even three quarters of its length, Costner would have directed a masterpiece ? instead this is just a very good film, but nothing special.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We join the praise of the movie, but we see also some negative aspects.Too often Kevin Costner is shown as a hero in the view of the Indians. One really cannot see the target of the film. The movie is a little bit too long, for example at the end. There are some brutal scenes, but one can also often laugh, for example when Costner imitates a buffalo. It is important that Costner writes a diary to understand the movie.The movie shows beautiful landscapes and good special effects, for example the buffalo hunting scene and the buffalo dummies which were killed by the white men who only took the tongues and hides. On the whole the movie is very realistic and emotional. We liked it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kostner can't act and direct at the same time (Tantataka!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kostner is a mediocre director, the likes of Clint Eastwood. Both have been hyped, since they cant find work in Hollywood. Kostner won the award since he has the Hollywood morons behind him, where as, Scorsese, is considered an outsider, who lost to a mediocre director. Why couldn't they find a American Indian to portray "Stand with a Fist"? The dialog between her as an interpretor sounds like The "Jeopardy" show.. Dunbear..no..Dunbar. The hunting of the buffaloes and the stockade-even though makes a nice spectacle-is cruel and should not have been allowed by the South Dakota authorities, not to mention the carcass shown of them. Kostner as John Dunbear! is a selfish loner (the type who shoot their own driver) who keeps a journal for the sake of narration but his voice is effeminate and shrill. This guy is no Morgan Freeman or Ray Liota. His acting is good when he gets on hand and knees to portray the Tantkata (buffalo.) even the Indians were impressed and seemed to them as good acting. It looks like he made a trip to the frontier, to hook up with this girl who is a bad interpretor but obviously good at other things and sleep in a tent. The story is drawn out for no reason. The only recreation and entertainment comes from a Kostner and the jackal staring at each other, even though the jackal comes out as a better actor! The shot where he picks up the wounded girl on to the horse is not shown-the reason is-it is almost impossible to do this, since the stirrups didn't exist. The movie is a money maker but was it better than "Good Fellas"? If so, why is it not in the list of Top 250 Movies? May I ask?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was the wolf's name Tube-Socks?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dances with Wolves" is beautiful. The detailed conversion on my new Blu player is and was phenomenal. The individual blades of grass stood tall and at moments I felt as if I was right there with Costner as he chased Two-Socks, or crossed the sweeping frontier. Costner's film, if anything, gave a modern technology country a view of a world that nearly feels fictional. No computers, no cell phones, nothing facing you except nature, and the power of Mother Earth. Costner captures this feeling with perfection. Not only does he have the time to cultivate this sensation, but he uses both audio and visual references to assist with his imagery. There was no doubt in my mind that Costner felt dedicated to this project that his creative eye wasn't at the peak of its existence. His passion bled through the film, giving us that moment when "Dances with Wolves" transforms from Hollywood project to Costner's dream come true. For that I applaud Costner for following his heart and creating a visual treat that goes beyond your average film.While Costner's imagery stands powerfully next to any great director's work, it is the overall story that ultimately holds back the rest of the film. Costner is obviously comfortable behind the camera, but it is his work within the film that feels a bit repetitive and cliché. Costner is not Lieutenant Dunbar. While he is the imaginative force behind the story, he cannot seem to tackle the character itself. Costner never quite transforms himself into something we haven't seen. Perhaps watching it during its release would have been a different story, but in 2008, one watches Costner be Costner only in Native American headwear. The scenes in this film where he first encounters the sounds of the frontier, or later when he finds an unseen love, were utterly dishonest. Costner was Costner; there was no other way to see it. The only parts that glimmered with a possible character were the beginning run through the barrage of open bullets, and the violent reintroduction to the white culture near the end were satisfactory, but for just a few short moments. Costner needed to tell us more about Dunbar, give us either flashbacks of his life or his reason for making decisions. The voice-over wasn't convincing enough as a conscious to give us true rhyme or reason. Those puppy dog eyes that Costner blasted any chance he had never gave us the torment that obviously dwelled within this man. There was a reason for his possible suicide attempt and escape into the wild. With no mention of family or history, it is difficult to understand Costner's why.With Costner misleading us through the mapping of this film, it was left up to the other players to demonstrate a goal at the end of this four hour tunnel. This semi-happened with Graham Greene's character and Catherine McCormack's role, two people forced into cliché roles that they have played time and time again. This time they pulled it off well, but I just didn't believe them. Greene plays this character in every film he has ever been in, while McCormack's character was a cross between Helen Keller and Pocahontas. Not to sound offensive to Native American's, I was happy to see a sympathetic view of them via Costner's eyes, but it felt used. Hardship seemed to be an unknown word to this tribe. Costner was able to walk on in, build relationships, not worry about food rations, and easily jump right into the culture without any worry. There was never a moment where I found myself saying, "Ah, is he going to make it?" ? the simplicity of it all seemed faked and merely in place for emotions sake.Finally, the question of time has to be approached. Did Costner need four hours to tell this story? Alas, no. Using the beautiful landscape he merely bought time, aka filler, to push his simplistic tale from average story to epic. In two hours, Costner could have pushed the emotional button further and really dedicated himself to his character. At pushing 245 minutes, we felt as if we lost the character of Dunbar after the first hour and a half. With such a broad canvas, not enough was dedicated to the right parts. Costner's relationships with the other characters were pushed so far that a sense of apathy was built. Any cares that we had were brushed away at the two and a half hour mark.Overall, Costner's film probably deserved the Oscars at the time ? but it currently doesn't stand alone as a modern masterpiece. Costner misjudged this film pushing the framing too far and loosing the central focus. His character of Dunbar seemed more like an imitation of Droopy Dog in the frontier, instead of a stylized representation of a true soul. Costner does powerfully show us a sympathetic view of the Native American culture during the time of its downfall, but with such an epic nature I expected it to carry more realism. The Sioux has danger, they had fears, and they had their own to worry about, but once Costner appeared we saw none of that. Costner was so excited about learning about them, about communicating with them, that we never quite had the chance to see their world. Costner must be given credit for his eye in this film. While his directing skills were not as I anticipated, his visual eye was superb. Images that may never be captured again were detailed throughout, giving us the view of an epic ? although lacking the other parts. "Dances with Wolves" is worth viewing at least once, but another four hours could not be done by this critic even if life depended on it.Grade: ** ? out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dances with Wolves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the directorial debut for actor Kevin Costner, who deservedly won the Oscar and Golden Globe, and was nominated the BAFTA, for Best Director, he also funded the film himself, based on the book by Michael Blake, it really gives the Hollywood western genre a kick. Basically set in 1863, during the American Civil War, First Lieutenant John J. Dunbar (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Kevin Costner) returns from battle, his injured leg is to be amputated, but following a suicide attempt Dunbar unexpectedly rallies his comrades, and an experienced general's surgeon saves his leg. Dunbar is praised as a hero, meeting mentally ill Major Fambrough (Maury Chaykin), he requests to transfer west, to see the Western frontier before it ends, he is paired with mule wagon provisioner Timmons (Robert Pastorelli), as they leave Fambrough commits suicide. Dunbar and Timmon reach the desolate Fort Sedgwick, after a scenic journey, all they find is a lone wolf that Dunbar befriends and names "Two Socks", because of its white front leg colouring, Dunbar awaits reinforcements and remains to man the post, despite the threat of nearby Indian tribes. While Dunbar writes a diary, and rebuilds and restocks the fort, Timmons is killed by Pawnee Indians, this and the death of Fambrough means other soldiers are unaware of Dunbar's assignment, and no soldiers will arrive to reinforce the post. Dunbar is initially approached by neighbouring Sioux Indians who try to steal his horse and intimidate him, he decides to find the Siouz camp and attempt to communicate, on the way he encounters Stands With A Fist (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Mary McDonnell), the white adopted daughter of the tribe's medicine man Kicking Bird (Oscar nominated Graham Greene), she attempts suicide because of the death of her husband. Dunbar brings her back to the tribe to recover, some tribe members begin to respect him, he eventually gains rapport with Kicking Bird and the warrior Wind In His Hair (Rodney A. Grant), as time goes by Dunbar finds that what he was told about the tribe is untrue, he grows to respect and appreciate their lifestyle and customs, and learns their language. Observing Dunbar and "Two Socks" chasing each other, the Sioux give him the name "Dances With Wolves", during this time Dunbar also forms a romantic relationship with Stands With A Fist and helps defend the village from an attack by the rival Pawnee tribe, he eventually wins the approval of Kicking Bird, is allowed to marry Stands With A Fist, and abandons Fort Sedgewick. Because of the growing threat of the Pawnees and the whites, Chief Ten Bears (Floyd 'Red Crow' Westerman) decides to move the tribe to its winter camp, Dunbar decides to accompany them, he goes back to Fort Sedgewick to retrieve his diary, which would provide the army with means to find the tribe, but the fort has been reoccupied by the U.S. Army. The soldiers open fire and kill Dunbar's horse, Dunbar is captured and arrested as a traitor, being interrogated Dunbar cannot prove his story, a corporal found and discarded his diary, refusing to interpret for the tribes Dunbar is charged with desertion and transported back east as a prisoner, Two Socks follows him, the wolf is shot by soldiers. The Sioux track the convoy, killing the soldiers and free Dunbar, they no longer see him as a white man, but as one of their own, Dunbar, as Dances With Wolves, decides him remaining would endanger the Sioux tribe, so he and Stands With A Fist leave, American troops are seen searching the mountains but unable to locate them. Also starring Tantoo Cardinal as Black Shawl and Dumb and Dumber's Charles Rocket as Lieutenant Elgin. Costner gives a brilliant performance as the soldier who befriends a feared Indian tribe, he also directs the film with real passion and conviction, the supporting cast members such as McDonnell and Greene are terrific as well, the film may be three hours long, but it is really worth it, it has great sweeping battle sequences, beautiful backgrounds, marvellous music, and it really does atone for the shameful depiction Hollywood used to have of native American life, a splendid epic western. It won the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Music for John Barry, Best Sound, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Costume Design, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Make Up Artist, Best Original Film Score, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Sound and Best Film, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Original Score. Kevin Costner was number 93 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, the film was number 59 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers, and it was number 75 on 100 Years, 100 Movies. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When voice-over narration went wrong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion Kevin Costner's acting ability is not in question at all - he was great in the far superior Western, 'Wyatt Earp' - it's just the rank awful writing that spoils the day here.It starts off immature, "these people were my friends", "I am a celebrity", then gradually descends into cheesy sentiment, "I came to understand that every last one of these people were great and the white men are so, so bad", before finishing off at downright sickly "he only smiled and talked of simple pleasures, a good fire was better than anything" - but however bad the voice-over journal was, I managed to cringe my way through it somehow.It was a case of Costner over-egging the point to the stage of ramming it down our throats - I think every one of us understands now that all Indians weren't murdering vigilantes with daft names. Okay so they do have daft names, but by no means is this a criticism of them and I don't mean to offend any Indians or Costner by saying it. And Fist In The Mouth or whatever he was called was obviously a very dignified character, as was made abundantly clear on more than one occasion - about eight I think.One thing that got me though was how Dunbar and co. were crying over some dead buffalo in one scene, but then ten seconds later were themselves having a 15-minute heroic buffalo chase, which was so over the top you felt sure a rabid Dunbar was going to start eating one raw.It was too much for me this film, I like to make my own mind up while watching films rather than be spoon-fed a load of sentimental claptrap like this. 4/10</fullReview>

He made many awful movies, so far, but this one is a real under low, a real failure. Well, there are 2 great moments - the excellent scenery and animals. They are very good and sweet. The rest is very preachy, predictable, real boring and yawning all 4 long slow hours. This is what they call a heritage? Maybe, I was not impressed - Kevin made a movie about himself, for himself and with much of his beloved his self. Sorry, this does not work.

And in cinematic terms, it works quite well, with beautiful photography and some rousing moments enlivening the three to four hours running time.But basically, it's the conventional long-standing naive view on the oh-so-noble savages, while the use of subtitled native language and extensive insight into the Indians' everyday life is laudable but does not necessarily provide a stronger grip on reality. The pic's still an all-American boy's adventure, owing a lot to Jack London's books and in that respect watchable (if not nearly as harsh and absorbing), but finally too long-winded and overreaching.6 out of 10 gripping buffalo hunts</fullReview>

Read many books on the subject. So, this movie touched me where I lived, and it was easy for me to relate to the Costner character and the sentiment expressed. I thought it was an excellent movie.Problem is, I tried to watch it again a few years back and I couldn't. Had to turn it off. When Costner spreads his arms out wide and prances back and forth, eyes closed, before an array of rifles firing at him and not able to hit him the thought came to me that 'this is bullshit'. Why didn't I notice how bogus this was the first time I saw it? (Actually, I did but kept watching as I'd paid good money). I guess it's supposed to signal to the viewer that this is a very special man - protected by some mystical force.Then, a while later in the film, Costner is living alone on the frontier and along comes a wild wolf that, again I guess drawn by some mysticism inherent in Costner's character, doesn't remain true to its wildness but becomes a playmate (pet) to Costner. And again came the thought 'bullshit'.Now, I know that the movie is gonna get better (I have seen it before and there's 'indians' coming) but I'm out of the film now because, apart from these incongruous scenes, Costner is boring me to tears. The fact is, he always bores me to tears. He's a very boring actor. A boring personality with a bland look. Why isn't this movie in the top 250? I think I know why.No point in going on about it. After reading four solid pages of 'greatest movie of all time' comments this one's bound to go to the back with lots of 'no' votes and I'm sorry to offend, but: good movie once - stupid movie twice. Kevin Costner is an overblown bore of an actor and his continually declining popularity is due to people realizing it as they revisit his filmography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prefabricated, Posturing Picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most overrated Movies ever. For a film to win so many Oscars you would think that it is something special. There is nothing special or innovative about this. In fact, it is less than Average on all accounts.Sprawling Landscape Photography rarely can elevate a Movie above its shortcomings. The Hero is a likable if not an engaging sort, although the Star/Director almost breaks the "Suspension of Disbelief" quite a few times with less than adequate Screen Presence, especially when narrating or anytime He is called on to display depth of Character.The manipulative turns abound. The Whites are presented, as the Narrator must tell us, in an obvious redundant description of a Companion?"The foulest Creature I have ever met."The Story is flat and way too long and unimpressive and betrays the Complex Subject Matter many times. Even the Buffalo Hunt is lackluster as are all of the Action Set Pieces. This is one of those Films that somehow is sprinkled with "Fairy Dust" and spellbinds Audiences and Critics into believing that there is more than meets the eye. Think Titanic or E.T. It is almost unapproachable. This is not the creation of Art, it is more like sleight of hand. A prefabricated, posturing, Picture that would not and did not endure its initial Academy Anointing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, I like the movie, but it's not like it was action-packed and the 5 hours you were sitting watching it while you're butt cramped was worth it. I mean, for goodness sakes. It dragged on and on and on. I admire the story about this guy living and learning to trust and respect the Sioux people, but the points could have been made within 20 minute frames. It was on a grand scale, but it didn't need to be. There were moments that nothing was happening and could have been cut out of the film. It's history. We know what happens to most of the Native Americans, so why drag it out? I love the story, the characters, their arcs, the plot, but it was all too long. Bravo shows it on occasion and the movie is even longer with commercial interruptions. I commend the crew on the final product visually, but it could have used with a few more editing staff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>spectacular photography but little more with 'underdog hero' Costner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Dances with Wolves' became quite a popular film in the early 1990s when the western was making a revival. This film portrays a frontiersman who discovers a life with native American people and a respect for their way of life. It depicts the native Americans as people more than previous westerns, which had a more lowly view of them.The best thing about the film is the production value - the attention to detail, the set design, the costumes, and so on. Some of the landscape shots were breath-taking, and there was also a good sense of action. I believe that this is the reason why the film was so popular. (Not to mention the audience's new love for Kevin Costner and for being more fairer to the native American culture on the silver screen.) However, I do not think this is the best film ever made. In between sweeping scenery and action are fairly long drags of dialog and Kevin Costner being a hero and showing him with his native American wife and hard life and loss. I'd personally rate this as an average film, but it gets points for some spectacular photography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't like this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't like "Dances with Wolves". The movie is too long compared with the few things that happen. The photography is dusty and brownish and it spoils the beauty of the landscape. The action scenes are sporadic and non-exciting. All the whites are laughably bad (save Costner, of course). As soon as a white guy appears on the screen, we are sure that he will readily do something awfully evil. This causes an unwanted comic effect. Moreover, I don't think that the current fashion of representing the American Indians as a not-even-much-modernized version of Rousseau's "good savage" is much flattering for them.Now I must confess one thing: I watched "Dances with Wolves" some years ago; I found the plot so uninteresting that I cannot remember how the film ends! OK, that's my fault; anyway, this is not a good recommendation for the movie itself, is it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wanted to see this for a long time, BUT! pretty bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only reason I would give this movie a 2 is because of the great cinematography, And I love and do cinematography for college myself. But for what was it worth? The story is very subtle slow and frankly boring as hell. I love movies involving history, their my favorites! And I especially love westerns or most stuff involving indians. Lonesome Dove, Bury my Heart at Wounded Knee, Jeremiah Johnson Etc. I wanted to see this for along time coming but wow I was disappointed. I'm not particularly a fan of Costner but I think he does a fine good in some movies (Untouchables). His narration of the story is mono-toned (never let Costner do narration Obviously) so bland and bluh (boring). The story is slow and not interesting through out, it barely develops. The officer who commits suicide in the beginning, what the f*ck, quite irrelevant and stupid. The only climax is that he has a change of heart for the particular Indian tribe and he never disliked them to begin with. The white woman who was captured, her story is bland and her acting is border line awful. The only good acting is the actors who portray native Americans. I have no idea how it is so praised and sometimes considered a classic. I bought it for 5$ because I was sure it would at least be pretty good because I tend to love movies of this genre, But No Way! Dances with Wolves is bland, boring, the acting is mellow dramatic/ just bad. Who ever says it has a good moral or message is dumb too. There are much better movies with good white and Indian relationships. REMEMBER I WENT INTO WATCHING THIS MOVIE THINKING IT WAS GOING TO BE AT LEAST DESCENT. Trust me there is no classic here. The cinematography is good though, I'll give it that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie but not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have issues with the movie as some others in how ALL white people, save Dunbar and Stands With a Fist, are portrayed. They are all portrayed as ignorant, aggressive, over-the-top evil characters. I am SURE some whites were like that but so could some native Americans be like that too. The movie also glosses over the real problem for plains Indians which was that even if US policy concerning them had been different, white people were going to expand westward anyhow and that the vast amounts of land that a small number of Indians "claimed" was going to cause a big problem anyhow. Indeed, the wars Indians had between each other were usually over tribal reach for hunting purposes to feed their particular tribe. Some of the movie was quite predictable too like Costner going to get the rifles he buried and saving the day against the Pawnee invaders. Basically, some of the movie was the Michael Moore view of the world that the Sioux were just kite flying peaceful people until the white man came which isn't accurate at all when you consider tribal warfare. That being said, having a movie from the Indian perspective is quite useful but this one wasn't it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kevin Costner took a great script and a potentially great movie and created an unwatchable piece of junk. I refuse to read subtitles to watch any movie. I did watch this movie twice. I hated it more the second time I watched it than the first. All of the dialog needs to be in English. I do not speak any other language. I watch movies for entertainment. I will not watch movies to have to try to read a bunch of subtitles. I did enjoy some parts of the movie when there were No subtitles. I hope this movie is remade by someone who will not use subtitles. I like Costner in some of his other movies and I think some of the other movies with Costner are great. I will never watch Dances With Wolves again. Not ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sorry, but your apologia has not been accepted. There actually was a Dunbar, and he was really a Christian missionary.And they could've at least gotten a native actress to play Stands with Fist, but nooooo...To make matters worse, this movie started a whole trend of wannabe Indians. Ask any Indian, we find them VERY annoying. All they're interested in is what they want Indians to be.Once we get past the racism, Costner's acting is sub par, as usual. What can we expect from a guy whose debut was playing a frat boy?Oh, on the lighter side, American censors cut out a scene where Costner says "Big buffalo" and one of the Indians says "Actually it was a little buffalo." You can guess what they thought he was talking about. And Costner's probably is fairly small, judging by the fact that he is speaking the female Lakota dialect throughout the movie. LOL</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kevin Costner's Academy-Award-Winning film 'Dances With Wolves' is an overrated classic. Yes agreed, it's beautifully directed and executed, but not a complete sweeper. The film's length is its biggest problem, leaving the viewer exhausted and tired. Its an above-average-to-average entertainer in my eye. Just about decent! Pluses: Costner's direction is fantastic. 2 words = Par Excellence. Costner's performance is also endearing. Other actors also do a pretty good job.Minuses: Too lengthy and violent. On the whole, 'Dances With Wolves' works in bits and pieces.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Racist Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved 'Dances with Wolves' when I was younger, but when I went back to watch it again recently, I turned it off half way through. First of all the movie is racist toward whites. Kevin Costner seems like the only white man who has sympathy for American Indians. Costner depicts whites as sloppy, drunk, and incompetent, while depicting the Native Americans as pure, noble, and peaceful. The settlers who came from Europe did horrible things to the American Indians, but that does not mean the American Indians were all pure at heart and the white man was all evil. The war and genocide that occurred between the two groups is what almost always happens when two people of different race, religion, and ethnic groups conflict with each other. Costner was paying respect to the Native Americans and that was a good thing that he did. The American Indians deserve it up to a point. But don't go around thinking they were not deeply flawed and did not have darker side like other human beings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start with saying the Kevin is definitely stepping down a notch in doing this movie after water world. Then again nothing comes close to the mind bending visually stunning movie we know as water world. The only thing that would make water world better is if he ate his own crap and then threw some of it at smokers. Thats enough of that though I'm getting to excited thinking there might be a water world 2. Dances with Wolves started out just fine and even had one of the best plots of all time. It also had superb dialog. The dialog makes star wars episode 3 look like child's play. It basically gives George Lucas a giant middle finger and up yours. The only reason I give it a 5 is because you see Kevin's nasty booty way to much. I mean you don't have to ruin possibly the best movie of all time with a little to much corn hole. I mean if his bunghole wasn't so pink it wouldn't be that bad but jeez it made my dong shrink up and almost fall off. Thats why i now hate Kevin.

		<fullReview>This movie is rubbish. It is so rubbish that not even the likes of James Earl Jones wanted any part of it. Other notable actors of the time that are not involved with this film because it was rubbish are Tom Cruise and Judge Reinhold.This film is all about a man who travels on his horse all the way out to the western area of the United States of America (the USA). When he gets there he makes a little hut for himself and becomes friends with the locals! LOL. The rest of the film is just as boring as that, and there are too many campfires in this movie that are created by rubbing sticks together because this film is set in a time before anyone had even invented lighters! If you watch this film you will feel very miserable, like having too many peas with your steak. I have watched this film and I have come to the conclusion that it is rubbish. It doesn't even have any scenes where anyone dances with wolves, which is probably a good thing because everybody knows that wolves can't even stand up without falling over, let alone dance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, here we go again, Indians good, America bad. Indians gooood, white men baaaad. Give me a break. This movie like so many others coming out of leftywood had me laughing about 1/4 thru this long, long, long movie.I'm sure the good news about this movie is that some college professor is using this movie as a guideline, for all the bad things American and the white men did to the poor poor Indians. The fact is the, Sioux Indians got a pretty good deal out of our government. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't great. But better than most. And did we treat some Indians bad? Yes. Did Indians kill and rape white women? Yes. Did Indians and white's break treaties? All the time.But for this movie to go on and on about how the government and white's are so bad is just ridiculous. Costner, who can't act his way out of a wet paper bag, tries to convinces you it's better to be an Indian than white. It's better to commit treason and leave your post and become an Indian.Maybe this movies should have focus on how weak this man Dunbar was. He couldn't handle it in the civil war; he couldn't handle being in the army. He couldn't handle being at a post by himself. I think this man Dunbar would have teamed up with anyone who came along at the moment. Good thing the Chinese wasn't building a railroad across the planes at that time or we would have been watching a movie about how to turn yourself into a Chinaman.</fullReview>
