		<shortDescription>Arthur was a good movie, coming from someone who hasn't seen the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start this off by saying that I have never seen the original Arthur. There is also no sense in me going over the plot or the differences between this and the original because that is covered in so many different reviews and I am guessing this isn't the only review that you will read. I am 29 years old and I wouldn't even consider myself a Russell Brand fan but after seeing this movie that is starting to change. I went into Arthur with an open mind. I did not have another movie to compare it to, since I didn't see the original, and I throughly enjoyed the movie. Russell Brand was OK in 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' and I really didn't enjoy his movie "Get Him to the Greek" but Arthur was a different type of comedy compared to his typical work. The best thing I can compare this movie to is "The Wedding Singer". Not because of the plot or the actors but because "The Wedding Singer" put Adam Sandler in a slightly toned down more caring/romantic version of things had done before. There was less slap stick and I actually ended up liking Adam Sandler more because of it. The same can be said about Arthur. This isn't OVER THE TOP Russell Brand like most of his other movies. I wouldn't say it's 'down to earth' Russell Brand either, more like some place in between.Even if you have seen the original try to go to see this movie and not compare it to the original. It's the same as The Dark Knight vs Batman with Michael Keaton. Both were good movies but you couldn't really compare them. What surprised me at the end of the movie was my brother (32 years old) saying he actually liked this better than the original, which he watched last weekend. He said the one liners were better and Russell Brand made a more convincing drunk. My guess is because Russell is probably always this drunk when he isn't filming movies!Arthur made me laugh out loud, which is something I typically don't do. The story was decent (typical romantic comedy) and even though the movie slowed down about 3/4 of the way in, it had to because of the story. Do yourself a favor and see this movie at some point. It doesn't have to be in the theater since there aren't any eye popping sound effects or state of the art 3D in it...(though the city of New York was a GORGEOUS back drop)Go see it. Turn your brain off for a bit and enjoy the movie for what it is. Don't compare it to the original but compare it to the other things Russell has done and you will see that he might actually have a great future at comedy ahead of him. Final Verdict: 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this film was simply brilliant. The acting in it was great, the comedic timing perfect, the script well written, and the setting well shown. Yes, once again it is a movie set in New York, but there's a reason why they can't having them there. It's an amazing city. And this movie showcases that very well. I appreciated the range of humor they had in there as well. Some of it was raunchy, and then at other times it was mild and a relief from some of the over the top jokes. The climax was well done, humorous yet tasteful at the same time, and the conclusion was very appropriate. I heard some people complaining about how this movie was showcasing how rich people have it made and it wouldn't be received well today because of the economic climate. That was ridiculous. If anything, it shows how money really can't buy happiness, and that the most important thing in this world is that we have each other. Overall, very enjoyable film that one should go into with an open mind and just have a good time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take Arthur for 2011 not 1981</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Arthur, was and is a great film. It was funny, well written and well acted. It garnered 4 Oscar nominations and 2 wins. It won 4 out of 5 Golden Globes. John Gielgud so deserved his award so well that year. Dudley Moore, in the title character, had the same lovable charm that Russel Brand has in this remake. But, there are several things missing which make the 2011 version an OK film, and not a part of cinema awards. First, its 2011 and not 1981. The original version would never be made today. Plain and simple. Arthur was a drunk. A hard drinker, who fell down, slurred words,and yes, even was driving drunk in several scenes. No way would that get approved today, or anyone think it was funny. It was this funny drunk that made Dudley's Arthur so much fun, even though today we would rush for interventions or rehab. Second, the director forgot this is a New York film. It is set in New York, but so much changed from one film to the other that the setting was indifferent here. No more neighborhood bars, dinners, landmark shopping sites, or eateries. There is one really good scene involving Grand Central, but it does not make up for the lack in the rest of the film. Linda becomes Naomi in the new film. She is not a New Yorker. Does not look like one, or act like one. She plays the part well, but its just not the same. Again, this remake could be set anywhere. Can you imagine the original anywhere but NY! Third, as good as Helen Mirrim is, she is not the Hobson that John Gielgud presented. She will not get any awards for this presentation. So, if you do not make any comparisons, you will like the film, but most likely not fall in love with it for 30 years. The film is well acted, written in parts, but it steals one lines too much from the original, that just seemed forced here or are not well placed. Whereas we see Arthur drink, he never really seems drunk. The relationship with Hobson is presented as a mother/son, rather than father/son. It was hard to believe in the relationship as much as the previous film. The chemistry between Arthur and Naomi was believable and flow very well throughout the film. Susan Johnson, played by Jennifer Garner had much more of a role here than the original. It needed to be reverted back. It was just not funny. Lastly, Nick Nolte was just plain horrible and nasty. He could have been written out completely. It made no sense for plot development. So, the new Arthur is as an OK remake, but not as good as it could have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly likable reworking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A drunken playboy stands to lose a wealthy inheritance unless he marries a woman he doesn't like, meanwhile he falls for tour guide that his family doesn't approve of.Entertaining comedy in which Russell Brand surprisingly comes across more lovable that Dudley Moores original incarnation. There are some genuine funny scenes notably with a magnetic bed, children's store, the Batmobile getting pulled over (yes, really) and when Arthur goes nail gun happy with future father-in-law Burt Johnson perfectly played by Nick Nolte.The realistic sets, New York setting including Grand Central Station act as interesting backdrop that director Jason Winer full utilises. Greta Gerwig as the love interest Naomi Quinn is on likable form while Jennifer Garner refreshingly goes against all American girl typecast as socialite Susan Johnson. Evander Holyfield, Luis Guzmán and Geraldine James Geraldine James put in an appearances. Helen Mirren's Hobson is touchingly portrayed and Mirren steals the show with her grounded and humanistic performance.Overall the story stinks of countless 80's rom-coms but Arthur is entertaining nonetheless due to its nostalgic yet contemporary reworking and Russels' engaging tongue-tied performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I suspect that Russell Brand is a polarising personality in this world. Some find his idiosyncratic ways quite the put off. I, on the other hand, have always had a soft spot for old Rusty. I find him beguiling and very pleasant to watch.I am not going to pontificate and deconstruct. This is a remake. I can't remember the Dudley Moore version but all I know is that this film was very charming. Fair enough, there are going to be no big surprises - no epiphanic moments. But what this has in bucket loads is a grand sense of heart. Russell Brand is silly but underneath the silliness there is real, genuine stuff. You can see his heart break in a crescendo scene and if you let yourself you'll find you become very sympathetic to this lost boy. Jennifer Garner is scarily comfortable in the role of a-grade beyatch! Helen Mirren is just perfect as the man boy's nanny. Look, to be honest I am too lazy to get into nitty gritty stuff but this one is a winner if you are open enough to admit it.Trust me. It's lovely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely despise Russell Brand so naturally I assumed that I would not like this movie one bit. That, however, was not at all the case. Sure, the movie started with Brand's typical ridiculous antics and obnoxiousness but it turned out to be quite entertaining. Brand, for once, was able to actually make the transition from ridiculous idiot to still idiotic but also charming with his humor. Also, Helen Mirren stole the movie. She is truly something else. I don't think I'd be alone in saying she is one of the premier actresses in Hollywood. Her character's dry humor but strength and caring shined through perfectly and was the highlight of the film. Garner and Gerwig's characters are also pretty interesting. Garner doesn't really step outside the box with this performance but it was still solid. I was pleasantly surprised with Gerwig though. I had never seen her in a meaningful role and she was very solid in portraying her emotions. All in all the movie was just a pretty good film and it was definitely worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People go to the movies for a variety of reasons. Watching Arthur for it's contributions to the world of cinema is probably not the reason to spend your $10.If you want a light comedy which entertains you, then I'd say the film definitely succeeds. But, if you take things seriously and attempt to critique the movie,well it might be better if you rent something from the Venice Film Festival instead. Arthur is made with a view to entertaining it's viewers and does a pretty good job of it,IMHO (but hey, a packed theatre of people laughing would not mean anything,right?) What would average movie goers know about the movies?Russel Brand doesn't attempt to copy Dudley Moore's role- he presents a rather brattish rework to take into today's age and times.Helen Mirren is delightful-every 30 yr old would love to have her as a nanny:) You find yourself rooting for Arthur turning himself around to end up with this girl he loves Naomi(Greta Gerwig)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not worth an academy award...But not terrible.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arthur ''Russell Brand'' is about the title character Arthur Bach. Arthur is a 40ish alcoholic ultra-rich playboy who lives' by no one's rules but his own. Arthur may be a 40 year old man on the exterior, but underneath he's an insolent 13 year old at best. His wealth was not earned but he none the less has access to seemingly unlimited funds via his family's business.After Arthurs shenanigans get to much publicity for the family business his mother gives him the ultimatum of either marrying a rude woman who only wants a stake in his family's business. Or simply being thrown out on his butt with no more wealth. The choice to be made is a long and hard one...Which is only made even harder when Arthur meets Naomi, a cute lower middle class girl who works as an unlicensed tour guide. Arthur falls head over heels for her and goes about making a relationship with her...Only to later have it ruined....Anyway...I don't want to describe the whole movie here for you...But that's the premise. Arthur is a good watch, Its not great and many will argue it doesn't do the original justice...But it is entertaining and worthy of a few good laughs. Don't cut this movie short just because someone on the internet says it's not as good as it should be. Give it a chance. It's an alright comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just didn't see the point to it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't jump on the bandwagon of immediately hating on a remake as there are some great ones out there. I watched the Arthur remake as I do like Helen Mirren a lot and I personally don't mind Russell Brand. But I was hesitant too as to me the trailer didn't wow me over, I didn't laugh once, and by the end of last week I was starting to get annoyed at Offenbach's Can Can(a fun piece especially to dance and sing along to but can get on your nerves sometimes depending on the time and place) being played for the hundredth time.Arthur wasn't for me quite the abomination that I heard it was, but in all honesty I didn't see much point to it. It is better than the Psycho and Wicker Man remakes both of which almost made me lose the will to live, but for a good remake look towards The Thief of Baghdad, The Magnificent Seven and especially The Thing. If I were to compare this to the 1981 film, the 1981 film is much better being very funny and charming and I actually preferred the much-maligned-but(in my opinion)-better-than-its-reputation sequel over this too.I will get the good things out of the way. I did like very much how the film looked and the location shooting is very striking and the soundtrack is infectious. But here come the many negatives. While I admire that Arthur tried to stick faithfully to the original film, I think there are times when it tries too hard and it comes off as being too faithful. Except here while there was wit, fun and charm in the original and in its sequel, there is not enough of that here, the severe letdown that is the ending pretty much epitomises this. The script is often unfunny and juvenile, severely lacking in the acidity and drollness that worked so well before, and the gags are really quite weak, predictable and poorly timed.I don't mind a movie where it has moments of predictability, a lot of movies do, but it does bother me when there are too many moments throughout where it is. That is the case with Arthur, and I can't count the number of times where I was saying to myself "now where have I seen this before". Again, I don't mind when a movie show little or nothing new, but the difference is Arthur in the end didn't make me overlook that because it was lacking in charm.The direction is rather poor as well, often rushed and smug, and there were times where I felt there should be more time to breathe. And there are some moments where there is little or no humour that are really quite dull. The acting overall fares little better. I have to say though Russell Brand did have very big shoes to fill and he does do an admirable job trying to convey some spontaneous cheeky charm. The problem is not only is his material unfunny and dreadfully weak but his titular character clichéd and unlikeable. Arthur in the original was clichéd in a way but I found as the film progressed you warmed to him, here I grew tired of him.I cannot deny that Greta Gerwig is talented, but she too is ill-served with her material. She has no snappy lines, no funny joke, no witty gag to write home about, so overall it was the pretty-but-bland acting performance. I'd say the same for Jennifer Garner as well, and also that her frothy acting style didn't entirely work within the tone and style of the film. I was most saddened about Helen Mirren, bless her she tries so hard, but in the John Gielgud role she can't do anything with her lines, she has some decent delivery but there is none of the droll and acidic quality in the one-liners to go the extra mile. Then there are talented actors such as Nick Nolte and Geraldine James who are largely wasted.All in all, not an abomination but pointless. 2/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Comedies should be fun. Sometimes they can deviate from reality but the whole premise of this movie is absurd.Arthur was just a totally unbelievable character. Maybe it was brand, maybe it was the script, maybe it was the director. It doesn't matter. If we don't believe Arthur could ever be a real person then we will never have the connection that is needed for a movie to succeedPerhaps the people who find torture and sadism entertaining could rate this movie highly but for the majority of the human population they will find this a piece of trash. I am just surprised that this movie with the deridingly unfunny revised script was ever released.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really loved the 80's romantic comedy Arthur for many reasons. Its premise was sweet, the characters were all likable, and Dudley Moore was just brilliant. So, when I heard last year about a remake starring Russell Brand I knew it wouldn't be as good as the original, but with Brand as Arthur I knew it would be enjoyable. And thats just what it is.The premise remains the same. Arthur(Brand) is a drunken playboy millionaire who is told by his mother that he has to marry Susan(Jennifer Gardener) otherwise she will stop giving him money, which he obviously doesn't want. So, when he meets Naomi(Greta Gerwig), he has to choose between the money or the love.Arthur has its funny moments. It also has some of the charm that made the first one so wonderful. But the thing that I enjoyed most was that it wasn't word for word, scene for scene like the original. They changed certain things up.There are certain things that I wish would've remained the same. I wish that Susan could've been more likable. You know she's bad from the start. But in the original she was innocent. She wasn't a total wacko, unlike Gardener's character. I also like the small similarities, and the big ones.But I did enjoy some of the differences. I like how they went out of their way to make it different. Such as Hobson being a woman(originally played by John Giugland now played by Hellen Mirren), and the fact that the mom is the one threatening Arthur, not his dad.Though Brand isn't quite Dudley Moore, he still does a good job. He was born to fill in the shoes. I just wish he got drunk more.Moore's drunk moments stole the show. Gerwig is a delightful star, and i'm glad to see her do more. The two have wonderful chemistry. So, the new Arthur isn't perfect, but its a charming and funny remake that doesn't go down in infamy.I mean, most remakes blow. But Arthur works because its not a total retread. I say see it as soon as possible. Din't believe what you hear. Brand, Mirren, and Gerwig will make your afternoon a good one.B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie very much! Of course it is very difficult to top an original with a remake, this being said, I viewed it on opening day with 11 friends, all of which had slightly different tastes in movies, and we all enjoyed it. The witty humorous lines that Russel Brand is able to bring to the table makes the movie very enjoyable. His chemistry with the other actors is incredible, and he is truly "The worlds only lovable billionaire" in this film. I am not usually a fan of Russel Brand, but this changed my opinion entirely. An awkward man he may be, but he is able to stir up a laugh when needed, and jerk a tear or two as well. If you enjoy actors like Adam Sandler, or if you enjoyed "Get Him to the Greek", or if you have a liking for witty lines, and use of vocabulary, I highly recommend "Arthur" This movie made me laugh, cry, and really consider buying it as soon as it is released on DVD. 9/10 stars, for a wonderful movie!</fullReview>

None of the jokes made laugh, and most of them were quite irritating, to say the least.Honestly, this is one of the worst movies that I've seen in my entire life, and I can't believe that it is rated so high, considering how bad it was.0/10 (And I would rate with a negative score if I could)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Looking for a funny bit to enjoy with some friends, I was very pleased with the outstanding one-liners and Russell Brand's silly antics. I was pleasantly surprised with the sweet romantic plot and deeper underlying plot. Not having seen the original, I had no expectations and I really loved the laugh. I think the motherly relationship between Arthur and Hobson added to the complexity of the situation between Arthur and his mother, as did the parallel between the death of Arthur's father and Naomi's mom. The depth of Naomi's character also added to the growth of Arthur's character and promoted an emotional connection. Surprisingly sweet, Arthur (2011) is a secretly lovely romance with the added seriousness of alcoholism and the complexity of deep loving relationships.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Went to see this because my fiancé thought the previews were funny. Admittedly, the previews I had seen made it look funny as well, but I had read some critical reviews, and wasn't enthusiastic. As it turned out, the critics were right, and I applaud the marketing geniuses who were actually able to make "Arthur" look even remotely entertaining. Brand, who I usually like, was nothing better than annoying, and he might have been the best one in the cast. The dialog was silly in parts and completely corny in others, the premise was poorly executed, and the six people at the showing I attended never let out anything more than a slight giggle from time to time, probably out of embarrassment for the performers more than anything else.On the plus side, if my fiancé ever criticizes any of my cinematic choices, I can remind her of this tripe. That ought to put an end to that conversation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are many a billionaires we stumble upon in life. It's not often that humility is a mannerism shared or valued by a majority. In fact humility is a value that has seen its better days as society drifts out into the darkest corners of its time where I fear there will be no chance for redemption for us all. A most welcome movie to all Russell Brand Fans all over the world, an alluring revelation of an innocent, honest, warm hearted billionaire. One of those characters that are seldom seen in today's society. A man who values living life more than he values his wealth, some may distinguish this as him being immature, however it also could mean that he is one of those less corrupted adults in society in his times, it has been said that a child may enter the kingdom of god at ease in comparison to an adult, purely due to social corruption with maturity. Also did I mention he is a bit of a playboy!! Arthur however is manipulated by his mother Vivienne using his inheritance as bait. Vivienne who has never known her son since birth we presume, wishes for her only son to marry into Susan with the hopes of maintaining a positive commercial face for the great empire that Arthur values less. The British actor Russell Brand is always a hearty laugh and a great entertainer to watch. Since he came into the spotlight with "Forgetting Sarah Marshall", a wide plethora of talent seems to be oozing from within him. Russell Brand builds his character with great awe, since Vivienne's unjust request of a marriage with no love but great financial stature. Unable to stand his ground due to his innocence, he turns to his nanny; Hobson. Helen Mirren who plays Hobson has been with Arthur looking after him all his life and trying her best to keep him on the right path. What will become of Arthur and his innocent love for unlicensed tour operator Naomi Quinn (Greta Gerwig)? His inability to inflict deliberate pain on another will drive him to a solitary life or is there retribution? In Rom-Com Genres, there is always a Cruella De Vil. There has not been a Cruella on screen that I have been on a mission to hate more than Susan (Jennifer Garner). A woman who has greed for money and would even risk her body into a marriage without love just so she may get a taste of the Bach empire and its rich life and social positioning. Standing there in the other corner is Naomi Quinn (Greta Gerwig) a hard working middle class girl who is an aspiring writer who has never been given the chance nor has the confidence in herself to follow her dreams. Quite an unexpected run into Arthur changes her life, she is shown purpose to her life and is inspired to follow her dreams.Seems like a stereo type Rom ? Com to you? If this is what you are thinking as of now and you are not a fan of the works of Russell Brand, please give this movie its chance. Personally this has been one of Russell Brands better performances with a magnificent, heartwarming screen play. Whilst this is and will not a be a "Forrest Gump" today, it has plenty of laughter and rich storyline that will just give you that needed gentle tug at your heart and maybe even a tear. For all those Russell Brand fans, happy viewing, this is funny!Title: Arthur Directed by: Jason Winer Starring: Russell Brand, Jennifer Garner, Greta Gerwig, &amp; Helen Mirren Rated: PG-13 for alcohol use throughout, sexual content, language and some drug references Rating: 06/10 110 Mins</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Helen Mirren in for John Gielgud?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching on Sky Movies Premier, this was a much anticipated update for me, loving the original and thought the idea of having a nanny in the form of British Super Legend Helen Mirren in the place of that original world-weary and tart (vocally, that is!) John Gielgud.Those brought up on the inimitable Dudley Moore original will always compare this unfavourably, not least of all in that Moore was a long- standing, widely loved actor/comedian and Brand, certainly by comparison, is a cheeky new kid on the block and generally known only to a modern and youngish audience, thus limiting its appeal.Brand is actually not bad, though he occasionally lapses from the requisite clipped English into mis-pronounced key words, not often but noticeable- a small point maybe, admittedly. There is an attempt to get Russell's hair similar to Dudley's, another small point, but I noticed! Mirren as Hobson is usually very good, with some excellent comic retorts but somehow isn't as consistently funny/good as she should be. That is probably down to the writing.What does probably let down the side the most, may be the two young women in Arthur's life. Liza Minnelli is simply NOT replaceable and the chemistry generated between Brand and Greta Gerwig is tepid, whereas originally, the two (Moore &amp; Minnelli) absolutely fizzed together, sparkling more than one of Arthur's flutes of champagne.Luis Guzman IS great as the Batman 'Robin' chauffeur and there are quite a few new scenes made up specially for this film, rather than just lazily re-filming the old one.I'm not sure that the extra 13 minutes over the original is a welcome one. It doesn't have the quality of the material to keep it going for that long. My score is nearer 6.5 than 6 but 7 it is not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the first "Arthur" years ago and was a big Dudley Moore fan as a young teenager. Dudley was great in "Arthur" and "10." And thus, when this remake came about I purposely avoided it. After all - why try to top a classic? Then, one evening when absolutely nothing else of worth was on, this was just starting on HBO. So... I decided to give it a shot. And I ended up absolutely enjoying this film.I must confess to not having seen any prior Russell Brand movies nor have I seen any other movies w/ Greta Gerwig, so I went into this w/ positively no expectations. Jennifer Garner does a great job of making herself unlikeable - which is a tremendous feat for an actress that most of us adore.Helen Mirren is quite enjoyable in the role of "Nanny Hobson" and Luis Guzmán is his usual off-the-wall self as "Bitterman." But the movie comes down to two essential characters: Arthur {Brand} and Naomi {Gerwig.} And there is a chemistry between the two that translates well on the screen.I usually avoid this type of "romantic comedy" and look for deeper movies w/ much substance, but "Arthur" just hit a spot for me. I gather from the other reviews here that some people have lost that ability to allow themselves to just get swept away in a film and take it for what it is."Arthur" isn't anything that is going to change the world, but it is delightful in its own way. Who can't watch this and imagine themselves as Arthur - living life carefree and having fun w/ absolutely no concern for money? Yes - for most it is simply a fantasy - but it's also nice to have that fantasy for a couple of hours occasionally.The only thing I found disturbing about the movie is that Hollywood is so bereft of original ideas that they've turned to remaking movie after movie. Hopefully that will change, though I doubt it.All in all, I enjoyed the new "Arthur" and if you go into it w/ out expecting anything more than a brief respite from life, I imagine you will enjoy it as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good for lighthearted entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about a young alcoholic man who has to marry a woman whom he does not love, so that he can get his billion dollar inheritance from his mother."Arthur" is a lighthearted comedy about a rich young man, who is still a child at heart. He has no sense of responsibility, as he does not have to work for any of the material wealth he has. Despite his immaturity and egocentricity and childishness, Arthur is a likable character. If other comedians portray him, he would easily become irritating and even offensive. So well done to Russell Brand. The romantic comedy element is also engaging and entertaining, so I find "Arthur" a good film for brainless entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brand new Arthur</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a fan of Dudley and the original movie, I started watching this with some trepidation, probably ready to unleash criticism at the slightest weakness. You soon, however, realise that this is a completely different take on the idea and I had the feeling that everyone was perhaps trying a little too hard to be funny. There was certainly some snappy dialogue and it was a colourful, slushy experience that didn't succumb to my notoriously low boredom threshold.Overall, a lot of fun, despite some slightly nervy acting in places and a few scripting issues. Not laugh out loud like dear old Dudley, but an admirable attempt when you consider just how good the original was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was wonderful actually!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right in the beginning I'd like to point out that I have never nor will I ever compare a remake with the original because this would attract expectations and a movie is to be seen as an individual piece! What do you expect from a movie with Russel Brand? Probably not too much depth! It is a pop corn movie in some way and if you settle for that you will give this movie probably 5 points! However if you decide to let this movie sink in a little bit you either love it or hate and that is because of Russel Brand! You love him or hate him... I love him because he can pack 4 punchlines into one sentence and either you find that annoying or funny! I actually laughed a lot during this movie and I thought the cast was absolutely brilliant! Now again big words for a Pop Corn Movie but there is indeed a bit more to it! Hellen Mirren has given this film some seriousness that was unexpected and without giving too much away the relationship between Arthur and his Nanny (Helen Mirren) is the key to the story! The movie has 3 acts white the first act is a comedy, the second act a love story and the third act a drama with charming comedy the whole thing was unexpectedly good! I was surprised about Greta Gerwig playing the love interest Naomi! Usually Hollywood likes to point out by stunning looks who the one is we have to cheer for but Gerwig is just a very natural woman which was important for the plot and while it was overdrawn in almost any parts it had believable moments! The Movie clearly shows what we forget to appreciate in our daily lives. The main plot was love or money but in this remake the entire movie had a sub text to it where it is about friendship, family and the little things in live like a bowl of soup! That is mainly why I loved this movie! I saw the original, I knew how it would end so that was no bog thing but portraying Arthur as an addict was a great idea! I can't give for a comedy 10 stars but i give it proper 8 stars rating simply because it surprised me with the parallel plot! Worth to watch it and absolutely not to compare to the original which is the only way to go!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know there are several reviews stating the original is better than the remake but in my opinion this re-make was done very well. It's hobbled by the fact that it is in fact a remake and movies are being remade far too soon these days. Yes, Dudley Moore was the perfect original choice for this role, no doubt about it, but today...Russel Brand is the perfect choice Taking this movie on it's own merit it was enjoyable. I FELT for Arthur, I liked Helen Mirren's portrayal of Hobbs, I even liked that Jennifer Garner was so unlikeable.Is this movie a 10, of course it's not...but it's good entertainment, give it a chance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand all the negative reviews, while I haven't seen the original, I thought this was the best comedy I've seen this year. I couldn't stop laughing the first 30 min or so, then it slowed a bit but was very enjoyable throughout.I am really amazed at how bad critics made this out to be, thankfully I was bored enough to watch it anyway and you should too. If you don't like it, then you need to work on your sense of humor and learn to enjoy life. I'll watch the original so I can compare the two, but regardless this version is well worth the watch.As for the acting, Brand was very convincing and very funny throughout. In fact all of the characters had there moments, very well done by everyone involved. I know this isn't a great review but I just wanted let people know the truth about this movie and that is its a great movie to watch and enjoy, not critique and compare to an old original.Update: Just watched the original and all I can say is wow, are you all idiots(negative reviewers)? The new version is so much better than the original. As i stated previously I laughed seemingly non stop for the first 30 min or so, with the original I maybe chuckled twice during that period. If you ask me there is no question which is better, out with the old in with the new.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Remake of "Arthur" Lacks Art!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything that made the original "Arthur" (1981) such an appealing but politically-incorrect romantic comedy is conspicuously missing from the lackluster remake co-starring Russell Brand and Helen Mirren. Freshman director Jason Winer's slick, glossy, $40-million rehash of "Arthur" includes several hopeless changes from the original that don't improve the finished product. Moreover, Warner Brothers looks like it was banking heavily on "Arthur" to make millions because they let the producers shoehorn one of the studio's hottest, million-dollar plus properties into the plot: Batman. "Arthur" opens and closes with our irresponsible hero joy-riding through the streets of New York City in a replica of the Batmobile. Winer and "Bruno" scenarist Peter Baynham have updated the story line and sharpened the focus. Unfortunately, this overt realism detracts from what essentially was a hilarious "Cinderella" fairy tale for adults. Mind you, the chief characters--particularly the eponymous zillionaire playboy--emerge as more often obnoxious than sympathetic. The idea of casting Russell Brand in the role that Dudley Moore immortalized with his considerable wit and subtlety had some modicum of merit. After all, Moore and Brand both hail from England, and Brand is an exotic misfit. He takes himself no more seriously than Moore took himself. Sadly, the comic sensibilities that differentiate them from each other doesn't make Brand's Arthur Bach either more interesting or sympathetic. As his nanny, Helen Mirren succeeds far better than anybody in a biological role change. Meanwhile, Nick Nolte is a perfect fit as the grumpy father of the woman, Jennifer Garner, who our protagonist is fated to wed against his wishes. Baynham fails to replicate the sparkling dialogue of the original and none of the lines are quotable. When everything is said and done, "Arthur" amounts to an inferior remake and none of Brand's antics can compensate for these shortcomings.Arthur Bach (Russell Brand of "Forgetting Sarah Marshall") doesn't know the meaning of work. Indeed, Arthur has never earned a dime by the sweat of his own brow in his life. Nevertheless, he has more money to blow than most people ever dream about, and he indulges his every whim and desire with his millions. Such is Arthur's notoriety that the police are already familiar with his outrageous shenanigans. Nothing that he does surprises them. When the authorities pull over his devoted but simple-minded chauffeur, Bitterman (Luis Guzman of "Mystery Men"), at the outset of the action, they know that only Arthur has enough money to not only buy his own Batmobile replica but also careen around the streets in it. Furthermore, it comes as no surprise to them that Arthur is sloshed. Arthur rarely does anything without an alcoholic drink in his hand. Mind you, the cops catch up with Arthur not because they are better drivers, but because Bitterman and Arthur cannot handle their Batmobile. The humor here is our tipsy hero crashes into the famous statue of a huge bull on Wall Street. When Arthur tries to extricate himself from the wreckage, he finds himself wedged up against the bull's abundant scrotum.Eventually, Arthur's long-suffering mother, Vivienne (Geraldine James of "Gandhi"), who manages the family business, tires of her son's excesses and forces him to grow up. Namely, Vivience plans to deprive Arthur of his $950 million inheritance unless he bows to blackmail and marries a wealthy heiress, Susan Johnson (Jennifer Garner of "Catch and Release"), who she holds in high regard for her business acumen. Naturally, Arthur doesn't like his mother's ultimatum. Initially, he tries his hand at working. Predictably, Arthur's attempts at holding done a job at Dylan's, Gotham's most illustrious candy store end in disaster. Arthur's life-long nanny and confidante, Hobson (Helen Mirren of "Red"), believes that a trip to the altar might straighten him up. Hobson has spent most of her life picking up after Arthur and forcing his hookers and one-night stands to cough up his expensive toys and valuables than they tried to steal.Along the way, rebellious Arthur discovers penniless Naomi Quinn (Greta Gerwig of "No Strings Attached"), the woman that he has spent his entire life looking for. Naomi works as a Manhattan tour guide without a license. Indeed, like Arthur, the authorities know about her and have repeatedly warned her about her illegitimate job. In the original "Arthur," the girl of his dreams, Liza Minnelli's hard-working waitress Linda Marolla, was a shoplifter who liked to steal ties for her unemployed father. Naomi and Arthur hit it off splendidly because our hero knows how to spend big. Arthur makes a major mistake when forgets to inform Naomi about his predicament. When she learns that Arthur is about to marry Susan, Naomi washes her hands of him. It doesn't help matters that Arthur has pulled strings to get a publisher for her children's book.As remakes go, "Arthur" seems rather pointless, no matter how well Winer and Baynham have updated the protagonist's antics. Sadly, those antics are more tasteless than amusing. Worse, in an effort to differentiate themselves from the original, they have poor Arthur sober up following the Twelve-Step Alcoholics Anonymous program. Brand possesses none of the charm and wit that made the original Dudley Moore character so infectiously funny. Instead, Brand tries to convert the title character into the rock'n roll miscreant that he portrayed not only in "Forgetting Sarah Marshall" but also "Get Him to the Greek." "Arthur" fails to generate any chemistry between its leads. Brand and Mirren don't bond, and she doesn't get to deliver the acid-tipped barbs that John Gielgud in the original administered with such relish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>* out of (****)After giving such a rancid review to "The rite", making the claim that it was the worst film so far of 2011, well... 2011 has a new contender. Even going in, I knew this film was going to be atrocious from start to finish. Why see it then? Apparently my friend's fun night out consisted of buying my ticket to a movie I didn't ask to see, then having to reimburse him/her later, and eventually just seeing the damn movie. Honestly, I kept in open mind in the beginning, but this film just did not do it for me. Even in the most stale comedies, I can laugh here or there. I NEVER laughed or chuckled. Not even a heartfelt smile. I honestly sat there with the same blank expression. What's even worse is that I predicted absolutely every scene, guessed every punchline, and even knew going it what I was going to get. First of all, let's talk about the performers. Russell Brand is seriously the most irritable, pretentious actor, or at least in this film. I swear, I did not care at all about him. He didn't bring any charm or wit, he was just flat. Jennifer Garner was as equally obnoxious, but at least she didn't take up the majority of the film. As for the others? Honestly, I didn't connect to any characters. There was no development, no depth, no purpose. The characters were just there. Not to mention, this story has been told a thousand times before. Can Hollywood stop beating a dead horse? Remake or not, the script is just very uninspired. Rich, pretentious dude has to marry an equally rich, pretentious dude, but falls for an arrogant, so called "sweatheart" and doesn't care about the "money". Maybe this would be interesting had it not been projected on the screen so many times.All in all, "Arthur" is just another waste of celluloid. It isn't funny, it's not entertaining, and it's not worth seeing. Plain and simple. Had I not been forced to see this movie, trust me, I wouldn't have. If you MUST see it, please just rent the original. It's probably better than this movie. All I'm glad is that 2011 so far has had only two stinkers, or at least I've seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Was this remake horrible? No, but it also wasn't that great. In only a couple of scenes did this film lift itself above mediocrity. In comparing this update to the 1981 version, the original is simply better on every point. Russell Brand is probably the best choice they could make for the lead, but he doesn't measure up to Dudley Moore's Arthur. And the wonderful Helen Mirren does her best, but she just can't match John Gielgud's witty portrayal of Hobson. The writing fell particularly short of the mark. The one bright spot for me was Greta Gerwig, whom I had not previously seen. She did a fine job of making a thinly-written character become real. I look forward to seeing her in the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arthur (Russell Brand) is an irresponsible drunken playboy. His mother Vivienne (Geraldine James) is fed up and forces him to marry proper and sensible Susan (Jennifer Garner). He can't stand her. The only person in his corner is his caretaker Hobson (Helen Mirren). One day, he meets free spirit Naomi (Greta Gerwig).This is weak remake of Arthur(1981) staring Dudley Moore. Russell Brand is childish but just isn't childlike. That's mainly what's missing from this version. The joy and the childlike innocence is gone. Greta Gerwig is cute but she's way too quiet. There isn't much of a spark between the leads. The chemistry is questionable. Helen Mirren is an interesting choice for Hobson, and she does a fine job. Without the fun of the original, there isn't much here.</fullReview>

The cinematography is wonderful. The movie suffered in its casting. While Russell Brand was terrific, as was Helen Mirren,it was odd to see Hobson portrayed as a woman, and called by her last name. The Naomi character left me absolutely cold. I didn't buy that there could be any attraction between the two, and that, to me, was what ruined the experience. The humor, as with the original, was pithy and smart. Apparently, however, it is not everyone's cup of tea. All in all, a fun and terrific little movie, just missing being a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charmless unfunny remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilt heir to a large family conglomerate Arthur (Russell Brand) was largely brought up by his nanny Hobson (Helen Mirren), who even though the rich brat is already deep in his thirties nurtures his every need. Meanwhile his business-oriented mother Vivienne (Geraldine James), detached from her son and holding a very official, emotionless connection, attempts to persuade her only son to take a more responsible role. Threatening him with losing his inheritance and access to money, Arthur is forced into marriage with rigid and ruthless corporate exec Susan Johnson (Jennifer Garner). Unable to envisage a life without his private Batmobile and endless parties, Arthur decides to enter into this prearranged commitment. However the plot thicken, when the aimless playboy inadvertently falls for the lively and independent-minded Naomi Quinn (Greta Gerwig)...Russell Brand attempts his best to channel the inner-English affability, but all too often he finds himself immersed into the running joke, instead of the character. Lacking depth and waves of charm which made the original Dudley Moore such a memorable success, Brand focuses mostly on being spoilt, unsociable and devoid of a sense of moral fibre. The script isn't of help, basically flattening the emotional side of Arthur, instead playing around with various juvenile pranks and jokes, mostly adding hints of insincerity to the character. Arthur's fling in Naomi has an amiable screen presence, but again lacks a clearly defined role, lingering instead as a Amelia-wannabee with pointless inner-turmoil.The lack of credible front-line actors even more highlights what is a unchallenged performance by the always infallible Helen Mirren, who serves with aplomb as Arthur's surrogate mother, the sole purpose while the ending delivers emotional punch with the key sub-plot, however lessened by the lost child Russell Brand, who doesn't really now in which direction he should channel he character. "Arthur" isn't entirely unlikeable, mostly thanks to the supporting cast, but somewhat pointless given the eternal power of the original. However something obviously is wrong, if the only thing that partially works in a comedy is the dramatic side - the movie honestly does not even invoke a single half-hearted smile (a stark contrast to the 1981 film).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit, when I saw this movie, I was expecting next to nothing. I was wrong. I agree, Russel Brand is no Dudley Moore. (I mean, come on, nobody else could have played such an iconic character.) But the Arthur had a good story. Here, Russel Brand's Arthur is far more reckless than Dudley Moore's Arthur. (To the point that Russell Brand's Arthur get arrested.) Jennifer Garner's portrayal of Susan is far more extreme than the original. Here, Susan isn't just some spoiled rich girl, who is somewhat clueless, but rather this Susan is a gold digger. And then there's Hobson, played by Helen Mirren. As it is, I love Helen Mirren, (Excalibur, 2010, etc.) I loved the way she played the part as a stern, yet compassionate mother figure to Arthur. While this movie is in no way better than the original, I think that this is one of the better remakes as of late. (Way better than Clash of the Titans.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Nearly As Bad As You Think, Actually Kind of Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arthur (Russell Brand) is your typical man-child. A twenty (or thirty) something, he acts more like an eight year old and everyone treats him accordingly. The only difference between Arthur and the typical Will Ferrell character is that Arthur is filthy rich, the heir to a business conglomerate and the fortune that comes with it. He lives in a New York high rise with his chauffeur/friend, Bitterman (Luis Gonzalez) and his nanny, Hobson (Helen Mirren), and spends his days terrorizing the police in his Batmobile and buying ridiculous things at auction (like the suit Abraham Lincoln died in, which he then wears). His carefree life is put to the test, however, when his mother, Vivienne (Geraldine James) decides she's had it with his embarrassments. She offers Arthur a choice: marry Susan (Jennifer Garner), an ambitious woman who Arthur hates or lose his claim to the family money. Complicating his decision is Naomi (Greta Gerwig), a lower class free spirit that Arthur has become infatuated with. With limited time available, Arthur must grow up quickly and figure out what it is that truly makes him happy.Arthur had three strikes against it going in: 1. The trailer is horrendous, the type of "advertisement" that sandbags its intended beneficiary before viewers even step into a theater. It's almost as if the studio purposefully picked out the most annoying parts of the movie to include in the trailer. Ouch. 2. I'm not a fan of Brand and I've never understood his charm. To be fair, Get Him to the Greek (and his performance in particular) grows on me every time I happen to catch a part of it on HBO but everything else he's ever done has left me unimpressed. 3. I, like almost everyone else in the world who does not work in Hollywood, am against unnecessary remakes. No one wanted a new Arthur. NO ONE.But for all the negatives coming in, I confess I quite enjoyed my time with Arthur. The entire movie is one absurdity after another, to be sure, but I had fun regardless. Arthur operates within a vacuum in which it creates its own environment and sets its own rules(a New York in which everyone treats Arthur the way a small town would treat a pre-teen in the 1950s) almost like you'd see in a fantasy or sci-fi film. More importantly, the film holds to that environment and those rules and this sort of total escapism serves it well. From a comedy standpoint, too, you could do a lot worse than Arthur. It's all very juvenile, of course, but when you're in the right mood and the jokes are plentiful, sometimes easy jokes are the best kind. Arthur is filled to the brim with those and I laughed more than I would have ever dreamed coming in.As far as the performances go, I suppose you couldn't really call what Brand does "acting" since he is basically portraying a cartoon-like version of himself. But what he manages to do with Arthur as opposed to some of his other characters is to make him extremely likable and sympathetic, much more so than I would have thought possible given that he is a selfish, wealthy, immature man-child. I did not expect to root for Arthur but I did, in large part due to the healthy amount of heart that Brand infuses him with. Arthur is a good person who just doesn't really know how to be a good person and while his redemption isn't the same as what you might get from a drunk (like the original Arthur), it is nonetheless appreciated. Mirren, too, is solid. Now, I have no idea why in the name of The Queen she took this role but since she does bring an element of respectability to Arthur that the film definitely benefits from. She and Brand develop a fun relationship throughout the course of the film and she serves as a quality straight man to Brand's ridiculousness. Their underplayed dynamic is what makes Arthur work and what keeps it from becoming the disaster that I anticipated at the outset.Check out my reviews at ieatfilms.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anachronistic Character Sketch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the sixties there were many cinematic attempts to focus on weird character, like Morgan or A Thousand Clowns. Arthur belongs in this group. And I think it would have been a better film if it stuck to that time period. Then top hats on hippies had sparkle, but now it seems like an embarrassment, so needy. But Arthur is not then but now. Secondly, I think he is a little too obnoxious, a kind of even less likable Tiny Tim. I didn't find him a sympathetic character. Still, it is a generally watchable film, it does take you efficiently along for the ride. None of these movies really had much of a message anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>by a worth watching movie i'm really being unfair to this title and i will tell you whybefore i watch movies i always like to check the great database we have here called IMDb.com its helpful sometimes. :)so after i checked and found out it was a Remake and it have low Ratings I've felt bad and i decided to put low hopes into it and watch 5-10 minutes and then decide whether to continue or look for another one.and the 5-10 minutes turn to be 25 minutes of joy and laughter, yes that's what the movie makes me feel " and at that moment I've decided to make a review to encourage people to watch it and this was my first review. but not until i finish the movie no i couldn't stop watching and write a review because i knew it's going to be a LONG review!now talking about the acting i will start with Arthur "Russell Brand" which blows my mind with his amazing acting skills and his funny lines he kept saying the whole movie. one line i liked from Russel Brand was: when Hobson searching in the purse of Tiffany she found Arthur watch in there Tiffany said Arthur oh. look i don't know how that got in there, i don't know Arthur. Arthur replays: its probably one of those mysteries that will never be discovered! JFK, who nicked my watch.. also i have to say Tifffany "Christina Calph" was great in this very short part.now about Hobson "Helen Mirren" well she is a wonderful women and great actress and made this movie as wonderful as she is with her funny/smart lines and stable- high acting skills..one of the Hobson (Helen Mirren) lines was to Evander and Arthur after punching Arthur she says: Burt Johnson 3:00. "Evander, if he's not out of this ring in one minute, i'll bite your other ear off. LOL is Evander Holyfield in this movie so Hobson can tell him this? well if yes this part totally worth playing and FYI "Evander Holyfield is who mike Tyson bit his ear" did u know that? well i didn't know and its good to know :)and i will end this review with the beautiful Naomi Quinn "Greta Gerwig" who wore the part Perfectly.as the rest of the cast thank you for being in this movie you made it beautiful and a worth watching :)to the readers thanks for you're time and i hope this review was helpful for you. watch the movie and enjoy :)</fullReview>

Arthur's character is well played by brand who can be so immature at times, yet is also forced to deal with a lot of emotions and eventually becomes a better man by going through things. the connection between Arthur and Naomi couldn't have been more perfect, what a refreshing actress she is compared to the cookie cutter model type in most movies. oh and it made me laugh a few times, especially when he gets in the gummy bear suit! lol</fullReview>

		<fullReview>don't get me wrong - it's not classic cinema, it's not groundbreaking in any way shape or form... but i really don't get why people are coming down so hard on this. predictable? well, yeah, i mean obviously you can assume the boy will get the girl, grow up a little in the process, etc etc. BUTa) the laughs were pretty constant, i had even had to pause the DVD a couple times to catch the last line cause i was laughing right through itb) the dialog was totally witty, the actors i thought played well off each other, and i don't know how much was written and how much was improv, but there was lots of spark and sparklec) i don't know which original arthur you guys saw, but i thought the one that came out 20 years ago and it was pretty bland - more so than the remake if you ask me. funny to see all the reverence to the original version now, at the time it came out i remember it getting blasé reviews, and neither my friends nor my parents liked it at all (or anyone else i knew for that matter)long story short, if you just need a pleasant, upbeat and funny rom com that will make you laugh consistently for an hour (and you like russell brandt at all) you could do much worse than renting Arthur (2011)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Premise is simple, Wealthy child like playboy who isn't Dudley Moore, stands to lose his wealth if he doesn't marry the woman his mother chose for him. Worse still, he's falling in love with a fake tour guide....It was positive from the word go, seeing as i Haven't seen the original, and i happened to come across 'on the rocks' on TV not so long ago.I thought it was going to be a disaster, seeing the poor reviews and box office, but amazingly, I found a pleasing and quite endearing movie and titular character.It's more or less the Brand and Mirren show here, and they have such a ball on screen, that it's impossible not to like when they are both on screen.It may be a pointless remake, and the supporting cast (notably Garner, Nolte, James, and Guzman) are wasted in an awful way, but hey are just filler for the forth-comings of Arthur. It's not laugh out loud funny and very predictable, but for Brand, he shows he isn't just a flash in the pan, and can play more than a Rock Star or Ironic 'cockney' comedian.Mirren is great and plays the straight (wo)man to Brands little child. There are great references to other films and it all looks great, but if you don't think of Moore, or the fact that this is pretty cheesy stuff, it's a good movie to take your mind off the real world for a while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Less of the bitter drunk, more of the irrepressible man-child... Surprisingly, it worked, for me!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Full disclosure: I must be one of the only people in the known universe who DIDN'T like the original - so if you come to this update with an affection for its progenitor, then I can well understand you hating it, and dismissing my opinion... However, if like me you're one of the rare breed who senses potential for improvement, then you might just be well satisfied!Part of the problem with the 1981 version for me was that I couldn't shake the feeling that I was watching Dudley Moore kill himself, on screen... The character of Arthur (and indeed, maybe Dudley himself... ) seemed to drink to hide an inexhaustible sadness, and all of his hijinks were just a way for him to feel not so alone... Some of you out there may be the type of viewers who like that kind of pathos, but I just found it tragic, and it made me uncomfortable that we were being encouraged to cheer on an individual in slow decline.In this new film, Brand still drinks - but this time it feels more like an accompaniment to the silliness, than the very fuel that propels it... Arthur here is someone who refuses to grow up, but not because it appears that he's running away from anything; rather, it appears that he's just having too darn good a time... and I found that playfulness infectious.Brand, of course, can play the cheeky cad with his eyes shut, since that seems incredibly close to his real-life persona... and Gerwig is a nice foil for him as the centred yet dreamy girl who gradually makes him want to assume responsibility.Mirren uncovers yet another angle to an otherwise familiar role; stern and motherly as opposed to put-upon, like the previous Hobson... With some terrific one-liners from Peter Baynham (who has yet to write a bad comedy... ) this feels altogether lighter and sweeter than the established classic with the decidedly melancholic undertone... Maybe I'm naive and sentimental, but consciously and knowingly living in a fantasyland works for me... In truth, it's just more fun there.The only thing I genuinely do miss is the theme from Christopher Cross!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than Good. I Loved It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A darling movie. I'm a huge fan of Helen Mirren and Russell Brand's chemistry in any setting. To cast Mirren as the long-suffering but devoted caretaker of Brand's Arthur was a clever move, and it pays off in some great scenes between the two. This film was unfairly criticized, in my opinion, for not being "as good as the original." The original is dated, and most of it's appeal is nostalgic. I remember seeing it in theaters and enjoying it far more then, than I do now. I have seen this version of Arthur several times, as it was in heavy rotation for several weeks. I kept returning to it, time and again, with affection. For me, that is the sign of a good film. There is a distinct LACK of discomfort here, whereas the Dudley Moore characterization seems more and more like a portrait of a very sick man, who was most likely going to die of cirrhosis within a few weeks of finding his one true love. I remember finding him depressing, even after my first viewing. I worried about those two, and was not altogether sure they would make it after all.... This movie was slammed way too hard for reasons I have yet to see for myself. I expected not to like it, based on the reviews. I was shocked to find that I liked it from the start, and it just kept getting better. If you like Russell Brand at all, give this film a chance. It might just be a most pleasant surprise for you. I am awfully glad I took the time to screen this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dudley Moore &amp; Steve Gordon are rolling in their own graves.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the original Arthur it was about an alcoholic millionaire with a youthful spirit and knows how to make others laugh. He ends up with a hard decision to either agree to marry a woman in a prearranged marriage and keep his fortune, or don't marry the woman and have his money cut off. The entire movie was filled with clever humor, great characters, and a well written script that made it a classic from the 80's. 30 years later, they decided to remake it only to borrow the plot and throw out every thing out the window.When it comes to remakes, they either do as well as the original, or it falls flat and is viewed as being inferior to the older version. The first minute watching it was a real intolerance and that's never a good thing if I don't enjoy the film right away. I am going to examine the changes they made to the characters, because I never felt this ashamed towards a remake in my whole life! First let's talk about Arthur in this remake, in the original he was short stature, likes to make jokes that do make you at least chuckle and is a real pleasure to have at any party if he existed in real life. The remake's Arthur is nothing compared to the one portrayed by Dudley Moore. Russell Brand does no justice to the role, he is way too tall, was never funny, and was way too obnoxious to be likable in anyone's standards. Could they not of casted a shorter actor for the part? Martin Freeman would of been a better choice, he had the right height and would of done the part of Arthur justice. Russell on the other hand made Arthur look like someone who requires medication to settle down. I know Arthur was meant to be drunk, but at least the original Arthur was at a steady level when intoxicated. This Arthur does stunts that look like they belong in a slapstick comedy. There was no advise on how Russell could of done differently for the part, he was just the wrong choice to start with. The moment he was casted, the film was already ruined.Now to talk about Hobson, who was the most drastically changed character for this remake. In the original Hobson was a male butler, in this film Hobson is a female nanny. The sex change on the character isn't the issue, its the idea of Arthur having a nanny to take care of him. He's like about 30, so having a nanny still take care of you at that age makes Arthur look more pathetic. Hobson in the original was perfect the way he was, if the character isn't broken don't fix it! There was a great chemistry between Hobson &amp; Arthur in the original because despite him not being keen on Arthur's behavior, he does care for him and provided good support. In this film you do see moments between Arthur and his now female nanny, but it doesn't feel right to me. It doesn't feel realistic, imagine if Bruce Wayne had a nanny instead of Alfred for a butler? Would you say that would be normal or that Bruce has personal issues? I'm sure we can all agree that having a butler is more cool than having a nanny. Even Lara Croft had a butler for crying out loud!Now for the discussion on one more character that is wrong for this remake? Remember how Arthur fell in love with the spunky Linda Marolla in the original? Well she's no where to be found in this remake. They had the nerve to replace her with a woman who is no where as likable as Linda: Naomi Quinn. She is a typical cliché love interest found in every average chick flick. She doesn't even try to be Linda's replacement, because of how much of an opposite she is. The romance between her and Arthur was so unreal that I would have a hard time believing any woman in real life would find the remake's Arthur to be "attractive". Arthur &amp; Linda's relationship was better in the original because that Arthur would be able to attract women compared to the remake's example.In conclusion, this remake is disgusting and has no right to be titled Arthur at all. Cause Russell Brand made Arthur an unlovable dolt who you wish you're able to beat up in a back alley until he is bruised all over and has to eat throw a straw for one month. The director turn it into a mediocre chick flick which it isn't. If you don't understand the concept of the original then you have a box office bomb waiting to blow up. The actors weren't doing their best at all and not a single one of them looked like they were enjoying their performances. I was glad that the film receive two Razzie nominations for worst actor and remake though it would of been awesome if the film won either category. The fact the film only made 30 million at the box office is proof that the public knew it was a lost cause to begin with. I just pray that will mean there will be no remake to Arthur 2 cause I'd hate to see how they'd mess up Fairchild in a remake. If you haven't seen the original, check it out, because it worth your time as oppose to this abomination that will rot into obscurity for the greater good of mankind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ah, remakes &amp; sequels, Hollywood's mixed bag, this one has its moments but fails to impress</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arthur (Russell Brand) is as rich as they come, being the sole heir to a fortune built by his late father's very successful conglomeration. Yet, he is an alcoholic and a skirt-chaser supreme, going from party to bedroom to party again. The only person to stand by him and clean up the messes he creates is his longtime nanny, Hobson (Helen Mirren) who has been with him since childhood. In contrast, he has little contact with his actual, widowed mother (Geraldine James) who still runs the company. This is by choice. However, because Arthur is supposedly the one who will eventually helm the biz, his continual antics are scaring the stock holders more and more. So, mama lays down the law. Either Arthur marries a bright, rising businesswoman in their corporation, Susan (Jennifer Garner) or he will be cut off without a penny. Susan actually wants the wedding herself, for she fancies becoming the CEO in the near future. Needless to say, Arthur hates the idea but loves his money. Things get even more complicated when Art meets a penniless young beauty, Naomi (Greta Gerwig) who does inspire him to be a better person and who makes his heart go flippety-flop. Yet, a marriage to this struggling artist would result in the same excommunication. What's a poor little rich boy, er, man to do? Ah, the Hollywood remake rears its somewhat not-so-handsome head again. The original Arthur, with Dudlay Moore, Sir John Gielgud and Liza Minelli is still a funny charmer. Gielgud took home that famous golden statuette for his surprising comic turn, after a lifetime of more serious work. Here, the cast is fine as well, with Brand, Mirren, Garner, Gerwig, Nick Nolte, James, Luis Guzman and more. Brand could be viewed as the weakest link of the crew, for he is sometimes comical, sometimes annoying. But, alas, although they all try hard and are talented professionals, the material is not as funny or charming as the original. That's a shame, for the film looks great, with notable art direction, sets, costumes, et cetera. If you are stuck at home on the weekend, singing along to Sam Cooke's famous "Another Saturday Night and I Ain't Got Nobody", this film is okay entertainment. But, what kind of endorsement is that, really?</fullReview>

Clever scripting and naturalistic acting lend a very human warmth to over-the-top characters.The key to the film is this warmth, and that's why I give it high marks. It doesn't simply try to make us laugh at the Wacky Briton or be shocked by his consumptive lifestyle. It explores the nuances of affection, anarchy, and loss in a lively and caring way.Don't see it expecting "shocking raw comedy by a bad boy" and it should go over much smoother. It's really a very simple film and doesn't pretend to be a challenger for "Get Him to the Greek" or a great romance, but it achieves poignancy and entertainment, which was good enough for me.</fullReview>

He begins to reconsider, however, after he meets the like-minded Naomi (Greta Gerwig).With help from his chauffeur (Luis Guzman) and nanny (Helen Mirren), Arthur betters himself. But with his wedding nuptials approaching, he is torn between family duty and his heart's desire.While it is a remake of the 1981 film, this Arthur stands on its own as an enjoyable and endearing comedy.Fortunately, if he ever does become destitute, Arthur will already have the accompanying alcohol abuse down pat.

		<shortDescription>Arthur was a surprisingly good movie -- thoroughly enjoyed it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had no preconceived notions about this movie, other than I like Russel Brand as an actor, absolutely love Helen Mirren in anything she's done, and like Jennifer Garner for the most part.This movie surprised me. I loved the original, although I haven't seen it in several years, but saw it back in about 1987 or so and loved it then too. This "remake" is more of a reworking, I think. Russel Brand adds his own style and class to it, and it's that much better for it. I immediately felt connected with his character, Helen Mirren's character (Hobson) as the stuffy English nanny who is gruff on the outside but loves Arthur deeply on the inside even if she doesn't always show it. Greta Gerwig, who plays Arthur's love interest, is absolutely charming in a quirky, goofy, sweet kind of way, and I absolutely adored her in this role. The chemistry between her and Arthur is believable and interesting to watch. Loved every minute of it.Jennifer Garner is one of those actresses that I really like in some roles, and don't really care for in others. She's not really supposed to be likable in this movie, but I found myself strangely attracted to her. I think she pulled off the psychotic-power/money hungry bitch-demon from hell role quite well, actually, and thought she and her character added a much-needed dimension to the movie. As for Nick Nolte's character (her father), I could have done without him. I like Nick, but thought this role was unneeded and a little disturbing, and I felt like it would have been a better movie without him. Sorry, Nick.Overall, the comedy in this movie works wonders. I laughed at most of the jokes, and I was thoroughly entertained by the three main characters' interactions and their blossoming relationships. Every minute was believable and enjoyable. I even liked the chauffeur's character, played by Luis Guzman, and like him in pretty much everything he does. He's just funny and entertaining to watch on screen.Overall, I highly recommend this movie. I was surprisingly mesmerized by the whole thing, and I will definitely watch it again, probably several times. It's really, really sad at one point, and I can't remember the last time I cried watching a movie. I just don't do that, and this one has a particularly poignant and touching scene that left me watery-eyed.Just a good, funny, entertaining movie all around with lovable characters and good story. I don't require much else from my movies, so I give it 9 out of 10 stars and loved it. Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoy the movie as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring and sad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though, I wasn't really a fan of the original, it did have the greatest comic drunk in Dudley Moore. This however, proves that funny drunks can only be portrayed on The Simpsons. It's also a little sad to see Helen Mirren in this kind of material. She actually said on the Blu-Ray Extras that she thought the director was good because he let the actors ad-lib a lot. What the hell is that? As it looks to me, this film chucked out all that supposedly ad-libbed material and made this into the standard romantic comedy. There are a few scenes with witty banter between Brand's Arthur and Greta Gerwig's Naomi but the rest is a crashing bore.Another thing is the storyline about the arranged marriage. The mother's motivation for fixing Arthure up with the Jennifer Garner character feels absolutely false. She would almost immediately get him to be a worse drunk than he was before.As for the comedy, there is absolutely not a single line that gives you more than a mild chuckle. I don't know why the usually reliant Luis Guzman dropped his heavy accent here either. Yes, he does play virtually the same guy every film he's in but I almost missed it here. Here he just seems to waiting to cash in.I don't usually give all out negative comments like this one, but this film looks like it wasted a huge amount of money to remake a film that wasn't that good in the first place. To the director: Please try to come up with an original at some point and to the actors: don't give praise to a director who lets you loose and then makes you boring.</fullReview>

Arthur's alcoholism never really comes across as an obstacle here. The drink makes his life more fun and challenging for those around him. Arthur here is a child, and is constantly supervised by Helen Mirren. Brandt deserves some credit for this role. He plays his normal self for the majority of it, but he is able to pull at the correct heartstrings now and then. His relationship with Mirren is beautifully played, and there's a line at the end which is simply fantastic. It does stretch itself out to an unwelcome length with ridiculous scenario after ridiculous scenario. Never dull, sometimes very funny, and sometimes very moving. Doesn't sound like it matches the classic status of the original, but I'll just have to wait and see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a few years people will not be so harsh in their reviews, and this movie will stand the test of time. Whereas the original displayed the acting talents of Moore &amp; Gielgud, this remake stands out because the plot moves along quickly and plausibly as far as comedies are concerned.This movie emphasized the negative aspects of alcohol abuse and the movie made me feel happy that the protagonist chose to become sober. I'm glad this movie updated the story with a sophisticated plot and better acting (and better script) than the original. Whereas Gielgud was condescending and pompous, Mirren was genuinely caring. Whereas Moore was a cackling idiot, full of slurring speech and slapstick humour, Brand was articulate and portrayed a sympathetic character with low self esteem. I found Brand's drunken portrayal more believable than Moore's because Russell's alcoholic behaviour remained functional and fairly cognisant even while under the influence. This is what classic alcoholics do - they behave as normal as possible even while drunk. Also Moore's drunken character was an eccentric insecure superficial simpleton who was afraid of being alone. I also found the love-at-first- sight aspect more believable in this movie than in the original when Dudley meets Liza in a department store. Russell meets Greta at Grand Central Station and pursues her to fend off the police and get a chance to meet her. I also felt Minelli was miscast in her role in the original because there was no on-screen chemistry between her and Moore. Moore's Arthur describes her as beautiful in the store but there was nothing beautiful about Liza Minelli in a bright red cowboy hat and yellow jacket. I found Russell and Greta's dates at Grand Central and Central Park very charming. I also found the wedding scene hilarious with Brand slowly undressing himself as he walked away from Jennifer Garner. This version was more entertaining and a lot less boring than the original Arthur.</fullReview>

Having watched the travesties that have been pawned off as movies this year this movie was a very refreshing change of pace, for one thing it wasn't entirely predictable, secondly I thought the wit in this movie was spot on, not to mention the fact that it was actual intellectual humor which lets face it is nearly extinct.This movie is about a lavishly wealthy playboy whose antics are only exceeded by his ability to guzzle anything that has high proof content. While at a black tie event his mother(the primary holder of his estate and fortune) loses very important clients due to his public embarrassment once again. Having had enough of his disappointing and out of control lifestyle she gives him an ultimatum to either marry a woman the he truly appalls or lose his entire estate, after a considerable 15 seconds of consideration he chooses marriage, in the course of his engagement he meets another woman, one of remarkable dazzle and down to earth plainness, he of course is immediately infatuated with her.

For most people would not have watched the original especially when the time frame between the two films is over 20 years.IF you can go past the main character, the film is charming, honest, has for the most part a smarter script than you average girl's comedy film, a nice chicks film.

		<fullReview>What an amazing, not-great movie.This movie fires on all cylinders, but unfortunately not all in the same direction.The story is light hearted and entertaining. The cast all transcend their roles and show off what smart people in broad movie roles can achieve if they work and have talent. The script is occasionally very clever. But above all, there is actual legitimate TRUTH and ROMANCE in this film. Everyone's motivation and personalities are believable, even amid the farce of the plot.The biggest problem of the film stems from it being a remake that keeps unnecessary elements for no reason. The biggest culprit is the biggest element of the film, which is that Brand portrays a drunk. I suppose there was a certain irony in casting Brand in the role, but the irony play out in that Brand does not play a convincing comedic drunk. Except for the scenes in which they take great care to demonstrate his possessing alcohol, one would forget that he even IS drunk. The greatest offense is that it is unnecessary. The alcoholic elements play into the film in order to justify Arthur's selfish excess. But many films have been made in the past 30 years with the same conceit minus the alcohol. Adam Sandler, perhaps, has most solidified our ability to believe in the man-child without the plot device of alcohol to buoy the concept. I would very much recommend this movie. It's clever, inoffensive and showcases a great deal of original wit from Brand and Mirren who are both so lovable that every second of screen time is a joy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to turn a classic into a flop.. Just add Russell Brand.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm unsure why Russell Brand was cast in this role, yes he's English but he's not the lovable character Dudley Moore manufactured in the original film, nor could I warm to him. The moment you see Duddly Moore in the original film his energy just pulls you in and you really want him to find love and happiness. I couldn't give two hoots about sleezy Russell Brand.The original film was beautifully crafted and each character played a part that screamed 'classic', John Gielgud steals many a scene with tremendous delivery and typically 'dry' British wit that ties the whole film into such a wonderful package.Sadly the sloppy false bravado that Russell Brand throws out makes him seem arrogant and unlikeable.This 'reboot' of a truly great film should be quickly forgotten and the smile return when you put the original DVD on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch the Original Instead.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arthur (2011): Dir: Jason Winer / Cast: Russell Brand, Helen Mirren, Greta Gerwig, Jennifer Garner, Nick Nolte: Remake of the successful 1981 hit starring Dudley Moore as the lovable drunk. This time out it is Russell Brand as the rich playboy who squanders his money on excessive drinking and carrying on. Central plot regards his riches under threat when his mother arranges that he marry a snobby wealthy woman, played by Jennifer Garner whose intentions are to get his signature and increase her wealth and position. Director Jason Winer is backed by colourful locations but unlike the original, the humour is completely drained. The first problem is that Brand plays Arthur more as a big kid who hasn't grown up, while the alcoholism that made Moore so funny is a distant thought. He attempts to find work but fails. He wants out of this arranged marriage and finds solitude in a tour guide. None of this is interesting and Brand can merely recite. Helen Mirren plays his nanny in a role that was played by John Gielgud in the original, only he was a butler. Mirren is a good actress but she travels predictable grounds here, particularly when health issues surface. Greta Gerwig has the thankless role as potential mate in a role Liza Minnelli played well in the original. Gerwig's role is as straight forward as it can get. Garner starts out fine as the snide fiancée but she quickly becomes standard issue especially since we know the wedding won't happen. Nick Nolte plays her father who will becomes Arthur's nemesis. It is not a career highlight for Nolte but more like a terrible joke. Dreadful remake that is enough to drive a person to drinking. Score: 3 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Russell Brand is so funny...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to start this review by saying, not a lot of people liked this movie, because of the fact that this is a remake of the 1981, so-called "classic". I have never actually seen the original, but I have seen the trailer, and it didn't make me want to watch it at all. Russell Brand is so funny as Arthur, a man who has had everything handed to him on a silver platter. Or to be more accurate, a gold platter encrusted with diamonds and ruby's. One day, he actually has to get a job, which is just so hilarious. This movie is quite good, in my opinion. It could have been funnier, and it they could have not killed Hobson. That kind of sucked.Overall, I give this episode a 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A remake of the 1981 film by the same name, 'Arthur' is a Decent remake, of a much superior original. Its got its share of charming moments &amp; also good performances, working to its advantage. 'Arthur' Synopsis: A drunken playboy stands to lose a wealthy inheritance when he falls for a woman his family doesn't like.'Arthur', in comparison to the original, falls short. Reason? The wit and the overall story-telling isn't as impressive or arresting, but luckily, this remake isn't bland or boring. Its a fair entertainer.Peter Baynham's Screenplay is mostly well-done, but not full-proof. Jason Winer's Direction is satisfactory. Cinematography &amp; Editing are passable. Art Design is impressive. Performance-Wise: Russell Brand as Arthur, delivers a likable performance. Helen Mirren is superb. Her sequences with Brand, are delightful. Greta Gerwig is charming. Jennifer Garner is in terrific form. She nails it as the vamp. But The Talented Nick Nolte is wasted in an insignificant role. On the whole, 'Arthur' is an ideal lazy Sunday afternoon watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Plot) An alcoholic playboy stands to lose his inheritance if he doesn't manage to marry Susan Johnson (Garner) But Arthur falls for someone else instead, and things get chaoticI've seen both Arthur's, and I've actually managed to enjoy both of them. That's rare for me because it's usually the other way around, meaning I like the original, and wind up detesting the remake. Remakes are becoming very superfluous these days, but I couldn't help but enjoy this one. That cast was so much fun to watch, and they really did care about making sure the audience had a good time. It has its fair share of surprises, and also some big time laughs as well. I groaned when I heard Russell Brand was taking over for Dudley Moore, but he wound up surprising me by giving a fun performance. The real star of this movie is Helen Mirren, though. It was already entertaining without her, but she took the entertainment up a notch whenever she was on screen. Greta Gerwig was charming, whilst Jennifer Garner played the clingy love interest to a T.Final Thoughts: If you enjoyed the original Arthur, there is no reason you can't like this one as well, at least in my opinion. Give it a chance. It's pretty entertaining, and I recommend it7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You're drunk again Arthur...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a romantic comedy, then "Arthur" is a pretty straight run of the mill. Fairly generic storyline, that is predictable to the core, as is with most movies in this genre.The comedy used in the movie is great and right to the point. Lots of hilarious moments, dialogue and situations, and as such, the movie really delivers right on.The storyline, as generic as it is, is about a rich and drunk playboy named Arthur who is to marry a corporate woman, as requested by his estranged mother. If he fails to do so, he will have his multi million dollars stripped from his good name. However, Arthur is caught between having to please his mother and marry the woman he doesn't love, or follow his heart and go to the woman whom he loves honestly and truly, and thus say good bye to his million dollar lifestyle.I will say that the people they had hired for the various jobs did good work with their given characters. But personally, it is a bit too strained by now to watch Russell Brand play yet another alcoholic rich guy, it is wearing a bit thin already. The movie was so well carried by the performance of Helen Mirren."Arthur" is a good and entertaining movie. However, if you are the least bit familiar with the romantic comedy genre, then you will not find anything new or remarkably innovating in this movie. But still, "Arthur" entertains at all the right moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arthur is a study of excess.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arthur is a study of excess. Well, I suppose it's also a study in access, and many people get those two homophones confused, so I guess everyone wins this time. But my original point is that everything in this movie, including the very filming of it, is extravagantly wasteful. See, we already had a film called Arthur. It was a long time ago, so I'm sure you could be forgiven for not knowing this is a remake. Alas, here we are, presenting a comedy featuring Russell Brand playing the role he was born to play. And play. And play.Not content enough with simply being Alduous Snow in both Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Get Him to the Greek (the latter of which is insanely hilarious), here Brand plays the title-character man child with lots of money and no responsibility. Eventually, he gets to the point where he has to marry a horse played by Jennifer Gardner, not for love, but for business. Conveniently, he falls in love with the film's saving grace, Naomi. Greta Gerwig, along with Helen Mirren, but honestly, does that woman NEED any more accolades at this point, provided me much needed grounding in all the chaos created in Brand's wake.His style of comedy is best described as throwing as much insanity at the wall until something sticks. That works well with good writing, less so when recreating a character that was nominated for an Academy Award. Yes, I recognize that there is very little here that is carried over from the original, and that's not even really my point. My point is again excess. The storyline contains it: billionaire heir throwing gobs of money around in a failed attempt at making himself happy. And so does Brand's acting. It's funny up until the point when it just becomes too much.While there are glimpses of heart: a truly charming relationship between Arthur and his help, or perhaps a few fleeting moments when romance wins over exuberance, the film is essentially in love with itself. And we're left just kind of trying to string together good memories brought about from selected funny bits. None of which include shots of Russell Brand in his underwear.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>English accents are subdued for American audiences</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved every minute of this modern version of "Arthur." We're living in the present and wouldn't think of judging it by the 30 year old film. This link is 4 minutes long, and is an interview done by IMDb with Russell Brand on the subj. of his movie "Arthur" 2011.http://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi3369245977/Helen Mirren, always by his side, has been his nanny since birth, and Luis Guzman plays his chauffeur, so he is not a drunk driver even though he is drinking in the first half of the movie. He goes to AA, which is not a spoiler; it just makes the movie doable! Think of being so rich that you give someone $10K to let you wear their costume for one hour; it is this sort of wild unimaginable mischief that makes this movie for me. Also, that Russell Brand is an adorable guy, skinny, tall 6'3" with dark wavy hair.If you have trouble with English accents, this movie is edited for American audiences; only Russell and Helen Mirren and a couple of bit parts have the English accent. Dame Helen is great at comedy, much like Dame Judi Dench. Russell is comparable to Dawn French (The Vicar of Dibley) in that in-your-face-funny way.I believe the low rating it got, 5.6/10 instead 9/10 which is my rating, is likely to be that some Americans can't always get the self deprecating English sense of humor; I feel for these people!A nice wedding song I haven't heard for awhile is "Going to the Chapel."Grand Central Station and skyscrapers in New York City are wonderful. We get several skyline views of Russell's home, recognizable by its aqua roof; it is a penthouse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comparing this to the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Russell Brand just plain sucks. He's like the British version of Tom Greene or Pauly Shore. There is no way he should have been in the same movie with Helen Mirren, much less star in a remake of a Dudley Moore classic. If you all just stay quiet and leave him alone, he may just go away. I still can't believe he's the one doing Katy Perry. Brand has got to have the worst sense of humor of them all. I hope somehow he finds out he sucks and maybe he can re-invent himself cos he is so annoying. If he is going to hang around, I hope he changes his acting style because it just plain looks like he doesn't care and with all this money at stake nowadays with movies, he needs to care about what the public thinks. If he don't, he's this generations Pauly Shore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Matter of Worlds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remakes embed a history of abstraction, so even though both the concerned films may be trivial and uninteresting, the story of their difference can be quite engaging.The original was simply constructed based on the drunk redemption story spliced onto the flexible rubber of romantic comedy. It was something of a risk to balance the damage of a pathetic drunk with the well established film humor of drunks, but it was pulled off.Now this. It has the same name at least, and a comic doing what passes today for humorous excess (including sexual addiction). But the foundation is completely different because we are now well past the point were we can tell stories without telling stories about stories.So we have a film about stories, and the collision of different stories. Our hero is not a victim of substance abuse, he is instead someone who lives in a fantasy world. His 'nanny' and 'mother' have their own stories. He has trouble harmonizing his with those of the rest of the world, as represented by these women.But then he meets a girl, a storyteller who has the ability to bridge this gap. It is as simple a version of the redemption genre as the original 'Arthur.' But the shift to metastory is complete. Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: Arthur</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now for a guy who takes an immediate disliking to Russell Brand the prospect of watching him for nearly 2 hours did not fill my heart with joy especially when he was to be acting as a rich layabout. But I buckled on down and watched away hoping to be pleasantly surprised and I have to say, it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be (still nothing special mind).Arthur is a remake of the 1981 film of the same name and follows Arthur (Russell Brand) the a rick drunken playboy whose only worries in life seem to be how to top his last stunt or where his next lay is coming from. To help him through life Hobson (Helen Mirren) his nanny and Bitterman (Luis Guzmán) his chauffeur are there to look after him. Despite this help, he still gets into trouble at every turn which leads to the company in which he is the sole heir becoming nervous about the future.So when his mother (Geraldine James) becomes sick of his attitude, she gives him an ultimatum that he can either marry Susan (Jennifer Garner) who would ease the shareholders concerns or be cut off from the family fortune and live out life in the real world. The only problem being he has finally met the girl of his dreams Naomi (Greta Gerwig) and so faces a dilemma.I have only seen some of the original not all of it and in that respect, Brand seems to capture some of the charm and essence that Dudley Moore brought to the role but I still find it hard to relate or feel anything towards the main character. Are we supposed to feel sorry for the billionaire who finally has to make a decision and do something with his life? O boohoo! First and foremost thought, it's a comedy so did it make me laugh? In general no but I have to say there were at least a few jokes that got me smirking but over the length of the film, which was too long in my opinion, were few and far between. Brand plays the drunk well (not that surprising) in a more toned down version of his usual characters which won me round- I'm still not a great fan but his performance was solid.Arthur partly entertained and when not compared to the original gives the opportunity to zone out for a couple of hours and be mildly entertained. If there was another choice available then I would probably go for that but there are definitely worse comedies around than this one.For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com</fullReview>

Why doesn't Hollywood come up with something original instead of murdering a pretty good, enjoyable old film. WHY? I gave Arthur 1 star based on the fact I liked the first one so much. And I hate Russell Brand and everything he's ever done. The only reason I can think of for that douche-bag even getting the role was his accent.

		<shortDescription>Better than the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out-of-control playboy Arthur (Brand) must choose between an arranged marriage with Susan (Garner) or with Naomi (Gerwin), his true love. Having never previously seen the 1981, Arthur I watched it the other night. And, I must say: what was the matter with people back then? That movie wasn't funny at all. The script was terrible. Watching a person acting as though drunk is not funny. The only way to cure that is to get an actor drunk and hope he remembers his lines. The only thing good about it was John Gielgud. He was the only pro in there. Everything else was for the respective in-crowds which gave it 10-thumbs up, of course. There were some good lines but they were delivered like after-thoughts. Pitiful. Of course, I have run into people who thought the Dudley Moore job was fantastic. Those people need to be watched. And I am sure they say the same about me. Now, let's see if the promos held true.They did. They did. Well, except for the first 20-minutes where Brand talked incessantly non-stop and wasn't funny at all. I don't think there was a space gap of 2-seconds between one talking and another stepping right in. But, once Arthur meets Naomi, the movie took on a tone unlike the original. This had more tenderness in it, which the original lacked throughout. Maybe that was what was wrong with the original. That or the director was intimidated by the stars. The cast made this more memorable than the original. Seemed they rushed in the original, but not here and all performed well, especially Queen Elizabeth as Hobson (Bob, Queen Elizabeth wasn't in this). Hmmm,?. now I suppose you are going to tell me it was that Mirren woman again. Not much comedy in here for me. I only laughed out loud when Arthur went into the kitchen to make tea for Hobson (Mirren) and you heard the crashing of pots, pans and dishes. It was funny because I didn't expect it. Good comedy catches you by surprise sometimes. The basic story is the same, but things were changed around a lot so I guess you could call this an update. All in all a much better film than the original. There seemed to be a more humanistic approach this time and it worked. Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.</fullReview>

In the original I loved Bitterman. But in this movie it has very little to do with him at all and he has a female nanny in this one Helen Mirren as Hobson and even she cannot save this movie. I watched this remake once and I won't ever watch it again it is a one time movie. I have tried to like Russell but I just don't. Greta Gerwig just has no chemistry with Russell Brand at all.

		<fullReview>Hollywood, please get some new ideas! Not every film needs to be remade. The 1981 version was a classic by itself and didn't need to be remade. If you have to remake a film, would it kill you to make it, well, entertaining? If you've seen the original (rich playboy pushed to marry for money but falls in love with a broke girl), the storyline is still there but there's just so much wrong with the new version. 1) I've really, really tried to like Russell Brand but like I've said before, as a supporting actor he knocks it out of the ballpark, but as a lead actor he wears out his welcome after about a half hour. His Arthur is more annoying than Dudley Moore lovable. I'm not a hater; I thought he was funny in Forgetting Sarah Marshall and I saw his stand-up special. He's simply not leading man material. 2) Poor Helen Mirren. To go from winning an Oscar to this? On paper changing Hobson from a male butler to a female nanny looks good, but it just doesn't work. Mirren's Hobson looks out of place here, especially wearing that Darth Vader mask and talking like Vader. This was obviously a paycheck role.3) I never understood Jennifer Garner's appeal. She seems blah throughout the film. The only time she showed any life is when she got her Sydney Bristow on and punched Arthur at the wedding.4) Never heard of Greta Gerwig before this. She could be the next romcom star. Too bad her character in this was awful. A tour guide that's too poor or lazy to get a tour guide license (really, how expensive is it to get one?) so she gives illegal tours. Huh? At least when Liza Minnelli played the waitress in the original that steals a tie at Bergorf, at least it's believable. Who ever heard of illegal tours? And if she's that poor, how is she able to afford to live in Astoria, Queens?5) Nick Nolte as Burt Johnson should be in the looney bin, not a rich guy scaring the bejesus out of Arthur and the audience.6) The blatant Warner Brothers promotions: the Batmobile, Looney Tunes playing in the personal movie theater. 7) I miss the movie title ARTHUR with the letter A being tilted in the movie poster. I did like the end credits of the new version that looked like a pop-up children's book come to life. Usually end credits are just plain crap but at least this movie made some effort.Just do yourself a favor, skip this version and rent the Dudley Moore version. You'll be glad you did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To make it clear first of all, I have NOT seen the original. I found this movie to be extremely entertaining, and found myself laughing throughout the movie. I'm not the biggest fan of Russel Brand's acting, but he did really well in this movie. I like what often appears to be improvisational additions that he mutters during the movie. He captured the character really well and gives the viewers a good impression of what a rich kid in NYC lives like. The best way to enjoy this movie is to watch it without any expectations and just go with it. It kept me on my toes the entire time and although at times predictable, it was fun to see how things worked out. As mentioned, there were many laughs if you pay good attention to the sometimes hard to hear dialog. Enjoy this movie with a beer or two and some friends. The plot is easy to follow and it's a good movie to watch for some laughs and if you don't want to sit through something that requires much concentration or focus. Watch closely, though. It's worth it!</fullReview>

People who don't like Russell Brand might want to give this one a miss. I thought Arthur's character was particularly good, seeing how he is so generous (in the most stupid ways!) The story-line was well developed all the way through. It got a bit tedious at times but other than that I thought it was funny pretty much all the way through. In some ways the film was quite deep, like the scene where you find out Hobson dies, and Arthur then becomes depressed. Overall I would give Arthur 7/10.

		<fullReview>Last night, I went to see ARTHUR. Even though I'm normally stand-offish towards remakes, I decided to give this one a chance. And I must admit, I was thoroughly entertained. Russell Brand's version of Arthur is played with a Michael Jackson-esque innocence that you don't see much in movies anymore. And that's what we like about the character, he's childish, irresponsible, but well-meaning to a fault. When he gets into trouble and makes the difficult choice to grow up, you want to see him succeed. In contrast, Helen Mirren (as Hobson) is the perfect foil- she's stern, sarcastic and doesn't put up with any of Arthur's antics. And even though Arthur's REAL mother is cold and distant, you can tell that Hobson raised and loved him. Which only reinforces what I first learned in BATMAN BEGINS with Michael Caine's Alfred. Sometimes, the hired help are the actual parents of the rich and well-to-do children. And in ARTHUR, there is a real chemistry between Arthur and Hobson. So the movie is heartwarming and funny in equal doses, without being cloying or contrived. One funny scene in particular (spoiler alert!) involves Brand, Garner and a bed. Overall, if you're looking for a fun, relaxing and entertaining show, please go and see the new ARTHUR. Oh and one other kudo, thank God the filmmakers had the good sense to have kids acting like kids!</fullReview>

If you have seen the original Arthur with Dudley Moore, you wont be happy seeing this remake. I found the story line hard to follow, and very confusing at times. Why the writers changed the Hobson character to a woman, and left out the grandmother (she was an important part of the original film) didn't make sense to me. Russell Brand was not very convincing playing the part of a drunk. Dudley Moore was brilliant in that part. The supporting cast wasn't much help to this film either.

		<fullReview>The original Arthur came out in 1981 and starred Dudley Moore. Remember him? It was funny. It was poignant. It was believable in an "out of your own reach" sort of way. I walked out of the new Arthur after an hour, came home and immediately watched the Dudley version on Netflix's Instant Watch. It was as fun as I remembered it, even though rich then is so not rich now. Remember 1981, when there were only a handful of millionaires? Who knew? It really made me feel good about walking out and honoring the first version.The problem with the new Arthur is that Russell Brand is silly? but only silly. Doing a silly movie with a silly actor means it can be silly and still not be not funny or believable. Arthur is not funny, and it's an embarrassment to Helen Mirren, who should have run after reading page one of the script. She is such a great actor; what was she thinking? Much has changed in the thirty years since the original Arthur came out. Liza Minnelli has turned out in real life to be as crazy as she appeared to be in Arthur and The Sterile Cuckoo. She always made me so uncomfortable in those roles. I just knew it was the true her, and that she could not possibly have a great life. I was right, alas. But Arthur needs to play opposite someone as nutty as him in order to make it believable, and no one in the new Arthur comes close to really being his soul mate. Dudley Moore's real life had a sad ending; he was always just a bit embarrassed by his own lack of seriousness.So I have put to rest here the need to discuss the movie at all.It reminds us all that watching old versions of movies can be a fun thing to do on a Sunday afternoon. 'Night Dudley.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really don't know how much space I can waste for a review of this bomb. Russell Brand is utterly unfunny and unlikeable as the lead character. Grating, annoying, angering are some adjectives I'd give to this performance. Really, I am at such a loss of words as to how bad this movie was. I will say something nice, and that is that Helen Mirren did a decent job. I mean, she SHOULD, she's Helen Mirren after all. But I just don't see why she bothered with this film. And frankly, John Gielgud in the original was MUCH wittier and funnier. Okay, I have two more lines to go.... sooooooo....... hmmmmmmmmm......... the best advice I have for anyone even thinking about spending even a dollar at Redbox to STAY CLEAR of this disaster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst sequel...or at least tied with Chris Rock's Down to Earth.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a remake goes bad it usually is just a water downed useless retread like Gus Van Sant's Psycho, or an honest effort that just doesn't connect such as Tim Burton's Charlie and The Chocolate Factory. Compared to Dudley Moore's Arthur, a bona-fide classic, one wonders why so little effort was put into the remake with shoddy performances, poor writing and uninspired direction. It doesn't even rise to the level of a direct-to-RedBox sequel, Arthur 3: Nephew of Arthur, if you will. And that's the big problem here, its so bad it's like a low- budget sequel along the lines of Mask 2 or Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd except those were much better films. There was one other remake like this that I can remember and that was Chris Rock's Down to Earth, a very poor reworking of Warren Beatty's Academy Award nominated film Heaven Can Wait. When it comes to comedies Hollywood can't rise to the occasion of remaking classics. The best they can do is tackle action remakes by including CGI effects that weren't available for previous versions. Which is why sci-fi remakes (Spielberg's War of the Worlds, Keanu Reeves' The Day The Earth Stood Still) that require a strong script fail despite great special effects. I'm not opposed to remakes, one is often reminded that the Wizard of Oz was a remake, but it was remade in 1939. Today, Hollywood can't rise to the occasion with scripts even when given a head start with a proved story line. All they can do is superhero films which are 90 percent CGI and 10 percent whatever you call comic book writing. Scripted comedies seem to be dead giving way to parody films and the type of lunacy by Will Farrell or Seth Rogen that if you're not drunk its not very funny. But in the case of the remake of Arthur, being drunk only reminds you of how funny the original was compared to this piece of crap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the original 1981 movie and enjoyed it very much. This movie I didn't like at all. Maybe it was Russell Brand, he's too far out there for my taste. I watch comedies to laugh and forget the harshness of life's realities, this movie is worse than reality. It's too bizarre and painful to enjoy, at least in my opinion. The original Arthur with Dudley Moore was light-hearted, funny and benign. Russell Brand, in my opinion was a bad choice for this role as his personality is too weird and sinister to be funny. Yes, I am comparing this to the original, sorry but the creators in sense are attempting to sell the movie based on the original with viewers expecting something similar, I was. They should have created a totally different movie with a different title, etc... If one watches the movie they should be aware this movie is a totally different twist to the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been a fan of Russel Brand for years, as a person and as an actor. I have loved every single film I've seen him in because they are great comical feel good films and this is no exception.Having not seen the original I have nothing to compare this too.Mr Brand plays a very witty, astute character who is made to grow up and become and adult. The humour in this film is first class, and some of jokes were very cleverly said, and would take someone with some degree of intelligence to understand.All in all he basically played himself, which is a great character. I would have no problem watching this film again, nor recommending it to others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I mean Helen Mirren, Nick Nolte, Luiz Guzman and Geraldine James... Well, I love British humor, but I am not a fan of Russell Brand (as well as Ricky Gervais, for instance). He looks too overreacting and flabby and I don't find him especially funny. I have not seen this version from 1981, but the plot is mediocre and too predictable; with dozens of funny lines, though. A kind of entertainment it is, killing time, but do not expect a memorable night. Happy end will provide, presumably, additional moments to move on with your girlfriend/boyfriend... :) Helen Mirren's performance is, as usual, enjoyable to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great cast, weak script, kind of endearing, but not funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved Brand as Aldous Snow in Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Get Him to the Greek. However, with a mostly-unfunny script (I have to admit there were a few witty quips that made me laugh, though), his lovable aloofness just became?idiotic and annoying. What a shame, since the cast was talented, and did the best they could with the lines they were given. In particular, I've got to say that I initially did not find Gerwig's looks to be right for the leading lady (of course, she wasn't helped by the silly outfits she wore), but she delivered such a sweet, genuine performance, that by the end she had won me over. Another thing that this movie did well was incorporate New York City; specifically, its use of Grand Central Station and the Whisper Wall was pretty cool. The film even became kind of endearing in its second half, and almost got 3 mugs from me?but ultimately, it wasn't good enough as a romantic drama to make up for its failure as a funny comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>a rich, selfish, childish, drunk chooses love over money. That's the problem with this movie. Arthur has no redeemable qualities so why would we care if he ends up happy? Russell Brand plays an over the top character of himself as rich playboy Arthur. Arthur still has a nanny and spends money like it grows on trees and stays drunk most of the time. One day his mom is tired of the embarrassment and tells him he must marry, Susan, a business minded woman, or lose his money. At the same time, Aurthor meets Naomi and is smitten with her. But he's like that with most women he meets. And for some unknown reason he really loves this one? That wasn't believable. Nothing is shown as to why Naomi would stand out from all the other girls.Hudson is the only woman Arthur could ever really love, but other than that he's so selfish and annoying. No woman would put up with that.FINAL VERDICT: Don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arthur - a bit of a bore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arthur is a boozing, partying, carefree billionaire. With a nanny to tuck him in at night, 950 billion dollars at his disposal, and the law enforcement of Manhattan on his side what could go wrong? Russell Brand was probably the best choice for this role. Even so, I was not over the moon about his performance. Anyone can be witty with scripted lines, but timing and delivery are what make the character truly funny and endearing. I'm not saying I didn't enjoy Brand, there was just something not quite right about his performance.Arthur claims that having fun is his calling and he does it very well. He crashes a batmobile, destroys a beloved landmark, and then celebrates when he finds that he's finally going to be put in jail. I really felt that I would be laughing a lot more during this movie. Someone behind me thought it was hilarious, but I did not share her feelings on the matter. Admittedly, I laughed aloud a few times. There is a scene in a candy shop involving a gummy bear costume that is particularly amusing, but overall the frequency with which Arthur comes up with on the spot witty remarks is a bit much. So the story goes that Arthur's mother ? who is only present in his life to control the funds that he has access to ? wants him to stop being such a buffoon and get it together so that he may run the Bach company someday. The company has never been run by anyone without the Bach name. If Arthur can't do it, then who? Enter the radiant Jennifer Garner. It is rare to see Jennifer Garner in a role where she isn't likable. Except, of course, Daredevil. But that wasn't her fault. The whole movie was a train wreck. But I digress.Garner plays Susan Johnson. Her intention is to marry Arthur so that she will have the Bach name and can take over the company for Arthur's mother. Arthur doesn't like Susan and ends up falling for Naomi (Greta Gerwig). Naomi's down to earth factor is a little extreme. I can appreciate that she wants to be the girl who isn't wooed by money, but come on. His gestures are grand and I think any girl in her place would probably be thrilled to be doted upon in that way. Says the girl who haggled the price of a bagel this morning. Fifty cents is fifty cents I tell ya!A movie so centralized around spending money and drinking heavily is an indulgence in itself. So I take this movie at face value. I accepted it for what it is, but I did not love it. The plot was often over the top and that wasn't so great, but it has a lot of heart.Now, onto my two favorite parts of the movie: Helen Mirren and Luis Guzman. The hired help. Mirren as Hobson is charming, intelligent, and sophisticated to boot! She has been Arthur's nanny since he was in diapers. She gives the movie an entirely new level of likability. I think she does that with every film she touches though. Luis Guzman played a smaller role, but lemme tell ya, that guy was hilarious! He plays Bitterman the butler. I can honestly say that he got more laughs from me than Brand did.To reiterate, Brand delivers a punchline well enough, Gerwig is at least memorable, Garner is adorable even when she's evil, Guzman brings the funny, and Mirren is? well, Mirren. She is gorgeous and lovely dressed in frumpy garb and that is something that few can pull off.I say, go ahead and see Arthur. It's good for a couple of laughs. The movie's heart is in the right place and the message is actually a really great one. The delivery is just a little wacky. But hey, sometimes we all need a little bit of wacky in our lives.- Ms. Silver Screen founder of mssilverscreen.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is this the worst movie of 2011?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a dismal movie. Although passed off as a comedy, this movie is a tragedy, and in more ways than one. First, the main character is not funny. Rather, he is repulsive. Second, the movie dwells on morbid themes relating to substance abuse and death. Three, the movie's story is so downbeat as to cause one to reasonably ask: when will it end? Four, changes from the original movie utterly fail, making the original, which also had its problems, seem like a virtual classic. Fifth, although Helen Mirren's portrayal as Hobson rates an enthusiastic E for Effort, she is totally miscast. Six, the character of Arthur is so ridiculous as to reduce him to a caricature. Seven, the conflict between Arthur and the mother is contrived since Arthur's erratic behavior leaves the mother with little choice except to be nasty, if for no other reason, to shield her money from someone who is seriously unstable. Eight, the Jennifer Garner character warrants serious consideration for the worst supporting character ever concocted by a Hollywood screenwriter. When a beautiful actress like Jennifer Garner is made to look and sound like a banshee, something has gone wrong. If the movie wants Arthur to look and sound like a social misfit, okay. But when the same standard is applied to a truly beautiful woman, then that proverbial line has been crossed. Nine, setting this movie in New York City just did not work. A city like New York is big enough to swallow up a lot of Arthurs. He can do a lot more damage, and be a lot more noticeable too, in a smaller city or town. Ten, Russell Brand is a talented, energetic actor who tries to bring some authenticity to the Arthur character, but he is miscast. The character is supposed to be a small, vulnerable snip of a man who projects vulnerability and is harmless. The same cannot be said Mr. Brand's Arthur, who literally towers over the other characters and projects himself as an intimidating figure.</fullReview>

This movie was below bad, I felt lost most of the time while watching it, because there was no definite line which the movie moves on. Quick jokes here and there don't do any good to the quality of the movie, because it feels like it's not connected to what's going on. I never felt attached to any of the characters here, because there was no clear vision of what we are supposed to be understanding. It really was an awful experience at the theater, one that I would not recommend to anyone for sure. I gave the movie a 2 out of 10, the two is for Manhattan shots from above and its stunning buildings, that's about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love the Dudley Moore version of this movie, and from the previews, I was doubtful, but I go to at least one movie a week, so I decided to see this one. It was about what I expected - no comparison to the original. I got the impression that Russell Brand had seen the original and was trying to play Dudley Moore, but not really succeeding. Having a nanny instead of a butler did not work. Jennifer Garner did OK as Susan, but Greta Gerwig in the Liza Minnelli role was just pathetic. There was no chemistry and nothing about the character that would make us believe Arthur would give up his fortune for her. One of my favorite scenes in the 1981 version was the engagement party and the stable scene, and that was completely left out of this movie. I feel that scene was pivotal to the plot. Most notably, no one in the theater laughed. I first noticed that I was not laughing, then noticed that no one was. Perhaps remaking the film wasn't the worst idea ever, but if it had to be done, more thought should have been put into the idea. You might enjoy the movie if you have not seen the original, but if you have, you will be disappointed.</fullReview>

Greta Gerwig brought NOTHING to her role as naomi and her performance was actually painful to watch . . . yes, painful. It was like watching Sophia Coppola in Godfather III all over again. Did the actress originally chosen for this role call in sick? Did anyone watch the final product? Clearly not. This is a don't bother film. View the original on Netflix on your laptop before you go to the theatre.

I knew that this re-do was going to be weak, but it is a slap in the face to anyone who had seen the original, you had to know going in that this wasn't a redo of the original when the producers started calling it a re-telling of the Artur story. The last time I was this disappointed with a movie was the latest of the "Focker" movies which I was forced too see....

		<fullReview>Why, why, why did they remake the Dudley Moore classic. My guess is that Hollywood has finally run out of ideas. Russell Brand attempts to re create the lovable Dudley Moore drunk playboy character-and fails miserably. Helen Mirren-a fine actress gives what is arguably her worst performance in a role she obviously did for a paycheck. About all she does is scowl and have a mean, exasperated expression on her face.Rest of cast is pretty non descript as is the story, screenplay, and direction. Everything in this wet turd of a movie falls flat on its face, and the director didn't even try to redeem it. Guess he knows the score. He was paid to turn in a movie and he does just that. Only thing is that this waste of celluloid is not a movie. It is just another product of contemporary Hollywood , a heartless and soulless Hollywood that has absolutely no clue on how to make a real movie. About the only good thing in this bomb are some of the on-location New York sites where this was filmed, but Grand Central Station looks like a leftovcer set from Superman II. Do yourself a favor. Save your gas and 11 bucks, stay away from the multiplex playing this atrocity and rent the Dudley Moore original. There is absolutely no comparison between the real thing and the remake. The kind of film that should never have been made in the first place. If you are sucker enough to pay good money to see this Dudley-less dud, demand a refund! Any wonder why movie-going in the US is down by 20 percent? Crap films like this are the reason!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How can a comedy, a movie usually designed to make people laugh, bore me to tears? Throw in a thoroughly unlikable protagonist making unfunny "witty" jokes while acting like a man child and you've got yourself one of the best sleeping pills to ever hit a cinema near you.Arthur (Russell Brand) is a spoiled, rich 30-something wasting money every 30 minutes to enjoy his life while being watched over by his disapproving nanny/surrogate mother, Hobson (Helen Mirren). When Arthur's mother, the owner of a multi-billion dollar corporation, has had enough of Arthur's immaturity, she threatens to cut him off unless she marries the responsible and completely-out-of-her-mind businesswoman, Susan (Jennifer Gardner). While Arthur begrudgingly plans to go through with the marriage to keep his fortune, he struggles with the prospect when he meets and connects with the part-time con artist Naomi (Greta Gerwig). "Wackiness" ensues. For two boring hours.I was coming into this film ready to hate Russell Brand, who's very appearance makes we want to take a shower to wash away the filth. For his first lead role, he doesn't really bomb it completely but... he's just not a funny guy. The sad part is, you can see him try to be funny, when he starts acting out and behaving like a child. So he pretty much looked at Will Ferrell and decided to copy what he's been doing in his very, very worst movies. So it doesn't come across as funny, it's just sad. Brand never reaches the level of annoyance he stooped to in "Get Him to the Greek" and "Forgetting Sarah Marshall", but he's definitely not a leading man. He has no charm, no attraction, and no likability. And he does this for two unforgivable hours.While you never care about Arthur, you oddly care more about the supporting cast. You really feel for Helen Mirren's Hobson and her exasperation with putting up with this rich, spoiled little brat. She's dry and sarcastic, and the film's best moments (which are few and far in between) all belong to her. Even Greta Gerwig is more charming than the lead, and you actually feel sorry her when she gets hurt in the movie. Jennifer Gardner has fun as a psycho for all 10 minutes she's in this film. That's right, she can only be here ten minutes of this two hour waste of time.But a comedy needs funny situations, and this film is sorely lacking in that department. Even though Brand plays with the famous movie cars and rents out Grand Central Station, there's nothing to laugh here. I'll admit I giggled at a snarky remark here and there, but like I said, it never comes from Russell Brand. You see a couple of ridiculous things like the DeLorean or the Batmobile (the bad one), and you feel like you're ready to smile but the movie does nothing with them. While this film didn't anger me, it commits the cardinal sin of being boring. They have two montages of nothing interesting happening, and there came points while dialog was going on and I almost started snoozing. And did I mention this "comedy" is two unholy hours long? At the end of the day, Arthur is an irritating movie with a thoroughly uncharming and unfunny protagonist. It's a waste of time and money that only has a few funny moments peppered in. Rent it to pass the time, but do not expect to laugh. Expect to catch some Zs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A less than enjoyable experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arthur can be summarized like one of those Old Spice commercials:Look at Brand, now at NYC, now back at Brand. Don't look at Greta Gerwig, she can't act. Now back at Brand, now look at money, lots of money. Look at New York. Feel better?I will admit I liked Russell Brand in Forgetting Sarah Marshall. The uncomfortable situations Jason Segel crafted were accentuated by Brand's cavalier rock-star attitude. It was a character not far from Brand's actual personality, but he still had a structure and dialog that were intentional. In Arthur, it's quite different. Brand plays Arthur who, from the trailers, we are to believe is a child-like idiot who is being pushed around. Right away we see that he's far from being childish or stupid, but is a raging alcoholic and womanizer. Hardly the lovable billionaire I expected. The majority of jokes and situations rely on poorly written dialog and on Brand being "wacky." I laughed about a dozen times, not exactly funny for an almost two hour movie. Green Hornet had a similar problem; Seth Rogan can be hilarious, but he still needs solid dialog that he apparently can't write for himself. I can't confirm on Arthur, but I imagine the director gave Brand a good bit of leeway with improvising.Brand's performance and character weren't the only problems with the film. While Greta Gerwig had the looks for the perfect hipster New York girl, her acting was uncomfortably disconnected from any emotions or conviction. Contrast that with Jennifer Garner who played a perfect villain with a tons of energy. Not a Garner fan, but she definitely brings it when she needs to (see The Kingdom, one of my favorite action/crime thrillers). Helen Mirren, of course, was excellent. What can I say, she plays a great Brit.Little bit of a spoiler ahead here.I'm getting tired of movies that don't have the nerve to be slightly original when it comes to happiness. Just once, I'd like the girl in peril to meet a nice guy and they ride happily into the sunset to work 2 jobs, build a home and life for themselves, and retire on an adequate 401(k). The end of Arthur gave me a little hope that this movie might have an upturn. Stripped of his fortune, Arthur gets sober, appears to have a job, and goes to look for the love of his life. Sounds a bit realistic, even romantic. By this point, Gerwig's character is a successful children's book writer. Apparently her horse was not so hight to decline the publishing deal Arthur finagled for her. That right there ruins any "happy but poor" ending. As the happiness cherry on the unrealistic cake, we find out that Arthur's distant, uncaring mother's heart grew three sizes that day and she reinstated his fortune and gave him a "job" running some charity. How noble!! They ride off in a $500k car through the streets of New York *sigh, it's so wonderful* City. Are you serious? We're in the middle of terrible economic times, and nobody is feeling it harder than folks in cities with high costs of living. What an elitist slap in the face. Did I mention that this little "things set right" montage took all of 5 minutes at the end of the movie? And they wonder why they're going to barely break $10 million on opening weekend.Acting, script, silly things like story (who needs it!?) aside, what really ired me about Arthur was having New York freakin' City crammed down my throat. Is the city in such bad condition these days, they need a publicity film to tell the country that they're still superior, happy, beautiful, and, of course, so very affordable? Spare me. Every bit of this movie is proof that Hollywood has zero connection with the movie- going audiences that wander into theaters hoping for something enjoyable and funny, but instead get this?Arthur had a few funny moments, but the cruel selfishness of most of the characters topped by the NYC love-in made this movie a less than enjoyable experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake of the Dudley Moore movie 30 years ago, but not as good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie sets itself up for failure just by the fact that no one can hope to play a charming drunk as well as Dudley Moore did. But Russell Brand tries and it comes off as a partial success. It would be a more entertaining movie for those who have never seen the original. Russell Brand is Arthur, son of an extremely wealthy New York family. He is a man-child, knows how to do nothing on his own, still has his nanny, and basically has a worthless life drinking too much and spending money on the latest whim. Helen Mirren is Hobson, his nanny.Geraldine James is Arthur's mother, Vivienne, who runs the business since dad had died some years back. Currently she is having difficulty gaining potential investor confidence because Arthur keeps turning up in the news with his capers. So mom decides Arthur needs to get married and she picks company businesswoman Jennifer Garner as Susan Johnson. This marriage will appease the investors and will allow Susan to eventually run the company with a family name intact.Problem is Arthur doesn't care for Susan at all, and only agrees to the arrangement because mom says she will "cut him off" if he doesn't. Arthur is not quite prepared to live that way.The complication comes when Arthur encounters Greta Gerwig as Naomi Quinn, a budding writer of children's books but who works as an unlicensed tour guide to support herself and her ill father. Arthur sees Naomi as his soul mate, but the engagement to Susan presents a bit of a problem.So that is essentially what the movie is about, Arthur trying to live his spoiled lifestyle and get out of marrying Susan and in the process capture Naomi for himself. Nothing goes smoothly in his quest. Luis Guzmán is good as Arthur's driver, Bitterman. Nick Nolte is Susan's intense dad, Burt Johnson. Is it my imagination, or does Nolte's voice get worse every year? It is almost painful in my own throat just to hear him talk. What is wrong with his voice??SPOILERS: At the church on the wedding day, Arthur speaks up and calls off the wedding. Even though mom threatens to disown him, he tries to mend fences with Namoi after she found out he deceiving her regarding his engagement. In the end Arthur went to AA meetings seriously, and we see him sober for 6 months and continuing. He and Naomi stay together and he assumes a productive role in the family business. Susan was found to be power hungry and she was dismissed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ugh... Too much obnoxious. Not enough funny.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arthur is a movie that, believe it or not, thinks it's a comedy. It is far from a perfect movie. In fact, it's not even a good movie.Russell Brand stars as Arthur Bach, a multimillionaire, alcoholic company heir who relishes his material items, expensive parties, and bantering with his nanny, Hobson (Played by Helen Mirren). But, he's forced into a marriage with another company heir, the manipulative Susan Johnson (Played by Jennifer Garner), out of fear of losing his billion dollar inheritance. Things get eve more complicated when he falls for a young, working class woman (Played by Greta Gerwig), leaving him to ponder if his wealth is really worth it.The biggest problems I have with the screenplay, aside from sporadic story arcs, is the characterization of Arthur, and his performance by Russell Brand. Arthur is built up by both parties as such an obnoxious character. His humor is crude, too rapid, and dull on impact, anyway. It's just handled so recklessly, and Brand acts too annoyingly, that even when the character asks for sentimentality, we can't give him much sympathy. The damage is already done, further adding to the inconsistency of the script.The movie itself makes too many attempts at being funny, and it doesn't have a lot of funny. Not to mention that most of the cast are disappointing. The only real bright spot of the movie is the the warm, caring performance of Helen Mirren, who gets several of the only laughs in this film. Still, one gentle performance and the infrequent laugh just doesn't cut it for me.As soon as the movie was over, I just needed to erase it from my memory, even if only for a brief moment. I found the original Arthur on Netflix instant stream, and I sat down, watched the whole thing, and it was heartfelt, vastly funnier, and Dudley Moore gave a terrific performance. It isn't the first time a really good Dudley Moore movie has been butchered by a weak remake (*cough* Bedazzled *cough*), but hopefully it'll be the last.Arthur can be described with one word: Witless.*1/2 / ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a fan of the first Arthur, but I'm also a fan of Russell Brand - so I'm pretty sure I went into this with little to no bias.This remake is just too darn close in terms of dialog and storyline details. It just flat-out followed the first movie from beginning to end, but it was that yanking of half the script that kinda sent me off track. Sure, it's a remake, but there is no originality at all here, and Russell Brand is staggeringly dull as Arthur.I expected more. Russell took a small step back in "Get Him To The Greek", but this is a considerable step back. There's way too little of 'drunk Arthur' here, or the in-general funny Arthur.Then you have Helen Mirren - a fantastic, powerhouse of an actress who's bound by the same chains. Same story, same dialog, and suffers in terms of creating an engaging/memorable characters.There was the original score from Christopher Cross, and other strengths like strong actors across the board that made the original far superior to this remake.A huge disappointment. Don't blame me, I'm not the one that remade this film with a trio that's far less-engaging than Gilgud, Moore, and Minelli. Do I actually have to refer to the original as the original now? That and be reminded of this car-wreck every time I do it? great.44/100</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow, I really tried to like this, but it's a horrible remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am all for remaking films so a newer generation might watch them with their favorite stars etc, and Russell Brand is pretty funny, so I thought why not.Now all I am thinking is WHY? I will never get those 90 or so minutes back in my life and I could have been doing so many better things.I will say there are 3-4 genuinely funny moments in this movie - when Russell picks up a pill container and mispronounces what is written on it, but the movie is generally speaking a really badly written screenplay, whether or not you take into account the remake part or not.Arthur is barely likable, but just about makes it, but the "love interest" actress is totally forgettable and basically a cardboard cutout. Bitterman has been updated and he's OK, but Hobson (played by Helen Mirren) is just too blah - she has a couple of funny lines, but she's certainly no Sir John Gielgud whose dry humor was hilarious in the first version of this story.Then there is Jennifer Garner - WTF? Susan's character is meant to be horrible and so is her father, but the way they played it in this movie was way too over the top, not believable at all, in fact cringeworthy most of the time.I guarantee anyone who kinda liked this movie will LOVE the original with Dudley Moore - the story is far better and the parts they changed for this version were way better in the original.As a fan of remakes by and large, I just can't believe how badly this one misfired.Redbox this movie and don't even bother with Blu-ray, get the cheapest copy you can get if you still want to see it, or better yet wait for it on network TV - it won't be long!</fullReview>

After being told that he must either marry someone he hates or love $950 million dollars in inheritance, Arthur (Brand) must decide what is more important, money or love. I had never seen the original "Arthur" with Dudley Moore so I decided to watch that before this one. After watching the old one I was not impressed and was not looking forward to this one. While watching this I started to like the old one more and more. I understand the updates that they needed to do for the new one, but they made it a little too P.C., which took a lot away from the story and who Arthur was in the original. I will say that I really get annoyed by Russell Brand, but he was not that bad in this one. I also have to say he is the perfect choice to play this character. Helen Mirren did a good job, but as much as I like her she is not even close to has funny as John Gielgud was in the original. This is not as bad as I was expecting, but this one made me like the original more then I did after I watched it.

		<shortDescription>Watch the original instead, this remake is a dud...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is the very reason why people hate remakes. The original Arthur didn't need to be updated, it didn't need to be re-told. But, here we are 30 years later watching Russell Brand dressed as Batman rubbing the nipples on the batsuit.I am not against remakes, by any means. Remakes are essentially good. What 16-year-old do you know would want to watch a Dudley Moore comedy from 1981? Hollywood introduces an old character and plays it for a new generation, I have no problems with that. As a writer, it's the most sincere form of flattery.Arthur (Brand) is a spoiled billionaire (is there any other kind?) who's also an alcoholic. He lives each day as if it were a party, spends cash like it's going out of style and is also very kind and generous. He's so nice that he wants the woman he was just in bed with to "help yourself to that priceless sculpture on your way out the door". It''s a good thing his nanny, Hobson (Mirren) is there to look after him, help him and protect him. Arthur's mother, Vivienne (James) is fed up with Arthur's childish antics, she's losing investors because of him, so she gives him an ultimatum: get married to Susan Johnson (Garner) or be cut off from the family's money. Her reasoning is that if Arthur marries Susan, the investors will stay because she is a cutthroat businesswoman. Arthur reluctantly agrees, but then he meets Naomi Quinn (Gerwig) and that's when Arthur has to make a choice: stay a boy or become a man.Is the film funny? Yes and no. I did chuckle a few times. The script does have some funny bits and you can't help but be amused at how much of a smart-ass Arthur is. He actually does have intelligence, he just chooses to be snarky. ($999,000 dollars? I thought a million would be vulgar). The third act kind of jumps around a bit once Arthur tries to become a better person but it just leaves the audience in a state of confusion --- is he doing this or is he doing this? Is he picking the money or is he picking the woman? It's a very poor showing of resolution and worse yet, it's still extremely predictable.The thing I like the most about Arthur is Helen Mirren. She gives a top-notch performance, as always and I love that they cast her instead of a man (in the original, Hobson was played by the late great John Gielgud, who won an Academy Award for his performance). I applauded the filmmakers for making this change because it made the film seem a little fresh. If only they picked a better actor to portray Arthur. Russell Brand's performance was so mimicky, it's insulting. It's like he was trying to be Dudley Moore. Why not do your own fresh take on a classic character? This completely ruined the movie for me. I was hoping that Brand would bring something else to the role, not just copy someone else's. Luis Guzman was wasted (no, not drunk, I'm talking about his talent) as Bitterman, appearing in only a few scenes. Jennifer Garner is fine as the woman he's forced to marry and Gerwig's performance was overshadowed by Brand's flair for over-the-top theatrics. Maybe first-time director Jason Winer can reel his stars in a bit next time so as not to ruin the movie. More reviews at www.soveryterry.com Final Grade: C-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a unbearable romantic comedy, but it's a unfunny and dull one that gets worse as it progresses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen the original, so I can't make any comparison. But to sum up the plot it revolves around a rich idiot that does some pointless and obnoxious things and soon has to marry some rich girl that his own mother wants him to marry in order to change her son into a dignified person. And he has to marry the girl of his mother's choosing in order for him to keep his wealth, but he falls for another girl instead that is average but is kindhearted. This type of scenarios has been done a lot before of the rich guy falling for the poor girl and in most cases it has been done better. This is suppose to be a comedy but I didn't find anything funny about it, it does have it's moments sort of but it's very very few. Other movies at least goes has some touching aspects to this, but that isn't the case for this movie. It just doesn't have factors that would make the movie enjoyable, the main character idiocy is okay in comedies, but the stupidity in this just wasn't funny. This isn't a unbearable romantic comedy, I guess since I seen far worse but as the movie progresses it gets worse and worse.4.2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overslated and underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very tempted to give this film a miss after reading the dreadful writeups, but Russell Brand usually delivers, so having watched it and seen the original 1981 movie with Dudley Moore I was pleasantly surprised. Maybe the humour does not translate or perhaps you either like Russell Brand or hate him, but I found it a good update and a role that fits Brand well. His genuine accent is very close to 'Duds' and he naturally pulls off the part as if it were made for him.Dame Helen Mirren of course delivers Hobson impeccably as did Sir John Gielgud, however she lends a more maternal slant to Gielguds paternal. Greta Gerwig may come across as plain but this was also intended in the role played by Liza Minelli as the honest girl seeking love and happiness not money and power.Perhaps the Arthur movies have a quintessentially British flavour that directly challenges the culturally right wing American lust for money and power above all things. But this is the moral story of both films. Life is fleeting enjoy it without flushing it down the toilet or losing your compassion and humour.This is a tragic comedy love story that comes good in the end like any romcom is supposed to. A well tried and tested formula.It was a decent remake with it's own scripted humour following the same plot but not a total copy like 'True Grit' which is a total homage and offers nothing better or different. I was glad that I ignored the bad reviews and saw for myself. Love it or hate it it's worth a watch especially if you liked the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Russell Brand irritates the hell out of me. There's no getting around that. Some people find him hilarious while others, myself included, see him as a desperate, ingratiating bottom feeder, who will not only stoop very low to get cheap laughs, but seems to enjoy getting them that way more than really earning them. This remake of the Oscar-winning 1981 comedy, Arthur, starring Dudley Moore and Sir John Gielgud, is a tonally confused mess that wants to make us laugh, failing, and then wants to make us cry, failing miserably. Brand plays Arthur, the rich, spoiled man-child alcoholic who, who lives in a lavish New York apartment with his loyal but stern nanny, Hobson (Helen Mirren).

		<shortDescription>A needless remake of a fantastic classic comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying I'm a fan of Russell Brand. As I live in the UK my first introduction to the man was when he was a host on one of the Big Brother off shoot shows, Big Brothers Big Mouth or something along those lines. Russell was laugh out loud hysterical. He improvised, used extraordinarily anachronistic language while waxing lyrical about contemporary life and celebrity. He is a great comic. However, as a comic he should stick to a certain thing. Kenny Everett was hysterical also, but he remained so as a DJ on the Radio and then later in his Television programs. But he kept to his station as a hilarious OTT comic, not a comic actor. This is where I believe Russell Brand should stay, on the telly. He is NOT a COMIC ACTOR, he's a COMIC. When he's interviewing ridiculous celebrities, musing about his crazy past life as a drug addict on stage or just being himself while being interviewed by others he is something of a joy. I enjoy him, he has a great, bizarre and truly wonderful sense of humour. He should NOT have attempted to remake Arthur however. No one should, it was unnecessary. The original starring Dudley Moore is as funny, scandalous and emotive as it was 30 years ago. If any film was in need of an update Arthur certainly wasn't one of them. Russell Brand adds further misery to this needless remake by taking all the drunkenness out of Arthur. He's no longer a hilarious drunk, but a depressed man-child with a drinking problem (thank you AA). So now we have a remake of a film about a hilarious drunk who now is no longer really drunk. Yes alcoholism is a debilitating illness, but Arthur is about a billionaire drunk playboy and people came to the film to be entertained, not for a reminder that alcohol abuse is a serious illness. Avoid this film like you would a stray dog turd on the street and please see the Dudley Moore classic if you haven't already.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arthur</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw a few clips and I wasn't sure if a remake of the Dudley Moore/Liza Minnelli film was a good idea, I was tempted by the lead actor starring in the title role and the swayed again by the critics rating, but I did see it. Basically Arthur Bach (Russell Brand) is the spoilt rich drunken playboy, son and heir to a big family business run by his mother Vivienne (Geraldine James), who he calls by her first name, and all his is spends pots of cash on alcohol, partying, renting movie vehicles, unneeded ornaments and much more besides. He is told by his mother that he will only become the new chairman of her corporation Bach Worldwide and ultimately keep his fortune, including the $950 million inheritance, if he marries to arranged wife, shrewd assistant Susan (Jennifer Garner), who will take stable control. Arthur agrees to do this as he and Susan did have a history together once, and he gets permission from her father Burt Johnson (Nick Nolte), and the next day his opinion on the whole thing changes. He meets the beautiful illegal tour guide Naomi (Greta Gerwig) who takes an interest in him because of his rebellious nature, and while the wedding is being arranged he sneaks out for secret dates with her. Arthur's female butler and nanny Lillian Hobson (Dame Helen Mirren) doesn't normally like his taste in women, mostly prostitutes, but as she gets to know Naomi she grows to like her, with her ambition to get a children's story about the Statue of Liberty and other New York landmarks published. He has made his new lover interest happy with his high spending ventures, including emptying Grand Central Station for their first date, but Arthur wants to see if he can live like a normal man with a paid job, but this doesn't go well. After trying to sway Susan and one or two other attempts to stop marrying, without any success, he decides to tell Naomi the truth that he is engaged, of course she is upset and wants him to leave her alone. Arthur then has his driver Bitterman (Luis Guzmán) replacing Hobson who is in bed for a bad headache, but in fact she is suffering from an illness that is slowly killing her, and when she goes to hospital he does get Naomi to come and visit. When they look like they are going to make up, Susan arrives to rub her face in the engagement, and reveal that her recent publication of her children's book was in fact helped out by Arthur buying the publisher that did it, and she leaves. A few days later Hobson tragically dies and Arthur starts drinking again to numb the pain and loss, and eventually it comes to the day of the wedding, where he is not sober, and he gets a final letter from Hobson. From beyond the grave she tells him that he should follow his heart and do whatever it takes to get Naomi back, so he objects to his own wedding saying that he does not love Susan and that it is all a setup, and he tells Vivienne he is prepared to give up his fortune. Six months later, after she refused his offer to get back together, Arthur goes to buy a copy of Naomi's book, and he finds out she is reading it in the library, and in front of the children they eventually kiss and make up, and in the end, Arthur does still have his fortune. Brand gives a really good performance with well scripted wordy and drunken dialogue, Gerwig is nice despite not being as interesting as Minnelli, Mirren gets her moments although she isn't quite as credible as the Oscar winning performance Sir John Gielgud gave, and the supporting cast, especially Garner, are okay. The film is a nice simple story with most of the laughs not just coming from the lead character, but what puts a smile on your face is the fortune spelling ventures, including borrowing the Batmobile and The Delorean, and other good jokes besides, so it's not such a bad remake comedy. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a total disaster, but not anything to run out and see either.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The latest 80's remake comes to us in the form of "Arthur". Russell Brand is set loose in his first full-on starring vehicle. With ole Russell, you either like him or not. He works best in sparingly and his first lead film will test your tolerance of his shtick.There a several changes in the story, but the overall plot remains the same; rich, spoiled and lacking any kind of direction man is given an ultimatum; marry a woman hand-picked or loose said fortune.I will give the creators credit in that they updated the film to play directly to a modern audience. It doesn't follow the exact same blueprint as the 1981 film, it plays mostly to Brand's strengths and that does go a long way in enjoying the film.Helen Mirren takes the place of Sir John as Hobson, now, a life-long nanny rather than servant. She is good, as expected. Louis Guzman is funny as Brand's chauffeur Bitterman. He and Brand make a fun physical couple given their very distinct height and body type differences. Jennifer Garner is equal parts gorgeous and scary as Arthur's betrothed Susan. Nick Noelte pretty much plays a hyped of characterization of his usual tough-guy persona as Susan's dad. Finally there is Greta Gerwig as Naomi, the object of Arthur's affection. There are times that Greta is absolutely perfect, then times she falls flat. Not sure if it was just how she was playing Naomi or what, but I found her at times to be very amateur in her delivery. Not anything that torpedoes the movie, but I don't know, just something didn't quit click there all the time with her performance.The dialog in the film is pretty good, I would say even on par or better than the original. Again, much of it plays to Brand's style and if you like him, you will love the banter he engages.The one place that this film does fall short on compared to the original is the score and soundtrack music. There is really no definable theme to the score, they do throw pieces of the original's in here and there, but nothing discernible or as memorably as the original movie's score. As for the soundtrack, definitely nothing to compare to the title theme of the original, in fact, I can't even remember the songs that did play. This is lite stuff, nothing to rush out and see, perhaps a matinée at best and then just expect to have a little fun. If you are on the fence, stay there and wait for it to make it on disk and give it a rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original movie from 1981 is, and always will be a classic. The sequel on the other hand was one of the first head scratchers where movies that didn't really call for a sequel still got one. A common thing in the 80's (and still to a point now, when we are given so many sequels to movies that came out years and years ago).For anyone who hasn't seen the original, or is unaware of what the movie is about, the plot is pretty simple. Arthur Bach is a spoiled man-child, who never grew up, and is constantly inebriated. He squanders his families' vast fortune, and torments his loyal nanny. But one day Arthur is given an ultimatum to marry a woman that he doesn't love and keep his inheritance, if not he will lose it all. All while trying to win the heart of another woman that he truly does love. A lot like the original, which, let's face it if it works, don't break it. The new version isn't really anything different than the original film, and even hits most the same beats story wise. A few things are switched up here and there, but all the broad strokes of the original plot is intact. I will say it is mostly well casted, except for a few exceptions.I generally like Russell Brand in the right parts, and this would seem to be a shoe in to most, but he was basically mimicking Duddly Moore in this movie. Not really acting, just doing his shtick. It felt like if someone decided to go around doing Rodney Dangerfield's act just because he slightly reminded people of Dangerfield, even though he wasn't quite as sharp and witty. Brand has his moments in other movies, but this was just a remake that was not needed. It had it's amusing moments. I only chuckled a few times though.It reminded me of The Longest Yard remake. Had it's moments, a few went too far, but stuck with the basic story structure with no real horribly out of place twists for no real reason (Eh-hem...Nightmare on Elm Street...). But just felt unneeded and unwanted. Neither of those films did I ever look at and say, "This would be so much better if they remade this movie!" It is too much like the original to completely disregard and is passable. Nothing really called for this movie to warrant an update though. King Kong, I understand, it's been remade and sequelized in so many ways. New special effects technology and the iconic image make it a viable entity to be re-imagined in a whole new way. Unlike movies such as Longest Yard, and Arthur, where there is no real need for the films, but there have been MUCH worse remakes of others lately. Ones that would have been more suitable for repackaging and a nice polish bit the dust, but this movie is entertaining enough to catch on cable or cheap rental if your curiosity makes you.I'm actually surprised it wasn't made 5-10 years ago with Adam Sandler. He basically already remade it with "Billy Madison," only difference is school being the catalyst, not getting married as the reason for their possible loss of fortune. Would have at least been different that you could love or hate it on it's own merit. The remake on the other hand is too much of an over copied copy of the original though, looks like it, but a little muddy.I love the original, and even though the sequel did enough damage, this movie will leave a bad taste in the mouths of most fans of the original like spoiled cream, it was good before, but now it's just sour. Could've been worse but it's unneeded so that just makes it all the more redundant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wonder what studios are thinking when they release movies like this... other than greed and desperation. The original "Arthur", with Moore and Minnelli, held (and still does) top spot for my favorite comedy. Moore's Arthur was believable and offered moments of maturity, even in his inebriation. He was funny and endearing, but the film didn't condone the behavior. In this, the new Arthur, Brand is silly, foppish and the film appears to celebrate and explain away the behavior. The dialog runs amok with back story and cliché, with the androgynous Brand performing endless, pointless and boring shtick. How utterly embarrassing for Helen Miren!It goes to show that, these days, anyone can make at least one movie or music recording, regardless of talent and it seems creativity is at an all-time low in the industry.If anything, it should drive people to appreciate the original, all the Moore/more! I rented it for my 14 year-old grandsons and promptly rinsed their minds out with a session of "Pay It Forward" and "To Kill A Mockingbird" bleach.Brand should have taken on someone in his own weight class, instead he took a dive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A funny, real, and heartfelt movie that goes above and beyond the original Arthur</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having scene the original film and being a huge fan of Russel Brand, my heart was set on seeing this movie at the theatre. I wasn't quite sure what I was going to be served going into this remake or if it would live up to the original, but I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt. In all honesty, I was expecting them to make Arthur kind of ridiculous, look stupid, or just throw in the type of stupid comedy that many of the comedies are turning into these days. If I was judging it based on some of the trailers, especially the "wash your winky" scene, then I shouldn't be far off right? Wrong! Instead while watching the film I was pleasantly surprised and even exited. I think this remake did what any remake should do and give the story a new life and take it above and beyond the original. There was many parts in the original that skipped through scenes or ideas too fast, where in this one they chose to deal with it (for example Arther's mother and his alcoholism). Even Arthur's love interest is a lovable character that doesn't seem as needy or off track as the original character. It was charming, witty and heartfelt. I think it even went to a deeper level then the original. At one moment I was even a bit teary-eyed. If you want a movie that is funny, real and tells a great story definitely see Arthur.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tripe with a capital T</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest I was never really a fan of the original film, but Dudley Moore played the wayward richly spoilt character of the movie title impeccably, he was a funny guy and knew about timing and physically was able to make us all believe he was as drunk as he was portraying. We felt sorry for him without hating him....this remake however...or re- telling as I keep hearing Helen Mirren describing it, is banal rubbish of the highest order. Russell Brand is about as funny as slowly drowning in a cess pit, and countless times during the movie I was almost compelled to cut my own head off....just NOT funny. I was under the impression that a comedic film was at least in parts suppose to make you laugh or tweak some flicker of entertainment inside the watcher....this was just a bore, and Brand is just a Boor. He could not garner one iota of sympathy from this watcher as his cringe inducing clumsy and embarrassing performance unravelled, positively unlike-able. In this film, the afore mentioned Helen Mirren causes further embarrassment as she delivers hackneyed, cliché's while playing 'Hobson'...what on earth was she thinking of?....dire.This was 2 hours of 'humour' that seemed to be based on what was considered funny for 10 year olds in the early 70's on shows like 'Banana Splits' Brand tries to be funny, a little like Clive Dunn's character in 'Dad's Army'...he can't act, he isn't funny, just a little sad, charmless and thoroughly annoying...and he does this for every second he is on screen....garbage. Only consider watching this tripe if you have absolutely nothing at all in the world to do....ever.</fullReview>

Well then - why go at all? You have to approach this film as something new; then you will enjoy a simply entertaining film. Not a blockbuster; but entertaining. Russel Brand is very good, but I did find some of his lines hard to hear because they were very soft spoken. There are a number of funny, "under the breath" comments that I think were missed by some in the audience. Helen Mirren was excellent. Jennifer Garner seemed out of place in this film; she did not fit her role. I'm not familiar with Greta Gerwig's other work. I thought she presented a new, fresh face among young. actresses.

		<fullReview>I can only echo what most people have already said. Whoever thought that remaking this movie should have his head examined and his professional credentials seriously reviewed.Yes, Russell Brant is funny, in his way, but he is NO MATCH for the effortless, charming comedy of the dear, departed Dudley Moore. And though Helen Mirren is a fantastic actress, she in no way can come close to the incomparable John G. Totally different acting styles, and generations. Certainly she never shared the stage with Olivier.And there's no Lisa Minelli to make us really laugh. Like the scene when she is shoplifting and Arthur 'covers it up', meets her and sets the groundwork for the rest of the movie.Bottom line: Don't mess with something that cannot be done better. Period, the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Massive Bore with Fewer Laughs than the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I made the unfortunate mistake of watching the original ARTHUR from 1981 starring Dudley Moore before I went to see this remake in the theater. It was a funny movie, one that I was surprised I hadn't made time for before. I suppose it's possible that I might have enjoyed the new one more if I hadn't been spoiled by the original. The story is pretty much beat-for-beat just like the original, with some differences to modernize it for new audiences. Arthur Bach is a spoiled millionaire, living drunkenly of his family's immense wealth while getting into trouble in ways that only a rich man-child can...raging parties, a collection of movie cars, reckless spending at auctions, etc. He's cared for by his nanny Hobson, a stern woman who keeps him in line as best she can manage. As the movie begins, Arthur's mother is fed up with her son's reputation tainting her organization and she gives Arthur an ultimatum: marry a reputable woman (in this case, the manipulative and greed-driven Susan Johnson) or be cut off from the family fortune. Arthur's willing to play along until he meets Naomi Quinn, a lower-class girl who acts as an unlicensed New York tour guide to care for her father. So now Arthur must choose: marry a woman he loathes and keep the money, or follow his heart and live in poverty.I imagine this idea must've looked great on paper. A remake of a cult classic from the early 80's for a brand new audience. What better person to cast in the role of an iconic drunken playboy than comedian Russell Brand who, with the exception of loaning his voice to a few animated characters, has primarily made his career playing a wealthy man-child in FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL and GET HIM TO THE Greek. In the original, John Gielgud was hilarious as the pompous Hobson with his never-ending flow of snide comments (for which he won an Oscar). Helen Mirren should've been an inspired choice to step up and fill Hobson's shoes. And then Jennifer Garner as Susan...wait. Jennifer Garner? Whose decision was that? To be honest, none of the cast really seems to be trying here. I normally love Brand's antics, but his character here doesn't come off as a perpetually drunken yet lovable fool as well as Moore had done. Instead, Arthur just strikes me as an idiot. Half the time, I forget he's supposed to be drunk. He just comes off as a trust-fund kid with half a brain. Even Helen Mirren fails here. She's trying to do her best Gielgud impression, but she falls way short of being half as endearing as the original. And don't get me started on Greta Gerwig as Naomi. At least Liza Minnelli's Linda in the original came across as a street smart girl who made the most of her lower class lifestyle and found fun in the small things in life. Gerwig sort of hits that note, but less "intelligent" and more "naive and annoying".OK, so the cast is a bust. How about the story? When I hear of a remake/re-imagining, I expect a movie to keep the basic premise and characters but to put their own spin on the source material. ARTHUR baffled me in the theater as I realize the film is an almost beat-for-beat remake. Aside from modern additions like the Batmobile or Arthur's magnetic hovering bed, the film is way too similar to the original to have even bothered being made. There is one major exception to this: the original was goofy fun whereas the 2011 film comes across as just sappy. Sure it's got its funny moments, but they're surprisingly few and far between. There were major stretches in this movie where I was just bored. It takes itself too seriously. Arthur's alcoholism in the original was a character quirk that made the movie funny. It made Arthur what he was. Here, it's treated like a detrimental flaw and that must be corrected before we roll end credits. The movie even goes on ten minutes longer than it needs to just because Arthur living in drunken bliss with Naomi isn't enough...he needs to be sober too. So we're treated to an extra ten minutes of irrelevant crap when we just want the movie to end. The happily ever after part already should've happened....why is this movie still going?! Arthur's character arc completed when he realized some things in life are more important than money...not when he conquers alcohol addiction. I think the filmmaker's must've forgotten this.I'm sure it sounds like I'm being overly harsh on a movie despite giving it a mediocre rating. That's because it's not a horrible movie...it's just no where near what I was hoping/expecting it to be. Brand's role as Arthur should've sealed it. He was honestly the best possible choice for the character, in my opinion. But the script was too weak for even a combination of Brand and Mirren to save. The movie is still a comedy and there are some funny bits, but there wasn't enough. Too much sap, not enough laughs. If you've never seen the original, you might be able to stomach this movie better than I did. Then again, if you haven't seen the original, skip this version and go watch the good one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original and this new Arthur both have things to recommend them. What I much, much preferred about this new one was the resolution. In the old Arthur (spoiler!), Moore's Arthur remains an alcoholic to the last. When I first saw it, this "resolution" sat like a lump of cold lard in my values processing engine, as it added a new chapter to the Myth of the Happy Alcoholic. Frankly, I sort of wonder if the primary reason for a remake was to set the karmic record of the basic scenario--which has tremendous charm and humor--straight.Beside this, it was what a remake should be; a creative exploration of a wonderful scenario idea: In the right hands, they could remake Arthur every year with no ill effects. This Arthur brought every bit as much of the same comic cheek and invention to the concept as the original, if not more.A lot of folks are dissing Brand; I think he's a comic genius and has marvelous stage presence. It warms my heart to see him taking direction so well and creating an Arthur who looks death in the face and responds as one must; with life-altering vigor and purpose.All that said, it must be pointed out that the direction *was* over-the-top; not out of place for a comic scenario, even one as profound and timeless as this one: I was happy to overlook the excesses and get some good larfs in.If you watched the original, please don't cue this one up with plans to savage Brand on Moore's terms: See it as though for the first time, with an open mind. I think you'll agree it was high time for an update.</fullReview>

Totally disconnected from reality, not because the luxury but because the fantasy world the setting is in. The guy tries to be funny with that annoying voice pitch but does not succeed; the same with the talking with the drunk voice w/o having a drink. What I wonder is how directors and producers can spend so much money in a senseless movie without realizing that what they are doing is not right; mass hypnotism? The timing in the movie was bad; reactions odd and the plot too mechanic. I then watched the old film people talk about and realized that what the new film lacks is class. The combination of actors and the context of the movie did not fit the overall plot.</fullReview>

Why Helen Mirren lowered herself to play in such an awful film I will never understand. Russell Brand as Arthur plays a poor drunk, and Gretra Gerwig playing Naomi has no personality to talk of. Why I wasted my time watching the whole film I don't know. It was patently clear within 10 minutes how bad it was going to be. Remakes of classics are always dangerous. This shows none of the charm or wit of the original. Even as a film taken by itself without the original to compare it is rubbish.

		<shortDescription>That Respectability That Old Money Brings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this remake of Arthur, 30 years after the original came out placed a lot more emphasis on physical comedy. That's more Russell Brand's shtick, but I think Dudley Moore did a whole lot more with Arthur Bach using character development.Regardless it's still the same futile drunken playboy who can't stand on his own two feet. Filthy rich, but without any kind of skills to survive in the real world, Arthur just drifts night to night getting stupidly drunk and causing all kinds of grief.There's not much you can do with him and his widowed mother who left him in the care of nanny Helen Mirren has a plan to merge a pair of fortunes. Nouveau rich Jennifer Garner and her father Nick Nolte who is a self made millionaire want a little of that respectability that old money brings. In Europe you marry a title, in America you marry a Ford, a Rockefeller, or a Bach in this case.The fly in the ointment is that Brand has fallen for middle class girl Greta Gerwig who wants to write children's stories. Whatever heart that Brand's mother Geraldine James has and it ain't much, Brand is about to break.Of course the big change in this version is Helen Mirren becoming a nanny and taking the place of John Gielgud who won an Academy Award as Hobson the butler. Sad to say I knew at least one Arthur in my own life though he was a gay version of the character. Whether you're raised by distant parents or a hired nanny at some point in your life you have to take control. Nobody let's him grow up and sad to say that includes his closest confidante Mirren.If you've seen the first version than you know what's going happen in the film. This version of Arthur does have its merits, but I really recommend seeing what Dudley Moore did with the part before judging this one.</fullReview>

It mirrors the life of Russell Brand in some ways, who has himself lived quite a life and I admire him for being able to portray a likeness of himself in the film.Helen Mirren and Greta Gerwig did well in the film. It is the first film I have seen with Greta Gerwig who reminds me of the late Brittany Murphy and it was a huge surprise to read her biography and discover that she is multi-talented.The film has quite good punchlines and made me laugh. There were some crass bits but they were excusable because they helped to bring out the story. There were parts that were rather predictable but I enjoyed the film as a whole notwithstanding. I liked the way Russell Brand delivered his lines in his accent which was clearly distinguishable from Helen Mirren's despite both of them being English.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Arthur</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Can one lose touch with reality? I suppose if one has multi-millions to one's name without even trying, then probably yes. There's a rather poignant moment in the film that a key character hammers this point home to the titular Arthur, played by Russell Brand, that brought out a smile inside of me since it brought to mind how some folks in power start behaving as ridiculously as Arthur and spouting some of the most inane nonsense just because they can, and do so because there's not a worry in their world possessing that kind of obscene wealth.Yet again we have another remake of a movie descend upon us, with the original Arthur some 30 years ago played by the late comedian Dudley Moore. Russell Brand takes over the main role as the alcoholic playboy whose family riches fuels his major consumption habits of wine, women, and plenty of movie cars from the Batmobile to the DeLorean without time travel components. Getting into trouble seems to be his hobby, with butler and driver Bitterman (Luis Guzman) and nanny Hobson (Helen Mirren) ever ready to bail him out. You wonder just when this man child will grow up, which forms the crux of the issue at hand when his mom Vivienne (Geraldine James) issues an ultimatum for him to marry her trusty assistant, the ambitious Susan (Jennifer Garner) or be cut off from his inheritance of a billion dollars forever.It brings to mind just how some will want to be amongst the elites and are willing to do just about anything to achieve that. And while Jennifer Garner has limited screen time to make you really hate her Susan character, you can feel the type of craving she goes after to be associated with a family with its own coat of arms. With her rich contractor dad (Nick Nolte) money isn't an issue, but to be associated with Arthur's last name of Bach that owns a global conglomerate rather than to still be looked down upon for a less than modest family background, now that's something to aspire to, even if it means going through a sham marriage that Arthur is reluctant to get into. I suppose this also carries some weight when put into political ambition that we see today, since some lust after the more surefire way to get into a seat of power through the compromising of principles, versus the school of harder knocks when sticking to one's ideals against something that's fundamentally wrong.And it's also because the story's actual romantic thread has that something going on between Arthur and a random lady he meets on the streets, the tour guide Naomi (Greta Gerwig), who proves to Arthur that life isn't necessarily always centered around the money, although you do know that a little something does help with the daily bills, and a network of names do help to open doors to new opportunities, just as how Arthur helps her on the sly to push her writing/drawing talents through. In fact this films is really about Arthur and the four women in his life, one after his last name, his mother, his true romantic interest, and Hobson.Originally a male butler in the original, this remake has Helen Mirren step in as the nanny, or more accurately the surrogate mother since Arthur's biological one cannot peel herself away from the business. For all his flaws, Hobson is the one to see through to Arthur's strength, even though his constant shenanigans test her every patience. Helen Mirren and Russell Brand share that incredible chemistry together on screen, that probably gave reason enough why someone ought to sit through this remake, with Mirren putting in her fair share of gravitas in a role that may seem like an over-glamorous Alfred role to a Bruce Wayne, dishing out good advice laced with sarcasm if warranted.And the subplot which took the cake involves Arthur being woken up to have lost touch with the common man, and to prove a point he was to seek a job, which naturally demonstrated he cannot. It's a reminder to those sitting in ivory towers that without coming down once in a while in all earnestness to learn about the plight of the masses, one can almost be sure of losing touch, and begin to spout nonsense and behaving in a jackass fashion like how Arthur does it. I hate to politicize the film, but with the environment we're in currently, one cannot fail to see how there are those who belong to the Arthur camp, others belonging to the Susans of the world, or even the Hobsons who remain blindly loyal and probably see gold even when Arthur descends into idiocy.</fullReview>

Finally, he conveys the closeness Arthur feels for his nanny magnificently I shouldn't have been moved by anyone in this film - this was supposed to be a comedy, laced with Brand-style theatrics! And here I was, in tears at several points in the movie, I'm talking tears I haven't shed since watching The Notebook! This film took me by complete surprise. In fact, my expectations were low, I decided to watch the movie on Saturday afternoon simply to fill in my day. If anyone is reading this, looking to watch a hilarious movie with a moving storyline, then please give this movie a chance. If anything, don't go watch this movie with "re-make" in your mind. Treat it as its own movie, independent from the previous Arthur, and judge Brand accordingly. You will be surprised!</fullReview>

To be honest, the movie really shouldn't be considered a comedy. I didn't laugh throughout the entire a movie and just managed to force a small chuckle and an awkward smile in one or two moments. You see the trailer and that is it, nothing left for the six pounds I paid to see this rubbish! Furthermore the lack of acting skills from Greta Gerwig who plays Arthur's dream girl Naomi, who is at some points uncomfortable to watch. Also the over sense of childish humour and speech from Brand is at times pointless and needy.A good comment though is the expected brilliant performance from Helen Mirren who portrays Arthur's long term nanny. She really lifts up the film and gives it a sense of character and good sarcastic personality.Overall I wouldn't really recommend it if your expecting laugh out loud comedy and decent performances, so to be perfectly honest, don't really bother.By Liam de Gruchy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking." Shakespeare's OthelloRussell Brand may not be as convincing a drunk as Dudley Moore in the original Arthur, but Brand makes the titular man-child as endearing as he could be given the premise of the comedy. Writer Peter Baynham brings some of the manic madness and tossed-off lines of Bruno to complement Brand's physicality for a pleasantly witty if not totally amusing satire of the idle rich.Helen Mirren does well as his butler, Hobson, a middle-aged Mary Poppins, although decidedly darker. (Sir John Gielgud in the original would be tough to imitate.) Their relationship substitutes very nicely, thank you, for the lack of one between Arthur and his real mother (an effectively stiff Geraldine James). Her demand that he marry the social-climbing Susan (Jennifer Garner) or be disinherited is the romantic setup for him falling in love with "nobody" Naomi (Greta Gerwig). "Setup" for such set pieces as a deserted Grand Central Terminal with a "Pez" candy dinner and acrobats, a not terribly funny exhibition of Arthur's childlike charm.I was greatly amused by the homage to Hitchcock, Rear Window specifically, when Arthur looks from his tub with golden binoculars at pedestrians who remind him of pop cult figures, some wittily chosen to resemble those close to him such as Hobson.One of the small lessons of the film is that true love should be the reason for marriage, and more importantly AA is an effective solution for drinking problems. The film, after all, is about an immature rich man's discovering his inner man through sobriety. Doesn't sound that romantic, does it? Well, it isn't, even though the characters are enviably happy in the process, as is this movie-going experience. "A very merry, dancing, drinking, laughing, quaffing, and unthinking time."

		<fullReview>Totally utterly mind numbingly awful. Russell Brand is about as funny as a burning orphanage - quite why this gangly, massive faced idiot is popular is frankly beyond belief. I am led to believe his fans like the way he speaks in that mockney poetic nonsensical kind of way believing he has some kind of intellect. Well yes I can understand if he speaks fast enough and uses x number of big words he is seemingly intelligent to the average sheep. The film is a remake of an 80s film and also stars the endless bore that is Helen Mirren. The second 'queen' of england has the ability in any interview to talk a glass eye to sleep. She outright dismisses the original (normally the kiss of death) as 'boring' as alcoholism is not a funny subject. Anything is a funny subject - if its funny. Get it Helen? I seem to recall around the time the original was made Mrs Mirren was busy getting her kit off in every film she made so leave it out love. Anyway stay well clear unless you are a fan of Brand in which case I am obviously a 'hater'. However the opinion of anyone who would use that word wouldn't really matter to me anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was unfunny from the very start. All the gags (Arthur's Batmobile crashing into the famous Bull stature on Wall Street)were forced and unrealistic (in the movie when they crashed they only knocked it off its foundation rather than be smashed and killed as would happen in reality when they hit such an heavy object). There's also a scene where somehow he manages to clear Grand Central Station of every single person so he can have a romantic dinner in the middle of the place for an hour.Helen Mirren is completely wasted. She's a grand actress worthy of good parts. In this movie is doesn't even have to act. She just has to look stodgy, cold, and indifferent to Arthur's shenanigans. This part did not require her to call upon here skills.Greta Gerwig (who plays Arthur's girlfriend)is annoying in her role...she can't act and she's not particularly good looking. She plays a person who dreams about writing children's books...and the one that we get treated to sounds really lame...but, of course, in this movie, it unrealistically becomes a best seller.Most of the movie is predictable and trite. I don't recall much of the original Arthur, but I do remember being more entertained with that earlier version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Helen Mirren, a smart script and nuanced direction make this a great remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't say I was particularly looking forward to the remake of Arthur. I'd seen the original on HBO at some point as a teen, and it didn't do much for me. I didn't understand the Oscar wins for John Gielgud (Supporting Actor) and Best Original Song win for Christopher Cross' "Arthur's Theme (Best That You Can Do)." I never really got Liza Minnelli's appeal, either.The film fared considerably better when I watched it on Netflix Streaming earlier today. Gielgud's sandpaper dry wit impressed. Liza was more likable than I'd recalled. The song--well, I still hate the song. But the screenplay and direction by Steve Gordon is solid throughout, and Dudley Moore is perfect in the lead role.Which brings us to the new Arthur and the trepidation I felt even more strongly after watching the original. The commercials and trailers have focused on Russell Brand's Arthur as an even-more cartoony playboy than Moore's version, including over-the-top adventures such as dressing as Batman and driving around in the Batmobile. I've also never been completely sold on Brand, who at 6-2 stands about a full foot taller than did Moore. I've liked him in small portions, as in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, but found him a bit tiring in larger doses. The casting of Jennifer Garner--and her prominent billing on the poster--also seemed strange: This is the role of Susan, the bride in Arthur's arranged marriage, not the female lead. Instead, indie queen Greta Gerwig (who is so "art house" she actually starred in a film entitled "Art House") would be playing the Liza Minnelli role (Linda then, Naomi now) of Arthur's working-class true love.Only the presence of Helen Mirren, taking over for Gielgud in the gender-switched role of Hobson, left me feeling much hope that the new Arthur wouldn't be a complete wreck.I was way off. This movie's actually quite good. And if you're factoring in it being a remake (most suck) and a romantic comedy (most suck), the new Arthur is especially impressive. The commercials are doing it a disservice: The new Arthur is very funny throughout its running time, updates the story to modern-day sensibilities in an intelligent fashion, and manages to broaden and expand upon the more dramatic aspects of the original. In some ways, quite honestly, it's a better film. Hats off in particular to screenwriter Peter Baynham, who handled this tricky assignment with aplomb. His script actually is fairly reverent to the 30-year-old original, selectively using plot lines, scenes and even occasional dialogue where it fits. But he also brings the relationships and sexual/class politics into the 21st century, and finds an intelligent way to address the elephant in the room: in both films, Arthur is an alcoholic.The original film, for example, has Moore swigging from a bottle of rum in a paper bag while driving on the highway... without any consequences. His alcoholism is treated simply as an aspect of his immaturity. Brand's Arthur never drives drunk--his chauffeur, Bitterman (Luis Guzman in the remake) handles all the driving--but his drinking causes real consequences, and he's forced to address them.Does that sound too heavy for a romantic comedy? It doesn't play that way, thanks to Baynham's script, savvy performances by the leads, and nuanced direction by Jason Winer (making his feature film debut). It's not surprising that Winer is the co-executive producer (and a regular director) of Modern Family, because Arthur replicates that show's mix of believable character interactions and laugh-out-loud humor.Anyone who's seen the original will know all the major plot points, because this truly is a remake in that sense. You reach the same destination, you just take a few different roads (including a couple of gender twists).Arthur, an immature playboy who has never worked a day in his life, will be cut off from the family fortune--close to $1 billion--unless he marries Susan (Garner), whose family ties can be beneficial to the corporation run by Arthur's mother (father in the original). Unfortunately, Arthur has fallen in love with another: Naomi, who runs illegal (albeit popular) tours of Grand Central Station and other NYC landmarks. The casting is mostly on point. Mirren is pitch-perfect in the plum role of Hobson, giving the relationship with Arthur an intriguing maternal slant absent from the original. Gerwig finds just enough grit in her character to keep Naomi from becoming too pixie-like. And Garner fits perfectly in a role right in her range, providing the toughness and attitude the character of Susan desperately needed in the original.As for Brand... he's really not too bad. The comic scenes are his forte, of course, and he's a blast throughout those--funny, smart, charismatic, appealing. He's a bit less successful in the dramatic scenes, but still not too bad. We don't quite get a peek into the darkness we know is dwelling deep inside Arthur, but Brand certainly goes a few places he's never gone before and shows promise.A few small problems hurt the film. It runs a bit long at 110 minutes; an even 100 would have worked better, especially near the end. Those trims would have been welcome in a few scenes around the film's middle where Arthur tries his hand at gainful employment; they felt like studio-mandated bits of broad humor that don't play well with the drier wit and general smarts of the rest. Finally, Nick Nolte appears in a couple of scenes as Susan's tough-guy father, and he's frankly hard to understand.Despite those issues, the new Arthur really is a lot of fun. Compared to most romantic comedies, it's funnier, smarter, sharper and even occasionally touching, and Mirren's performance is worth at least an Oscar nomination of her own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unncessary remake of a classic falls far short of brilliance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose if I were to do a remake of the 1981 movie "Arthur" I could do worse than cast Russell Brand in the title role. He most closely matches the comic talent of Dudley Moore, who starred in the original. The point is, however, why do the remake in the first place? There is an inherent danger in attempting to resurrect a classic, which the original movie certainly was. The new version performs a couple of sex changes. The first transforms Hobson from a man - expertly portrayed in the original in an Oscar-winning performance by Sir John Gielgud - to a female nanny, played by Helen Mirren. Arthur's controlling parent this time around is his mother rather than his father. Other than that, there is little in this effort that is original. Don't get me wrong: Brand is a gifted comedic actor. But in my book, Dudley Moore was - and always will be - Arthur. With Netflix, Redbox and other services available, there is no excuse for those who haven't seen the original "Arthur" to watch this inferior version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The fact that critics and the majority of users on here have attacked this film saddens me. I think that Russell Brand did very good job and diverted himself from his other work quietly nicely. The fact that it was PG13 amazed me and I thought the film would suffer because of it but it didn't. Since it was a remake of an old 80's film, it felt quite fitting that Brand's style of humor was toned back and relied more on wit rather than shock. The story whilst predictable was warm and entertaining, what a movie should be: feel good. Don't listen to what the critics say or what the Russell Brand haters say (they just jealous because he's married to Katie Perry), go out and see this movie. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arthur remake shows audiences a silly and heart-warming character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie that I wasn't expecting much from this year was the remake of the classic 1981 comedy Arthur. I could just see from the film's trailers that this remake would deliver cheesy and flat gags and just barely cover the main aspects of the movie like the relationship between Arthur and his nanny Hobson and his obsessive need for alcohol. I hate to admit though, I was pleasantly surprised. Even though, it doesn't compare to the original; Arthur starring Russell Brand turns out to be humorous and heart-warming comedy that can be enjoyed during an agreeable matinée.The movie revolves around the world of happy-go-lucky millionaire playboy Arthur Bach played by Russell Brand (Get Him to the Greek). Arthur? to sum him up. He's basically a man-child. All he wants to do his party, party, party and drink, drink, drink and have some fun when he has nothing better to do. After, a couple of inebriated shenanigans in the Big Apple, his mother tells that she can't take his bulls#*t anymore and threatens to cut him off from his supplied fortune. In order to not lose everything, Arthur unwillingly agrees to marry a successful business woman named Susan Johnson played by Jennifer Gardner (Alias) who, if married into his family, will regain the Bach's economic respect from their investors because of you know whose high jinxes. While Arthur is grieving about his horrific decision, he runs into this cute aspiring children's book author named Naomi played by Greta Gerwig (No Strings Attached). Arthur becomes completely enamored with her and respects her free-spiritedness and rebelliousness. Now, it seems that Arthur is in a bit of a pickle and must decide whether or not to marry a woman who he has nothing in common, but he gets to keep his vast fortune or, spend the rest of his life penniless with a woman who really understands him.People know Russell Brand for his Adam Sandlerish performances in his films like Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Get Him to the Greek. But like Sandler in The Wedding Singer, Brand is very toned downed quite a bit here and it's not exactly a bad thing; it's actually a great thing because us the audience are able to connect to him on a emotional level and at the end we care about him and where he'll end up. The big thing that the film's director Jason Winer (Modern Family) fleshes out is Arthur being a heavy drinker like the original. Arthur realizes throughout the course of the film that his drinking is pushing the ones he loves away from him. He begins to battle his rebellious side as he tries to make amends with his addiction as he goes through failed attempts to contribute in AA meetings and treats all it like a big joke.I was really looking forward to the rendition of Arthur and Hobson played by Helen Mirren (The Queen) and their contrasting relationship of Hobson taking care of Arthur and Arthur doing his thing and acting like a drunken idiot! The best scenes in the movie are with Arthur and Hobson and just the great chemistry that Brand and Mirren create from the silly dialogue. Some might say that Hobson is a bit cold toward Arthur, but honestly, she pretty much has to in order to make some kind of dent in his brain that will make him act responsible for once. When all of this tension fades in certain moments, Hobson really does express her true motherly compassion for him and that she would do anything for him.Since Arthur is a millionaire, he has to buy all kinds of movie memorabilia like the Batmobile, the time-traveling Delorian from Back to the Future, and the mystery van from Scooby Doo. His penthouse suite is great to look at as he has a magnetic bed that hovers above the bed, a huge home theater that shows Looney Tunes 24/7! It was also funny to just hear all of the lavish things he bought and a couple weeks later he gets bored with like a pet Giraffe that he fed up with because it wouldn't wear the clothes Arthur wanted him to wear, go figure. The movie's set designer did an incredible job in making Arthur's room just too cool! Even though, I'm praising this film for being cute and touching; there are a decent amount of flaws that contribute to the film being annoying sometimes. Brand's acting did get on my nerves quite a few times and his squeaky accent did sound like he was sucking on helium off stage. Brand also couldn't help to rush through his dialogue like at the speed of sound, so it tore away from the story's progression. The performance that I thought wasn't really necessary was Nick Nolte (Hotel Rwanda) and his portrayal of Susan's dangerous and crazy father. I really thought his dialogue was terrible and with his gruff voice I could barely make out what he was saying half the time.This film isn't perfect, but it does give audience something they wouldn't expect? a funny and likable character who reinvents himself to save him and the ones he cares for from an inevitable car wreck of compulsion. This film delivers the themes of the original Arthur, that the fans will want to see maybe even done better, like his alcohol addiction and the funny back and forth between Arthur and Hobson. I wasn't exactly blown away in hilarity with Arthur, but I was pleasantly surprised with it and admittedly I would recommend this film to friend of mine. I'd just ask them not to pay full price to see it, that's all. Three out of four popcorn bags for Arthur.</fullReview>

I liked this a little better then then last years Get Him To The Greek(2010). And I thought he could'nt play out of his goofiness, but he proved me wrong here. Helen Mirren is also as Hobson(this time a nanny, taking over for John Gielguds butler). I hope she will be nominated, she was quite a scene stealer.Jennifer Garner was good, so was Greta Gerwig. And Nick Nolte is memorable as Garners crazy father. This film was entertaining, but not a masterpiece, It's just a movie that you'll enjoy from time to time like the original 1981 version.

		<shortDescription>Give This Remake A Chance - Well Done Brand</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of the original Arthur and the genius of Dudley Moore, make no mistake. As such, I went into this film with low-expectations as I would with any remake.To my surprise, I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I found it charming, witty, and its New York backdrop quite lovely. Let's face it, Russell Brand was going to be bashed from the get go for taking on such a beloved role, but he really did a wonderful job. The magic of the original Arthur was Dudley's performance and wit, as well as the relationship between Arthur and Hobson. Both Brand's performance and the relationship between Arthur and Hobson (Helen Mirren) are in tact here. I found myself emotional during several scenes between Brand and Mirren. When is Helen Mirren not fantastic, btw? As far as the supporting cast, Greta Gerwig really sparkles in her understated twist on the original Liza Minnelli role. She is the breakout star here. Great chemistry between Gerwig and Brand too.This isn't for everyone, and it will never replace the original by any means. But, do yourself a favor and give it a chance!</fullReview>

And how we as a society are obsessed with owning things and why.How the things we own at times really own us? And perhaps that what the movie should of been about. Also, it's hard to relate to a billionaire man/child in today's current world. Kind of a strange move for Hollywood, isn't it? Giving us a story about a rich guy who isn't happy!

		<shortDescription>Another remake that you may or may not like</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second movie I saw today was none other than Russell Brand's Arthur, the remake about a millionaire with lots of toys and lots of empty glasses. When I first saw the trailer for this movie I rolled my eyes and thought, "Great date movie to have teens make out in." Fortunately I was wrong and instead was very pleased with the results I saw in this remake.Let's start with the positives: The first positive was how dynamic Russell Brand was in this movie. Up until now I had only seen Brand act as a wise cracking rabbit, a computer graphic dork, or an insane party boy that liked drugs, booze, or acted strange. In this movie he still had a lot of alcohol involved in his character and played the same part the same way we have seen him do a hundred times. However this time, we get to see Brand take on a character that is truly in love, which is quite often in this movie. The director of this film brilliantly integrated the drunk nature of Arthur with the true love side, which forced Brand to have to explore his acting dynamics in this film. I'm happy to say that he did this quite well and really made Arthur a believable human being. However, this movie would not be nearly half as good without the talents of Hellen Mirren and Greta Gerwig who played the nanny and love interest respectively. The group dynamics played between these three was fantastic and formed an interesting relationship. The constant struggle Arthur faced to listen to his heart and to his nanny, really made the situation seem real. Although it was a little extreme, the choice Arthur had to make is similar to the crucial decisions the typical human has to make. It's not always easy and there are times where you may think everyone else is correct, but in the end you have to figure out what is right. Thus, the characters were very believable. The acting was also great in this movie, which further added to the believability of this movie and made the movie feel real. It wasn't overacted as we have seen in a lot of recent romance and drama movies as of late, and it wasn't all about touching and caressing as Twilight constantly does. Another positive was the quirky nature of the dialog, the large quantity of one liners, and the constant spoutings of Mirren's character. Other positives about this movie were the fast pace of the movie, the dynamic toys and settings that Arthur dwelled in and the rest of the cast having great support.Weaknesses: Perhaps the biggest weakness of this movie is the predictability of the story. It's another romantic comedy where the protagonist pines after one girl and you can probably guess the ending. Other things that were not expected from the trailers were quickly predicted by the dialog and hints given by the scenes. Another weakness was the whole Garner drunk scene where her hammered nature had using sloppy, slutty dialog that reminds me a lot of some of my friends. It was really not my kind of comedy, and reminded me more of a big budget glee scene. However, others may like it. Other people may also get tired of the constant alcohol usage in the movie. It seems that the source of Arthur's comedy is being drunk and eventually it can get a little tiring, of seeing him stumble or sound like he is in ecstasy. Other than that there was little I could think of that really made this movie weak.To sum it all up, Arthur was a fun remake that I thoroughly enjoyed and laughed at. I felt the group dynamics were well played, the acting was for the most part solid, and the story was pretty well driven and fast enough to not bore you. There are a lot of one liners and alcohol humor and again depending on what makes you laugh and your tolerance for one liners you may or may not get annoyed. Overall I would probably give this movie an 8.5, but I'll give it a nine at most. Until next weekend enjoy and email me at rgkarim@mail.roanoke.edu to help me become a better editor.</fullReview>

Russell Brand seems to be getting better at his roles such as from Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Get Him To The Greek and Hop.The film is full of comedy as Russell Brand is a natural comedian. And the film does very well from start to finish.Also, Helen Mirren and Russell Brand share that incredible chemistry together on screen. That probably gave the reason enough why someone ought to sit through this remake.Overall, Arthur is a fun remake (even though I has seen the original) which I enjoyed. The film is funny, moving &amp; full of fun. This film is an like it or not like film but give the film a chance and see what you thought.Verdict: 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems these days it is far too easy to dismiss a film simply because it bears to resemblance to a previous film and shares its title. Instead of concentrating on whether this is better or worse than the original you should instead watch this film with the open mind it deserves.It doesn't try to be clever, Brand while not my favourite actor has a personality that fits the character perfectly, who else could have been cast in such an extrovert fantastical role. The brief aim is clearly to guide the viewer through a fantastic tale of love and the moralistic tale of how money can't buy you love no matter how hard you try.The plot is well rounded and the casting great, yes there are some stereotypes (Mirren as the nanny) but these are there to add and not detract from the movie. Really this movie should be taken at face value and let it fill you with the happiness that is intended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'ARTHUR': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Remake of the 1981 (some would say classic) Dudley Moore film 'ARTHUR'. This one stars Russell Brand in the title role, as a self indulgent alcoholic man child who falls in love with a girl he doesn't deserve. It's directed by Jason Winer (who's only other credit is directing TV, most notably 13 episodes of 'MODERN FAMILY') and written by Perer Baynham (based on a script by Steve Gordon). I don't remember the Moore 80's film and therefor don't have fond memories to compare it to. I can say this version neither lived up to nor disappointed my expectations. It was mostly a waste but mildly amusing.Brand plays Arthur Bach, the heir to an indescribable fortune but only if he marries an equally self absorbed heiress (Jennifer Garner). He falls for a poor self employed tour guide (Greta Gerwig) who's so far out of his league that the movie is insulting to suggest she would even consider going out with him. She supposedly see's through his selfish humanity wasting exteriors and is attracted to him, despite his apocalyptic endorsing flaws. A sweet romance develops.This movie is especially insulting in today's economy but it does have some good laughs, decent performances and adequate directing. Brand isn't bad in the lead but he's so much better in ensemble casts like the turns he played in 'FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL' and 'GET HIM TO THE Greek'. The supporting cast is no more impressive, except for Helen Mirren who is the best reason to see this movie. Garner looks beautiful but embarrasses herself here and Gerwig looks cute (I'm sure she's a promising up and coming actress but here her only skill is appearing likable). Next time you're watching 'SCHINDLER'S LIST' remember this movie when Oscar is talking about all the lives he could have saved by not purchasing a pen.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWEHzfCd7M</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why does everyone hate this film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, this is my first film review on IMDb. I have recently decided that I pretty much like all films, there are very few i wouldn't watch again, so baring that in mind, this might be a little too positive.I enjoy Russell Brand's performances, from his films, to stand-up to his presenting of silly MTV shows. And this was possibly his best. I haven't seen the original, although i plan to do so soon, but Russell Brand just seemed to suit this roll. He has a very unique personality and quite clearly brings that to all his performances, and this was no different, he brought so much depth to his character.The story line was very inspiring, although I though the last few scenes could have been extended a little, as the conclusion, although obvious happened a bit too quickly for my liking. The relationships set up were interesting and explored throughout, and the most developed and touching one was between Brands and Helen Mirrens character, they both played their parts superbly and had great chemistry.Essentially this is a light hearted comedy, with a nice story thats a bit different to what i've seen before. It will be interesting to compare it to the original, but as a Russell Brand 'fan' i will probably prefer this one. I really just wanted to write this because i was shocked to see to many negative reviews.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arthur Review by Brian W</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off Russell Brand is a comedic genius - If you only take away one item from this review, it should be that.Arthur (2011) is a remake of the 1981 Arthur, which starred Dudley More &amp; Liza Minnelli. Let me say the original is a classic, if you have not seen it you should put it at the top of your Netflix queue, John Gielgud playing Hobson in an Academy Award winning role.The best way for you to approach this remake is to hold off on comparisons, because it sadly does not hold a candle to the original.BUT! This is still a fun and cute movie. As I implied before Russell Brand is absolutely adorable in the lead. You can see that Brand's personal life has helped him train for this role. I absolutely buy him as an alcoholic with a heart of gold. The other core of this movie is Helen Mirren. What can I say about Ms. Mirren that everyone doesn't already know? She is one of the greatest actresses of our time! Of course you already knew that. Mirren plays her role so lovable and still so dark at the same time, you can't help but love everything she says. You also love Mirren because when the scene has to become serious and you need a real actor to step in you know that Mirren is more that qualified for the job. These two are fantastic together I would probably watch them do anything, even watching them comment on paint dry.The hidden gem of this movie, as everyone else is saying, is Greta Gerwing. She is so adorable. Throughout the movie you fall in love with this girl and her personality. Gerwig's character falling in love with the horrible yet still uber charming character of Arthur is completely believable. The scene when she and Hobson are grilling each other in Arthur's home theater is pure fun.The other supporting female of the movie is Jennifer Garner, she plays SusanJohnson, the character who is set to marry Arthur. She is quite fine in her role and I enjoyed her. Garner steals the show in one scene, when she drunkenly impersonates a sexy kitty a top Arthur's magnetic bed - quite possibly the hardest I laughed in the movie. Luis Guzman is also in the movie as Bitterman, Arthur's driver. Guzman gets a few laughs but is pretty absent for most of the movie. (Which could be a good or bad thing, I am not quite sure yet.) Finally you have the ever-crazy Nick Nolte, showing up for about a total of 10 insane minutes, all of which are a bit on the silly side.The movies plot is nearly the same as the original, with some updates to modern time. The movie has been tailored a little bit to fit Brand's sense of humor, and with that has its hits and misses. I think that you will have fun with this movie depending on how much you like Russell Brand, since the movie is mostly Brand having fun. Overall I enjoyed the movie very much. This is the perfect date night movie, something for both the guy and girl to enjoy. It was a small cute little remake, but try not to think of it as a remake and you will have more fun.I give the movie a 7.5 out of 10 / or a B Thank you again for reading and as always ENJOY THE MOVIES!

		<shortDescription>More real than the original. Brand and Gerwig are great! (As are Mirren, a good guy, and Garner, a villain)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must confess to being one of the curmudgeons who found the original "Arthur" really bad. Drunkenness has never been funny to me. Loutishness, narcissism and a life without vision or purpose has also been nothing to tolerate, let alone boast about, in my world. When I heard that this new incarnation of the old Dudley Moore movie was markedly unlike the original, that actually prompted me to give it a go. Plus, I have always found Russell Brand's loopy self-absorption kind of funny (he loves his mum!).This new version was much better cast than the original. John Gielgud simply had too much gravitas and dignity to have really tolerated that Dudley Moore Arthur. He wouldn't have stayed more than a few days, then he would have booked out of there. And whatever good qualities Liza Minnelli may have possessed, sexual appeal, charm, and romantic potential were totally not among them from my perspective.This time Helen Mirren as the Gielgud character lets on that she too may have a few dark corners of her libidinous make-up, and that she found the arrangement of a loving and care-giving relationship with Arthur somewhat satisfying, and at least safe. Her reasons, of course, she wisely keeps to herself, the audience is left to make up their own plausible back-story.And this time the "approved" betrothal object, played by the marvelous Jennifer Garner, is not hideous (Jennifer Garner is constitutionally incapable of playing hideous) so much as cold, heartless, driven, and on her own mission. With that character one is repulsed, but one also has a momentary flirtation with the idea of "Heck- why not?"Garner's dad, aptly played by Nick Nolte, was a vulgar thug, venal and coarse. Greta Gerwig as the real love interest of Arthur is simply adorable. I have never seen her before, but found her absolutely perfect. She is sweet without being cloying, attractive without catering to some cranked-out version of media hotness "a la mode." She seemed genuine, deep, innocent, and completely the kind of person anyone, especially Arthur, would love to spend time with for the intrinsic delight of her company and her vibe. Gerwig deftly showed us her character's heart without any effort or melodrama.Lastly- this movie wisely decided NOT to try to re-do the old story point-by-point. The old story simply wasn't worthy then, and God knows it wouldn't be now. No departures are radical, in case you did somehow fondly recall Moore and Co's 1981 effort. But it was re-thought in a relevant and meaningful way that makes it a better story. All in all, then, this "Arthur" is more believable than the stinky and dreary original. The premise of both is so outlandish as to be almost stupid, but watching these great actors take us through the stages of the story was a joy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do yourself a favor and WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never write a review on these movies but felt as though I had to because the reviews being left here are completely wrong! This movie was so funny from beginning to end, I couldn't stop laughing. I have never seen the original Arthur so I can enjoy this movie in its true form, instead of comparing it to something else. Russel Brand's character is played so well. He is rich, always drunk, and basically a big kid who does a lot of growing up as the movie progresses. He also has a very funny driver/side kick, played by Luis Guzman. The two of them get into some extremely funny predicaments. I thought it was refreshingly original. If you enjoy comedies, this is definitely a must see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved it. I thought it was funny and very entertaining. I laughed and I cried...Helen Mirren was great as the butler. Making the butler was a great touch. They had tremendous chemistry together. I was not thrilled with the choice for Naomi. I thought they should have had someone funnier or at least better looking. Her outfits were ridiculous. Jennifer Garner cannot pull off a bad guy in a romantic comedy. It is not in her range of acting. Russell Brand is great as Arthur. He is my new favorite actor. He did a great job at the funny moment and the touching ones too. I hope to see more of him in the future. I would recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>just plain fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming from the perspective of someone who didn't see the original movie and went looking for some light-hearted goofiness, this film was just exactly what I wanted! Russel Brand did a great job adding depth to a character who could have been one-dimensional, and I thought they did a great job with makeup and costuming. Jennifer Garner really made me want to smack her as Susan! I also loved Greta Gerwig as Naomi. It's so refreshing to see a real woman in a leading movie role - someone I can really relate to. It was also clean enough that I didn't find myself covering my eyes for every other scene. Great flick for a casual movie night with friends!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apparently this movie is not for everyone, it was however, for me.This movie is not going to change the way you live your life or love your family, but it achieved what it set out to do. It made me laugh. Not only was this movie incredibly funny, but I thought the cast was successful in creating likable characters with more depth than one would expect from this calibre of movie.I find most comedies of late fall apart in the latter half when jokes themselves are not enough, and the story has to actually advance some sort of plot. Interestingly enough in Arthur dealt with this nuisance excellently. The plot was wrapped up efficiently while still maintaining the high level of comedy as seen throughout the picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A BRAND new take on a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start this off, i would like to admit i've never seen the Original Arthur. So my opinion is in no way a comparison against what is wildly considered an absolute classic.Im gonna say, i thoroughly enjoyed this film. Russel Brand is at his boisterous best, frolicking the streets of manhattan, be it dressed in the Infamous Clooney-nipple Batman suit, or wearing Abe Lincolns Top hat. The narrative of the story, ridiculously rich Arthur (brand) stuck in his ways of alcoholism, sex parties and causing trouble for his business women mother, raised by his very caring nanny (Helen Mirren). Business women mother realizes that the future of her company is at jeopardy due to Arthur's idiocracy and decides that he must be taught a lesson of tough love. Marry Jennifer Garner's devilishly unique character; to maintain the integrity of the family company, or be cut of from the money. Cue unexpected love interest. Arthur meets Naomi in central station, swiftly followed by an hilarious chase downtown involving some classic NYPD and some solid one liners from Russel Brand. Story unfolds, Brand falls in love... Struggles with his feelings, his alcoholism and his motherly affection for his nanny. Tragedy strikes, some relationships are strengthened, some are broken. Nick Nolte is in classic form as Jennifer Garner's hard ass father and is involved in one of the best scenes of the movie. All in all, the film was really well shot and nicely put together, its fairly clichéd and is over kinda quickly; but deals with some pretty dark subjects. Russel Brand shows he has enough star power to lead any comedy flick, and shows a tormented side unseen of him to this date. Good few belly laughs and a lot of classic one liners. Not a must see, but absolutely rent it if your ever in need of riches to rags comedy... 7/10 Live long and prosper</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A spoiled alcoholic and big baby behaving as a rock star finds himself involved in a marriage for interest in the way he falls in love.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>His mom is forcing that marriage so he has to decide between money or love, He lives in a bubble spending money as crazy and without caring about anything and is unable to understand the real world but thanks to his nanny he starts to do his best. His mind works as a mind of a kid does, he loves colors, toy and games and falls in love with someone like that.Sweet, funny, heart warming, and enjoyable. Jennifer Garden does an amazing job here, aggressive and sexy. The nanny is just lovely and smart and the guy an asshole... a new love story. You will enjoy how fun is to spy people and don't forget the moon is always following you. Those 10 bucks will not be regretted. =)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arthur Was brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arthur was brilliant because it appealed to todays youth and updated the original to todays lifestyle. Russell Brand is a brilliant comedian and he made the movie. Anyone else playing Arthur would have ruined it and it would not have been as good. I read somewhere that Ricky Gervais would have been a good actor for the role of Arthur but I don't think so. It made me laugh from beginning to end and was the best five dollars I have spent in a long time. Not only that I went back and saw it three more times. The first night I saw it I came back home and popped in the original Arthur with Dudley Moore to see what the big differences were besides the obvious things like the bat mobile and golden bull balls. There was a world of difference from Hobson, his personal assistant, being a witty and brilliant actor who was a male in the original and a witty and great woman in the remake. Without giving out anymore details this is a definite must see so you can see if you like it. I have heard everything from it's not asa good as the original to it's totally brilliant and even funnier than the real one. So it's all up to you! Go and see it. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than the Original!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sorry to say that I liked the remake a little better than the classic 1981 version. This movie made me care more about the characters, and had more of an emotional storyline concerning one of the characters. Russell Brand was awesome and hilarious as Arthur Bach, a drunken millionaire who is being forced to marry against his will. Arthur is so lovable and very childish and is taken care of by his sweet but strict nanny, Hobson.Because his mother is tired of his wreckless ways, Arthur is forced to marry Susan. He ends up meeting Naomi, and falls in love with her, but if he doesn't marry Susan, he will be cut off from all the money. I highly recommend ARTHUR!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing this remake, I was interested in seeing the original. Just finished the original, and the remake is way better! Brand is a fantastic Arthur. Honestly, if I had seen the original before the remake, I probably wouldn't have seen the remake. My vote goes for the new and updated version. I can't remember a time I laughed so hard at the movies. A great way to spend an afternoon or an evening. The cast is amazing. Brand's childish outlook as Arthur is classic. A few similarities, and a few differences as far as the plot and starting story line, but all in all I would go see the movie again. Very rarely do I talk about buying a movie after walking out of the theater, but Arthur is a movie that will be in my collection when it comes out on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Russell Brand owns this role.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been reading numerous posts on here, and I am appalled at the level of indifference shown by the users on this site. I will start off by saying that if you don't like Russell Brand, then you will not enjoy this film. Comparing him to Dudley Moore is simply impossible. Dudley Moore's humor was based around his ability to appear intoxicated throughout the entire film. Brand's interpretation was less believable, and you can sense it was an act, where with Moore it appeared he was literally hitting the bottle between each take. Brand does deserve praise for the remainder of his performance though. His personality is hilarious and his delivery was spot on. Now replacing John Gieglud with Helen Mirren was quite a stretch. Gieglud NAILED the role, winning the Academy Award for his performance as Moore's butler/nanny/father figure. His humor at times surpassed Moore's, his dry wit leaving me wanting to see him as much as Moore's character. Helen Mirren was funny, carrying the mother/nanny role with a stern attitude sprinkled with witty one liners. The only thing that was completely wrong with the film was having Greta Gerwig in the role that was completely owned by Liza Minelli. I mean, it's Liza for God's sake, at least put someone I've heard of in the role. Gerwig came off as irritating, and more of a friend to Brand than a serious love interest. I gave the film a 10 to balance the low scores given by many of the other users. Bottom line-the film was hilarious. I laughed constantly and really enjoyed every minute of it. It will always pale in comparison to the original, but was enjoyable nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, if you are a fan of a remake movie, you are gonna love this. The effort is exemplary and i could not ask for more.I usually love American remakes because of its evident detail concerning the plot works best the second time around, but giving the classic comedy Authur! a try is something never seen before and hands off to Hollywood for pulling that off.The only problem with such a film would be as to how much detail can they go into as not much is there. It is highly unlikely to draw audience if the content is not substantial and relevant as many of you might agree that the latest sequel to the Resident Evil series was undesirable and off.Well, it too soon to point that out but to what the trailers and the first episode looked like, i would suggest you to watch the thing as soon as you can because its awesome. The actors are good, the plot is great, the CGI is pretty cool and appears real, suspense and thrill is all over me, can't stop to watch next remale.</fullReview>
