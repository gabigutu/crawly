		<fullReview>Ali G Indahouse has got to be one of the funniest films I've seen in a long time, and Cohen's portrayal of a British gangsta is hilarious. This film has cult classic written all over it, and it features some really great lines. Ali G Indahouse is a good-time party movie that will leave the viewer laughing literally from beginning to end. Definitely Vote Ali G and keep it real.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius. And this movie is good! Although the film doesn't nearly reach the quality of the tv-show, it's still very funny and has some seriously wicked moments! I've liked Ali G since the first time I saw the material from the show. I think he's one of the best comedy characters of all time.. up there with say, Peter Dragon ("Action") and The Blues Brothers. Biggest surprise with this film was that they've actually got some serious actors to do it (Dance and Gambon). After this I will absolutely respect them even more, for having the good sense to take this chance. I have nothing really bad to say about this film, it's very funny. Very juvenile, but hey, so what?! One more thing to mr. G: SEQUEL, PLEASE!**** / *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ali G loses no effect on the big screen - a hilarious comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ali G earned his fame on the small screen - though the big screen has not lost him any kudos either. Ali G Indahouse is a hilarious laugh-a-second fun fest - just like on the small screen. He has lost none of his character or stupidity at all, and behind all that - none of the film is brainless fluff either. A human side to Ali is revealed during the film, the idea of Ali G running for PM is a brilliant, fresh and funny one - and the incessant stupidity of Staines' gangster man is mixed well with the stern, harsh world that is politics. The film is also full of brilliant new characters - and instead of just interview after interview, we get a proper comedy film that never gets repetitive or boring. So why didn't I give it ten stars? Well, the ending was funny, but also botched and failed - none of it made sense. And in parts, the film became offensive in trying to be funny - but that's Ali G for you - if it isn't offensive, it isn't itself, and it is totally and utterly ruined. Ali G's big screen debut was a success in my belief, and should have got into the 6-7 average rating range on IMDb. But it could have got worse as well, and people are bound to have mixed opinions, especially on a film such as this.On the whole, Ali G Indahouse is hilarious British comedy at its best - and funniest, and most clever. A great job! 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie was laugh-a-thon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As someone who usually despises Ali G, Ali G Indahouse was absolutely brilliant. When I was watching it, I was in a hysterical fit. Yes it is sexist, rude and extremely crude, and I loved it. As some comedies are only have one or two comical scenes, this movie was laugh-a-thon. I have never seen a comedy as original as Ali G Indahouse.For a comedy starring Ali G, this would be worthy of an 8 out 10. Absolutely Brilliant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The thing with Ali G is that he takes the mick out of himself and his character. The humour is very much a 'like it or love it' brand of totally politically incorrect, irreverent and self effacing type.Personally I totally love this film, and so has everyone i have met who has seen it. You can watch it several times and pick new gags up each time. The humour is both aural and visual, and the timing is impeccable. The humour is probably very English, and specifically London, so its possible that non-English viewers may not get some of the humour. Think of yourself as a teenager and you will love it - especially if the likes of Kevin &amp; Perry Go Large tickled you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When most British TV comedies get given the big screen treatment they are usually terrible. This is one of the more successful attempts but is still no where near as funny as when Ali G was the telly. Ali G was hilarious on TV when he was interviewing unsuspecting politicians/scientists/vicars etc, and less so here in this cinematic adventure. It actually has a plot as Ali rises to become Primeminister of Great Britain! It has some very funny parts but not nearly enough of them, maybe its because Ali G has been around for about 3 years now and the concept is becoming a bit stale now. Although I loved the bit where Ali met Sacha's other comic creation "Borat", very clever and a nice pay off for fans of his TV show. ***6/10)***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... and if you do too then you should watch this film. If you're a fan of Ali G then this film is definitely for you. It is very funny - Its probably not as funny as the TV show or the video as thats where Ali G's stupidity is in its element. While it wont go down as a great British movie, it definitely is one of the better ones and funnier than some more high profile movies, it is still very funny and childish. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A crazed hoo-hah that will become a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first encountered the Ali G character a few months ago in the American import of his interview show in which he sets up unsuspecting celebrities and creates comedy at their expense. Since they are invariably people who feed on public attention, it is entirely appropriate to feed on them once in a while. But it takes a seriously misleading, confusing and outrageous character to pull it off, and Ali G (Sacha Baron Cohen) does it. Cohen thinks funny; Ali G is a hugely funny creation, in much the same way that another wild and crazy guy, Andy Kaufman, invented unforgettably outrageous characters. "Ali G Indahouse" is Ali G to the third power, cubed. The plot is suitably improbable, offering an appropriate springboard for the Ali G craziness. I laughed till I cried. The plot twisted around and ended happily, and there wasn't a cliché that wasn't ragged on or a convention that wasn't exploited, and at every turn, the absurdity of the Ali G persona looms over all, ragging on itself and painting everything with its humor. I like the fact that Ali G is a white middle-class guy who has become a hip-hopper and gone native with it. In that way it's about re-creating oneself and then bumping up against conventional reality, which results in absurdities and humor, some attributable to the pretense of the invented persona and some to the ridiculous conventions it scrapes against. It could be a stretch and unfunny. It works and knocks 'em dead.Let me now back away from over-analyzing something that looks uncomplicated and isn't, but is hugely funny, and deserves just to be enjoyed. Roll with the humor of that crazy dude. He is a classic. Doug Wilson</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I used to love Sacha Baron Cohen`s creation of Ali G on THE 11 0`CLOCK SHOW in the late 90s . I also liked the spin off show though it should be pointed out by then the joke was wearing thin and it was obvious his guests were in on the joke of having a white boy impersonating a black ghetto boy wannabe . When ALI G INDAHOUSE was released I didn`t bother to see it because Ali was probably past his sell by date then . But my brother bought me the video of this film and watched it on Boxing day and I must confess it was a lot better than I expected ALI G INDAHOUSE is a very funny if you understand the " Wigger " culture of middle class white boys wishing they were black . I was laughing out loud at the first half of the film as Ali lays down the facts to his posse that wearing the wrong colours in the ghetto could cost you your life , and Ali on the election trail had me in absolute stitches as he drove down Staines high street giving a rap broadcast , but then the film goes slightly downhill as an extremely unlikely political plot takes shape and the jokes slow down So all in all ALI G INDAHOUSE is funny but slightly uneven . I still watch the video a couple of months after getting it but only the first half . It`s a lot better than getting socks for Christmas so thanks for the video Neill</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are a fan of smooth, hip talking or just a bit of hip hop, then you'll like this film, as for everyone else, you can enjoy Sacha Baron Cohen as the great Ali G. Borat (Cohen) also appears, but his own film is much better. Basically, Ali G lives in the West Side of Staines and is protesting about his Leisure Centre closing down. So he decides to join the Prime Minister (Sir Michael Gambon) and his nasty assistant David Carlton (Charles Dance) in parliament, hence the title, Indahouse. Also starring Kellie Bright as "me" Julie, Martin Freeman as Ricky C, the fit Rhona Mitra as Kate Hedges, Tony Way as Dave, EastEnders' Nabil Elouhabi as Jezzy F and Ray Panthaki as Hassan B, Naomi Campbell, newsreader Jon Snow, EastEnders' Rudolph Walker as President Mwepu, and Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan. Ali G was number 8 on The 100 Greatest TV Characters, he was number 6 on The 100 Greatest Funny Moments, along with Borat at number 24 (and Bruno at number 77), and he was number 6 on The World's Greatest Comedy Characters, with Borat at number 17, and Sacha Baron Cohen (or as the character) was number 12 on Britain's Favourite Comedian.

		<shortDescription>Quite bad actually, if it weren't for the Ali G character.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is actually a quite lame comedy with some extremely childish humor but it all still somewhat works out due to the presence of the legendary Ali G character in it all.Even though this movie has basically nothing to do with the "Da Ali G Show" the character still works out as well in this movie. It's of course a ridicules and outrageous character but he's all the more hilarious because of it. It's obviously a satire on the whole rap and hip hop scene and it's still Sacha Baron Cohen most legendary character, despite the successes he has had with Borat and Brüno.The movie has some very childish humor, which mostly is about sex and it has an almost non-existent story. It's just the kind of movie in which the story really doesn't matter. It's all purely about the main character. Even the lamest and most predictable movie in this movie will still surely make you laugh a couple of times. "Ali G Indahouse" is not the most hilarious movie ever made or the best thing Sacha Baron Cohen has done in his life but it's good enough for a couple of dumb silly laughs. Still the movie gives you the feeling it has more misses than hits in it but jokes are bombarded at you so fast that you just tend to sort of forget the movie its weaker moments and enjoy the movie its more funny moments.Quite amazing actually that respected actors such as Michael Gambon and Charles Dance appeared in this type of movie. Or perhaps they knew of Ali G's success and just wanted to be a part of it. Still I feel that when looking back at it they won't regard this as their finest moment.Good enough for a couple of dumb laughs.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IMDb mark: 7What a fun film this is! Especially the beginning... 'Ali g Indahouse' has got to have one of the greatest, funniest intros ever! Even the opening credits are hilarious. But you have to be open-minded. This movie certainly isn't for the people who move their heads disapprovingly when they see you purchasing prophylactic wrappers. Getting back to the movie, this film is likely to offend not only older people but women, too. So, it is fairly obvious that the movie is intended for a restricted audience.-Humour: There is more than a fair share of swearing in this movie. There are more than a few sexist remarks in this film. And yes, they are extremely funny. But there are even a few very funny lines that aren't sexist or obscene. 25/25-Physical Comedy: Sacha Baron Cohen is the one who provides nearly all of the funny stuff in this film, but he does it really well. He finds himself in predicaments and tense moments throughout the whole film, and some of his reactions are priceless. 17/20-Plot: The plot is very far-fetched. One of Britain's party leaders decides to use a stupid young man he sees outside making a fool of himself in his plot to overthrow the Prime Minister. But that young man isn't just anyone, he is street tough Ali g, who is one bad dude. 6/15-Ending: I didn't think the ending was too great. Of course, taste varies. 4/10-Theme: Not all people can be judged by their exterior. 9/10-Nudity: There is no nudity in this film, although there are a couple of nude pictures of some unknown women briefly shown late in the film. 0/8-Cast: I hadn't heard of Sacha Baron Cohen before seeing this film, but apparently he is better-known in the United Kingdom, having his own series, 'Da Ali G Show'. Other somewhat famous actors in this movie are Rhona Mitra and Charles Dance, and there is a cameo appearance by Naomi Campbell. 2/8-Genre: This is a comedy. 4/4--&gt;Overall: 67/100It's so nice and refreshing to see a good sexist, lewd comedy among this bland sea of chick comedies. Since 'Married... with Children', I haven't laughed this hard while seeing a new comedy. From Swordlord, 2 swords up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By convincing the Prime Minister to back the totally unsuitable Ali G as a candidate for Staines in the local elections, nasty chancellor David Carlton (Charles Dance) hopes to discredit his party's current leader, thus enabling him to seize power. To his surprise, however, the plan backfires, Ali is embraced by the nation, and Carlton is forced to find other ways to try and guarantee his political future.Puerile, crude, misogynistic, and always outrageous: Ali G Indahouse, the big-screen debut outing for Sascha Baron Cohen's middle-class Berkshire gangsta, is all of these things and much more?meaning it's my kind of film!!Obviously, there are those who are simply not going to get the joke, and there will definitely be people who find risqué jokes about oral sex, homosexuality, recreational drug use, hardcore pornography, and The Queen's nether regions offensive in the extreme (needless to say, they should stay well away!), but if you find such juvenile humour side-splittingly hilarious, are a fan of Baron Cohen in general, or just want to see hottie Rhona Mitra in her underwear (and you shud, cuz she iz well fit!), then I fully recommend spending an hour and a half in the company of Ali G and the West Staines Massive.They iz wicked!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As an American who is far too old for the MTV demographic and far too pale for the BET demographic, I never heard of the supposed Brit-T phenom "Ali G." In fact, when I saw the advertisement for "Ali G Indahouse" I thought it was "Ali G India House" and I had no idea what it was about.Several days later it was playing on the TV in a restaurant where I had dinner. While waiting for my food, I started watching the movie. At first, I dismissed it as yet another crass, hand-job and hard-on teenage comedy. However, as the movie progressed I found myself laughing out loud! The scenes at the Cabinet Meetings and during the Prime Minister's Question Period are hysterical. Ali's "solution" to the refugee problem and his "fact finding tour" of H.M. Customs and Excise are brilliant parodies."Ali G" is not deep, meaningful cinema full of adolescent angst or award-winning performances. It is not even a classic comedy in the "Lavender Hill Mob" "A Fish Called Wanda" sense. It is, however, up there with the Austin Powers movies and the Zuker-Abraham films ("Airplane" "Naked Gun" etc.) as mindless movies that produce ample belly-laughs.Since this movie is not - to my knowledge - available in the States, I bought it on DVD to show to my friends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film debut for Ali</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Funny movie story about the successful character created by Sacha Baron Cohen who in his interviews succeeded in bursting the pomposity of many an unknowing victim. Unfortunately, after a while everyone knew who he was and the element of surprise was lost. A movie seems a logical progression.When news of the movie was first leaked, people speculated as to what the story would be. It would involve Staines that much was clear, so it was interesting to see Ali becoming the MP for Staines.It's a sign of how well the character is regarded when one considers the calibre of the actors involved. Hats off especially to Charles Dance, particularly for dressing up in the short leather skirt at the end.Since I live in Staines it was interesting trying to spot the many familiar places and also the changes in the town since the movie was filmed. In fact it is said that this movie was responsible for the rejuvenation that the town seems to be undergoing.For the most part the movie delivers it's laughs, although personally I've always found Cohen's other character, Borat, painful rather than funny. Still this is only a small gripe.If you watch carefully in some of the scenes you can see building work in the background. This was the new Staines cinema, and on the day it opened I saw this movie there.In summary, an amusing movie debut for a great character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Childish, crude and lacking the core of humour that made him funny originally ? but when it hits, it eye wateringly funny.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wannabe rude boy Ali G (Alistair Leslie Graham) teaches a class for scouts at his local leisure center to help them get out of the hood (Staines) although he knows in his heart that some won't make it to 11. When he finds the Government is due to shut down the Leisure Center he begins a protest that brings him to the attention of David Carlton, the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Charlton helps him run for office in the Staines by-election, however he is actually planning to uses Ali to make the Prime minister to look a fool, resign and then Charlton can take his place. However Ali's `Keep it Real' campaign seems to catch on and is more successful than expected.As with most TV ? film conversions, this isn't high art, but it isn't rubbish either. The story is daft and actually gets in the way of Ali the character. When things actually need to happen to move the story along it feels a bit forced but when Ali is allowed to be the focus of the scenes it is funny. The humour is of two types ? the humour of the white boy trying to take on black culture and live in suburbia as if it was the hood, while the other is dirty, rude or crude jokes. Both are funny for the most part, however extending Ali's character to create other characters isn't very good (they can't do it like he does it).If you're an Ali G fan then you'll probably like this (but may see him as being dumbed down from his normal job of making politicians look stupid). If you like dirty jokes and toilet humour then you'll love this. However outside of this you may just think it's rubbish (and you might be right). It's sexist, dirty, puerile, childish and silly ? but when it hits (as it mostly does) it's very funny. It also has lots of women for Ali to ogle ? although his character is developed enough for us to believe he really does like Julie and is just stuck in character.Sacha Baron Cohen is really good and has added layers to his character to make the leap to film. He also allows many of the jokes to be on him and does it well. Freeman is poor and just goes to show how good a creation Ali G is ? not everyone can do it! Charles Dance is OK ? but when you see what he has to do at the end of the film then you'll probably agree that he should have passed on this. Same with Gambon really ? although he doesn't sink to Dance's depth. The rest of the cast are TV level and suffice ? special mention goes to the actress who played the Chancellor's secretary (I forget her name)?.how hot is she!Overall it's rude and childish, but if you like that type of thing or are an Ali G fan then you'll laugh really hard plenty of times. If you have any morals at all then you'll probably find it all a bit of a waste of time?..I laughed the whole 90 minutes!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ali G Indahouse is one of those films which should not be watched by those who don't like silly comedies, because it is certainly one of them. Although not unintelligibly so, as it is somewhat satirical and witty in its dialogue and characterization; and is clearly well written (like much of Sacha Baron Cohen's comedies).Ultimately, I rate comedies on how funny they are, and this movie did not fail to crack me up. Certainly not as good as Borat, but still a good laugh (especially when watched with others who also like Sacha's comedies).Would recommend to those wanting to watch a decent comedy movie, and those looking for a good laugh.~ 8/10 ~</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For some reason Sasha Baron Cohen delivers an incredible performance in TV shows that make you laugh. Yet, the moment the same story goes to the big screen it becomes almost idiotic. Ali G Indahouse is the first of those attempts and the weakest of them all, preceding Borat and Brüno.What you've seen in Da Ali G Show is more or less translated to the cinema format, but there is one important thing missing. A rather strong socio-political message underlined the TV show, in particular the season(s) filmed in the US. None of this is to be found in Ali G Indahouse. The movie resembled Scrubs with adult jokes in a feature film.</fullReview>

He decides that he is going to go on hunger strike until they change their plans. When that fails he gets an offer to enter politics, unknowingly to him, he has been asked by a person who desperately wants to become Priministor and has used Ali to try and ruin the real Priministor's reputation so that he will resign. However when Ali is a success he is stitched up by the person who entered him in the first place he decides to put it right.This film starred: Sacha Baron Cohen, Charles Dance &amp; Martin Freeman.ALI G INDAHOUSE was released in 2002. In my opinion this is a good film that will make you laugh and entertain you for 90 minutes. I do recommend this film because it is a good comedy which will make you laugh and if it doesn't then you clearly have no sense of humour.***/***** Good film</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well alongside his fame and fortune Sacha Baron Cohen has also managed to achieve such a high level of notoriety with his urban character, that the actual town of Staines changed its name to Staines-upon-Thames to get away from the negativity. That's pretty impressive Mr Cohen, you made an English town change its historic name, is that funny?.Like many TV characters that have reached the big screen this whole thing feels padded out, forced and struggling for material. Unfortunately this is no different despite being a brilliant and popular creation by Cohen. I think it was a bad choice to go down the actual movie with a plot route as we all know this character like all of Cohen's characters works better when lampooning reality. Seeing the highly naive and thick Ali G trying to strike a conversation with a real politician about current affairs only for him to lower the tone and go off on completely random filthy tangent is what its all about. Hearing Ali comment on his bitch 'Julie' or his various friends from Staines and the things they get up too is amusing to listen too, but to actually now see these people spoils the myth as it were.Of course the biggest draw with Ali G is the highly accurate satirical mocking of young British teens (black and white) who imitate the American rapper gang culture. This is the crux of his laughs, his not so secret weapon, talking with this modern day slang cum multicultural cockney hip-hop dialect that is frankly cringeworthy to listen too when anyone speaks with it, especially white folk. Add to that his heavily Jamaican/Afro American/UK chav influenced streetwise attire with bling, tracksuits and big trainers and you have a great controversial character ready for upset public figures.Thing is all of this is completely lost in the film because there is none of that, its just a silly bland plot about Ali trying to save a community centre in Staines. There are no funny clever stinging moments because its a scripted movie, instead they must rely on childish toilet humour which only works part of the time, its immediately unoriginal and loses all credibility. Coupled with the fact the cast is made up of big names merely sinks this project even further, big names equals no risks, no proper laughs, no awkwardness or embarrassing moments, its all played safe which is not what Cohen and his creations are about.Now I would be lying if I said there were no funny moments in this film, there aren't many but they are there. For me personally the best and most recognisable lampooning of my home country would be at the start of the film when Ali is 'street racing' in his hyper modded Renault down the high street. This very short sequence is extremely amusing because of the stringent UK road laws and the fact we have to drive at 20-30mph everywhere. Watching these two uber modded cars crawl down the high street at 30...pulling up sharply at the 20mph speed board is hilarious, literately the best bit in the film.Its actually reasonably funny during the start of the film whilst Ali is within his home territory of Staines and his mates. After that as we follow him to Westminster it just loses any fresh comedy hopes and becomes so derivative, the character of Ali G does grow somewhat but only in the wrong way. Instead of the chavy boorish dunderhead we all know and love we end up with some Americanised superfly looking pimp that just feels too much of a stretch even for this character. We all know about the typical UK traits that Ali G represents, we all roll our eyes at the image he portrays because we all see it in our daily lives, that's why its so funny. If you take that away and go down another countries cultural route then your target audience won't relate to it anymore, simple as that.In the end this film has just gone too far over the top with the character and its just not funny. Had it been a mockumentary style flick like 'Borat' then it would have worked I'm sure, but this option doesn't. Its basically puerile with dated stupid visuals gags and must resort to showing Charles Dance in drag to try and raise a laugh, and it fails at that. Such a huge huge error for the direction of this film that has resulted in a very very average outcome.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sacha Baren Cohen has created a masterpiece that will be loved by audiences all across the globe! The film has some great one liners that will keep you laughing until it hurts. I have the film on DVD and have watched it at least 10 times, and it never seems to get old! It is quite cringe-worthy in some places but that's what makes ALI G so lovable and this film so brilliant. This is outlined in how it grossed over 10 times its budget and the music in this movie is just brilliant too! This, along with Borat are Sacha's best works and he deserves all the credit that comes his way. The girls aren't have bad in the movie and the films all round display should be admired!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ali G suffers by having a script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before there was Borat, there was Ali G.Released in 2002, "Ali G Indahouse" was the first of three films featuring the three characters from Sacha Baron Cohen's TV series, "Da Ali G Show"--the other two films being 2006's "Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan" and 2009's "Brüno." Unlike the latter two films, which used the unscripted man-on- the-street format of the TV show, "Ali G Indahouse" suffers from using a script.The story is mostly contrived. Alistair Leslie Graham, who goes by his wannabe name, Ali G, is a white kid from the London suburb of Staines who wants desperately to be black. He lives with his grandma and has a girlfriend he calls Me Julie. When the government threatens to close down the center where he teaches a group of boy scouts how to be gangstas (scenes of wasted comedic potential), Ali G goes on a hunger strike outside Parliament to protest. The hunger strike quickly ends when the reporters covering the event tempt him with some KFC. Ali G is then recruited by a conniving Member of Parliament, David Carlton, to run for the representative from Staines. Carlton's plan is for Ali G to fail miserably, embarrassing the Prime Minister (Michael Gambon, Dumbledore from all but the first two Harry Potter films), causing the PM to be ousted in a no-confidence vote, clearing the way for Carlton to become PM. Contrary to Carlton's plans, however, Ali G proves to be wildly popular by "keeping it real." The PM's approval rating soars, and Ali G becomes the PM's adviser. Of course Carlton isn't going to sit by idly while this happens.The movie falls back on lazy, juvenile humor. Most of the jokes are stillborn and fall flat. What made the TV show so wildly funny--playing off the character with interview subjects who weren't in on the joke--is completely absent from the movie. The movie does have some good moments, such as when Ali and the gang break into the PM's residence and have to break dance through an "Entrapment"-inspired security system criss- crossed with laser beams. And there is some funny commentary on modern society, such as when Ali has to clarify over the phone an indecipherable message he texted in shorthand.But without an unwitting victim, Ali G just isn't very funny. Luckily Cohen learned his lesson from this film, and stuck to the format that made his show so funny in the inspired comedy "Borat."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ali G Indahouse is a decent movie with a bad storyline but it makes up for it with a ton of very funny scenes and a very likable performance as Ali G from Sacha Baron Cohen.Ali G is definitely not my favourite character Sacha Baron Cohen created,and the brief cameo Borat has in this movie just reminded me that he is much funnier than Ali G.I think that Martin Freeman was a bad decision,I always like him in everything he's in,but he is usually a very calm character,and Ricky C just wasn't the right role for him.Fans of the series Da Ali G Show will probably be disappointed with this movie,but will still enjoy the many laugh out loud scenes,and Ali G is a very likable character.While protesting to save his beloved leisure center,Ali G gets caught up with the Prime Minister and makes the government for liked than they've ever been,but the Chancellor has is own plans set up against the Prime Minister.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Contagiously funny comedy, a taste of things to come by a somwehat comic genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember just before Christmas 2001, I was up late with my dad watching this show he recommended to me, Da Al G Show. After three or four minutes, I was in titers and guffaws "Who the F is this guy". Well he's the name wave comedian of the millennium. Sasha Baren Cohen, who's not just funny as hell, but has great insight in to subjects that come through in his scripts, where he takes so many so many digs at stuff, some stuff that ought to be dissed. The following year, this movie came out. Though really wanting to see it, "Oh, I wait till it's comes out on DVD", and it did in the four months that ensued. I should of gone to see it at the cinema, for this is such funny stuff, only the first in a series of Cohen classics, you could never tired of watching it, where those same funny moments, would still have you kicking yourself, you wouldn't find it less funny. The film too, has a good, if original story. Ali G is such a character you can't hate, and too, like many of us, lives off the dole. His dog really likes to get intimate under the sheets, where Ali: Alistair likes to have sexy dreams, where may'be we see a little bit more of this guy when we should, when his johnson dangles out, whilst in the middle of a shootout, Ali, heavily outnumbered. He teaches kids stuff about self improvement, at the John Mikey Leisure centre, where kids get badges for majoring in advanced swearing. Only now the centre is about to be closed down, where Ali, demonstrates his disapproval in another hilarious uproariously funny scene. Suddenly luck turns his way, while again revealing too much of his anatomy, where he's used as a pawn to overthrow a Governor (Gambon, great) by an evil political adversary, wonderfully played by Charles Dance, who can pack a few punches as seen near the film's end. In return, Ali may just be able to save his centre. And they way Ali tries to get votes, is just another series of funny scenes, where if you don't vote, you may want to check out your letter box. Ali G's girl is a nurse, who really hasn't got a problem with one of her colleagues either. And we have a misunderstood conversation by Gambon and another political party. Highly funny, vulgar and crass in parts, hey that Cohen's trademark, Ali G Indahouse, is essential viewing for comedy fans, or lovers of Cohen's films, where if they've seen the other ones, and haven't seen this, this one finishes the picture perfectly, and delivers at the same level of laughs. Hey, who wouldn't want to see Dance in a woman's leopard outfit and having to be made Ali's bitch.</fullReview>

'Ali G Indahouse' Synopsis: Ali G unwittingly becomes a pawn in the evil Chancellor's plot to overthrow the Prime Minister of Great Britain.'Ali G Indahouse' is funny in parts, not in totality. Some jokes &amp; gags, especially in the first-hour, are excellent &amp; bring the house down. But, in the second-hour, the writing material loosens &amp; doesn't quite register an impact. Sacha Baron Cohen &amp; Dan Mazer's Screenplay works in parts, while Mark Mylod's Direction is fair.Sacha Baron Cohen's performance as Alistair "Ali G" Graham, is terrific &amp; deserves special mention. The talented actor who delivered fantastic performances in films like 'Borat' &amp; 'Brüno', proves his mettle yet again. Here's an actor who deserves a massive fan-following, due to his sheer talent. I would love to see more of him. Another performance that I truly liked in here, was by Martin Freeman, who scores as Ali G's best friend. On the whole, 'Ali G Indahouse' is a fair comedy. Watch it for Sacha Baron Cohen!</fullReview>

I will check out later the TV series of Ali G and let you know.In the movie you recognized a lot of elements of scenes, which in the later movies are repeated in a different and equal funny or even funnier way.So, the message to all the wanna be hip hoppers out there is: Check this and take it as an example of how to score among the people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ali G Working For The Government</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Ali G Indahouse' is the first movie of Sacha Baron Cohen's trilogy that was followed by 'Borat' and then 'Bruno'. All three characters originated from Cohen's 'The Ali G Show' and thus, crude and vulgar humour is expected and this kind of humour isn't suitable for all. I found the humour of 'Ali G Indahouse' to be much less crude compared to the followup films. Expectedly, it's a silly movie with a predictable story but entertaining nonetheless. The execution is adequate and the writing a tad nonsensical but most of the jokes work. While actors like Michael Gambon, Charles Dance and Rhona Mitra are left with cliché roles, Sacha Baron Cohen steals the show obviously. Martin Freeman stands out as his homosexual sidekick. Of the three films, I prefer 'Bruno' because of the original story while 'Borat' is the least favourite. I wonder what Cohen has installed next.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Baron Cohen is an improv genius, but this film is merely aaaiiight.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forget Will Ferrell and the Judd Apatow school of improv where actors get 5 and 6 goes at coming up with various punchlines in scenes (Ferrell usually makes his "hilarious" by yelling them out for no reason), try it unscripted and on the fly with a non-actor who may or may not punch you depending on their mood.To that end I fully recognise that Sacha Baron Cohen is an improv genius, Borat and Bruno both proved that beyond doubt. (He was also the funniest thing in Madagascar 1 or 2 by far.) But the first character to bring him notoriety was Ali G, the wannabe black gangster-pimp who is actually a middle class white boy from Britain.Perhaps it is because a lot of his comedy comes from shock value but I rarely choose to revisit the Bruno or Borat movies, they are far less cringe-worthy the second time round, and I was pretty surprised to find that this film had aged so poorly as I remembered it as a near classic.Not now Mr G.Aaaaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiight let's go.Ali G Indahouse opens with the best scene in the film, a dream sequence that sees Ali in his "natural habitat", the Los Angeles mean streets, surrounded by bitches and beset on all sides by hard core playas determined to do him harm. Of course he pulls out his gat (or equivalent) and busts many caps indeed.Cut to real life, Ali is actually a suburban dwelling gangsta-by-choice, with a similar posse of tossers (including Martin Freeman) in tow. They wear all yellow. Their nemesis gang is the East Staines Massive who wear blue and are equally (not) hard.When the local government closes down the local recreation centre Ali decides to protest to keep it open. Fortunately the Deputy Prime Minister (Charles Dance) sees an opportunity to submarine the Prime Minister's (Michael Gambon) standing and promptly announced that Ali G will be running for parliament in the local by-election.Ali's campaigning does not go well at all but a monumental gaffe in a televised debate by his opponent helps Ali become an unexpected success.Once in parliament the continually ludicrously dressed Ali and his similarly ridiculous boasting are taken as the voice of a generation and he promptly joins the cabinet and becomes the PM's go-to guy on all policy matters.After brokering a peace treaty by utilising tea laced with natural 'erbs Ali G is sacked, and the PM resigns when a tape of Ali boning his missus is released.Of course Ali must break into the new PM's office and fix tings.Maybe I'm ten years older and this just isn't as funny anymore, maybe it never really was. There are more chuckles in this than many other comedies, the recent Get him to the Greek and Date Night included, but no side-splitting moments of comedic brilliance.There is a funny sms joke near the end and Charles Dance proves himself to be a good sport, but without the "this is real" edge supplied by Borat and Bruno this seems a little too try-hard.I firmly believe though that Sacha Baron Cohen will make two or three truly brilliant comedies in years to come.Final Rating ? 6.5 / 10. It is telling that the two scenes with almost no relevance to the main plot are the funniest, that being the first 5 minutes and the last 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The hip-hop, white-gangster wannabe only known as Ali G (Sacha Baron Cohen) to his friends (Martin Freeman &amp; Tony Way), his girlfriend (Kellie Bright) and his relative Nan (Barbara New). When the evil chancellor (Charles Dance) and his assistant (Rhona Mitra) wants to overthrow the Prime Minister of Great Britian (Michael Gambon). Ali G unlikely chosen by the chancellor to make the Prime Minister to look foolish and lose his credibility. But instead, Ali G is a success with the politicians and the media. Ali G is actually more clever and smart, despite what the chancellor thinks of him. Ali G finds himself being embraced by the nation as the voice of the youth and keeping things real. Now the chancellor has to find ways to destroy Ali G credibility as well.Directed by Mark Mylod made an amusing, extremely silly comedy with some sharp satire. It is fun to watch Cohen gives his character Ali G his 110 percent. Although it was only released in Grant Britian back in March 2002. The movie was finally released on DVD in North America in late 2004. Since Cohen is extremely well known for his sketch comedy in the U.K. and the U.S. in "Da Ali G Show".DVD has an good anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an fine Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The DVD has an amusing running commentary by Cohen, Freeman and Way but in the commentary track, the actors are doing their characters watching the movie. DVD also includes Deleted Scenes, Two Featurettes, Photo Gallery and Trailers. "Ali G Indahouse" is a good, crazy, sometimes wildly uneven comedy. Die-Hard fans of Cohen will enjoy this more than others. Besides, it is fun to watch Gambon and Dance in this absurd movie. Written by Cohen and Dan Mazer (Borat:Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan, Bruno). (*** ?/*****).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big Ups. And Much Sideways</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bet Charles Dance has never in his career said anything remotely like: "Is there any reason why there should be an absurdly dressed half-naked man chained to a fence being tossed off by an old blind council worker?" The half-naked man is hip hop defender of the Westside Massive turf of Staines, west of London, Ali G (Sacha Baron Cohen), chained to a government building on a hunger strike (which he has just broken by nibbling on a KFC chicken tender). A rival gang leader has taken advantage of him and pulled his pants down. Whereupon a blind council worker polishing the fence is also unknowingly polishing Ali's knob. If you haven't guessed yet, ALI G INDAHOUSE is not the type of girl you take home to mama.Buoyed by the success of his criminally funny DA ALI G SHOW (where Cohen perfected the art of catching people off guard with his naive, ambiguously-wigga Ali G, using their ignorance of his parodied character against them), Cohen ambitiously ramps Ali G into movie format. Which is a big up for Cohen, but not so formidable a career move for Ali G.ALI G INDAHOUSE works more often than it doesn't. The cultural gap is not so much to blame as the aura that Cohen has built around his fake celebrity hip hopster. We are used to seeing him blindsiding real life celebrities and officials, whereas here, too many people are in on the gag.That is, we know everyone Ali G interacts with is in concert creating a "comedy" - even those people who seem oblivious to his shtick, like the Prime Minister (Michael Gambon). The movie works best when Ali can riff without too much involvement with the other cast, ironically, his own ignorance creating the humor this time.Charles Dance is Deputy Prime Minister, David Carlton (aided by perfect-9 hardbody Rhona Mitra), who fixes Ali's election into Parliament, to be the Prime Minister's adviser on gaining the youth demographic, knowing full well Ali would embarrass the Prime Minister out of office, thereby setting the stage for him to be elected PM himself. His plan works all too well, when Ali's forthright stance on "keeping it real" only skyrockets the PM's popularity.Ali's girlfriend is "Me Julie" (Kellie Bright); his posse mate, Martin Freeman (best known from Ricky Gervais's THE OFFICE), who pulls off some fine jamming for a white boy.Drug gags, sex gags, scat gags, hip hop gags, gags that fall absolutely flat and gags that fly, ALI G INDAHOUSE is an uneven potpourri of throwing everything this character has against the wall and not caring whether it sticks or not; like a British version of POOTIE TANG (2001) - absurdist comedy about a street thug rising to prominence to battle the establishment.The message that politicians are either stupid or crooked is nothing new, and director Mark Mylod, with writers Cohen and Dan Mazer, traverse no new ground imparting that message, which Ali spells out quite literally: "R.E.S.T.E.C.P! Do ya even know wha it spellz? Yes, Restecp. 'How's anyone out there meant to restecp each other, if you lot in here, don't even start restecpa-ing one another?" Unfortunately, Ali's character does not remain the resolute, clueless renegade. It is disappointing that the film gives him a "respectable" arc - he is made Ambassador to Jamaica (the wicked pot being a bonus, of course) and goes from being a drug-addled misogynist to a Parliamentary drug-addled misogynist...Now that's Restecp.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ali G Indahouse is a fantastic film that makes me laugh every-time I see it, the way that Sacha Baron Cohen can create characters that really stereotype what he is attacking and still be funny is one of his greatest aspects, and in the film he perfectly portrays a London chav.The film has so many funny moments that it would impossible to mention them all and so as not to ruin it for potential viewers I'm not going to mention any, but nearly every line is packed with some sort of witticism and yet still teach the audience about restecp.The only downside of the film is that I just found some of the support acting (other than Cohen who plays Ali G) to be too over the top for example Charles Dance as the evil MP was just too exaggerated to be as funny as he could have been, but this is just a minor let down on a fantastic film that I have watched several times and will watch several times more over the years, it gives a great sense of what can be achieved by British filmmakers if they have confidence in their own ability.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alistair Leslie Graham ("Ali G") is a young man from Staines, a small suburban town to the west of London. The central joke of the film is that Ali is white, British, middle-class and lives in a quiet part of suburbia but tries to imitate what he believes to be the lifestyle and culture of working-class urban blacks, although his idea of black culture is a curious mixture of American inner-city gangsterism and Caribbean Rastafarianism. Ali's fast-talking dialect is a mixture of Jamaican patois and London street slang; the character is said to be based upon the white disc jockey Tim Westwood, who affects a Caribbean accent despite being the son of the Anglican Bishop of Peterborough.Ali G, of course, is a creation of the British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen, and existed well before this film was made, having appeared in various television programmes since 1998. (Another of Cohen's characters, the Kazakh journalist Borat, makes a brief appearance here). The format of "Ali G Indahouse" is different to that of Cohen's next film "Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan". That film is a spoof document in which Cohen tries to persuade real-life members of the public that Borat is a real person. Although in the original television programmes Cohen had tried to persuade people that Ali too was a real individual, often in spoof interviews with celebrities, he obviously realised that by 2002 the character was too well-known for such a format to work. The film, therefore, is simply a fictitious story with Ali at the centre.Ali and his gang ("Da West Staines Massiv") get involved in a campaign to prevent the closure of a local leisure centre and as a result are dragged into a murky political intrigue by the Chancellor of the Exchequer to supplant the Prime Minister; this plot line may reflect the difficult relationship between the then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Chancellor Gordon Brown, often seen as plotting against Blair. As a result of this intrigue Ali is elected to Parliament in a by-election; the word "Indahouse" in the title is a corruption of "In the house", the house in question being the House of Commons. After various vicissitudes all ends happily and Ali's beloved leisure centre is saved."Ali G Indahouse" is not quite in the same class as the ""Borat" film, in which Cohen had some serious points to make behind all the vulgarity and the madness. The idea was to express outrageous views in order to shock people or to trick them into agreeing with him, and thereby to expose levels of racism and prejudice in the United States. There is nothing quite of this nature in the "Ali G" film; despite the political send-ups it is not really making any serious points about British politics. The political plot, in fact, is not really important. The film is really an excuse for a display of Sacha Baron Cohen's brand of humour, which can be an acquired taste. As in the "Borat" film, the humour on display here is often vulgar, crude and offensive - and often hilarious. Ali talks a lot about "respect" (or "restecp" as he spells it), but he doesn't have a lot of restecp for anyone, certainly not for the powerful or the pretentious, and punctures their pretensions with a series of devastating put-downs. (Most of his one-liners, alas, are too crude to quote here).The film is not for anyone easily offended by sexual, scatological or drug references, or for anyone holding to high standards of political correctness. (Ali habitually refers to women, including his girlfriend "Me Julie" as "hos" or "bitches" and to homosexuals as "batty boys"). For anyone else, however, there is a lot to laugh at. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe not the funniest of Baron Cohen's, but worth several cheap laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ali G Indahouse is really the only of the three Baron Cohen character comedies to be an actual movie. The Ali G character was the lead character of Da Ali G Show on HBO, while the other two characters appeared as more funny. This has always been the main character for Baron Cohen as well, and the first to be created. So anyway this movie is honestly a very nice ode to the character, as he is not getting a hoaxing movie like the other two characters. So basically you get sort of what you get from Ali G most of the time on Da Ali G Show. The writing isn't spectacular, but you get some well needed cheap laughs from this one.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ali G character works brilliantly within the confines of a comedy show, but as a movie, it doesn't work in the same way.Don't get me wrong - this is a very funny movie, full of biting, witty dialogue, that caricatures the modern British chav wonderfully well, whilst providing the viewer with a hilarious, if unrealistic story.One problem with this film is that the script and content is either fantastically brilliant, or it's embarrassing to watch. When I say embarrassing, I don't mean funny embarrassing a la Office or Extras, but rather, you'll wish they hadn't included it in the final cut. One example of this is the inclusion of a music video after the film has ended, to the tune of, "This is how we do it." Whenever I watch the film, I stop the DVD when it says the end, and leave it at that.Overall, Ali G Indahouse is a good film, worth watching a couple of times. The script is enjoyable to an extent, and there are no issues as far as acting goes. However, refinement is the key word here.Ali G is a better television programme. Borat is a better film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly and Childish, its a Riot - Aiiiii!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who has seen Ali G before, should be well prepared for the full motion picture that is 'Ali G Indahouse' Although I prefer Ali G when he is interviewing the rich and famous, his brand of completely off the wall comedy definitely entertains from start to finish on the big screen too.Ridiculous plot, ridiculous characters and a ridiculous script, that all make this film a riot for fans of Ali G.If you've seen him and didn't like him then avoid this film like the plague, because it's definitely just more of the same; for everybody else - watch it Aiiii! 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i love this film!! maybe it is my generation but i can really connect with what he is talking about and means to do. it kept me laughing for the duration. duration of the film, the next day, and beyond. i think this film is not one to watch if you mainly care about the plot and character development. this film is pretty much only for the generation that will understand it. there are lots of things you just know being brought up in that generation that you wouldn't if you were say 40. i think Sacha barren Cohen was Very and i do mean Very good. he is a genius. and the reason h is such an idiot is because he can make people believe he is a complete idiot, and make it funny at the same time!!Very good film. strongly recommend!!!! (not so strongly if you are over 30)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not a bad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ali G show was really something amazing - he was so stupid wannabe rapper, but no one he interviewed noticed that he was just pretending. Sasha Cohen is actually very intelligent guy, who pretends to be stupid, so he could get really honest answers from people... And it is very funny. So I didn't expect movie to be good, cause it was all acted - no real people or interviews. So the basic point of all show was lost. But I was wrong - I laughed all the time, it was one of the funniest films I ever saw. Sure it was stupid, but who cares if you can't actually brake in to safe with a car battery, like someone said? It wasn't supposed to be a realistic documentary... And it isn't like the show, it goes in totally different way, but that doesn't mean it is bad. When I finished watching I was totally impressed, but now when some time passed I realized that it was not that special anyway, But it still deserves a nine - well at least for what it is supposed to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The way i found out about this movie was when i watched American pie 2, at the start it had a trailer for Ali G indahouse, i watched the trailer and it just forced me to buy the DVD, it looked incredibly funny! so the next day, i went to my local store and picked it up for ?3.99 (Bargain!). The film is about Ali G, who is a "gangster" of the west staines massive crew, who's rivals are the east staines massive crew. Ali has a "Cub Scout" pack of children where he teaches them how to survive in the "ghetto" by teaching them how to swear and steal cars, after Ali finds out the government are stopping the money coming to the leisure centre where Ali teaches the kids, he runs for MP for staines and overthrows another MP in his attempts to get rid of the leisure centre to make room for an airport in staines. Throughout the film there are laughs aplenty as Ali gets up to some crazy stuff! Borat makes an appearance for a few seconds in the film too, this is a definite must watch film for all you Sacha Baron Cohen fans out there!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No real plot, no character development, no Scorcese-level direction, but seriously, were you really expecting any of this? The only thing that matters is that this flick is absolutely hilarious, nearly on the same level as Borat. Sure, the ending drags a bit, but if Borat's cameo didn't crack you up, you must be the worst batty boy in the history of batty boys. Sacha Baron Cohen is possibly the greatest comedian ALIVE, and here he gets more laughs than Jude Law on a nude beach. I dare you not to laugh.If you can pull the ten-foot pole out of your behind for an hour and a half and just enjoy some well timed and extremely stupid jokes in a stupid story about a stupid character, see this stupid movie. You'll be glad you did. Keep it real!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was sure after see the trailer for this film that it was going to be a waste of my time. However I was dragged there tonight and I have to say it was entertaining. It seems to be a general thread of these comments that everyone has been surprised with this film. No one has said it is a great film but its difficult to say it was a failure.With the millions that are spent on films today, scripts, locations, actors and effects then a standard has been set for a "good" film. Ali g doesn't bother with any of these elements (except actors like Dance and Gambon), instead we are just presented with joke after joke whether inspired or crude one liners. It's difficult to pick anything out about the film that is quality but at the end of the day it made me laugh and surely that's the point.Of course there are people that find farting in someones face unfunny but if that image even begins a smirk on your face then this film is worth seeing. Although definately go when you think the cinema will be full cos its much funnier when everyone else joins in with the laughs and cringes at the same time.It just must have been a shock for Micheal Gambon and Charles Dance to go from Gosford Park to Ali G indahouse. One end of the scale to the other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some funny bits, but overall not worth it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sacha Baron Cohen is clearly a talented comedian. He is able to completely sink into the most ridiculous and obscene characters and completely break boundaries that most films only push lightly. Shock humor barely begins to describe Cohen's style. But while "Borat" was hysterical because it unashamedly tore apart parts of American culture that we'd rather not think about, "Ali G Indahouse" doesn't quite cut it.Ali G (Sacha Baron Cohen) is a wannabe gangsta rapper who loves teaching kids at a community center about the gangsta lifestyle, but the center is losing money and is going to close. He goes to London to go on a hunger strike in protest, but at the same time, the Chancellor is planning on double-crossing the Prime Minister to get his job. To that end, he needs to have the Prime Minister hire a young, "in touch," person to fill a seat in Parliament, who will then fail and force the Prime Minister to resign. The chancellor sees Ali G, and immediately selects him for the role of the unknowing pawn. Needless to say, things don't go as planned."Ali G Indahouse" is a satire. It spoofs the public's concession about what is acceptable behavior in today's world while also making fun of politicians who despite showering the public with words and promises, are so clueless about what the people really want that they fail. The film allows Cohen to do what he does best, which is to act outrageously in places and situations where behavior must be kept under strict control. Yet, despite there being a few hilarious sequences, the film doesn't really work.Perhaps the reason why this film doesn't work is that there's actually a plot. In "Borat," Cohen let the character run wild and that was it. Here, Ali G is given a storyline, and maybe the film could have been better if the story was decent (which it isn't), but it closes the walls on the character, and Cohen's characters need as much room to breathe as possible.I've seen a few clips of Ali G, and he's just not as funny as Borat (I haven't seen "Bruno"). True, he can get us to laugh, but he's just an moron, instead of a man who is so clueless that he doesn't realize that his behavior is appalling, bordering on illegal. "Borat" was funny because only Cohen and the filmmakers were in on the joke. "Ali G Indahouse" doesn't have that luxury.The humor is very British, so if that's not your thing, it's another reason to skip this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>East side or West side? Both are very funny here.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alter Egos do not come funnier than the creation of Sacha Baron Cohen's Ali G. Completely misled by his delusional and non-existent sense of the Middle England Suburban surroundings that his social background consists of. He persists on living the style of a Los Angeles Gansta. While still living with his Gran in the London suburb of Staines, he keeps tight control of his Posse, the West Staines "Massiv".Spending his spare time between Me Julie, his girl, the Posse and teaching local eight year old Scouts at "Keep it Real (advanced)" lessons at the Government funded John Nike Leisure Centre.This is where the story takes off, being told that the Government funding has stopped, Ali G then proceeds on a one-man quest "In the struggle for Justice I iz willing to lay down me Life, just like Martin Luther Van Dross did". Being his reply to the local media crew when interviewing him on hunger strike while chained to a fence.Charles Dance here plays David Carlton, the sinister and devious Deputy Prime Minster, who is "Even more eviller than Skeletor". Using Ali G, unknowingly, to lose the Prime Minster 18,000 votes three weeks before the General Election. Seeing Ali G as a bumbling idiot, his plan backfires. Ali G suddenly becomes an over night sensation and a saviour of the people, working directly with the Prime Minster. The story becomes more sinister and with hilarious consequences.Ali G Indahouse is a great British movie that brings the hugely talented attributes of writing, along with Dan Mazer, executive production and acting of Sacha Baron Cohen. Charles Dance and Michael Gambon, as the P.M. play their parts with great seriousness among the gags and hilarity that is Ali G.Ironically, seeing the parodies playing their parts in a World that really is real, and who are continually preaching "Keep it Real" from their own little World that is the West Staines "Massiv" is true comic paradox.Directed by Mark Mylod, his first full length feature film since directing television work such as Shameless, Shooting Stars, The Fast Show and the Smell of Reeves and Mortimer to name a few.Very Real and very funny.</fullReview>

The women were British, chunky and HOT, especially Rhona Mitra, who was the model for the original Laura Croft.The gag of a white boy in London thinking his entire life that he is an East L.A. gangster never gets stale, primarily due to the different angles that it is approached from. Sure, the story is dumb and predictable, but it is simply a track to carry the hilarious dialog and sight gags that heavily pepper the movie.But, keep an open mind.

The plot about an evil chancellor is quite silly but its just an excuse for ali g to do his usual thing. The humour is very rude and very constant so dont be expecting a nice family movie with elves and such. Just an example of some of the hilarity(about the only one suitable to mention) is when Ali stands up and makes a 'speech' (of sorts) in parliament, he then gets taken out by the guards and he screams "iz it because i iz black"..It has a go at the 'gangsta' life in the most hilarious ways and even though its pretty ridiculous, you will definately have trouble controlling your laughter 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is, by any intelligent standard, a bad movie. I can't say anything good about the characters, story or quality of production (except for Ali G's wardrobe) . The jokes are almost all crass and/or silly. But it did make me laugh a lot.Ali G is a badass gangsta from the West Side, or at least he would be if he wasn't a poser from Staines, London. The community hall where Ali teaches little kids how to be like him is about to be demolished, so Ali starts a campaign to save them because 'dere is already too many bothers dyin' in da hood.' He ends up in Parliament due to the schemes of the evil Deputy Prime Minister, where he proceeds to wreak havoc.Ali G is played by British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen, whose 'Da Ali G Show' became a massive hit, mainly because of the hilarious reactions of real people when they were subjected to what they thought were real interviews by Ali G or Cohen's other character, Borat from Kazakhstan. That is missing from the movie and while watching Ali G take the mickey out of gangstas and their lame white wannabes is fun, the rest of the film's humour relies on Ali being a dork and jokes about sex, masturbation and dope. If you're not in the mood to laugh at immature gags about those things, then this will probably be one of the worst movies you will ever experience. If you are and you're a fan of the series who doesn't go in expecting much (like me), then it's good for a laugh.Respec.5/10</fullReview>

Not that I don't find the interviews funny.There isn't a whole lot that I can say about this movie other than I enjoyed it and have watched it several times.

		<shortDescription>Hilarious, if you get the joke</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ali G Indahouse is a rare thing these days: a genuinely funny British comedy, unlike recent rubbish like Guest House Paradiso (Bottom was superb but the film just didn't work), East Is East (where were the jokes?) and Bean (awful). Although it features many gross-out gags and slapstick situations, in order to laugh virtually all the way through it like i did then you need to understand exactly where Ali G's humour comes from.Contrary to what most people think, the joke behind Ali G is not that he can fool famous people in interviews into answering his ludicrous questions seriously by presenting himself as a voice of 'da yoof'. The real gag is that he personifies every young, disillusioned white middle-class male who wants to be a black gangsta (the dream sequence makes this obvious enough). The crappy souped-up cars, gang wars with bespectacled teenagers, a pirate radio station called 'Drive-By FM' - this is some of the most well thought out and accurate satire in years! It is also refreshing to watch a comedy that has the guts to not worry about being PC, and comes out all the better for it.Unless you fall into the 15-25 male catagory and actually KNOW people who are like Ali, though obviously not to such an extreme (and there are thousands trust me), then it is likely that some of the laughs will pass over your head, but there is still enough OTT lunacy to entertain anyone with a sense of humour.9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Consistently funny with a real charm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the opening dream sequence where Ali lives out his fantasies of gang warfare in downtown LA ("Hoes? That is not a very respectful way to refer to them bitches"), to a hilarious climax involving a raid on the PM's country home, Ali G in Da House achieves something Brit comedies have struggled for too many times in the past. Namely, to take a successful TV concept and turn it into a consistently funny, entertaining big-screen caper.The plot involves Ali being set-up as a Parliamentary candidate for Staines by the Deputy PM (Charles Dance), who hopes to embarrass the Prime Minister and further his own leadership ambitions. Needless to say Ali is duly elected, and goes on to discover a plot to build a new airport terminal over Staines. Only by recovering a tape that seems to show the PM having sex with some floozy, but actually depicts Ali and Julie getting down to it in the PM's room and with his hat on, can Ali save Staines and thwart the evil Dance's ambitions.Baron Cohen's script is spot on: while we think we know what to expect from Ali after his many TV appearances, the comedian declines to rehash the character's finest moments and instead takes Ali to another level. Though the plot is as daft as you'd expect, it is actually there, rather than a thin excuse for a series of set pieces. Meanwhile, the additional characters work well in their own right, rather than acting as stooges for Staines's finest. While "me Julie" is little more than a cameo from Kellie Bright, Martin Freeman (who you may recognise from BBC's The Office) has some great lines as Ricky C.Top turns from Michael Gambon and Dance also help to give the film a real charm. Deserves to be a success and if the reaction of last night's preview audience is anything to go by, it will be just that.4 stars out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Proof that TV comedy doesn't necessarily translate well to cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Proof positive that TV comedy doesn't necessarily translate successfully to the big screen, the film debut of Sacha Baron Cohen's British TV pop icon Ali G is a big hodgepodge of ideas, some good some not, flimsily attached to a slim fish-out-of-water scenario where Ali G goes into politics as an MP for Staines on a Save-The-John-Nike-Leisure-Centre ticket and unwittingly becomes PM Michael Gambon's saving grace with his "Keep It Real" pronouncements, much to the displeasure of Exchequer Charles Dance who has his sights on becoming PM himself. There's good fun to be had with the constant satire of British infatuation with and emulation of American ghetto culture, and the generally low level of below-the-waist humour is offset by a sweet, unexpectedly wide-eyed innocence that means no offense (there's a general amazement throughout the film that they've actually been getting away with this for so long). But the general level of wit and invention isn't very high (the best they can come up with is a fish-out-of-water plot where Ali G gets into politics?). And the need to harness the TV's fast-moving humour into a structured plot that can support a 90-minute film very much works against it. Plus, the fact that the reference points are so hip-hop-centric means whatever fun the film may have is lost for anyone who's not in the joke. Who just happen to be nearly everyone who's not attuned to hip-hop culture. Which is a shame, because that's where the film's real interest lies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit that I love "Da Ali G Show" and purchased the first season as soon as it came out on DVD. So when I heard Sacha's movie was being released on DVD as well I wanted to rent it right away. One could say I had very high expectations as he is an extremely funny comedian so it was to my dismay that when it came time to actually watching the film it was complete and utter crap (for lack of a better term). I laughed probably 3-4 times tops throughout the whole duration which is pretty pathetic considering the main actor's potential. I mean I was well aware that it obviously didn't have a stellar budget but it still had so much more potential that it just couldn't live up to I guess. I was even more disappointed when I came to the realization that Mr. Cohen was actually one of the co-writers of this piece of garbage too because if he didn't help pen it then he could be considered less liable but once again to my chagrin...not in this case. I have seen a lot worse and I'm thinking I'm only being so hard on it since I went in with such high hopes but there are a handful of laughs, however don't act surprised when you find out it's nowhere near as funny as his TV show!Final Slant:Movies: I would've cried if I blew that much money on this!!DVD Purchase: I was tempted just to buy it first since I figured it'd be so good anyways...thank God I chose against this!Rental: Only if you're a big fan of Sacha's and can't get enough of him.</fullReview>

If there were more people like Sacha Baron Cohen in the world, it would be a better place for better, or..for badder.

		<fullReview>At least, given the impeccable standards Ali-G has set for himself from his TV show. This wasn't an awful film but nor was it any good.Firstly, Ali-G is an undisputed genius. His TV interviews with Mohammed Al-Fayed, Neil Hamilton, John Humphreys, numerous Irish political groups &amp; activist groups and his crimewatch scenes are all nothing short of hilarious. The finest series comedy in England since the likes of Blackadder &amp; Only Fools &amp; Horses.Sadly though, Ali is at his funniest doing the above, ie interviewing, debating, basically being himself. The odd occasions he has tried to be an actual "character" it's not took off &amp; that was the problem here. Granted there were some funny lines, quite a few infact but nothing actually laughing out loud hilarious. The cinema was about a third full &amp; the most any joke was greeted with from anyone was a smile or 2 second chuckle. there was no laughing in unison like Four Weddings, Notting Hill etc.Charles Dance &amp; Michael Gambon done very well with the script as you'd expect and acted well. Kellie Bright was gorgeous &amp; I'm sure her fame will increase after this. The Houses of Parliament scenes were probably the pick of the film, they were amusing &amp; could've done with being a bit longer and there were one or two good messages coming through a loose script. The biggest let down was some of the singing, dancing or hand shaking scenes (esp the ones with the bloke from the Office) went on too long and you could feel the embarassment of the audience begging for them to end. By the end they'd been done to death.Sadly there'll no doubt be the increase of people using "innit" and other Ali-G terminology, under their mistakenly belief that they're being funny and original. I remember being at work the day after Ali's interview with Neil Hamilton in which he greeted him with "So tell me, were you the one with the orange peel in your mouth?" Colleagues were in hysterics reminscing at this line. Yes it was funny, hilarious infact. The problem was none of them had the faintest idea what he meant by it or it's significance, except me.But that not the fault of Ali-G or no doubt this film. Infact on the contrary he caricatures the "white man pretending to be black" &amp; street life in general absolutely brilliantly. That was the best feature of this film &amp; "should" make many realise how idiotic they look. But I bet it won't.In a nutshell, you can roughly guess exactly what the film will be like through having watched his show and the film really acts as nothing more than a further insight into his life, with the one sub-plot. There's a fair scattering of humour, but still less than any 5 minute segment of his show.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ali G Gets No "Respek"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of "Da Ali G Show" on HBO, I had high hopes for this film. I should have known better when it went straight to video.... and then none of my local video stores carried it! The problem with this film is it simply tries too hard. I did not not want to see the Ali G character in his home environment or running for parliament or saving England. In my opinion, the "Ali G" character only works when he is operating OUTSIDE his environment --- so we can laugh at how unbelievably stupid he is and laugh even harder at the frustrated, often angry reaction his sincere stupidity arouses in all those unfortunate to encounter him. This movie bombs horribly due to the throwaway script, and as a result, it is an interminable exercise in sheer boredom with maybe 3-4 genuine laughs to be had in TOTAL. I well and truly HATED it from frame one and it just NEVER got any better (despite crossing my fingers and gritting my teeth). I think Sascha Baron Cohen has talent (his TV show proves it), but this movie shows absolutely NONE of that talent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is good s***!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The very first time I saw Sacha Baron Cohen's character Ali G (the ultimate wigger!) was in the Madonna music video of her song "Music", a video that was on MTV countless times every day (back in the day when I watched MTV) and in which Ali G is Madonna's driver. When I saw on the big screen what I think is the funniest film of 2006 (and probably of the decade so far, brilliant film!), Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan, I didn't knew a thing about Sacha Baron Cohen and it was until later when I knew about Da Ali G Show but still as for today I, sadly, have seen only a bit of that show. Of course I have as much desires to see more of Da Ali G Show (can't wait to get the DVDs!), as I have to see the third film based on a Cohen's character from Da Ali G Show and second Sacha Baron Cohen/Larry Charles (Larry Charles' Religulous is another of my most- wanted films) collaboration Brüno. But anyway, and about this film, Ali G Indahouse (directed not by L. Charles but by Mark Mylod and released in 2002), well not long ago I saw parts of it but until yesterday I saw it for the very time entirely (last week I got finally its R4 DVD). And one of the parts that I had seen before yesterday is when Ali G meets Borat (they don't really like each other!). I have never seen Borat stuff from Da Ali G Show but here in this film is clear that this character of Cohen was still not totally polished, you know he sounds different. Like I said, I haven't seen much of Da Ali G Show but I'm pretty much it was in Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan when Cohen reached his top (my prediction is that Brüno will be as hilarious as Borat but I don't think it will be more hilarious but who knows, can't wait!), by comparing "his" two feature films there's no doubt that Cohen learned, in 2006 he gave the audience the home run but certainly a double ain't that bad, right?And yes, for me Ali G Indahouse is mostly like a double but sometimes it's actually like a triple yet sometimes like a single but never less than a hit (for sure it deserves a much better IMDb user rating than a 5.9/10). As I think you already know, this is fiction in its entirely and it's quite a typical film: Ali G becoming a politician, is typical stuff with the evil one of the film (played by Charles Dance) choosing Ali G as a candidate for his own benefit obviously only to find out that his plan will not be really successful at first and when he finally gets what he wanted Ali G and pals are ready to kick his butt (not really literally, you know Ali G is only a complete badass in his dreams!). Cohen is simply great, this one was sort of my introduction to his character Ali G (I clearly remember the bit I saw of Da Ali G Show was with Brüno in a beach) and I'm a fan. And well for sure it's easily better than Harry Potter! ("If you is watching this, Potter, I is better than you. You probably ain't even slept with a girl"). Respect.R4 DVD extras: commentary by Ali G and Ricky C (!), "Video Diary" (hilarious, see how Ali G needs tons of makeup to become a white man!), "Talking the Talk" ("this bit is for people of countries where they don't speak English?like Scotland." Funny stuff, learning to speak real English like Ali G: "I's Ali G, the dominatin' MC Making bitches touch their punani" = "Hello, my name is Ali G, your master of ceremonies encouraging females to manually stimulate their pudenda"), photo gallery, trailer, teaser trailer-Ali and teaser trailer-Tupac.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ali G Indahouse is a film that appeals to my sense of ridiculously gross and childish humour. The film is worth many hardy chuckles and you'll enjoy every single one of them. The execution is not as clean as one would hope, but then again the film was obviously done very tongue-in-cheek.In some instances the amount of genital-flavored comedy may become rather numbing. Pot-jokes are never funny to me, but still I got a few kicks out of the UN meeting scene. It may be due to the fact that this is still a British film that it manages to charm its way through all the horrid comedy.Additionally Ali's over-the-top dialogue and commentary keep the film fresh.Not a masterpiece in the idiot-comedy department, but a memorably dumb film nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sacha Cohen is a serious genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have only given this film a 7 because I expect a lot more, and elements of the movie were simply too "silly".Sacha Cohen, and the characters he has developed are singularly the most accurate view into many elements of UK and US post adolescent culture. The adoption of ethnic mannerisms, slang, clothing and essentially persona, by the late 20's early 30s character "Ali G" and his "posse" are nothing short of hilarious. The fact that they also mirror an element of our society, just makes it that much funnier.The 15 year old male humor, including lots of potty and sex jokes, and for those who haven't watched Cohen in action, recreational drug references, could easily fall flat, if not delivered by this comic genius. His character, which also include a Eastern-block ?arab? from a fictitious spin off country, is absolutely hilarious in his lack of comprehension of other societies. Cohen depicts this "jew hating" vulgar character, as a victim of his own ignorance. As he travels across the US, he shows pictures of his naked sister, attempts to hit on nearly any woman he meets, and exposes his home country's misogynist perspectives on the proper roles of women in society. Any comic would attempt to pull of a character like this, but only Cohen does it in a way that we truly believe he is just an innocent buffoon.His third primary character, a gay Austrian fashion reporter, gets himself into many high profile meetings and situations, only to blow the minds of his interviewees and guests.Very little of the overall concept of extreme embarrassment based comedy is new (i.e. candid camera). Cohen, however, takes this to a new, highly intelligent, thoughtful and extremely effective level.This guy is simply funny as heck and he gets across several major points of view about how ridiculous racism, hatred, homo-phobia, and much of back-ward America is simply so wrong that you can only laugh at it (or you'd have to cry).Check it out - my main man Ali J is in da house!!</fullReview>

Sure there is a lot of funny jokes and scenes, but it isn't as original as I'd hoped. Somehow it seems to be aimed at US audience, there just was too much jokes that was heard and seen before.Anyhow, Ali G is like a cult character already, and I only wish there will be more Ali G movies, I know Sacha Baron Cohen can do MUCH better than this... but they has to keep it real. 8/10 big ups for Ali.

		<fullReview>Pretty much exactly what you would expect from an Ali G movie. Crude jokes, loads of stereotypes to laugh at and a million references to places we all know (start practising your Englefield Green hand signal the minute you leave the cinema). The first half hour is absolutely brilliant, but then the story kicks in. which leads to about half an hour of slightly less funny stuff, but still has its moments. The rest goes back to Ai G the way we like him.The performances are all pretty good. Sacha Baren Cohen's is the main reason you are going to see the movie in the first place. Kellie Bright as Mi Julie is good, but I still found it a pity that we even got to see her, as it was almost better when she could potentially have been a myth. But is was obviously something there for the sake of the story. There are a few recognisable faces throughout the movie making cameos or playing smaller roles, which are fun to spot.Ultimately its Ali G for an extended period of time, with less intelligence and more base humour. There are some lovely pop culture references which will bring back memories from your childhood, and a great game of spot the location as they go around Staines. Leave your brain behind when you go to see this and you will have a great time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wait for the video</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Bennett is clearly out of his mind comparing this film to Machiavelli. Pretending that this film is anything more than puerile rubbish is a severe stretch of the imagination. This film was by no means a serious critique of British politics or contemporary capitalism, in fact, the scenes shot in Parliament are miniscule and riddled with inaccuracies (a real lost opportunity).I like Ali G's TV stuff, for much the same reason I like Mark Thomas, even though I don't agree with any of his political views: I think it essential for any democracy that people like Messrs Baron Cohen and Thomas exist! However, A.G.I. is a BIG disappointment. It's so incredibly far-fetched that you find yourself bored by it quite quickly. Ali G's election to the Commons and his subsequent success as an M.P. is so unlikely that you soon realise that no matter what he does he's going to get away with it.There's nothing in this film to grip you unless you're such a die-hard Ali G fan that you're not going to hear a word said against it no matter how dire it is. For me, this film suffered from the same problem as Kevin &amp; Perry Go Large - it's a sad attempt to create a movie-length 'sketch'. How they got the likes of Sir Michael Gambon and Charles Dance to participate is beyond me (large sums of money I assume), especially given some of the things Mr Dance is made to do during the film (Sir Michael appears to have been spared too much embarrasment)It's boring toilet humour that should be outmoded in this day and age and should be consigned to the same broom-cupboard along with all the Carry-On films. I think a lot of Ali G fans will be equally disappointed with this pitiful offering and advise everyone thinking of seeing this to wait for the video.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The jokes don't work, they just make Ali worse, but I'm sure we'll see his face again...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those of us who like Ali G (and those ignorant idiots who play the race card are just wrong to disregard him), what is it exactly that we like? For me, it is his power to fool people; his ability to present himself as someone he is not. The people he interviewed assumed him for an idiot and ultimately looked like idiots themselves through their responses. The beauty of it was that we the spectators knew he was not that idiot - we were in on the joke and what a joke it was.Throw Ali G in a feature film however and this joke can not and does not exist. Ali G becomes the idiot that he so successfully parodies - an incredibly thick sexist, obsessed with his cock size, living with his mum and smoking a lot of dope in imaginary gangland suburbia.To say that the original joke is lost however, is not to say that the film is not funny; it certainly has its moments. Much of the comedy relies on lewd, gross-out humour, which although far from sophisticated, is undoubtedly laugh-out-loud stuff. Mr G somehow finding himself being w***ed off by a blind street cleaner is surely the stuff of genius.Ali's disillusionment with his identity and his culture also makes for some laughs and is surely some sort of commentary on today's youth; he is taking the p*** out of something but it is hard to pinpoint exactly what.Still, for me, a lot of the jokes still fell flat. Making a human electricity chain in order to open a locked safe isn't funny; it's just stupid. The unfathomable plot which is fast becoming a motif of the British "slapstick" genre is also an annoyance.I certainly wish I had waited for video, perhaps watching the film whilst enjoying some form of Ali-endorsed intoxication would help the jokes to push the right buttons.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As films go - this is NOT going to win any Oscars, but it never pretends that it will or that there is any fantastic plot - just pure simple entertaining comedy, so who cares! What this movie does is deliver laughs, good laughs, at a fairly consistent rate. Ali G in da House achieves what most other British films fail to achieve, and that is to be funny without being a 'chick-flick'. Transferring the character of Ali G from the TV to the Big Screen was never going to be an easy task, and in some places this clearly shows, but on the whole Sacha Baron Cohen makes a very competent job of it - a better job than most could have hoped for in fact. Charles Dance delivers a good performance as the scheming Deputy Prime Minister, while Michael Gambon is relatively quiet as the PM. The whole supporting cast perform well, but none of this really matters - the whole thing is just about the comedy and "Keeping it Real!" Ali G may not appeal to those people who are easily offended, but if you're up for a laugh and just want to be entertained, this may be what you're looking for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say I was rather pleasantly surprised by this film. I went along expecting 90 minutes of crude knob jokes and a million 'aiiiight' and 'west siiiide's. Which there were several of, of course, to cater for the 13 year old who had snuck in to snigger in the back row. However I nevertheless found myself laughing, mainly at a lot of the more obtruse social comments hardly emphasised but still very clever and well thought out. The plot was suitably ludicrous, the filming very slick and stylish (was v surprised to find out this was the director's first film - well done to him) and the soundtrack kicking. I agree that the opening scene is probably the most comic of the film - NWA blaring, Ali bouncing in one of those weird gangsta rapper style cars, making pathetic gun noises when his machine gun runs out of bullets and imitating East Coast rudeboy lingo (I wonder whether US viewers will take him at face value or get the sarcasm..) It was all the little things, like his suped-up crappy Nova, utterly OTT outfits and most of all the puerile humour at every opportunity, that made this film sustain its momentum throughout. Yes some of the jokes are weak and unoriginal, but they come so thick and fast you can gloss over them and instead watch out for the more subtle ones. I'll probably watch it again on video and notice even more. Just ignore the predictable side and a far better creation emerges. Honest! Go in with an open mind, don't judge and dismiss it beforehand as I was planning to, and you can't fail to enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An alright film, but nothing to write home about. The jokes are good, overall, and unlike several like films, it stays reasonably funny throughout. However, it lacks the sophistication that a film like American Pie has (basically, it fails to plaster over the holes in the plot). If you want to sit down and have a fairly good laugh, then go and see it. It's nothing to write home about though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There isn't a decent plot, the film isn't as funny as Ali's spoof interviews, but it does a good job of deprecating the character along with whites who obsess over ghetto street culture. Essentially the film is sort of a re-working of Mr Smith goes to Washington (or whatever that was called).The commitment to Staines shown by Ali is quite cute, deserving of the statue erected to him down there.Funniest part of the film is Ali's antics in the House of Commons and serving in the Cabinet, along with a bizarre statement by Richard Madeley of Richard and Judy. Some real politicians would have added authenticity and allowed Ali to say some rude stuff, and I felt this opportunity was missed.The film is mainly mediocre, but occasional (and often subtle or bizarre) moments stand out. It celebrates small town life in the UK and in a strange way, is surprisingly patriotic. It makes a change from hollywood, which can only be a good thing. Bo! (etc).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reminds me of Bean....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big Ali G fan. I believe him to be the funniest thing to hit TV since Blackadder. However, I had reservations about this film. I had a feeling it would go down the Bean(1997)route: start off hilariously but become more serious and emotional towards the end, so the character has learnt something.The movie does fall into the trap a few times, but always pulls itself out in time, with hillarious consequences. The plot is non existent, just a series of set pieces that couldn't be shown ''...because of the white boys that rule Channel 4.'',according to Ali.The funniest moment in the film has to be the start: Ali has a dream about living the black urban gangser life and being shot at by (roughly) 100 gang members, all with Uzis and pump action shotguns. The sequence is a spoof of Boys N The Hood(1992) and The Matrix(1999)and must rank as one of the best action/comedy setpieces in modern cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not funny, not smart ? Ali may be in the house, but his film is out of turn.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What we have in Ali G Indahouse is actually a rather cynical film; a needless and low-brow attempt to cash in on the success of what was a relatively funny television show, a television show that tried to insert a certain energy or 'updating' of interview shows of old; a breath new life into what had essentially become either old men in suits sitting around talking to one another or young adults nattering about on post-modern looking sofas early on Saturday mornings, trying to inform the youth of the time about current music and popular culture - but really just acting as a means to 'tell' the kids what to like. While Ali G's interview with the Beckhams remains one of the funniest pieces of television I think I've ever seen, the transition from screen to screen in this case does not go well at all.The most obvious and most striking difference is the placing of the character of Ali G in the 'real' world, by bringing him out of this television personality persona and inserting him into a part of England in which he must live normally and interact with those around him accordingly. The formula that was not broken on television has been fixed for the cinema, it would seem. On the TV, Ali G (played by Sacha Baron Cohen), is a rude and crude TV personality that dresses extravagantly and pokes fun at casual drug use, homophobia and certain parts of the female body. In the film, he goes the whole distance and exhausts jokes about these things to the point he runs out of ideas and has to revert to out-and-out racism; sexism and jokes about bestiality ? all in the name of a runtime.Baron Cohen essentially casts himself as this misunderstood and budding political genius of a man that unwittingly enters politics and ends up revolutionising it anyway. Initially, he is accompanied by Michael Gambon and Charles Dance, two actors that were roped into this by God only knows how. Ali works at a local leisure centre, teaching young kids how to present themselves and act, thus trying to transform them into the louts of the future. These are quite sickening passages of film that hinge on the fact we might find young kids swearing relatively amusing. But Ali has another close knit group of individuals, in the form of Ricky C (Freeman) and Dave (Way), two people that make up his Staines posse. What is on the surface, a stereotypical jab at a 'chav' archetype when antagonism with another gang arises, is essentially Caucasian people mimicking African American gangs in body language and voices while acting out and thus trivialising gang violence, particularly when the fact there's a possibility one member might get shot for wearing the wrong 'colours'.What with the leisure centre closing down, Ali takes it upon himself to enter a bi-election in order to save it when he is spotted by Charles Dance's David Carlton during a hunger strike that is additionally used as a means of meek humour. As his off-beat ideas and erratic approach to everything draws more and more attention to himself, Ali becomes embedded deeper into the world of politics and corruption, culminating in a dastardly plot to demolish his home of Staines for sake of construction work. Is Ali G Indahouse supposed to acts as some sort of statement on how easy it is to get into politics within our contemporary world - with promises of big and erratic ideas while systematically fooling everyone? Is it some sort of look at the corruption that supposedly goes on in politics ? the battle or struggle for power? I don't think it is, but if someone were to credit it with these accolades, I have a feeling the film-makers would more than likely snap it up.The film is empty-headed and offensive in ways that doesn't see it deliberately attack certain groups, but just runs so quickly out of ideas that it needs to resort to barrages of grotesque and offensive humour. Like Ali G in one scene during his television interview with another party member, the debate goes on for a while before our lead just resorts to 'out of thin air' accusations and insults that further drive the piece. If you are a healthy; white; heterosexual male between the ages of 18 and 30 and are in relatively good shape but without much of a brain, then chances are you won't be offended - which means you'll probably laugh. For anybody else, the film is an ordeal ? you might loose count of the number of people the film should offend: from overweight people; to Thais; to people that might actually live in Staines.Bizarrely, the film feels it can change tack at absolute will. The pastiche of contemporary youth in the form of young males, influenced by contemporary African-American culture, is long gone by the time we're meant to believe Ali G goes on some kind of realisation odyssey and learns that his 'Julie' (Bright) is the right girl for him rather than skimpy, seductive secretary Kate Hedges (Mitra). We're not buying it, and the film has no right to peel off into this realm of emotion, epiphany and heart-ache amidst all these jokes about the size of phallus' and fellatio with a horse ? it's absurd. If we are to place it in a canon of recent, low-brow British comedies; it's probably a mite better than Sex Lives of the Potato Men but slightly worse than Kevin and Perry Go Large. Essentially, this is the best you can say about the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Disgrace Compared to the Show, Cohen's Worst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hoping to lose an election and force a vote of no confidence, a politician recruits Ali G to run for Parliament. Much to the politician's chagrin, Ali not only gets elected but impresses his co-workers and other world leaders. How low will the politician sink to get Ali thrown out? This movie is so poorly thrown together. Recycled jokes, amateur acting, directing and editing... a nonsense plot, characters with no consistency. Yes, some of the jokes were funny, but the joke seems to be a white man who thinks he's a gangster. And that joke is old in five minutes.I really enjoy the Ali G show and the Borat movie is one of the best comedies in a long time... Heck, even Cohen's work in "Talladega Nights" was hilarious. What went wrong here? Is it the poor supporting cast? Many reviewers like to contrast Ali G with Harry Potter and the reviews seem to give Ali the edge. Well, here's a review that says Potter is better. I've never read the books and only saw each movie once, so I'm not a big fan by any means... but the Harry Potter films have better plots, better acting and more heart than this film could ever hope for.Maybe this is not much a of a review, but it wasn't much of a movie. You'll want to see it if you're Ali fan, but I would ask you to hold back the urge if possible. It's just not a good idea.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ali G Indahouse is an awesome movie. The plot is funny and fulfilling, and save for a few moments that were too rude, it's a highly enjoyable movie. Some people do not like this movie, as they think it's too rude, not funny, and there's too much language, but it's just a comedy, nothing too serious, and when you get past them it's a very well written story, with good actors, funny quotes, hilarious mishaps and a laugh out loud per minute. I would recommend this movie to anyone over the age of about 13, definitely not under 10s though. I know the certificate is a 15 but most of my friends around the age of 13 have found it tears-down-your-cheeks funny, which it definitely is.10/10 for a brilliant movie, that will have you rolling around!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite possibly the stupidest movie ever made...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would have to say that if you were weighing the choice between Ali G Indahouse and Dumb and Dumberer (the prequel to Dumb and Dumber) as to which was a better decision for a Friday night, they're both horrible choices. But, Dumb and Dumberer would actually be more entertaining and a better source for human brain development.This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen and I'm not even exaggerating. I can count on one hand how many times I laughed, and the material wasn't even that funny. The acting was alright, but the lead was so stupid I'm glad it took place in England rather than in America, just to save us from anymore embarrassing retardation so many movies display these days. Basic Plot: I guess for a movie as juvenile and easy to follow as this was, the plot had to be the same as well. This 'Latino-gangsta wannabe' from England (who also thinks he's black btw.) gets suckered into helping an evil Chancellor overthrow the Prime Minister of England. But, in the end, Ali G has a far more sensitive heart than the bad man is expecting.I use the term 'bad man' because this script was written by that of a thirteen year old, and I would suggest the film (if you could even call it that) to that age range, only there was so much sexual and drug related subjects and scenes it should be rated X. I hope that the makers of the film suffered really badly with it's box-office outcome (which I don't doubt they did.) because frankly, it's the worst movie I've seen certainly this year so far, if not ever.I give it a 1/2 out of 10 (10 being the highest)for making it beyond a read from the producers.And that's my review.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love the TV shows featuring Ali G and i had read from many reviews that the Film was not up to the standard of the shows. While this is true it is wrong to compare the two. The film is a completly different format from the TV series. On the tv series we see Ali G meeting every day people who have no idea who or what he is and he exploits the fact by basically taking the micky out of them without them knowing it. The film is , just that...a film. It is in the same concept of the old Carry On films , plenty of double en tendres and lots of sexist and non PC jokes which unlike the carry on films are very funny. Ok , its about as far fetched as a film can get but as long as you realise that from the start and get into silly film film mode you should enjoy this as much as i did. iiiiiiiii. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well don't expect too much from this movie and you should do just fine. Oh, and being a fan of Ali G will probably help, I don't know what the rest will think of it. It starts off very cool and almost too fancy-looking and I thought my friend downloaded some Ghetto movie, but I quickly realized this was just the first of many gags. There are many, but some are pretty lame and stereotypical, something I wouldn't expect from one of the funniest people around. But still, the rest of the movie is funny and witty and includes many memorable quotes and scenes. If you've seen the movie check out my point of origin and guess which is my personal favorite. Where the man found our little country, constantly being mistakes with Slovakia and is, I am sad to say, fairly unknown even in Europe itself, is beyond me. And what possessed him to mark our women as unattractive and peasant looking, well it's not true, not most of it anyway. Maybe he only saw the mayor of our state capital. I'm joking. No I'm not.Anyway, a statement like that is bound to bring many a laughter when "Ali G Indahouse" opens in Slovenia. So if you've bothered to read this comment I advise you to see this movie, it's no masterpiece, but it should keep you entertained for the hour and a half. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't choose to see this film (it was a sneak preview), I didn't know Ali G. before and so I watched it unfold without any prejudice whatsoever. The humour is crude - the Monty Python kind of humour - and the film is totally non-PC and full of vulgarity. I suppose that's the humour of our time. And yet - as I said before: I was laughing. First, because of the way Ali G. is taking the mickey out of rap "artists" and their videos and the way women are presented in them. I was laughing about the sheer stupidity of the main character and - as I said to a friend - this is an extreme British version of "Austin Powers". I noticed that some people criticized that the film's characters were very flat. To me this sounds like criticizing beer for tasting like beer. It's a satire and therefore characters are flat. You might criticize the film, however, for being quite unfocused. And at the end it is now clear what attitude is expressed towards Ali G. However, I do think this is more than an American Pie film although the humour may be very similar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sacha Baaron Cohen's alter ego of Ali G is usually just seen in a 5-10 minute sketch where he interviews real life people and half the jokes came from their reactions. I am a HUGE fan of the television show and was very weary of a film version. After seeing the lumpy "Run, Ronnie, Run!" I was scared to see another sketch comedy turned movie fall flat. This is not the case with "Ali G In Da House". The character transfers to film very well and is incredibly hilarious. The story is dumb, but you don't watch this movie for the story. You watch it for incredibly witty and funny lines that mock that hip-hop culture. It's a movie that you can sit down for one minute and get a number of good laughs in.

There he begins to introduce far fetched laws and complicated ways of handling parliamentary matters, in hope of saving his center. Ali G has many entertaining qualities's about it, anyone who is into serious movies I advise you to leave this one on the shelf. Ali G is so absurdly stupid that it has to be funny, there are many entertaining scenes, it does have a lot of sexual content, a warning to put the kids to bed before watching it.

To get some idea of how lame this flick is, imagine the worst movie based on a Saturday Night Live character. That movie will tower over "Ali G Indahouse" on an intellectual, aesthetic, and comedic level. The one saving grace of this movie is that Borak makes an appearance, who is definitely a much better character of Cohen's than Ali G. There is one good joke in the movie, and here it is (referring to a community center that is being closed due to budget cuts) : "This place is like Mecca is to the Jews, like Kentucky is to chickens."There - now you don't have to rent it, even on a dollar day.</fullReview>

I lived in the UK at the time and watched every show. So naturally I was very much looking forward to this film, and the best thing I can say is, it didn't disappoint me in the least. I spent most of the film laughing my head off. Maybe it's true that Ali G is an acquired taste, but I really cannot see how anyone could see this farce as anything other but hilarious. Of course it has no plausible plot, who wants one? It would only get in the way of the jokes, which come fast and thick. As crazy, nonsensical comedies go, I think this is up there with Austin Powers and the like. And the best thing is, I believe that so far we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg which is Sacha Baron Cohen's huge talent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moving, subtle, sensitive &amp; life changing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most beautiful, moving, subtle, touching, sensitive and life-changing pieces of cinema I've ever had the pleasure to witness.Based loosely on Machiavelli's the Prince, Ali G in da House carefully and thought-provokingly challenges the current cosy political consensus and cleverly portrays the emptiness, confusion and anomie of early 21st century capitalism.Written in the satirical style reminiscent of Oscar Wilde at his most cutting and directed with the epic panache not reached since Citizen Kane this is an outstanding piece of work. Ali G will undoubtfully go straight to the top of most film critics all time top 10 lists and deservedly so.10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ali G - Stick to the TV program. You don't translate to the cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS For about the last four years I've been a keen fan of Ali G. Sacha Baron Cohen is undoubtedly a very funny and intelligent guy and, in my view, his best creation is Borat who's as funny as Hell and quite shameless in what he does and says to people.Anyway, to the movie. I didn't bother paying money to see this in the cinema; I suppose because I didn't expect a lot but when I hired the DVD recently, I found the whole thing pretty sad. The best part of Ali's taking the mickey out of others was largely missing and the script an plot was pretty damned awful; hooking all the car batteries together to blow a safe - REALLY!!?? This movie goes to show I think that some things can run for too long and definitely don't translate to the big screen. The movie also had that syrupy sweet ending that I've come to expect from British films. Where have all the good British movie making ideals gone to? That said, there were the odd very funny moments such as the dog in Ali's bed and Ali's audience with HM the Q with the "Shaven haven - RESPECT" remark.So, in summary, I am an Ali G and Borat fan and I have enjoyed many of his interviews (notably the one with Anita Roddick of the Body Shop) but this movie fell really flat with me. If there's to be another movie, I hope it's a whole lot better than this lot of old tripe.Weasel100 Canberra, Australia</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ali G was funny at first. His interviews were fresh and original. The idea of a mock gangster wearing OTT clothes and using street wise lingo was appealing at first.But this film is just a rehash of old jokes, the humour was mainly childish and revolved around the male sex organ for the most part. The film claimed good actors like Charles Dance, but their talents were wasted as they played silly 2-d characters. It is not 'terrible' but isn't really funny at all a second time. It could be said that the movie was Ali G's last bastion of comedy. After that he ran out of steam.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My god how bad this is. Who is this impostor pretending to be Ali G? Avoid this at all costs. It replaces the smart multi-layered satire and humour of his show with down and out toilet humour.This was obviously an attempt to get him known in the States before he released his show there on HBO.One commentator here pleads that we not judge the movie on the merits of the show due to the difference in the mediums. While it is true that the standard format of the show could never have been transferred to the big screen Mr Sacha Baron Cohen could have ensured the smart use of his comic style in a more conventional movie storyline. Instead we have this mess, which in all honesty has nothing at all to do with Ali G except for the packaging.Terribly disappointing. Go seek out the DVD's of Innit, Aiiii, or Bling Bling for some real Ali G.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>it's OK to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I compare two films with Sacha Cohen, Borat and Ali G then Ali G is immeasurably better. I'ts no master piece, but it's a film at least. Borat is complete garbage and I do not understand how it rated better then Ali G.I cannot put my finger on it, there something wrong with the Ali G script: half of the jokes are as if written by a 15 years old, not by an adult scriptwriter. And a number of jokes including Mr Cohen's lower body are quite tasteless. But the film actually comes together as a comedy and there are some valid jokes too that are funny: such as how Ali G becomes a member of government for doing something scandalous and stupid in the public (sadly true in today's western society: people get careers for doing stupid things in public), also Ali's advice about immigrant policy and some others. Ali G overall remains a sympathetic character, even though a kind of mentally underdeveloped for his age. But it's OK to watch,it's quite funny.But never ever watch Borat, it's awful and makes every intelligent movielover sick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie sucks!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe everyone thinks this movie is hilarious! I have yet to watch Da Ali G show, but with my experiences of seeing Borat and Ali G Indahouse, Sacha Baron Cohen is not funny. This movie was just another c*** comedy. It consisted of lame jokes and stupid British gangster acting. Why does everyone just love Borat. It was okay, but it was nothing special. My friend watched it fourteen times in one week. It is definitely not that funny. Ali G Indahouse is like Scary Movie, Rat Race, Dukes of Hazzard and all that other stuff with dumb jokes. Why does everybody love these movies. They're not funny people! You got to start watching real comedies like Anchorman, The 40 year-old Virgin, and Kicking and Screaming.How 'bout you turn on the television and watch some real comedy... Scrubs! That's the stuff. I'm Braffin'!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This truly inept piece of garbage is actually quite pathetic.if its a comedy why isnt it funny.TV Shows rarely transform well to the big screen.Both Guest house Paradiso,and Kevin and perry go large were hardly better than the tv shows on which they were based in fact they failed to be anywhere near as funny.but this makes them look like Classic Movies.I had more laughs in 1982 with Cannon and Ball in The Boys in Blue.yes this is probably going to be my vote for Worst Movie of the Year.Save your money rent The Parole Officer Its a Far superior Movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the WORST Films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't tell me this film was funny or a little funny. It was a complete disaster, and one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Ali G is only funny on Channel 4's Ali G Show. After watching his performance, all i can say is He is not made for Movies. With a Daft script, or more like no storyline, there's nothing to keep you entertained. Full of annoying, unrealistic character's this movie is a complete garbage all the way. At the end of the film, Ali G gives a speech. He mentions, if you hated this film, tell people it was good. Not even the speech could save the movie, He probably knew its gonna be a stinker. I would of given this a 0/10, but the minimum start is 1. Overall, Don't even waste your time on this rubbish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Waste of my time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have absolutely no idea why I watched Ali G Indahouse except for the fact that Salon seemed to think a crime was committed by not nominating Sacha Baron Cohen for a Emmy for his work on Da Ali G Show. It is a sure bet that I will never watch that show as there was absolutely nothing funny about the movie. Comedy? Torture was more like it. It was just about the stupidest thing I every watched. I will admit that I was captivated by Rhona Mitra. I had not seen her in anything. She wasn't on The Practice during the time I was watching, so I guess I will have to check out Boston Legal one of these evenings to see how she does in something that may be worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like Ali G's show, I believe the guy has comedic instinct, but hasn't (yet) developed it to a talent.The movie is a little worse than I was expecting. I don't find Ali-G offensive, just stupid. Jokes for 5-year olds, some good, some terrible.If you want to watch a movie that seems "offensive", but is actually funny, see Tom Green's 'Freddy Got Fingered'.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bean, Kevin &amp; Perry, UK TV creations that have made successful transitions onto the BIG screen. Now its Ali G's turn and I m afraid to say this is not one of them!Ali has always been obscene but funny with it. This film was extremley sick and not funny at all. Scenes involving bestiality, gay sex and paedophilia should not be portrayed for entertainment's sake.Ali G In Da House is rubbish and deserves making very little money.1 out 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>really really bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had already heard of Ali G in Madonna's music video "Music". I always think he's funny. (In fact, he really is.) Just last year I always thought of buying a VCD of "Ali G Indahouse". That's why some months later, I bought it cheap and I started watching it.But the movie surprised me. My older brother and I were expecting it to be a great laugh-out comedy. It turns out that "Indahouse" is just a stupid piece of garbage. It was really really bad. It also contains explicit sexuality content and very crude humor. It also didn't made me laugh, even just a big smile. We definitely hate that movie. Oh by the way, I have plans to sell it.Ali G was really different in his movie compared to his TV shows-- in such a negative way. Maybe he wasn't really well-focused and enough serious to make this flick. Just because there's some sex scenes in it doesn't mean it's freaking hilarious (because sometimes, too much isn't that laughable anymore). For the first time ever, I was disappointed at him. That really made me sad rather and happy.I gave this movie 1 over 10. Actually, I really want to give it a 0 rating. It's one of the worst movies I've seen in my entire life. I wouldn't recommend to anyone who wanna watch good comedies that aren't too explicit or horrible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a crap!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing this piece of crap you will know why the limeys drive on the left side of the street...this movie is an absolute NO-BRAINER! The jokes (if this is the right word for it...) are mostly sub-standard (about 98%) and do miss any punch-line at all. Save the money and get drunk. You might enjoy this movie being totally wasted, perhaps!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vote Ali G - as a forgettable, farcical piece of work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Ali G Indahouse' has a simple plot as you would expect ? Ali G is pushed into running as an MP for Staines, so he can try and save the local centre. In reality the plan is to hope that Ali G makes such a fool of himself that he manages to topple the government, and allow an ambitious politician to take control. Obviously enough Ali G becomes popular and from there humour and chaos ensues?Acting in such as show as this is irrelevant. Sacha Baron Cohen is well used to his Ali G character, and he's supported by a cast of faces, familiar to viewers of British television. They're not required to do much since their roles are one dimensional, and what they do with them is fine, if unremarkable. Ditto for the direction ? it's neither intrusive, nor smart. It just shows what needs to be shown, and that's that.And so it's Cohen's script that will make or kill the movie. The plot's a thin string, linking some set pieces. These set pieces are devoid of the smartness which Ali G fans are accustomed to. Instead it's more of a British take on the current body humour permeating the American Pie series of movies. These are an acquired taste, and not one I particularly enjoy. Admittedly there's a sense of wryness about it all, acknowledging the low-brow nature of it but that doesn't save the gags from being cheaper than a free lunch. They're amusing enough with a big group of people in a cinema, when laughter gets to the lowest common denominator, but bodily fluid gags won't live up well when you are trying to watch this move alone at home ? you need some brains for that.`Ali G Indahouse' is not dreadful if you approach it with the right attitude, and do not expect brains to your comedy. It is however a movie I would not be pushed watching again, and was disappointed after seeing it. Avoid? No. Go out of your way to see? No. Should be better. 3/10.</fullReview>
