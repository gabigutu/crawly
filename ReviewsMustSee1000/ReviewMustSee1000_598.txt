		<shortDescription>Unmatched accomplishment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes reading the user comments on IMDB fills me with despair for the species. For anybody to dismiss 2001: A Space Odyssey as "boring" they must have no interest in science, technology, philosophy, history or the art of film-making. Finally I understand why most Hollywood productions are so shallow and vacuous - they understand their audience.Thankfully, those that cannot appreciate Kubrick's accomplishment are still a minority. Most viewers are able to see the intelligence and sheer virtuosity that went into the making of this epic. This is the film that put the science in "science fiction", and its depiction of space travel and mankind's future remains unsurpassed to this day. It was so far ahead of its time that humanity still hasn't caught up.2001 is primarily a technical film. The reason it is slow, and filled with minutae is because the aim was to realistically envision the future of technology (and the past, in the awe inspiring opening scenes). The film's greatest strength is in the details. Remember that when this film was made, man still hadn't made it out to the moon... but there it is in 2001, and that's just the start of the journey. To create such an incredibly detailed vision of the future that 35 years later it is still the best we have is beyond belief - I still can't work out how some of the shots were done. The film's only notable mistake was the optimism with which it predicted mankind's technological (and social) development. It is our shame that the year 2001 did not look like the film 2001, not Kubrick's.Besides the incredible special effects, camera work and set design, Kubrick also presents the viewer with a lot of food for thought about what it means to be human, and where the human race is going. Yes, the ending is weird and hard to comprehend - but that's the nature of the future. Kubrick and Clarke have started the task of envisioning it, now it's up to the audience to continue. There's no neat resolution, no definitive full stop, because then the audience could stop thinking after the final reel. I know that's what most audiences seem to want these days, but Kubrick isn't going to let us off so lightly.I'm glad to see that this film is in the IMDB top 100 films, and only wish that it were even higher. Stanley Kubrick is one of the very finest film-makers the world has known, and 2001 his finest accomplishment. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For all those bewildered by the length and pace of this film ("like, why does he show spaceships docking for, like, 15 minutes?"), here's a word you might want to think about:Beauty. Beauty is an under-rated concept. Sure, you'll often see nice photography and so on in films. But when did you last see a film that contains beauty purely for the sake of it? There is a weird belief among cinemagoers that anything which is not plot or character related must be removed. This is depressing hogwash. There is nothing wrong with creating a beautiful sequence that has nothing to do with the film's plot. A director can show 15 minutes of spaceships for no reason than that they are beautiful, and it is neither illegal nor evil to do so.  '2001' requires you to watch in a different way than you normally watch films. It requires you to relax. It requires you to experience strange and beautiful images without feeling guilty that there is no complex plot or detailed characterization. Don't get me wrong, plots and characters are good, but they're not the be-all and end-all of everything. There are different KINDS of film, and to enjoy '2001' you must tune your brain to a different wavelength and succumb to the pleasure of beauty, PURE beauty, unfettered by the banal conventions of everyday films. "All art is quite useless" - Oscar Wilde.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest Movie of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Instead of writing a paragraph, I'll give four good reasons why 2001 is the greatest cinema experience of all time: 1) It is a visual Odyssey that could only be told on the big screen. The special effects that won Kubrick his only Oscar are the most stunning effects before that age of Jurassic Park and T2. They allow Kubrick to give an accurate (or at least are the most accurate) depiction of space travel to date. The silence that fills the space scenes not only serves its purpose as accurate science, but also adds to the mood of the film (to be discussed in a later point with HAL). The fact that Kubrick shot the moon scenes before the Apollo landing is a gutsy yet fulfilling move. Many have said that upon its original release, it was a favorite "trip" movie. I can think of no other movie that has such amazing visuals for its time and even of all time (sorry Phantom Menace fans!) 2) Kubrick's directing style is terrific. As in all his films, Kubrick likes to use his camera as means to delve into the psychology of his characters and plots. His camera is not as mobile as other greats, such as Scorsese, but instead sits and watches the narrative unfold. Faces are the key element of a Kubrick film. Like classic movies, such as M and Touch of Evil, Kubrick focuses on the characters' faces to give the audience a psychological view-point. Even he uses extreme close-ups of HAL's glowing red "eye" to show the coldness and determination of the computerizd villain. I could go on, but in summation Kubrick is at the hieght of his style. 3) HAL 9000 is one of the most villainous characters in film history. I whole-heartedly agree with the late Gene Siskle's opinion of HAL 9000. Most of this film takes place in space. Through the use of silence and the darkness of space itself, a mood of isolation is created. Dave and his crewmen are isolated between earth and jupiter, with nowhere to escape. Combine this mood with the cold, calculated actions of HAL 9000 and you have the most fearful villain imaginable. I still, although having see this film several times, feel my chest tighten in a particular scene. 4) The controversial ending of 2001 always turns people away from this film. Instead of trying to give my opinion of the what it means and what my idea of 2001's meaning in general is, I'd like to discuss the fact that the ending serves to leave the movie open-ended. Kubrick has stated that he inteded to make 2001 open for discussion. He left its meaning in the hands of the viewer. By respecting the audience's intelligence, Kubrick allowed his movie to be the beginning, not the end, of a meaningful discussion on man's past, present, and future. The beauty of 2001 is that the ending need not mean anything deep, it can just be a purely plot driven explanation and the entire movie can be viewed as an entertaining journey through space. No other movie, save the great Citizen Kane, leaves itself open to discussion like 2001. It is truly meant to be a surreal journey that involves not only the eye but the mind. Instead of waiting in long lines for the Phantom Menace, rent a widescreen edition of 2001 and enjoy the greatest cinematic experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did and I lost two and a half hours of my life that I can never regain again.I honestly have no idea what the critics and fans see in this movie. And that's not because I can't appreciate "art". I love a good film with profound messages, brilliant cinematography, and great directing.This film just isn't one of them.My main complaint about this film is that it's so horribly slow-paced, to the point of boring its audience to death. On the other hand, sequences of dialog go by too quickly and there's not enough exposition to let people who haven't read the book know what's going on (My mother had mercy on me and explained everything before I watched it). Would it have killed them to hire a narrator? At least for the beginning and the end? Let me break it down for you: (Spoilers throughout) For the first two minutes you are treated to a black screen with no music, waiting for the actual movie to begin.For the following minute and a half, you see several pictures of sunrises and savanna landscapes. Like the audience couldn't figure out how to set the scene unless they saw the establishing shot three or four times.The next eleven minutes are occupied with the grunting monkeys. They fight, see the monolith, fight some more, pommel things with a bone. Supposedly they are prehistoric men whose evolution is being influenced by the monolith's singing. Not that you could tell if you hadn't read the book.*Finally* we get into space. Only to be subjected to twelve minutes of ships slowly spinning to the Blue Danube Waltz (A pretty quick-tempo-ed waltz as I understand, yet here it feels absolutely agonizing). At last we get some innocuous dialog and rather cryptic exposition about the government not letting people land on the moon. We are left to wonder about this for fourteen more minutes of Blue Danube and spinning ships and neat camera tricks with anti-gravity.Next comes four minutes of watching a ship travel over the surface of the moon and dock at a space station. We get a little more exposition in a board room scene that follows. Then we're back outside traveling at a snail's pace over the moon. A second monolith is revealed, again filling our ears with that horrible ringing (I had no idea that was an actual piece of music!). The monolith does its little light show and then the plot jumps forward.*Seven* minutes of watching the ship to Jupiter travel. By this point in time my brains had turned into mush. Could it be moving any slower? Maybe it's "realistic" to portray it as such, but we still don't need to see five or six different shots of the same thing to grasp the concept of its "realism". Let me tell you about this "realism" thing; I cheered when the secondary astronaut character died. Not because I'm a sadist and like watching people die, but because after five minutes I was just so annoyed at the sound of his darn breathing! I'm supposed to care about this character, feel when he dies! Instead I found myself waiting for blissful silence whatever way it came.Anyway, now we get to the most interesting part of the film-the part with HAL. Forget Dave the stick-of-wood protagonist. The real star of the show is that coldly impersonal, chillingly villainous, ruthlessly merciless bad guy of a computer. He's great. And the "Open the pod bay doors" sequence is wonderful. But it's too short. And it's not long before the director once again lapses into too-long goings on.Four minutes for HAL to die. And die he does. Slowly, painfully, losing intelligence with every minute, voice getting lower and slower, singing "Daisy, Daisy", all with a low and constant hissing that becomes just as annoying as the heavy breathing.Seven minutes of flying colors as Dave enters the monolith. Seven. I could FEEL my brains melting and dripping out of my ears! Seven full minutes of absolutely nothing but some guy's whacked out psychedelic version of space travel, again with that thrice-cursed chorus! We got the idea at the beginning of the sequence! Why drag it out so long? Unless he wanted to make LSD users go psychotic and have flashbacks.I'm not even going to try to explain the ending, mostly because I don't quite get it myself. Supposedly he's in an alien research laboratory and they're teaching him deep and profound things while he watches himself getting older and older and then they send him back to earth as some kind of cosmic celestial space baby. None of this comes across in the film. For all you know, it's just a sequence of images with no purpose or plot whatsoever. A lot of the movie felt that way.The first time I tried watching this movie I gave up halfway through. The second time I suffered through this sore excuse for a film, it was to help my sister time the sequences to see how long they lasted. It's that boring.Call this crummy film "art" if you wish. I wouldn't. I've seen more interesting "art" in the local museum. And I am never subjecting myself to this kind of suffering ever again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film of monolithic proportions.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A review I have put off for far too long....Bluntly, 2001 is one of the best science-fiction films made to date, if not the very best. Stanley Kubrick was a genius of a film maker and this is one of his very best works. And although it is misunderstood by many, and respectively underrated, it is considered one of the best films of all time and I'll have to agree. Back in 1968, no one had done anything like this before, and no one has since. It was a marvel of a special effects breakthrough back then, and seeing how the effects hold up today, it is no wonder as to why. The film still looks marvelous after almost forty years! Take note CGI people. Through the use of large miniatures and realistic lighting, Kubrick created some of the best special effects ever put on celluloid. This aspect alone almost single-handedly created the chilling void of the space atmosphere which is also attributed to the music and realistic sound effects. I can't think of another film where you can't here anything in space, like it is in reality. Not only is the absence of sound effects in space realistic, it is used cleverly as a tool to establish mood, and it works flawlessly.Aside from the magnificent display of ingenious special effects, there are other factors that play a part in establishing the feel of the film. The music played, all classical, compliment what the eyes are seeing and make you feel the significance of man's journey through his evolution from ape to space traveler.The story, while seemingly simple, is profound. Sequentially, several mysterious black monoliths are discovered and basically trigger certain events integral to the film. What are they? Where did they come from? What do they do? These are all questions one asks oneself while watching the story develop and is asked to find his own way. While most come away with a general idea of what took place in the story, each individual will have to decide what it means to them. Any way one decides to answer these question results in profound solutions. It's not left entirely up to interpretation, but in some aspects it is. Experience it for more clarification. The end result is quite chilling, no matter your personal solution.While it is a long film, and sometimes slows down, it has to be in order to accurately portray the journey of man. It's not a subject that would have faired well in a shorter film, faster paced feature. Those with short attention spans need not apply.Last but not least, is the epitome of a remorseless antagonist, HAL 9000, the computer. Never has a machine held such a chilling screen presence. Which reminds me, for a film with such profound ambition and execution, there is surprisingly little dialogue. Another sign of Kubrick's genius.All in all, one of the best films made to date and one of the very best science fiction films made. A personal favorite. Everyone must see this film at least once.Very highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001 is one of those movies where, if you don't like it, you are told that you don't 'get it' and need to look at the deeper meaning and symbolism. You're told that you clearly have a slow attention span, and just want to see sex, explosions, and have the plot handed to you on a platter.Let's break down the movie shall we? Three minutes of blackness, with something that sounds like a dying hippo in the background. Then we get the opening credits. A minute of fascinating shots of the Savannah. Then a bunch of monkeys find a black rock and start killing things with bones. Cut to the first of many 20-minute shots of ships doing things while the 'Blue Danube' plays in the background. A bunch of pointless dialogue, and a group of moon scientists find another monolith.Cut to a spaceship that's too long for the crew complement--three sleeping people, two people named Dave and Frank, who have only slightly more personality than the stiffs in hibernation. And then there's HAL, the 'perfect' supercomputer who runs the ship. Predictably, he snaps and starts breaking the First Law of Robotics. Now this is something that has potential. An evil, coldly ruthless super-mind who controls the surrounding environment and can predict your every move. And what does he do? He lets one guy float into space and turns off the hibernation machines so the three sleeping guys die, leaving Dave floating in a pod. He simply uses the airlock, puts on a spacesuit, and turns HAL off--agonizingly slowly. Then, apparently, there's some psychedelic 'evolution' at Jupiter.Here's the movie with the pauses taken out: Apes see monolith, kill things. Scientists find moon monolith. HAL kills people. HAL dies; Dave gets a prerecorded message, and evolves at Jupiter.This is not me 'not getting it.' This is me being bored to tears by long stretches of absolutely nothing. Sure, it's realistic, but I find I have no reason to care. No matter the message, no movie can be good without being entertaining. Frankly, every character could be replaced with Keanu Reeves, and nothing would change.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tribute to one of the top 5 filmmakers of our time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I write this review just after hearing of Stanley Kubrick's death. It's a great loss, and I write about 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, because I feel it is the consummate Kubrick film, the one he will be most remembered for. It is a picture like no other, not only revolutionizing science fiction, but changing the way films are conceptualized. It was probably America's first 'art' film and has inspired the likes of George Lucas and countless other writers and directors.Aside from its visual greatness, the reason the film spawns so much discussion and analysis is because so many people have so many different interpretations of it. Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke, his co-writer, had a vision, but we have never really found out what was going through their minds. Of course, the skinny on its 'message' is how technology of the future will take over humanity and decide the course of our lives unless we are careful. 2001's ending is one of hope, a version of our rebirth through the star-child's flight back to earth. It is meaningless to many, but discerning filmgoers will understand.Although 2001 does not have the wicked, dark humor of DR. STRANGELOVE or CLOCKWORK ORANGE, or contain strong, eccentric characters that filled his earlier works like PATHS OF GLORY or SPARTACUS, I still feel he would've liked to be remembered most for this. If anything, HAL will be his most memorable character, dangerous, murderous, and artificial. It was a half-decade in the making at a time when Hollywood was still churning out dull musicals and just waking up to the New Wave of French and Italian cinema. Kubrick was a maverick director who made great films on his own terms, his own time, and for everyone else to marvel at. He will be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Order of the Universe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I spent many a sleepless night after watching 2001. Not only because of the psychological horror (of which 2001 is a masterpiece) but also because of the way it brought me (a restless soul) some clarity to the way I observe the universe. It changed my way of thinking in a very profound way. And after reading the novel (by Arthur C. Clarke) I found myself once again inspired (a writer as I am) by the level of imagination.The Space Odyssey is not something one can just "go and see". One has to be ready for it, or it cannot be understood. In fact I don't think it can be understood at all, at least not all of it at once. It is a philosophical journey to the infinite and beyond, a masterpiece of it's genre and still after 32 years technically quite impressive all the way to the powerful musical soundtrack featuring 'Also spracht Zarathustra' by Richard Strauss and 'Blue Danube' by Johann Strauss.Take all the time you want, but eventually you are going to have to see this film. If it can bring some order and understanding to the universe of a struggling artist like me, it can certainly do it for you as well.Or maybe I'm just plain crazy...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cosmic Art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mankind's Self awakening is the theme of "2001: A Space Odyssey", a process that unfolds along a space-time continuum. We "see" our primordial past, and we "infer" a cosmic future. The powers of intuition thus become the doors of perception, in our ongoing collective journey.From this transcendental perspective, a conventional, egocentric plot seems superfluous. Our frenzied conflicts and self-important dialogue are consumed in evolutionary change, and are irrelevant in a cosmos that is vast beyond comprehension. It's a tough lesson for a vain and aggressive species. Not surprising then that some of us huff and puff about the film's slowness and minimal story. For perceptive viewers, the remuneration is an inspirational sense of wonder and awe.In this film, which is mostly visual, geometric symbols guide our intuition. Circles and arcs represent nature. Right angles represent conscious intelligence. Some people think the sleek, black monolith is a Von Neumann probe. Maybe. Without doubt, the monolith is a visual metaphor for an extraterrestrial intelligence whose physical form is never shown. Mystery is more profound than explanation."2001 ... " is unique among films in content and scope. The cinematography is out-of-this-world, the special and visual effects are breathtaking, and the classical music is sublime. I rarely use the word "masterpiece" to describe a movie. But Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey" is art in the highest sense, like Leonardo da Vinci's "Mona Lisa", or Vincent Van Gogh's "The Starry Night".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>film is a poetical contemplation of most exciting eternal questions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is certainly one of the greatest films ever made. It is a story told in a steady pace, told mostly not by words but by cinematic means of expression. Perfect blend of spectacular special effects and classical music bring to life creations of human imagination in both realistic and poetical way. The story itself is quite simple at a first glance. As the title implies, there is an archetypal journey, a motive repeated for thousands of years. This motive was always used not only to depict a trip in space and time, and beyond, but also had rich philosophic meaning. The film is a poetical contemplation of most exciting eternal questions. It is not just an odyssey of a person; it is an odyssey of our species. The film is great by itself, yet, in my case, the impression from it will always be mingled with that from the book. I've read it at the age of 10, really not thinking about problems like 'what is the relationship between evolution of humankind and development of human morality'. But the impression was great enough to make me fall for entire genre of science fiction.The day I learned '2001' got only special effects Oscar and was not even nominated for the Best Picture was the day when 'Academy Award' completely became two words meaning nothing to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film about everything</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like a Circle around the human condition, 2001 starts at the beginning, skips the middle, and proceeds to the ending, right back where we started. Noting the weakness of words compared to image(s), Kubrick wisely dispenses with dialogue, preferring the power and essence of the scenery, and allowing the intelligence of the audience to do the deciphering. Or not, depending on the audience.A monolith in cinematic history, 2001 is a high water mark of direction, execution, and achievement. If one considers the ambition of the film (a film about everything), and the measure of success the film achieved to that end, a very sound argument for this being the greatest of all films can be made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"200l: A Space Odyssey" is a supremely intriguing space-travel journey with a profound look at mankind's future... It is one of the very few great films of our times... It gives us something to think, talk and argue... It wonders about our importance in the universe and ignites our imagination and curiosity... It inspires us to dig for insights...As a science fiction fantasy, it is one of the most original films ever made... Kubrick's camera dances to the "Blue Danube" with planets floating exuberantly through the light years... It's an experience in the poetry of motion, a rich statement to the power of cinema...But "2001" reveals that it's not really a science fiction film after all... It's, instead, a philosophical enigma, a magnificent meditation on man's place in the grand scheme of things, and a quest to understand ourselves by knowing all else..."2001" is a unique film about man's evolution told in almost subliminal terms... The people in this classic science-fiction epic hardly matter... Kubrick relates a chronology in images of things?the mountains, the desert, the technology, the space capsule, the computer named HAL (who is more interesting than the humans), and the time warp... The final landing scene is the very hallmark of cinematic genius...As a terror story, too, it is a towering achievement (not on the same scream-inducing level as Hitchcock's "Psycho"), but in an innocent and far more haunting way...The film uses invisible but powerful forces to manipulate the plot but perhaps the most overwhelming one is the picture's vision of man... In Kubrick's fantasy, the Golden Age of man was a neglected instant between a man-ape's exaltation at discovering the first weapon and a nuclear-powered spaceship floating in a graceful orbit around the Earth... Man has indeed evolved!As a spectacle "2001" assaults the mind, eye and ear, with stimulating images and suggestions... We are surrounded by a totally believable futuristic environment... The film is filled with brilliant sequences and extraordinary moments: The first interesting minutes in which the story of the apes is told visually, without a single line of dialog; the zero-gravity toilet with its great list of instructions; the stewardess defying gravity by walking the walls calmly upside down; the frightening moment when we realize that HAL is reading the astronauts lips; the magical alignments of Sun, Moon, and Earth; the "Starchild" returning home to charm the orb..."2001" is filled with poetic imagery: the view of the Sun rising over the Earth; the tossing of the bone into the air in slow motion; the slow images of the giant spaceship revolving in a cosmic ballet..."2001" is also a work of great visual acuity... It allows us to view more than the mystery of existence and destiny implicit in every man... Its end troubles many viewers as they demand clarity where there can only be mystery... They insist upon an answer where there can only be a question... Every viewer had a different explanation of the mysterious end of Kubrick's film? But for those who can accept mysticism, the climax is deeply moving...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A whimsical, often spectacular view of a future in which advances in technology dominate the world. It is well shot and although slow-moving it is intense and enjoyable throughout. The featuring of classical music to establish atmosphere works brilliantly; it provides a feeling of awe, mystery and intrigue ? the same aura that Walt Disney worked in creating 'Fantasia'. The special effects, both sound and visual, are still spellbinding by the standards of today's technology. Aside from the technical pluses of the film, it stands strong as it is one of not many films out there that has something important to say about humankind, and where the human race is heading in terms of our increasing reliance on machines and our unquenchable thirst to discover. Despite an ending that is hard to understand, it is even harder to overlook this film a true cinema classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick's "Black Square"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I normally keep my movie thoughts to myself but this movie affected me to the point of voicing myself out.Movies are typically evaluated via (i) more/less objective attributes (plot, ideas, action, cinematography, etc.) and (ii) emotional impressions they leave. While the latter is extremely personal and diverse, some convergence can be achieved in the former. Unfortunately, this piece greatly fails in it: no plot, no original ideas, no action, horrible cinematography, and a very repetitive soundtrack. As far as the emotional impression goes: well, in my case, it gave me a highly unpleasant aftertaste: a very pretentious schizophrenic nightmare...Why is it so overrated then? I'd hypothesize that it is for the same reason as in the case of Malevich's "Black Square". When one sees something a piece of "art" of that type, there seem to be two typical reactions: (i) "There is nothing there, it is junk." and (ii) "There is nothing there but it must be great because everyone else thinks it's great. Then it must be an art." So what created this mob fame effect for this movie? I don't know for sure but it might have been the big names of S.Kubrick and A.Clark. Once such a "snowball" starts rolling down the hill and picks up the momentum, it is more difficult to stop it than to roll with it.Please trust your own independent feelings. Things don't become better because a million of other people say they are brilliant. Cheers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When Art Attacks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001 is the perfect movie for a certain group of people. You know who they are. Over the internet, in your college maybe--a student or possibly a philosophy/art/film professor. A person with a passion for avante-garde films with wacky imagery and little else. They're the type of people who find a college thesis' worth of material from the dialogue in the Matrix sequels, they're the ones that boldly declare a film 'art' and anybody else who disagrees with them 'just didn't get it.' 2001 is art alright. The kind of art that I can only liken as being assaulted and nearly beaten to death by an Andy Warhol painting. Yes this movie is art, and you will hate it for that.This is a shame since normally I like Stanley Kubrick movies, but 2001 is an experiment in film-making and nothing more. The plot is incredibly vague, revolving around monkeys battling a black monolith, a mission to space, and a computer program called Hal going insane since that's what most self-conscious computer programs do. The film is then peppered with other psychedelic imagery that are supposed to convey grand ideas. They'll only convey those types of things if you're pretentious and into that kind of thing, otherwise you'll view it as utterly pointless.2001 revolves around these whacked-out, LSD-induced images to string together some kind of story that interests you. It does not. A parade of shots that have little to do with one another and randomly show things happen does not a movie make.There are no doubt going to be people out there who will try to explain 2001's plot and why you should accept it as being a wonderful film. The thing is this: much like if you have to explain a joke then it isn't funny, it's the same thing with movies. If you have to explain to someone the plot and its various interpretations, then it isn't a good movie.Ultimately I can't change the opinion of the viewers and critics that loved 2001, but if 2001 proves anything it's this: keep your art to yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Drivel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is certainly one of the most boring and meaningless films I have ever seen in my life. I love science and science fiction both. They are in fact 2 of my main interests in life. This movie still bored me beyond description! The accolades being heaped upon this hunk of garbage is hilarious. The most amusing tendency among the fans of this movie is ridiculing those who think it is boring and meaningless as stupid, ignorant or both. I am a professional in the computer design and engineering business. I am not stupid. And guess what? This movie is still boring and meaningless. It does have some of the best special effects of its era. In fact, most of the effects in this film would stand next to todays advanced digital special effects without being embarrassed. This is the one and only redeeming quality of this film. It's a collection of very long, very boring scenes that never seem to end. People have mentioned some of the most boring parts. The problem in listing them all is that it would be much easier to list the parts which are NOT boring babble. This movie is a complete waste of.....what seemed like 20 hours of my life. I highly recommend that you never waste time on such trash. For those who will attempt to dismiss my comment along with the other people they have dismissed let me be perfectly clear. I understood everything in the film. It is simply a terrible film. This pseudo-intellectual drivel is a director who thinks he's quite brilliant in his high school level presentation and vision of the journey of man. Of course he is very wrong indeed! If you enjoy this then I suggest you browse youtube for videos made by either inarticulate adults, or videos posted by immature children expressing their simplistic ideas of the world and mankind. The director is incompetent. What takes him 15 minutes of very boring film, a segment he labels "the dawn of mankind", near the beginning of the film is a segment that a skilled filmmaker would be able to accomplish in about 2 minutes at most. In fact that sums up what this movie really is. Very simplistic ideas drawn out, and I do mean DRAWN OUT SEEMINGLY FOREVER, in an effort to convince the audience that the filmmakers were very smart people. Hold a copy of the movie in your hand and you will see the condescension dripping from it. It's disjointed. It lacks cohesiveness. It adds elements of science fiction, horror, fantasy, and pre-teen created entertainment. It also fails to deliver in any of these categories. Stop attacking those who do not like this film. They aren't nearly as stupid as is implied here. This movie really does suck this bad. It's almost entirely comprised of shots and contrived scenes which are intended to showcase the effects. Nice effects. Utterly worthless film. Obtain and enjoy some of the many great documentary films about the space program if you want to see great scenery of space. To complete this huge hunk of celluloid garbage, the filmmakers end it with scenes that are not only long but can only be compared to patients in an insane asylum babbling incoherently. No we're not stupid. This movie just sucks. Beauty? Hardly. Deep? If you have a 5th grade education perhaps. Worth watching? Absolutely not! There is nothing brilliant about meaningless film that must be "interpreted" by the few viewers who claim they have the answer. Thats just incompetent lazy film making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are two schools of thought about 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. One, is that it is the greatest science-fiction epic ever made. This is supported by those who claim to understand the complexities involved and leading up the Star Child ending. The others, like myself, find it as absorbing as watching paint dry on woodwork.The musical background is glorious, the colors are dazzling, and there's an interesting use of HAL as a villainous computer. Beyond that, there is nothing the least bit interesting about the human characters (trite dialogue and no personality or warmth to any of the individuals), the pace is unbelievably slow (so the intellectually gifted can philosophize on the mysteries of space), and the payoff at the end leaves you either breathless with enlightenment or convinced that you have watched three hours of nothingness.I had the same letdown feeling when I watched THE CLOCKWORK ORANGE, so your like or dislike of this movie is purely dependent on personal taste. Intellectuals will take the position that you are a mentally challenged clod if you dare disagree with their elevated opinion of the movie--so be aware that this is not conventional story-telling in any sense whatsoever and only for those who admire Stanley Kubrick's way with unlikely cinematic material.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Kubrick film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sorry for the lopsided rating but this movie needs to be dropped down a peg from it's absurd status on the IMDb 250. How this ever got lumped in the other great Kubrick movies I will never know. In Dr. Strangelove you had an awesome dialog about war and with A Clockwork you had a look at violence and rehabilitation as well as many other things.In 2001 you have a look at monkeys for 12 or so minutes. Everyone gets it. It's not hard to get, it's pretty, it has some smart writing but the lack of editing is like watching someones life from beginning to end. 2001: An Eternity would be more fitting. I know some people will say you know what it's perfect, every minute had to be there. That's fine I wouldn't want to rob you of your monkey action or your ship docking sequences but I swear you could do this movie in a short and not lose the message.Maybe that was the point, To do a movie with space imagery and a ton of sunrise images that you can play you're enigma CD with the lights dimmed low as you try and woe some woman with your impressive movie watching resume. Whatever the case this movie shouldn't be uttered in the same breath as his other movies, they actually have content.Knowing his work and picking this one over the rest would be like picking Bad Boys 2 over The Third Man, Eye candy over substance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read some of the last critics and was astonished, that ratings for this movie are either very high or very low, which shows that these people weren't critic at all. I had a great deal of expectations when I watched this movie. Many friends said it is superb and I like all the other Kubrick movies I watched so far. But yeah. First of all the complete movie is filmed with a very keen eye on details. The ape costumes for example are great and the space vessels seem very realistic. The effects are much ahead of its time and are still remarkable today. But there is much missing. After the initial ape scene, which has some great shots the really boring part begins. Wee see spaceships with Strauss' Danube waltz in the background. It is pretty, for about 5 minutes, but after it is just boring. The music keeps repeating and all is very very slow. Some of the former critics say that you have to appreciate the beauty in it. Well spacecrafts aren't exactly beautiful and the statement, you have to enjoy this movie as a picture is stupid, because it is a movie after all. Maybe Kubrick chose the wrong medium for his 'art'. Later on even the music itself stops and it gets worse and worse. Some critics said the ships must be slow for being realistic. That is stupid, because in space velocity is relative and it wouldn't be less realistic if the ship was faster or slower. Over all there isn't much of a plot, which doesn't need to be a bad thing if the rest is entertaining. But it isn't entertaining, therefore plot is missing. I have to admit, that the end became interesting again. After a psychedelic sequence, where one doesn't know what it means come a few very good scenes. My friend insisted, that one can't really grasp the whole thing without reading the book along. But that is not the characteristic of a great movie. The psychedelic experience could also have been caused by a lack of oxygen leading to a dream sequence. One couldn't know the difference. I believe, if you'd take only the first ape sequence and the last aging and rebirth sequence you would really get a fascinating movie. What I most hate about the movie are the people watching it and telling me it is one of the best movies of all time. These are the same kind of people that visit an art gallery for the sake of telling other people that they are interested in art. Even my friend, who praised the movie, suddenly admitted that the movie is in fact boring for the most part. Art is not good because it bores you. It is the same mentality as saying, that culture has to be boring and that boring things are culture. And yes, I am not the kind of person who loves action movies. If it would be an intelligent movie, it wouldn't be boring, because really intelligent movies aren't boring. People brag about the philosophical meanings of this movie. What is the meaning of a flying spacecraft? Why has to be a philosophical meaning in a fictional short story containing aliens teaching mankind? There simply isn't one. Most people say that this movie is awesome because their friends do and this makes me angry. To sum it up: Boring as a whole but has some interesting genius scenes. It is not a bad movie, but also definitely not great and it is certainly not mediocre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nietzsche and 2001</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm always surprised, given that the famous title track of 2001 is called "Also sprach Zarathustra", that nobody (nobody I've read, anyway) has noted the parallels between the movie and Nietzsche's famous work, "Also sprach Zarathustra". The idea of man's rebirth into a star child; an infant form of an indescribably more advanced being, is an explicit part of N.'s "Zarathustra"; there is a prominent passage called "On how a camel becomes a lion, and a lion becomes a child", in which N. describes the first incarnation of the overman as a child, transcending both the ascetic, altruistic side of man (the camel; always asking to bear more weight) and the rapacious, brutish, will-to-power side of man (the lion). The fact that the song plays during the star child sequence can hardly be coincidence. And also, Zarathustra said that "man is a rope tied between beasts and the overman." The structure of the movie fits that description: a brief history of man as beast, until we become truly man by mastering weapons and acquiring reason, then a long sequence about man (the rope, as it were), and then a brief glimpse of the overman. The inscrutability of how these transformations occurred, and the suggestion that an external force caused them, is also Nietzschean; in "Zarathustra", he makes it pretty clear that he doesn't have a clue how people are going to be able to enact these changes themselves and suggests that we will have to depend on an outsider (Zarathustra) to show us how to "go under". Bowman's psychedelic sequence at the near-end could be seen as Kubrick's best 1960's-style attempt at depicting the mystical "going under".I know these parallels are pretty broad, and almost certainly have been noted elsewhere despite the fact that I have not personally seen it. But I just wanted to mention them, if for no other reason than to try to dispel the myth that Nietzsche was ultimately a gloomy philosopher. Few people find the ending of 2001 to be gloomy, and it is in my opinion, explicitly and unmistakeably Nietzschean. The case could certainly be made that 2001 is above all a dramatization of "Zarathustra" updated for the modern age. Feel free to disregard the outright snobbishness of my tying everything to Nietzsche.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Ape to Starchild; The Path of Being</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead;First, the film is not boring and inscrutable if you understand that Kubrick like Leone is telling his story with visual not verbal method. The opening sequence contains the entire story in microcosm; The dark globe is animal night, the crescent upon it is the barely rational man with a sliver of reason upon animal night. The sun is the Starchild; pure reason now completely separated from the animal body. The use of the ascending octaves of Richard Strauss's tribute to Nietzsche's masterwork Thus Spoke Zarathustra echoes what I am saying. The octaves ascend into the major crescendo into the star child it is simply the reason why Stanley Kubrick was the master he will always be remembered to be. Nietzsche's work echoes the same theme the path to the ubermensch. The monolith facilitates the next step in human evolution; it is a form for that which is formless. The ape picks up the bone, as Strauss plays, he realizes within the crescendo that it can be used as a weapon of power. This changes everything; the apes no longer cower in fear eating plants and being prey. They fight wars conquer and subdue their environment. The ape throws his bone of power into the air: Kubrick changes it into a nuclear weapons platform aiming at the slightly evolved apes' new enemies. How little man has changed from the ape Stanley is telling us. Do not be too impressed we are not far from the murderous carnivorous savages we came from. The HAL story is the story of the chasm between what we believe ourselves to be evolved rational sophisticates and what we really are. Notice, the empty clichéd lying conversation between Dr. Floyd and the Russians at the space station. How empty and full of deceit. The exact theme of DR STRANGELOVE; humans are barely rational dangerous violent savages who live within a self flattering delusion about their putative rationality. HAL was programmed by people who live in the dark about their natures; hence, HAL goes crazy trying to reconcile the two sides of his programming: 1. Perfect information processing and 2. Being as Human as possible. The conflict arises out of man's boundless mendacity that causes HAL to begin lying to the crew then killing off the witnesses. Kubrick loves to let us play with our hubris about ourselves then showing us how completely deluded we are about how irrational we utterly are. Like CLOCKWORK ORANGE, the people curing violent Alex have no idea the dangerously violent world they are releasing now defenseless Alex into. They live in the same fantasy about their society and human nature. 2001, like all of Kubrick's films, is about the same topic however different on the surface. The canyon between what we think we are the apex of rationality and what we really are barely rational violent savages. The film is a masterpiece for it is the closest to Sergio Leone that an American ever came. Pure visual storytelling using images and not dialogue with music beautifully crafted to echo the themes. If you are confused about what you are seeing, listen to the music. The ascending majors of Richard Strauss are ape, man and the crescendo of the Starchild. This is a visual one of a kind work of art using your eyes and ears for images and music not dialogue. If you wish to understand you only have to ignore the dialogue which is always meaningless chatter in Kubrick; study the images and the music. Then, my friend, you will cherish Stanley's treasure as much as I do."Behold, Life itself spoke to me, I am that which must overcome itself."Nietzsche From Zarathustra</fullReview>

Some great critic said it was good, and many others followed. To have the courage to tell the truth, and say it was slow, and boring would make them seem non intellectual. The fact is it is very slow, and boring. The fact that some have called it the BEST movie ever made, is not realistic. Anyone, who has, or can sit through this in it's full length (I have many times) is trying to see what the critics find so wonderful about it. it is not.

		<fullReview>This movie is not just good, its amazing. Besides providing us with good performances, original plot, fantastic special effects, thoughtful messages and a lot more, it was an, until then, completely unseen world to the public. This is the first sci-fi movie that takes us out into the unknown space of our galaxy with such splendid effects and mind bursting reality that the audience is left without words. I am only 16 years old, and therefore I was raised into a world of modern effects and 3D animations in the movies. But nonetheless I was really, and I mean completely, blown away by the quality of these effects, even after almost 40 years. The visual effects was just one of the merits of this movie, the camera was in true Kubrick style amazing and enchanting. It feels like you are consumed by the screen and sucked into this surreal world (especially in the round control room or whatever you call it). The effects, the camera and the sheer size of this movie caught me of my guards even though I had seen the rating before I bought it. But this movie has more to it than this. The meaning of this movie can also be interpreted as you wish yourself, even though I think there are some clear points concerning humanity (also true Kubrick style). How humanity on top of its evolution is just maintenance on board, and therefore not needed by the computer, one of humanities tools. How we in space appear like babies, learning to walk once more, losing control of our tools in zero-gravity, breathing through equipment as fish out of water. On the peak of evolution, we set out into the never-ending adventure as simple primates. Many might think that the length and slow pace of this movie is, boring? ridicules? or just a waste of time. But before you can jump to those conclusions, think about why Kubrick spends time with calm music and a spaceship in the middle of space for several minutes. This is to illustrate the beauty of it. Beauty, beauty is in many cases not granted the rightful respect by viewers. Kubrick wants to show us beauty, and if we do not succumb to it and relax, we can not enjoy this film as it was intended. This is not an ordinary movie, we can not just sit and watch as we can with some other movies, this requires time, thoughts and above all commitment and feelings to watch. All of this together, makes this one of the greatest achievements in the world of moving pictures. 10/10 Let me know if you agree with me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mesmerizing experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(r#54)Only Stanley Kubrick could create a film like 2001. It is unlike anything made before or after it and whether you like it or not, it is an unforgettable experience. I urge anyone who disliked this film to give it at least one more chance - I can honestly say that the film was way too far off the wall for me to appreciate it the first time I watched it.2001 is overflowing with iconic images, from the opening scene accompanied by Richard Strauss' "Thus Spoke Zarathustra", to the bone being tossed into the air by the ape. It has become such a huge phenomenon that even today TV series, movies, parodies and comics continue to spoof it. It is impossible to hear The Blue Danube without associating it to Kubrick's masterpiece. And that is what it is, in every sense of the word: a masterpiece. Nothing is half-baked or average about 2001 - it is a work of enormous attention to detail and love for the art of movie-making itself. Although Kubrick continued to direct amazing movies like The Shining, A Clockwork Orange and Full Metal Jacket (which were all far more accessible movies) after 2001, he couldn't top this: his crowning achievement.It's easy to see how viewers may be put off by 2001 - it doesn't follow the usual movie formula where the plot comes to a conclusion at the end. In fact, neither before nor after 2001 has a movie been made the same way. Plot line and characters are more or less redundant in this film: It's all in the images and music, and what it all means. I won't go into the point of 2001 since I haven't read the book and I think it is up to each viewer to decide for himself what it all means.The movie jumps from the very dawn of man's use of weapons to a time when space is heavily trafficked, and continues to show us the fate of some unlucky astronauts at the hands of a super-intelligent computer called HAL-9000. I won't spoil what happens in the end but I will say that if you could see it coming, you must be some kind of super genius; as far as I'm concerned it is the single least predictable ending for a movie, ever.Kubrick is the only director that I know of who has portrayed space in the most realistic way possible: vast, endless, dark, empty, and soundless. It's admirable that a director goes out of his way to make sure no sounds are heard in space, but rather than let this make the movie dreary and dull, Kubrick uses this to his advantage: the chilling silence of some scenes actually help build up the atmosphere in a way that no movie has done before. Some scenes are outright scary, working at an almost subconscious level. Kubrick has always been a master of creating moods and emotions with the viewer, and 2001 is the prime example of this: The climactic scene in the bathroom is unbelievably frightening, and Kubrick creates a sense of dread purely without monsters, murderers or loud music. It's amazing.The movie is highly meditative and definitely not the one to watch if you want a loud, action-packed Star Wars-type adventure. The long periods of near-complete silence, the low-key dialogue, HAL's monotonous voice (a stroke of genius) and the scattered pieces of classical music set you in a state of complete relaxation and makes you think. I realize this is highly personal and will not work for all viewers. The special effects are pitch-perfect, still as good today as they were almost 40 years ago. While the digital effects of the Star Wars prequels will be outdated in 10 years, 2001 will continue to stun people with its shockingly realistic and believable effects. Although I would have preferred Kubrick to win the Best Director Oscar for this (as well as many of his other films), the Best Effects award is completely deserved. 2001 still beats many of today's movies in terms of best effects.If you've grown tired of mediocre movies, give 2001 another chance. At first viewing, I thought it was tiresome and drawn out. At second viewing, it was the most perfect movie ever made. If you're open minded, this is for you, if Pirates of the Caribbean is your favourite movie of all time, it's not - and I don't say this to insult fans of Pirates, I'm just saying that this film might not be up your alley.I hope I don't sound too pretentious because I know how horrible many of 2001's rabid fans can be. I know for sure that it is not certain you'll enjoy 2001 - but I urge you to give it a chance. It is the ultimate acquired taste, and in my opinion, a masterpiece of epic proportions.</fullReview>

But when I saw it again a few days ago I'm completely mesmerized by this piece of art. I'm not going to talk about the beginning of the movie that shows us the process of progress. The cube is the thing that I'm going to talk about. I think it's a symbol of ignorance. It doesn't matter how much we make progress in science because there's always unknowns for human even more than before. How much did monkeys and professors know about the cube? Which group has more questions? For sure it's professors who have more questions and more unknowns. The spaceship's style is like a sperm and we can see it better in the last minutes when the spaceship's body could be seen as a sperm like moving light. I think it means that our space Odyssey is like a sperm's journey to the womb. And our knowledge of the world around is as same as a child's knowledge of surroundings in the womb. That's why we can see the cube in the room at the end of the Odyssey in front of an old sperm and a young and new infant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pure and simple, this is one of the greatest films ever made. If one were to ever question the genius of Stanley Kubrick, they only need to indulge in this masterpiece to be persuaded to think otherwise. There are so many positives that can be taken from this picture that it is almost impossible to find a starting point.The film (which was also co-written by Kubrick) begins in ancient times, where we are introduced to the Neanderthals. Primitive and lacking intellect, they encounter a strange monolith buried in the ground. Shortly after this encounter, one of the primitives discovers a weapon that they use to not only hunt and fend for themselves, but also to evolve. As a matter of fact, evolution plays a crucial role in the development of this film, as the movie itself seemingly "evolves" from one era to another. Later, we are whisked away into the 21st century, where a group of scientists embark on a mission to study a new monolith that has been discovered in the far reaches of the galaxy. Their ship is controlled by HAL 9000; a computer that is flawlessly flawed as we find out later in the movie.Released way back in 1968, the movie has special effects that are absolutely breathtaking. As a matter of fact, upon viewing this film I had a difficult time believing that it wasn't filmed only a few years ago. The scenes might take a long time to unfold, but that is the beauty of the film. The classical music and the effects are used here to illustrate the glory of mankind's evolution thanks to the monoliths that we have encountered. Music plays a critical role in all of Kubrick's films, but here I feel it has the most impact overall. This film is one that every connoisseur of fine cinema should see at least once. I am giving this a very enthusiastic 10/10.</fullReview>

And flying across the United States from coast to coast while staring out the window is also a great visual experience. Yep, you're certainly glad that you weren't asleep the whole trip, but there's no way to stay awake the whole time either. Such is 2001. Looks Fantastic, but at some point you're just staring out that window wondering "For God's sake! When will we FINALLY touch back down and get on with it? Some fans see Stanley Kubrick as God. I see their point. God created this incredible planet and there's so much surrounding heavenly beauty to behold, just like Kubrick stuffs into 2001. That said, you just reach a breaking point at which you're like "OK, nice planets! Nice starry heavens!! Nice lens flare!!! Assuming though that I'll live at least one more day, I'll try and see the rest of it tomorrow 'cause I'm like really freaking' bored silly right now! Yep, tomorrow. I'll admire it . . . tomorrow . . . or the day after that, but for now it's just putting me to sleep. And guess what? My own dreams never leave me bored!

		<fullReview>I felt the need to review this movie after reading some reviews from other users, simply because I agreed with all. Those who love it, those who hate it, those who enjoyed it, all of them. And the reason is simple: everything they say makes sense to me. I watched the movie for the first time about 10 years ago, and watched it again last night. It still doesn't make perfect sense to me. I mean, the story is absent, the characters don't really get through you, and the ending...who gets that ending?? #SPOILERS# BELOWThe end makes no sense to me... The psychedelic travel, the space child... Maybe I'm just plain stupid, but spending two and a half hours looking at space, slooowww space, and in the end just watch a man in bed, then a baby in a bubble, no explanations, no nothing... Truly, if someone got it and has the hability to explain it to me without calling it "art" or whatever, simply explain it to me, I would be very thankful, not kidding. Maybe that way I would be able to enjoy it next time I watch it, maybe ten years from now.That been said, why would I rate it a 7...? I believe when I watch a movie for the first time, I should put myself at the time, the era, the social paradigm, the movie was released. And this movie is cleary ahead of its time. Note, that I am talking about the visual effects, and the general idea of the movie. This movie clearly marked an era, a filmmaker, visual effects and the idea of what space was like. For that it deserves a high rating, maybe the highest. Not to mention the hype the movie STILL causes. We still can't reach an understanding...is it a masterpiece, is it overrated. The only way to really be able to discuss it and form your own opinion is to watch it, so the movie reaches its goal: to be watched and debated. A blockbuster rarely does this, we just watch them to get some good action scenes, visual effects, whatever, but when a filmmaker creates a movie that creates hype, controversy and most importantly, a vision of the future, he is creating a cult movie...a classic. To sum up, as I said in the beginning, when i read people calling it a classic, a masterpiece, I have to agree, but I also agree with those who say its overrated and boring...For me both sentences are true.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If only one film makes it off this planet, it should be 2001.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If the Earth was about to blow up and I could choose only 1 film to survive us, it would definitely be this. What's funny is "2001" isn't even my favourite movie. But I believe it tells the story of humankind better than anything else I've ever seen on the big screen. Essentially it asks the age old question "what is the meaning of life?", and for my money, it provides a very satisfying answer.What makes it such a phenomenal work of art is that it is able to address some of the most divisive, incompatible human attitudes (in particular, religion) and present us with a model that we ALL can accept. Judeo-Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Scientologists, Fundamentalists, Existentialists, Atheists and even Satanists can find truth in this film because it applies no labels. Like the mysterious yet commanding "black box" that appears in the film, it remains exactly that: a sealed black box which can be anything we choose to see.The black box may represent God. Or it may represent science. Or it may represent history. Or it may represent individuality. Make up your own mind, and you will learn a little something of yourself. Really, this movie is like a puzzle with infinite solutions, designed to teach us about ourselves by what we see in it. It's truly interactive. No other film has ever made me feel this way.The plot is almost irrelevant, so I won't bother summarizing. What you should pay attention to are the themes and questions the movie addresses.1) Are we alone in the universe? 2) Is there a point to life? 3) Are we heading in the right direction?By the time the movie ends, you should have an answer to all three, and yet all our answers will be different.SO WHAT THE HECK IS THE MOVIE ABOUT? OK, since you've read this far, I'll give you an idea. The movie is about evolution. Not just your Darwinian natural selection stuff, but a compelling proposal that evolution was (or continues to be?) guided by some extraordinary force. If you like, this is the marriage of God &amp; science that we've all been waiting for. Or if you like, it's a testament to pure science. Or pure God. Like I said, Kubrick allows for every possibility. And I have to hand it to him for remaining so tight-lipped that nobody ever knew what his personal feelings were on the matter.The film starts in prehistoric times with a tribe of moribund ape-like creatures on the edge of either extinction or excellence. Then we jump ahead a million years or so to find humans in a similar state of stagnation yet on the edge of another fantastic evolutionary step forward. Finally we jump forward to catch a glimpse of what evolution may have in store for us in the not-too-distant future. If it sounds like a documentary, I suppose it almost is, except without Marlon Perkins talking over it. We are expected to fill in the details ourselves, and that is the beauty of what this film does. It takes a purely objective approach and manages to lead us to our own satisfying conclusions.A word of caution. I don't think you're supposed to "get" this film on one viewing. I certainly didn't, and I've never met anyone who did. Even Roger Ebert (who ranks this as the greatest film of all time) was initially lukewarm about it when it premiered in '68. So if you feel like you just got cheated, or if you have no idea what everyone's raving about, please be patient and give it some time to sink in. I saw this movie when I was 16 and loved the middle part but hated the ending. Decades later I saw it again and suddenly understood it better. But I confess there's still a lot I haven't realized. I suppose as I get older and hopefully wiser I'll continue to interpret new ideas. And that's why this is the greatest movie of all time. It is about evolution, and moreso it EVOLVES WITH US.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers ahead.2001: a Space Odyssey is without a doubt the most challenging and successful film by the late Stanley Kubrick. This is not a film that you watch in order to be entertained or amused. Instead it provides you with a banquet of food for thought, images that linger in the mind's eye long after the movie itself is over. It is a film that you could meditate on. The film intentionally offers us more questions then it can answer, it is made to puzzle and mystify, but leaves the viewer nevertheless with a sense of awe and reverence (that is allowing that he has engaged himself in the process of viewing it, enjoyment of this film requires some effort on the viewers part) the questions that it does pose are large and ominous, concerning the genesis and destiny of the human race, it's ultimate place in the cosmic design and the existence or lack of some creative intelligence behind the structure of the universe itself. The first of the films Four Quartets gives us a distinct view of the species past. We see our distant ancestors, half-ape half human, in a state of near starvation. The climate has destroyed most of the plant life and the vegetarian beasts are near starvation. An extra-terestial object, a perfectly smooth and angular black monolith, appears and the animals are simultaneously inspired by it's presence to tool-making and violence. They are transformed overnight into carnevores, and when two tribes encounter each other near a water source, the tribe that has developed tool making capacity, as well as beligerence, soundly destroys the neighboring tribe. The new chief of the winning tribe, empowered by the first vestiges of technology triumphantly throws the bone that he used as a weapon in the air. We see the bone transformed into a floating satellite, which contains nuclear weapons. We soon learn that the world is torn apart by nuclear paranoia. The characteristics inspired by the monument's appearance that once helped us to survive now threaten our very existence. Once again humanity is in crisis, once again the unearthly presence represented by the black monolith will step in to aid humanity in the next step in it's development. On an exploration of the Moon a monolith identical to the earlier one we have seen is discovered. The governments of the world, normally mortal enemies, have come together in secret to discuss the implications. A mission is arranged. the monument has been engaged in some kind of radio communication with Jupiter. A few men will travel to the destination of the transmission. Most of them will, for most of the time, be kept in a state of suspended animation. The pilot of the spacecraft will be HAL a super computer who has been programmed to imitate all of the traits of human beings. The film has many outstanding sequences. As usual for Kubrick the use of classical music is outstanding. Most memorable are "Blue Danube" and "Also Spake Zarathustra" (particularly appropriate given the film's theme of transcending ordinary consciousness.) The cinematography is particularly excellent as well, after a single viewing the film's final 30 minutes will haunt you for the rest of your life. The character of HAL is the most important from the view of the film's central thesis. In imitating all the characteristics of human beings he comes to have their negative traits as well. The paranoia he develops which almost leads to the mission' s ruin is an exact mirror of the paranoia that has allowed the political situation back on earth to reach a point of desperate crisis. The film suggests that these are the traits that we must leave behind if we are to proceed to the next phase in our evolution. The architecture of the film is also meaningful. The designs of many of the spacecraft are intended to suggest reproductive organs and the process of birth and rebirth, the central motif of the movie. The ending of 2001 is the most spectacular and triumphant ever filmed. This movie takes a view of life similar to that presented in the poetry of William Butler Yeats and James Joyce's novel Finnegan's Wake. It posits a pattern to history and human evolution that is cyclic, yet progressive, repeating the same events at large intervals, yet with the human race as developing according to the will of a being with a larger purpose in mind. Though we never learn what this purpose is, the film assures us that the human race is not meant for failure, it's destiny is grand beyond it's capacity to imagine. It continues to amaze me that in spite of this film many people continue to regard Kubrick as a misanthrope. This is a religious film, not in the conventional sense of adhering to any specific creed, but because of it's invocation of wonder at the vast panorama of existence and it's involvement with the deepest and most vital questions of purpose and truth.  In the hands of any other director, this would all be perhaps a little too much. Hollywood's view of life is too puny, usually to encompass the grandeur and intensity of a vision such as this one. But Kubrick was a visionary, he directs with utter confidence, not only that he can handle material of this kind, but that he is the only one to do it. The process of making this film used all of his creative resources. The writing partnership with Arthur C Clarke is the most fruitful in cinematic history. Kubrick had to invent some of the special effects that were used in the movie's astounding climax. The resources to bring his vision to life did not exist at the time, so he brought them into existence. 2001 is a absolutely unique movie experience. Those who miss out on it do so at the detriment of their own intellectual and imaginative capacities.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It takes hard work to get into, but when you do, its amazing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Originally, I was writing a huge analysis of this film to post on IMDb, going through the film, thinking about it in detail and peeling back all the different layers to it. About half way through I realised that it was getting too long, and I should perhaps be more concise with my review. This however, showcases the huge amount of substance and detail to be found in this film. In my opinion, the best films aren't the ones that tell you things. The best films are the ones that ask you questions, so that you can think about it for yourself.The biggest theme in this film, in my opinion, is tools. Near the beginning of the film we are watching two tribes of apes just after the creation of the world. They are rival tribes, but then there is a pivotal moment which changes everything. One tribe discovers tools, in the form of using dead animal bones as weapons, and they are automatically superior. When one apes is playing, smashing a bone against another bone, he throws it up in the air and we witness one of my favourite cuts of all time. Suddenly it cuts to a spaceship with a similar shape, millions of years later, and we come to witness the tools that were discovered by the apes now defining who the humans are. The place they are staying in, a spaceship, is a tool. Breathing, which should be a wholly natural thing, can only be done through a tool. A man's only means of contacting his family is through a tool. For a large part of the film the characters wear spacesuits which, to me, although it is all up to interpretation, is symbolic, as, without their spacesuits (a tool) they would be naked. Later in the film, we spend a long time following an expedition to Jupiter which has on board an artificial intelligence computer, HAL, an astronaut Dave, and about three other Astronauts in hibernation. The thing that is striking about this section of the film is that Dave and the other Astronaut who awakens, both give extremely unrealistic and unemotional performances. That probably sounds like a bad thing to you, but that's exactly what the director wanted to convey. The fascinating thing about it is that in a ship full of a number of humans and a computer, the computer seems to have the most humanity.In this section, the two Astronauts decide HAL the computer, has gone out of control and they must unplug him. HAL finds out, and a fascinating situation arises. HAL feels fear. Here, it is easy to view HAL as a one dimensional villain who just wants to destroy things, but really, I think he fears being unplugged in the same way a person would fear being killed. I also think he reacts in quite a human way, killing the the Astronauts in order to save himself. However, Dave reaches HAL's control room and so begins a scene that I think is more disturbing than most things you find in a 12 (I'm British, but I think that translates to a PG-13 in the USA). In this scene Dave unplugs HAL and the most interesting question in the film arises. Is this murder? Whichever way, this is a very sad scene as HAL shows genuine human sadness and fear. At the end of the film, after an odd sequence consisting of Dave going through a light, colour tunnel and then seeing various landscapes in weird inverted colours, he lands in an eighteenth century room. This is a highly debated scene and is completely open to interpretation, but I will give my views on it:In this scene, I think that Dave, has travelled so far out, that time and space are insignificant. What I mean is that he has travelled to a place where it doesn't matter where, or when you are, time moves randomly. You could be in the eighteenth century, you could be on earth, you could keep getting older or you could keep getting older, (which all happen to him): it doesn't matter. And then what I think is the most ambiguous ending in film history unfolds. A much much older version of him appears dying on a bed, then you see a baby on the bed replacing where he was which grows and in the final shot you see it next to the earth, a similar size. So what does the ending mean? What does the film mean? What is it saying about tools? Was the unplugging of HAL really murder? Is HAL really human? What makes us human? Is it trying to imply we are too reliant on tools? Perhaps it is trying to imply that we ourselves are becoming the tools, as the beings with the least humanity. This brings me to my first point. 2001 never makes any statements it, only asks questions. And the great thing about that is that, they are interesting questions I can think about for as long as I want and never come to a conclusion, as I don't think there ever was one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:First, accept my apology for the review up front written under my real name: Garth Barnes. I was grieving when I wrote that, not using my mind correctly. The review's points are factually accurate about decoding the narrative. Yet, it is morally reprehensible for the movie is Humanism distilled. It represents why, though I quote Friedrich Nietzsche often, I reject his "the many exist to produce the single Ubermensch." See, Clark's ending in his novel 2001 is not in the movie for a reason. Read the ending he wrote, the Starchild returns to the earth, reaches out his hand and destroys both the missiles and the planet. It reflects exactly Nietzsche's thesis: that the many, the Herd, as he derisively calls them, exist only to produce the Superman. The Superman will go beyond morality; morality is only for the masses of brainless, herd animals. The movie depicts both writers' hubris perfectly. It shows man developing from herbivores to carnivores eventually comes the zenith: The Starchild. This is why Kubrick, who was working with Clarke, deliberately left the book's ending out of the movie. If you saw the Starchild return and annihilate the planet it might ruin your admiration for their humanistic mind control. Yes, man, like Nietzsche, declaring God to be dead, seeks to become what he thinks he destroyed.My original review is correct thematically; I urge you to revisit: From Ape To StarChild The Path Of Being. I write this, having gone beyond my grief for my dead aunt, my mind's power is unclouded by sadness now. The movie is reprehensible, to people of every religion, for it shows man becoming God. If Clarke and Kubrick had shown you the true ending, trust me, it was omitted for a very good reason. To both Clarke and Nietzsche, our collective lives serve but a single purpose to generate the Superman. With Nietzsche, it is quite unambiguous that this being will be high above our morality. He will 'write new tables of right and wrong'; when you watch this overrated hubris filled fantasy of collective self-deification, you will want to vomit. The progression comes with the apes learning to dominate their surroundings, the bone thrown into the air becomes a nuclear missile platform, continuing the domination into Homo Sapien form. I apologize deeply to those who read that earlier review. Suffice to say, when someone you cared for in your home for five years dies, you are quite irrational. As a Theistic Existentialist, and truly to every person of every Faith upon this earth: Man showing himself becoming God is the ultimate act of disgusting, Evil Hubris. Kubrick knew this, that is why he removed the Starchild returning to destroy the refuse from which he was born out of. Even this version depicts man replacing God and ascending from Ape - Man - Starchild. It was born during the Apollo age when man was so impressed with himself. Those of you enamored of it, do Garth this small favor, walk through the Killing Fields in Cambodia or Auschwitz in Poland, then tell me how we are becoming God. As we watch human beings saw off others' heads on videos, forgive me if I don't become a humanistic votary soon. My friends, I adore Stanley Kubrick, as many of Nietzsche's quotations, but the movie is an abomination of human arrogance. I write this to you indifferent to its reception but it is my way of apologizing for that ignorant, block-headed review you see with my name on it. I carried the helpless for twenty years with His Arms holding me up. I cannot go to face Him with this on my conscience. Accept My Apologies IMDb. Deus Vobiscum. Q.E.D.

		<fullReview>I had no idea what this would be like the first time I saw it. I thought it would be boring and plotless, but I was completely wrong.2001: A Space Odyssey is the best film I've ever watched, Sci-Fi or not. Almost everything about it is perfect. If it wasn't for 2001, current science fiction would be more "fun with strings and fishbowls" nonsense.The special effects and models still look good today. The attention to detail on the spacecraft interiors is near obsessive. One one could sit through a viewing just pointing out tiny details on the monitors. But that's not really the point of this film.In fact, 2001 isn't really a science fiction movie at all. It looks like pure science fiction, but not if you watch closely. There are several plotlines about evolution, the use of weapons, etc.I also seem to like everything that alot of people didn't like. Kubrick made a film that was made for people to THINK about, not a movie for quick thrills. Space is huge and completely silent; Astronauts aren't actors . Why can't people seem to grasp these theories? Critics blasted Kubrick upon release apparently for lack of explosions and no overblown dance numbers. Now no critic dares say a negative comment on 2001 or else ruin their career.The brilliance of 2001 has now deteriorated into the nonsense of "Independence Day" and "Armageddon."

		<shortDescription>The First Time I Made It to 2001...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In late 1968, I got my dad to drive me to Hollywood (I was ten) to see "2001" during its roadshow engagement. Earlier that year, during a family trip to San Francisco, we had stopped to eat at a Howard Johnson's diner, and with our meal I had received a comic book promoting the film. (If you'll remember, one of Kubrick's less astute predictions was that Howard Johnson's would be the food franchise on the Space Station.) After the mind-blowing revelation of that comic book, I suffered through four or five months waiting for my chance to see it. It took two tries. The first try was the weekend that the Apollo 7 mission became the first to circle the moon. My dad took not only me but also my mom and six-year-old brother. We drove the thirty miles to Hollywood......only to find that "2001" was sold out. Quickly we checked the paper for a suitable alternative. There was an ad for another interesting looking sci-fi film playing just a few blocks up Hollywood Boulevard... "Barbarella." This was literally just a week or two before the ratings system went into affect, so the only way we had to judge the suitability of the subject matter was by the ad, which was illustrated with goofy, fun-looking cartoons. "I wanna see Bar-bella!" my brother cried excitedly. It looked good to me too. So off we went. Try to imagine sitting next to your fairly prudish mother in 1968, watching -- without any warning -- Jane Fonda's zero-gravity striptease. And then every stripe of fetishism and polymorphous perversity, under only the thinnest satirical sci-fi camouflage. I remember afterward, out in the lobby, my dad kneeling by my sniffling brother, gently explaining "Those dolls couldn't really have been biting her ? they COULDN'T really bite her because their teeth were angled in? if they were really going to bite her their teeth would have had to angle OUT. So you see?" But I digress. On our second try, dad took just me. This time we got in. The theater was huge, with dark red curtains. The screen was huge, but thankfully not deeply curved like a Cinerama screen. (Over the decades since then, I have seen "2001" several times at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood, where the screen IS deeply curved. Every time the spaceship Discovery is shown from the side, it curves up at the ends like a smile. By the nature of its visual geometry "2001" was meant to be seen on a FLAT screen.) The overture began ? weird otherworldly sounds like I'd never heard before ? as the auditorium lights slowly dimmed. And then, that amazing stylized MGM logo, created specifically for "2001" and never used at the head of any other film (although MGM did later adopt it for a time as their corporate logo). And then the thrilling swell of "Also Sprach Zarathustra," and that awesome lineup of the moon, the Earth and the Sun! An image like nothing ever seen before on a movie screen. Or in real life either -- "2001" was showing us vistas of our solar system that NASA photography had yet to capture even approximately. Half the time I had no idea what was going on. But I didn't care. To me it seemed like a film FROM the year 2001. I was enthralled, and goaded to TRY to understand. More than any other film I can think of, "2001" really lived up to that oft-misused cliché phrase: it made me think. Driving home that night, I remember doing the math: in 2001 I'll be forty-three. I'll SEE all that! My dad died in 2001.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I find the divergent comments about this film quite interesting. It's either a masterpiece and suprmely involving or it's a worthless boring fake. I think if you were in a Cinerama theatre and had the experience that Kubrick intended, there would be no doubt that you had just seen one of the great films of all time. The pacing of this film is absolutely dependent upon the overwhelming size of the image and the detail of the soundtrack. There is no way to describe in words the power of the first time I heard the Zarathustra theme in a Cinerama theatre. It went way beyond what you would experience even in a concert hall since the music surrounded you and the volume and fidelity were simply overwhelming. This is a film that had people shaking and giddy following the title card! And so it goes for the rest of the film. What may seem slow and uneventful on a video screen was just what was required for an audience to absorb all the visual and aural information. Those stills for example, at the start of the film were accompanied by desert sounds that were so real you expected a cricket to hop out from under your seat. And the long sequences outside the Jupiter ship involving the AE35 unit are entirely engrossing and set one up for the silent horror that ensues. I just watched the film again for the I don't know how manyth time, and every time I see it I am surprised by threads I never noticed. This time I was amazed that the film is so much about murder. Murder as the basis for evolution, murder of humans by machines, murder of machines by humans. And has there ever been a greater metaphor for our technology dominated society that the sequence of the man jogging in his giant squirrel cage while the saddest music you have ever heard plays on the soundtrack?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You've probably already heard all of the praise that has been given to this film. And, really, all of this praise is truly deserved! It is a beautiful work of art, and even if you didn't like it (which is perfectly understandable), you should REALLY still appreciate the special effects in this film. It changed science fiction film history, and just film history in general.I mean, if the Academy hadn't given the Oscar to Kubrick for best visual effects, it'd probably be the biggest Oscar snub of all time! Of course, I don't take the Oscars all too seriously, so it wouldn't impact my life or anything.The film is broken up into a few parts, all eventually being connected to a black monolith. The unconventional structure of the film makes "2001: A Space Odyssey" even more interesting.Besides the unconventional structure, this film is experimental in many ways. It has some pretty experimental visuals, filmmaking techniques (including a particularly famous jump cut) , and a powerful and strange ending that begs to be analyzed by everyone who sees it! While I'm not the biggest fan of over-analyzing movies, this is definitely an exception through my eyes. The film clearly wants the viewers to interpret and analyze it, and that is what makes it even more interesting.Kubrick is clearly one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. The already mentioned experimental techniques and visual effects have truly influenced some of today's great filmmakers. The film also has a genius use of classical music. The music and the visuals match together beautifully, A lot of people may believe that this film is boring or nonsensical. While it is understandable to have those opinions, I was never bored during this film. It has intensity, mystery, and, of course, beauty!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The visual masterpiece of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was so fortunate yesterday to experience a miracle in the cinema. While thousands were flocking to see the latest installment of the HARRY POTTER series, I instead traveled over thirty miles to catch Stanely Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY on the big screen. I've seen it several times on cable, video, and DVD. But watching it yesterday on the big screen was a whole new experience, a experience that I will never forget. Some people will call 2001, Kubrick's best film. I would disagree, I personally like A CLOCKWORK ORANGE as my favorite. But 2001 is a hair-line fracture behind CLOCKWORK. Both films are on my top 20 films of all time. I would have personally like to see 2001 on the Cinerama screen at the Hollywood Archlight Cinerama dome on Sunset Blvd. in Hollywood, but beggars can't be choosers. Seeing it on a big enough screen was pleasing enough. How can I describe 2001 to those who have never seen it before? 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY is a film before it's time. It's the most influental Science Fiction film of all time! Yes, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY is more of a influence than STAR WARS and MATRIX. In fact, when George Lucas was directing STAR WARS: A NEW HOPE, he kept asking his crew about the space scenes in A NEW HOPE: "is it as good as 2001?" This is a movie that was released before David Lynch's career began, that required several viewings to understand the meaning of the film. Like I said before, I saw the film several times, and watching it on the big screen last night, I discovered new things with the plot. What other person could think of directing a movie in 1968, where a computer is the most reliable and intelligent instrument on a space ship? And thirty-three years later, in the year 2001, the computer is the most reliable instrument on the international space station. Or who else could think of showing a video game of a man playing chess on and with a computer, in 1968? Remember that this movie was released when The Beatles were still putting out new music, the Vietnam War was going on, and San Fransico was psychedlic central. Speaking of which, this is the film that is dubbed, "The Ultimate Trip." Since people who watched 2001 when it was first released, would drop acid, run up to the front of the theater to lay down and look up at the screen. I pity Warner Bros. for not giving a full re-release of this film last year in 2001, (or at least a one screen per city re-release). But instead releasing SCOOBY-DOO and BALLISTIC on thousands of screens across the nation, I guess money talks. But why should I mention those pieces of garbage with this film review? I told people for years, and I'll tell you now that I would consider placing a video screen continiously showing 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, with a picture frame around the screen and putting it in a art museum. When hundreds of years eariler, artists like DiVinci, Monnet, Van Gough, and 20th century artist like Picasso and Dali would express their art though paintings, Kubrick did his expressing through film. This is one of the best movies of all time. If you ever hear or find out that 2001 is playing on a cinema screen in your area. I highly urge you to catch it the way it was always ment to be seen, on the big screen. And I'm sure, Kubrick would agree with me. This is one of the best films of all time, so giving it ***** (out of five) is to little for the praise it deserves. But see the film yourself and be the judge, and I hope you'll agree with me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps Roger Ebert said it best... "Kubrick's goal here is not to thrill us, but to fill us with a sense of awe." And no film I have ever seen captures man's universal meaning in a film as does "2001: A Space Odyssey." From man's beginning to his probable destiny, Kubrick has captured the essential milestones that may have and what could still shape the very essence of humanity. And he does so very very much with so very little. This film, without computer graphics and hitech special effects, accomplishes more for the science fiction genre, than any other film of its kind, including the Star Wars Trilogy, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and Contact.For me, this is definitely the best motion picture of all time. ***** out of ****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's slow go science fiction piece demands patience from its audience as he bombards it with endless visual and audio extravagance at a sometimes snail pace that challenges one's concentration and endurance. It is a film experience to be survived with an outcome that will either dazzle you or bore you to tears.Something or someone is dropping large domino shaped monoliths about the galaxy. They seem to exude a superior intelligence bent on spreading the wealth where it takes on Earth enabling evolving mankind to kill and conquer through weaponry. When another monolith is discovered far into the future on the moon, Earth sends an expeditionary team comprised of five humans and one sharp self confident computer, Hal 9000 to inspect and follow the trail to Jupiter to get the lowdown. Dissension breaks out on the ship however and the mission is jeopardized.2001 is a visually stunning experience to behold on the big screen. It asks a lot of its audience and caught in the right frame of mind a cinematic experience of the first order. Ultimately it comes down to whether your mood is in alignment with Kubrick's tedious at times self indulgent floating rhythm. For nearly the first half hour there is no dialog for the remarkable opening transition from the dawn of man to present day space travel. Accompanied by a spot on music score (Strauss, Khachakurian) you are carried through space in a graceful and awe inspiring fashion both inside and outside the ship. The suspense ramps up when Hal goes rogue but even at this juncture Kubrick maintains his deliberate turgid pace that for some may ask too much. The visual fireworks really explode in the final segment partnered with an auditory assault that is to be endured rather than passively enjoyed as the last surviving astronaut roars toward Jupiter.2001 is a milestone in sci fi cinema; the halfway point between Melies Trip to the Moon from the 19th century and the ease at which advanced technology in this day and age can achieve creating similar terrain. Kubrick's use of sound and score to accompany his odd angled flowing visuals is indeed as mind blowing an experience one might have in 20th century film but his pace is painstakingly slow at times and you may find yourself wanting to abandon ship. Since it's opening decades back I have made half a dozen attempts to stay the course with this beast of a movie and finished it three times, twice with disappointment results. The one other time I completed it I walked out truly blown away. It is the one that remains with me and it is a very rewarding experience informing perhaps that the fault is in ourselves not the star, Stanley Kubrick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only reason I give it 9 and not 10 is because of the ending. Too weird! It does lead me to believe that one or more of the production team were taking recreational drugs.But other than that, it is a wonderful rendering of what could have been and perhaps what might be. Rich in detail, stunning special effects and great sets. And all from 1968... heck, I was still in high school and, as a timeline reference, the Japanese hadn't yet brought their first 4-cylinder motorcycle to market yet.The one prediction which they had completely wrong was the operator/ownership of the shuttle - PanAm was strong in 1968 but would be long gone by 2001. And we haven't discovered any remotely controlled monoliths yet.Philosophically, the film contains several messages, but one pervades all : "we are mere puppets of the Universe".Don't plan on watching this movie quickly, or even once. You'll miss way too much of what makes it a Sci-fi benchmark.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001 is arguably my favorite film of all time. Few films have had such a profound impact on me in so many ways. Stanley Kubricks marriage of visual effects with majestic music is unforgettable. Right from the opening credits as "Thus Spoke Zarathustra" by Strauss is heard in the background I feel a sense of euphoria like no other. The slow pace and meticulous nature of Kubrick's style will make the film seem slow and boring to the casual viewer, which is why I consider 2001 the ultimate litmus test for the true film buff. Kubrick and Arthur C Clarke brought such complex ideas to the screen that revolutionized science fiction and brought it to a higher art form in film. Aesthetically the film is extrodinary, but it is also philosophically profound. This film is truly an odyssey worth taking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This move is absolutely, most certainly one of the greatest films of its, or any other, genre. Kubrick is not only one of the greatest directors of all time, but his entire filmography should be put into a time capsule and can never be forgotten. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a journey unlike anything I have ever seen on the screen. Kubrick is one of the few directors that can draw you in and keep you captivated from beginning to end, even with the absence of extended dialogue or plot development. Just with visuals along, 2001 is able to present a picture of the future that is both sublime and horrifying. 10 out of 10, no doubt. For my money, it doesn't get much better than 2001: A Space Oddysey....now, the sequel, 2010...that's a different story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The finest example of the art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't remember when or where I first saw 2001: A Space Odyssey, probably because it is just so stunning. It epitomises grace, both visually and intellectually, and more than any other film it perfectly articulates the true purpose of science fiction.Every film (if not art in general) is ultimately an exploration of the human condition; but whereas so much Sci-Fi is simply a stylistic treatment of another genre (typically the Western) 2001 explores concepts that no other genre could - and that is what Science Fiction is for, stepping beyond what we have in order to better understand it. Exactly what 2001 explores is unclear, as the endless debates and its notorious ending make, well, perfectly clear; but if it is meant to do no more than stimulate thought then it achieves greatly.If Fantasy and Horror represent the imaginative then Science Fiction is the philosophic, but only the greatest examples rise to the challenge and that happens too rarely. Blade Runner (Sci-Noir, but anyway) is one of the few, questioning another facet of human nature, again doing so without resorting to blunt explanation when eloquent ambiguity communicates much more powerfully. So too Metropolis, the Citizen Kane of Sci-Fi; but compare these with The Matrix Trilogy (Kung-Fi), which had the potential to be both accessible and thought provoking but finally delivered only glossy nonsense.As well as breaking technological boundaries in its production, 2001 remains the strongest example of "hard" Sci-Fi for its scientific realism and the wholly convincing portrayal of future technology - human level, of course. Not just in the obvious hardware of the space age but also for HAL 9000, undoubtedly the most authentic representation of AI in either film or reality.I love this film. Over the years I read Arthur C. Clarke's Odyssey novels and found them more or less enjoyable, but the original film remains the pinnacle. When much younger I liked 2010 (A Space Idiocy...) which can only be regarded as a children's primer and was out-grown long ago, but there really can be no comparison between them, maybe with any other film at all. Stanley Kubrick was painterly in his style, but I think 2001 more than any other demonstrates the purest work of his imagination. A masterpiece unconstrained by the world that spawned it.As I write these words, 1040 other people have already had their say and I can only assume that no-one else will ever read this. Sadly I'm not patient enough to wait for another 960 to do the same, so the ultimate 2001: A Space Odyssey commentary will have to go to someone else. I hope they like it very much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No joke, this is one of the best science fiction films I have ever seen and it's from 1968. The effects were amazing considering the time period and they still look pretty good today. The cinematography was also pretty incredible. The way in which all of the strange camera angles and camera effects used throughout the film, work together in conjunction with the effect of no gravity, create this confusing, cramped atmosphere that really makes it seem like space. The long stretches of music in the vacuum of space and the extended periods of no dialogue throughout the film somehow just fit perfectly. It's a strange and mysterious film and the ending is definitely something out of this world, but it just makes for one great sci-fi film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd prefer that you play the theme to the film when you read this review. Look it up on YouTube, if you will. It lends everything a deep, thick layer of gravitas; I think my review is no exception.Here it is, folks. One of those true event movies. A film that makes you remember the place and time when you first saw it. This movies revolutionized cinema in many a way, providing inspiration for the masses. While this is only arguably Kubrick's best film (I have it second), it is certainly his most important. Contemporary critics were stupefied and divisive; to me, that typically means one of two things: either you have a comedy film or dark, dark drama that heavily depends on individual taste; or you have one of the greatest works of cinema ever made, one that people just aren't ready for yet. i am confident when I say that this is part of the latter category.I'm sure that you know some of the famous lines or scenes from the film; the protohumans banging on the mysterious black monolith, the interactions between the computer and Dave, and the trippy sequence near the film's conclusion that ends with the main character turning into a starchild. (By the way, there are actual reports of hippies sneaking into the film just for that last third and tripping, which I find hilarious.) But this film is more than its most memorable parts. I mean, so are most films; but this film is all about the overall atmosphere and tone. There is little dialogue and little human interaction. This film is a cinematic experience; a film closer to Fantasia than The Social Network. The most memorable and personable character is a computer, for crying out loud. If you had any doubt that a good film could be made without any of the traditional elements of a good story, here you go.I am frankly surprised that this got popular, even in the sixties. It is nothing less than monumental, and one of the few things that I can truly, unhyperbolically say took my breath away. I don't think I need to say that a movie like this would never get popular nowadays, and it certainly wouldn't get the same sort of budget. this is a good time to remind that a movie being clearly from its era is not a bad thing. This movie swept in when it could and ran to the stars.Looking at the reviews, I can say criticism has not changed much in the last fifty years; there are still some who degrade an epic like this, unable to grasp the bigger picture. I am not saying that this film is perfect, but rather that it's beyond criticism; its faults are as meaningless as our planets in the grand expanse of outer space.To Mr. Kubrick, I tip my hat. And I will do the same to you, the reader, if you indulge in a film that grasps the spirit of science fiction like no film before it. This is the movie that showed that the medium could transcend its roots and take on a soaring life all of its own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>phenomenal, groundbreaking a masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A culturally significant masterpiece of its time. 2001 A space odyssey is quite possibly the greatest science fiction film (and book) of all time. When people mention the notion of space travel in film this movie arguably one of the greatest of the 20th century always springs to mind. Just the ideas and themes presented in this film are truly ground-breaking. Before we had Gravity, interstellar, star wars, we had 2001, the film that started it all. From the dawn of time sequence where the film begins we soon witness one of the most awkward plot changes in cinematic history. Suddenly we are thrust into outer space, into the modern era witnessing a spacecraft descending into a space station and we soon witness a group of astronauts on a journey to the planet Jupiter. Kubrick's attention to detail and predictions of future technologies were simply spot on. The video phone in the space station, recognise that? It's what we now know as Skype. There doesn't have to be a lot of dialogue for one to understand the very notion of what is happening during the film in fact at least half an hour of the film there is no dialogue whatsoever. I wouldn't even consider there to be a lead actor in the film, in actual fact the central character in this film happens to be an artificial intelligent being known as the "HAL-9000", the central computer that helps the crew control their ship en route to Jupiter. 2001 A space Odyssey set the benchmark for idea of 'Man Vs Machine' and these ideas were later evident in future works such as Bladerunner and Bicentennial man. Also we must remember this film was released before the days of flashy CGI style special effects yet the way Kubrick gave you the sensation of being in outer space was just awe inspiring. Not to mention quite possibly one of the most spectacular uses of Strauss's music in cinematic history. This film does everything a science fiction film should. It also was the first film to get all of the science behind space travel accurate. So if you haven't already done so, do yourself a favour and watch this groundbreaking, phenomenal film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2001 : A Space Odyssey : A Magnum Opus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick can be said as an Einstein of film making. 2001 : A Space Odyssey is more than a Movie. Its an unforgettable master piece, perhaps the most intelligently made movie of all time. More important for us is to applause Kubrick's effort as he has not made the film with a commercial angle but, instead brought out a learning experience through cinematic media. 2001 : A Space Odyssey can be said as a Mix of remarkable Documentary &amp; a superb cinematic drama. The best part of the film is how Kubrick has documented the behavior in Outer space &amp; in Zero-Gravity system. Its merely impossible to explain by words or novel to explain the behavior &amp; perception which one can face in zero-gravity. When coming to fiction, Kubrick shows how humans in 21st century overcomes zero-gravity by using principles of centrifugal force. Difficult even to mentally visualize, but Kubrick &amp; his team generously designed, crafted &amp; shot the greatest scenes ever, of the Rotating Giant Wheel Space Craft &amp; Discovery Space Ship's Crews Walking through the Rotating Deck. 2001 : A Space Odyssey is a Film about "Evolution of Higher Intelligence for a Need of Survival under influence of Unknown Phenomenon" The basic idea of Arhtur C. Clarke was that, evolution of intelligence on Earth, from Apes to Man was bestowed by some extra terrestrials (Aliens) and subsequently transforms them from man to the so called "Star Child" (Higher intelligence) at the end and after 4 million years. During a sudden Phenomenon in an early morning, the apes come across the Monolith, a Black Rectangular Object, standing erect on the Land. It was a very unusual object for the apes as in wide contrast to their present environment. The "Curosity" increases amongst the apes and by overcoming their "Fear" one of the apes touches the Monolith followed by other apes. Here is where they overcome their fear and gained confidence. Their brains achieves a second degree of intelligence. Soon after that incidence, the apes are able to "THINK" and then comes the invention of a "Tool", perhaps the best scene of the film blended with great music. With this "Tool" apes are able to fight and defy the rivals. The fast forward to 21st century visualizes the "Civilised" Man with his tool which is now sophisticated and in constant innovation. And there is a conflict between the man &amp; machines (tools). Excellently directed by Kubrick, the dispute between the Discovery crew &amp; Hal 9000 is remarkable.Try to understand our connection with the earth. If we don't have any tool with us we can still walk around and survive on land as gravity keeps us together with the Earth matter such as air, water &amp; soil. But in Space, if one loose control of his tools, he shall not survive as there is no Air, water, land &amp; gravity. Our organic form of life is designed to be in need of these. Here is the need of MUTATION. Its time, since man have reached its highest progress but is helpless in Outer space, there is a need for Another Evolution. A New species which shall require no tools to travel. And the Phenomenon again occurs after 4 million years. Jupiter &amp; Beyond exhibits that "Dave" the last survival of Discovery space ship, after killing HAL 9000, visits the monolith and subsequently enters a new universe. This again unknown, Kubrick leaves on us to wonder. But the New universe is Multi-dimensional. In the present world we live is 3-Dimension and we are able to move in the space around us in 3-D pattern. This is the rule of our universe. But Dave's new world is Multi - Space-Time dimensional. Imagine if you could also have a Road of time in which you can move to &amp; fro like the Highway on which we travel. The birth of Higher intelligence Life form is an origin from this world. Dave is influenced / mutated again the by the unknown monolith and incarnated as "STAR CHILD" in present universe which in the movie is a Giant embryo. Here is were the film ends. The Plot of the film is definite. A journey of evolution from "Apes - to - Man - to - Starchild" How it happens, Kubrick shows it as under influence of the Sentinel Monolith. But the evolution happens, Monolith is a fiction, but Genetic Mutation is true. Nature have always constantly mutated Life form to habitat its relevant environment. This is a story of habituating outer space.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001 is an abstract movie that will divide the audience into two camps, those who understand it and those who don't. If you understand this movie then there is no question that it is one of the greatest movies ever made. If you don't understand it then you will hate it.I have now seen this movie twice. The first time was when I was about 9 years old. I was used to the fast action and popcorn storylines of movies like Star Wars. The extremely slow pace of 2001 and it's lack of dialogue meant that I really didn't take much notice of what was going on and became bored with it pretty quickly. Since then, I became interested in Star Trek (which has a number of extremely thought provoking episodes (eg: TNG "The Measure of a Man")) and other sci-fi with more intelligent storylines.This leads me to earlier this year when I had the opportunity to see 2001 again (this time on DVD in full widescreen). It had been so long since I originally saw the movie that I really didn't know what to expect. As the move progressed, I began to think about the themes and ideas behind it. To put it simply, I changed my ideas about this movie completely. It is a brilliant film and I don't think we'll ever see anything like it again. The key to enjoying this movie is how you interpret it. Don't expect to the story to be spoon-fed to you like most other movies. You have to think about this one.*** some spoilers ahead ***My interpretation of this movie is that it is a story of human evolution. The monoliths represent some something that affects humans (and our ancestors in the early stages of the films) and allows them to "take the next step". One interpretation is that it could be an alien influence, but there are a number of possibilities.The movie can be broken up into a number of different sections. The first is "The Dawn of Man". In this section of the movie, one group of "ape men" discover a monolith. After this, they gain the knowledge and ability to use weapons and tools. This gives them an advantage over their rivals.The movie then jumps into the future where an unidentified object has been discovered on the moon. Eventually we find out that this is another monolith. This acts as a catalyst and mankind begins to explore the solar system. ie: For the first time we are leaving the vicinity of our planet. The first stage of this is an expidition to Jupiter.Upon reaching Jupiter another monolith is found. This is where the most abstract part of the movie occurs. I won't say anything about it, except this. How would anyone show something beyond our ability to understand? This is what I think this section represents. This is where mankind takes the next step and evolves further.There is also the story of HAL during the voyage to Jupiter. Again, think about what HAL represents. Also think about why HAL seems to have more personality than the human crewmembers. It is much more than just a simple story of a psycho computer! ;-)*** spoilers end ***I would give this movie 100/10 if I could. This is science fiction at its best. BTW, if you can, watch the widescreen version on DVD. Many of the shots are lost in the conversion to 4:3 pan &amp; scan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Odyssey Explained</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Central to 2001 is man's evolutionary bond with the tool, or what later develops into human technology. 2001 begins in prehistoric Africa, focusing on a tribe of apes struggling for survival. Following the mysterious appearance of a large black Monolith, apparently of alien origin, the apes give birth to what is the film's paramount symbol, and what the film suggests is the key to humanity's dominance over nature--the tool. This is clearly depicted when the ape playing in a heap of bone remains learns the destructive power of the bone. The camera zooms in on and tracks the bone after the ape hurls it into the air to convey that this is birth of humanity as we know it. The apes have gone from mildy successful scavengers into weapons-making hunter-gatherers that eventually dominate their planet. Also, Kubrick's message in this segment of the film is that the qualities of the apes themselves, and not the intervention of the Monolith, are responsible for the apes' revolutionary discovery. Almost immediately, the film moves forward millions of years, to the point where the tool has evolved into a massive network of technology that gives man complete control of the Earth. Now, mankind seeks to dominate the cosmos.During this part of the film, tangible characters are introduced and Kubrick takes his audience on a tour of the power of man and his technology. Kubrick has another point to make during this section: man's weakness in space. Stewardesses aboard a shuttle must use gravity shoes to walk; passengers are shown eating through tubes; and another sequence depicts lengthy instructions on how to use a zero-gravity toilet. Kubrick's motive behind these scenes? To demonstrate that humans are somewhat over their heads in space, suggesting that their weakness could lead to a challenge to their dominance.As the film progresses, the modern humans discover the Monolith deliberately buried under the surface of the Moon, emitting a signal toward the far reaches of the solar system. The discovery prompts the film's major sequence, a manned space voyage to Jupiter, for reasons undisclosed to the viewer. The first developing and round characters emerge during this part of the movie, including mission commander Dr. David Bowman.Kubrick also introduces another major character--HAL, a talking computer that controls most of Discovery's operations, including the duty of monitoring crewmen placed aboard in hibernation. HAL essentially represents the pinnacle of man's technological achievement, and inevitably embodies the film's principal antagonistic element. The HAL computers have a perfect operational record, and are considered "incapable of error." However, Kubrick's space drama begins when HAL makes an incorrect prediction regarding the failure of Discovery's antenna, causing Dr. Bowman and his assistant, Dr. Frank Poole, to question HAL's stability and competence. Thus creates the film's cardinal conflict, and a monumental battle between man and his tools ensues.Kubrick again subtly suggests human weakness in space, this time through the use of sound. In two separate segments that occur while the humans are outside the ship and floating in space, the only audible noise is the assisted breathing of Bowman and Poole within their helmets. This suggests that man is like a fish out of water in space, and computers have no need to breathe. The battle between man and his technology begins when HAL decides that the human crew might endanger his mission, murders the hibernating crewmen, and launches Dr. Poole spiraling into space. But HAL isn't as perfect as he claims, as suggested by his inaccurate prediction of the antenna's failure. Dr. Bowman, the last remaining survivor of HAL's murderous plot, manages to infiltrate the ship after HAL attempts to lock him out, and manually disconnects HAL using the simplest of man's tools?-the screwdriver.In the final segment of 2001, Kubrick's sci-fi epic takes a mind-boggling turn as Dr. Bowman reaches Jupiter, where the alien forces behind the Monolith have led him. Kubrick uses an inventive and stunning sequence of vibrant lights and colors to illustrate Bowman's journey into the unknown, leading him and the viewers to a strange room. The room becomes Kubrick's irrational stage for the final act of the film, where Bowman must confront a final test--his own death. Kubrick uses no narration nor dialogue to progress the plot, instead he simply challenges the audience to grasp his conclusion. However, Kubrick does consummate 2001 with a definite ending. Dr. Bowman ends man's evolutionary bond with the tool, and becomes the Starchild, a being of pure energy. Like the tool, this is just the next major step in man's evolution. Again, the alien forces are not responsible for this change. Instead, they merely directed man where to go and set the stage for him.This film is a marvelous concoction of science and fantasy, and is truly rewarding for viewers familiar with its subject matter. All of us should be intellectually stimulated by it, but tragically, that probably will never be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many people talk about how many times they've seen a particular movie as evidence of it's greatness.I've seen 2001 twice.I hired it out from the video store when I was about 13 (about 6 short years ago), and it blew my mind. Sure, it was technically sophisticated, but how was it that such a great reputation was bestowed on a film that was honestly just so weird-ass and boring???No dialogue for half an hour!F***ing apes running around hitting each other, and throwing sticks in the air!A mildly interesting segment with a mean-ass pod thing that tries to eat a spaceman, and a rad bit where one jumps into outer space, closes the door and all the sound turns on was the highlight of the movie.Then more bullshit!Weird noises and whines!Ten or twenty (felt like a hundred) minutes of flashing lights! Wakes up in an old room with an old man with a glass of wine! THEN A GIANT FLOATING PLANET BABY!!!WHAT WAS THIS BULLSHIT????This film LOOKED good, but made no sense whatsoever! And when a film made no sense when I was 13, I got bored! And when a film gets boring, that usually means it's ROOTED!!!My sister watched the film at about the same time, and I distinctly remember walking in during the movie's final moments and finding her sitting upside down on her head in her chair, apparently in an attempt to prevent her natural reflexes from clicking the 'eject' button.However, I read a bit about the film ("What's this 'rebirth of man crap', and how was I supposed to think of that?" I was thinking!) and optimistically kept a copy of the film in case it might have later value for me when I was older and wiser.As it turned out, I never watched that tape again. The years came and went, and I saw many more movies (insert nostalgic montage sequence here), read many more reviews, and the movie even came out in a new 70mm print at a few cinemas a couple of years ago. I can't remember the occasion, but the flyer (I have it blue-tacked to the roof above my bed, I collect that sort of crap) reads "Happy Birthday Hal.", but I still couldn't bring myself to sit through it again. And eventually, I realised that I needed to see it again, simply hoping to 'get it', suspecting that if I did, I might even like it.Then a 30th anniversary video edition came out in Widescreen, which I subsequently purchased and so it came to be that I viewed '2001: A Space Odyssey' the second time.And it blew my mind again.Every thing that I'd ever read about the film was right there before me, clear as day! Everything that I loved about Kubrick (by this stage I'd seen and loved Clockwork Orange, Spartacus, Full Metal Jacket, Barry Lyndon, and to a lesser extent The Shing and Lolita) was there, mechanical characters and direction expressing extraordinary themes. It was like Kubrick concentrate! I loved every single frame of the movie, it was like he'd taken every shots and scenes that grabbed me in ways I never realised why, from every movie I'd ever seen, and thrown them together in an editing suite into 2 and a bit hours worth that just happened to privilege the most important, mind-boggling, revolutionary, ambitious and all-encompassing themes ever existent.I'd crap on about what it means, but I don't really know. I could think about it for ages, but I'd just end up at the same place again. If you want to know what it means, try reading someone else's comments here! But I don't think anybody, including Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke know totally what it means, I don't think that is possible with any movie. It reads specifically to each person who sees it, like every film or text does. And I think I should shut up soon, but not before I make a couple of points.This is probably a rash statement, and I've been searching for holes in it and haven't found any yet. "2001: A Space Odyssey" is the only true Science Fiction movie. If you take the Sci Fi from "Star Wars" (I film I admittedly love more, it is PERHAPS my all time favorite), you're left with what? An adventure movie, part western, part Japanese samurai film. If you take the Science Fiction out of "2001", you're left with nothing. "2001" IS science fiction."2001: A Space Odyssey" is by critical consensus one of the best movies ever made (I'm sure you didn't know that), and one of the top five I have ever seen. I have placed the 'Keeping 2001 tape' incident as one of the wisest things I have ever done in my life, even if I ended up taping "Hamburger Hill" over it.Thanks for reading!I have now just realized that the time I spent writing this overlong review could have been better spent watching the movie again. Stupid internet...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, mysterious, influential and iconic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 1968, 2001: A Space Odyssey is not only considered the greatest sci-fi film of all time but also one of the greatest movies of all time. Stanley Kubrick takes us on an epic space voyage like no other, beginning the journey in the days of our early human ancestors all the way into the depths of space and beyond. Kubrick uses themes such as technological advancement, human evolution and extraterrestrial life to craft his story. Kubrick introduces us to the mysterious monoliths and the sinister computer, HAL. All while blowing our minds with stunning special effects, beautiful scores and avant-garde ideas and concepts. 2001 however as iconic and influential its is does have its flaws, those being some very slow paced scenes and very little emotion or character depth, despite these 2001 still holds up today as being a masterpiece of cinema. Beautiful, mysterious, influential and iconic. 2001 is not only an all-time great of film, but a beautiful work of art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2001 gives mixed feelings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001 is complex for me. I am a huge Kubrick fan and I like practically all of his very few movies, except for this one. I can understand why it is a great achievement. At the time of its release it was an unbelievable breakthrough in both idea and in special effects and direction. For those reasons I can understand why it is a classic. But no matter how much I want to like it and see it as a masterpiece like so many others I cant say that I do. Its not that I don't like the movie, but that I actually hate it. I understand that it is tying to go beyond entertainment and make you think and not give you some fake ending that answers all the questions it raises. Instead it is trying to be very broad and give some sort of enlightenment about humans and the universe and creation. But to me it just comes off as very boring and pretentious film making. It put me to sleep. Now, many fans of the movie would just accuse me of ignorance, but I do believe I have quite a large following of people that would have to say they were more then just dozing off now and again while watching it. If you're going to watch this movie and you want to go REALLY deep with it you might as well take the advice of the original MGM tagline that went with it. It was "the ultimate trip" and as me and two friends of mine discovered (along with all the original hippies that saw it repeatedly in '68 who made it the box office hit that it was) its not nearly as dry when you are taking that "trip" while watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the creepiest films ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think "2001: A Space Odyssey" should really be considered a film, but instead, it should be plain art. By "plain" I don't mean boring or uninspiring. I call it "plain art" because even to consider this genius work in the same category as other movies is risking comparison, and placing this movie beside another movie is almost unfair, because no movie has ever come close to being as unique."2001: A Space Odyssey" is by far the most original piece of cinema ever created. It not only represents an idea so creepy and so realistic, but also breaks barriers in movie storytelling. Everything, from a 3-part narrative to an ending that makes you think for hours, wows the audience and sends their heads flying back in shock. It's a movie that a few may find weird, disjointed and pretentious, but every good movie is criticized by the public.The movie tells the story of a major transition between apes, humans and technology. Apes evolve into humans, and humans give birth to artificial intelligence. Probably one of the most memorable scenes in cinema history, as an ape smashes bones and throws one up into the air, director Stanley Kubrick carefully crafts a flawless transition from a bone into a space ship. Kubrick then takes us through some creepy ideas about unexplainable events and technology taking over humanity. Though we see three different stories, they are all connected: the apes show the first sign of evolution into humanity as they become more aware of their surroundings and learn the nature of mystery. Then, fast-forwarding thousands of years later, we see the story of a spaceship traveling to the moon on a commercial craft, and as they arrive they are shocked to find a monolith, which then transitions into a couple of months later when a newer spaceship is traveling to Jupiter.Kubrick really shows his genius in this movie, as he both directs the movie and the special effects. For the year it was made, "2001: A Space Odyssey" completely shocked the audience with one of the most advanced and complex effects ever seen, which wows viewers even to this day. In an age where special effects were all done by hand, "2001: A Space Odyssey" makes many people skeptical as to how they achieved some of the scenes without computer help. Aside from the stellar special effects, the score is the most haunting and unique piece of music ever put on the big screen. It so closely fits in with the movie with some major key scenes.The movie plays like an opera. It sways the audience in an inspiring music frenzy while also focusing on a story. And as we watch this movie brought to life, we question our own faith and our own motives in terms of creating artificial intelligence and traveling to foreign planets. What if one day our own race creates a HAL 9000 (a supercomputer with the ability to think and feel)? Questions like this are very much discussed upon watching this terribly amazing movie.Stanley Kubrick's best direction and one of my top movies of all time. It makes any other movie about space travel or artificial intelligence look shameful. A perfect film and an inspiring piece of art, "2001: A Space Odyssey" defines cinema as one of the most influential and visually stunning films of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Are machines more human than humans?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most people probably know the story. One group of apes forces another away from a water hole. The other group then comes across the monolith, which seems to imbue them with a new ability. One of the apes realizes that he can use a bone as a weapon, and forces the other group away from the water hole. Millions of years later, a bunch of people on the moon discover the monolith, which has indeterminate effects on their equipment. Eighteen months later, supercomputer HAL tells astronaut Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) that there will be a failure. When the failure never happens, Dave and his co-astronaut Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) realize that HAL may be malfunctioning and get into a pod so that they can talk about disabling him. But HAL can read their lips, and begins plotting against them. He kills Poole, and so Dave quickly disables him. After coming across the monolith, Dave then goes through a time-space continuum, which ends with him seeing an elderly version of himself. The elderly version then sees an even older version. The older version sees the monolith, which then portrays a fetus, which seems to introduce a new stage of humanity.It goes without saying that "2001: A Space Odyssey" is a thinking person's movie, but what is it saying? Knowing that insanity is a frequent theme in Stanley Kubrick's movies, let's address it here. We would jump to say that HAL is insane, but is he? He was programmed to complete the mission, and he would probably see fit to eliminate any perceived impediments. In Kubrick's "Paths of Glory", the soldiers disobeyed orders because they knew that it would be insane to obey; HAL cannot disobey orders because he is just a series of chips, wires and electronic impulses. So in a way, the people who designed him were the insane ones.What about the humans-vs-machines issue? Dave is human and HAL is a machine, right? Well think about it. When Dave tries to retrieve Poole after HAL kills him, the claws almost look like they're cradling Poole, while Dave doesn't seem to express any emotion.As for relations to other Kubrick movies, technology is going out of control, like in "Dr. Strangelove", and they are completely trapped, like in "The Shining".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that is not for idiots. I'll explain why.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I read all the negative reviews for 2001: A Space Odyssey (On Amazon. Com), I begin to wonder as to what kind of morons people can be today. In today's society, an acceptable film has to be fast paced and highly entertaining (Just look at the Oscar results of the past five years). They don't have to have a plot or a purpose. But it was the reviewer on Amazon who said he was happy that Stanley Kubrick was dead that really got me mad.The day that Kubrick died was a dark one for American cinema. Few directors alive today have the guts to try something new and imaginative. It's all sequels to hit movies (American Pie 2, Rush Hour 2, Jurassic Park 3) or remakes of old classics (Planet Of The Apes). 2001 was bold. It was a challenge. It was something new. It defied every set standard of Science Fiction films, from its unconventional narrative to its use of classical music. It showed that you do not need to have lots of dialogue to express ideas or emotions. Images can be just as powerful. And 2001 is unthinkable today without the power and excitement of Thus Spoke Zarathustra or the waltzes of Strauss The Blue Danube. 2001 critics also say that the humans are boring and `By the Book', while HAL the computer is sympathetic and interesting. That was Kubrick's purpose: The mechanizing of the human and the humanization of the machine (Another example would be the two airplanes in the opening of Dr. Strangelove).I have also read reviews of people who claim the movie is boring and complain that scenes take too long. Without the Dawn of Man ape scenes, would you really know what the hell was going on? It would start suddenly with a ship in space. It would still be, in your words, Lame! The docking scenes take five to ten minutes because that is how long it takes to dock a ship! It is not like in Armageddon or Star Wars where it takes just a second. These men are professional airline (Or spaceline?) pilots who are also carrying a cargo of passengers. They sure are not going to risk their lives just to arrive on time. Things are also slow moving in space because of gravitational forces and because it is a sterile and empty environment.Other morons also talk about how Boring the Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite scenes are and how pointless they are. The Star Gate Dave Bowman goes through is the Grand Central Station of the aliens (A highway you could say). The room he ends up in is a `Zoo' where extra-terrestrial `Zoo Keepers' study him and the way he acts in his natural habitat. The monolith there changes him from a young adult Bowman to a middle aged Bowman to an old, dying Bowman and finally into the Star Child. It is only boring if you think its boring.Some morons also don't know what the monoliths are about. In the beginning, the monolith is a teacher to the apes that causes them to evolve into humans. The monolith on the moon is a beacon. It sends a radio message to the extra-terrestrials on Jupiter telling them that the human race has advanced into outer space. The one floating in Jupiter space is the passageway to the Star Gate and I have explained the one in the room. We also never see the extra-terrestrials at all throughout the movie (We can however hear them in the room). Thus we have a greater fear of them because we do not know how they act or what they look like.My final thought is that if you have a short attention span or if you thought Citizen Kane was worse than Battlefield Earth, you should stick to Star Wars (Though I did like it) and a stupid Bruickheimer/Bay movie for your entertainment. 2001 is certainly one of the greatest movie experiences of all time and also shows that cinema can be one of the most powerful forms of art and can be utilized for other purposes besides showing people getting shot in the head or fornicating. It is also a reminder that Hollywood's future is always better than the real future. Oh how I would love to have my own Space Liner with it's own spacepods, a videophone and a zero gravity toilet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dueling Gods</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Since the disaster of `Sparticus.' Kubrick has centered each project on the mysteries of the narrative. Each film explores some theory or notion about the paths of storytelling and the fragility of those paths. Some get very abstract, like `Barry Lyndon,' where identities are adopted and plowed into nature. Some are rather simple, like `Shining' where the building is the author and teller of the story. But this is the most fun and in many ways the most interesting.Here we have three warring gods. Each might be the one who has created this reality or part of it. Each might be the liar who is telling the story. None can be trusted, or can they? The three are the `real' reality in which we live, but that of course may be completely unfettered by any logic. In the sequel, Clarke has this reality subject to jingoistic forces. The new gods in the equation are two:An extraterrestrial force. It may have even made us and how we see. It may have made all the reality we see as well. It is incomprehensible and capable folding time and consciousness. It may have made the story we are seeing.Dueling with it are humans and HAL. HAL is a machine with reasoning skills beyond that of humans. Thrust into this aether of creation, it may have gained extra powers over what is real and what is not. It may be at odds with the humans or the aliens. It may not be, in fact the aliens may be machines and see HAL and siblings as the point of their efforts. HAL sometimes seems human, sometimes reason itself (Dr. Spock is the palest of imitations), sometimes in cahoots with either or both camps.HAL might be telling us the story, a point underscored by his camera eye. We can't trust anything we see. But along the way, we see some pretty impressive things. It it hard to describe today when every third movie has a spaceship. But when this appeared, there was nothing at all like it. We were conveyed to a new and unfamiliar world, one created new for us, by whom and for what purpose we did not know.Ted's Evaluation -- 4 of 4: Every visually literate person should experience this.</fullReview>

My frame of reference made this movie seem like a long road to nowhere The plot moves too slow the dialogue is ancient the music whilst iconic was used out of context. I fear that a lot of people would give this movie a high rating because of the name and the aura the movie invokes and I can see how it is supposed to be a landmark movie moment. Fair enough this movie spawned some great concepts and i am grateful for that. However in my opinion and from my frame of reference i did not enjoy it one bit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely pretty film, but also extremely dull</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey is a visual experience like no other. Every frame of this movie is set up to near perfection, and the special effects haven't dated at all. Unfortunately, visuals aren't everything that make a movie.2001 is just so dull and boring. Sure every shot is pretty, but every shot also lasts what feels like a minute. We get shots of spaceships slowly docking, shots of astronauts running around the spaceship exercising for what feels like forever, and a long scene at the end where an astronaut flies through space while looking out at a very pretty array of colors. And the first 20 minutes are monkeys messing around with bones without a single word being said, a scene which sets the feeling of utter dullness the rest of the film has.2001: A Space Odyssey is one of the movies everyone looks into, arguing about exactly what it means. It is not a movie to be enjoyed, but a movie to analyze. And while some may be able to get some theme about human evolution out of it, for me to enjoy a film, it can't just be "deep", it has to be fun too, and there is nothing about 2001 that is fun.Should you watch 2001: A Space Odyssey? If you can bypass the story and view it as a purely technical production, then sure. But if you can't do that, then I do not recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Mona Lisa of movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I consider 2001: A Space Odyssey to be Art House, thought provoking, with great atmosphere. Going in watching 2001, you must rather focus on its atmosphere, which the visuals creates. 2001's plot alone is quite weak, but it's not intended to be strong, it's more about moving the story, then creating something special with the visuals, trying to give you more questions than it answers. Kubrick successfully provokes thoughts and emotions with this mesmerizing movie, 2001: A Space Odyssey is more of an experience, more about what you feel throughout the movie, and the thoughts it provokes. Kubrick creates tension through his use of pace, slow pace both story-wise and delivery from the actors. Kubrick wanted to make the audience leave the theatre with more questions than answers, which he expressed multiple times.The visuals, from its stunning cinematography to the ships in space, capturing my attention, seemingly it's as interesting for me looking back - from this day and age, as someone from 1968 would, if I had to guess. Its effects aged better than I expected, and kept astounding me. Kubrick shows here why he's regarded as being ahead of his time, even ahead of our time. Kubrick conveys years of information with only a simple cut, which can be seen early on in 2001.If you go into this movie expecting a fast paced sci-fi movie, you will most likely be disappointed. Not liking 2001 doesn't mean you're dumb, it's easy to see why someone wouldn't like 2001. It's long without much of a ''real story'' and lack of character development, with slow pacing and length, which are all good reasons for not liking it. Try to be open minded, marking it as ''pretentious'' is just as narrow minded as the people labeling others stupid for not liking it.2001: A Space Odyssey's score/soundtrack is a collection of classical compositions, the greatness and power it provides the scenes is much stronger than what typical film scores - typically telling us what to feel; as it most likely would, so having these compositions makes the movie more ambiguous and powerful, in my opinion.I recommend watching this movie with an open mind, analyse it or just appreciate its stunning visuals. As I've stated multiple times, you may find it boring, but it's still a must see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Admittedly, I never heard anything about 2001: A Space Odyssey until I saw a cameo of the HAL 9000 computer in the Epic Rap Battle between Steve Jobs and Bill Gates (nicepeter and epicLLOYD). I went to the library, borrowed a copy, put the DVD inside, and thought, "Well, this ought to be the clichéd sci-fi story. And for the next two hours, I sat in amazement as I saw the breathtaking visual accomplishment of a movie. It never failed to enthrall me and keeping me on the edge of my seat. It was, in my opinion, a highly realistic view of one envisioning the year 2001 in 1968.I finished the movie, and immediately went into IMDb for the results, and I was fairly shocked at the amount of people who disliked the movie. Most of those dislikes said something along the lines of "Overrated", "boring", and "someone tell me what the hell this is about."Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley Kubrick never really intended the audience to understand the movie completely: "If you understand '2001' completely, we failed. We wanted to raise far more questions than we answered."I completely agree with him. It isn't really much of a story of dialogue (which is kept to a minimum in this movie) as it is a visual story, along the lines of "Metropolis" or "A Trip to the Moon." The purpose of cinema is to provide a visual outlet to fascinating ideas and conceptions, relying on dialogue only to convey an actual story. 2001 manages to do both without the need of much dialogue, and therefore achieves what cinema originally intended to do.That is why 2001 is my favorite movie of all time. &#x1f44d;&#x1f44d; 10/10 (and I would rate it 11/10 if I could.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001: a space odyssey.For a long time, I had this movie on my computer and refrained from watching it. I'm not really sure why, because people close to me kept saying it's a great film and that I should watch it right away.And so I finally watched it yesterday.The movie is confusing, to say the least. The first 3 minutes are completely dark, with a strange sound that reappears throughout the movie.We then switch to a prehistoric planet, where apes and other animals are the (so it seems) only inhabitants. We see how they slowly, yet surely become smarter and learn some primitive techniques. Ironic enough, the scene ends when an ape kills another one using a bone. I guess the movie wants to tell us that violence is bad? But it is a sad and painful aspect of the (future) human race...The next story is about a research center (of some sorts) in outer space where a computer, called HAL, operates the whole mission. The research center is going towards Jupiter. The reason is explained in the movie, but it slips my mind as I am writing this. At some point, the computer malfunctions and things go bad.The final, and most confusing, story is basically a journey into the unknown. You could say that the 'odyssey' part of the movie applies to this last bit. For almost 15 minutes we, the viewers, are exposed to a colorful collection of lights, beams and shapes. At the end of it all, we see one man age in a single, isolated room. In the end, he returns as a fetus, as we see him float above the Earth.The black monolith, symbolizing evolution (I think), appears in all of these stories. There's probably a deep, philosophical explanation to it all, but I didn't get most of it.I'm sure this movie is an icon of it's time and yes, it is sometimes well-written and cleverly put together. However, my biggest complaint is that I wouldn't really call this a movie. Now that's not a bad thing, mind you.2001: a space odyssey is more like a string or chain of events. It's not really a movie as in having a plot, cast and connected scenes. It's a movie that really is unique to anything I have ever seen.I can understand the high rating, but I wouldn't give it an 8 or higher. I give this movie 6 out of 10 stars, only judged by a movie's point of view.If I would judge this movie as something else, it would get a higher rating. It certainly is a creative piece of art. But I don't watch a movie for art, I watch it for a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Slow, Cosmic Ballet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no question what Stanley Kubrick is looking for in 2001: man is insignificant. Space is vast, space is monotonous, and humans are insignificant because we cannot comprehend the vastness that is space. This space movie begins on Earth, before man had inherited it, when mankind was still toiling in the form of hapless primates, barely surviving and not at the top of the food chain. Then it happened. What exactly? We don't know, but something from above, in the form of a black monolith, helps the primates become man. Zip ahead a couple of thousand of years (literally, cut from prehistoric Earth to the space age is unofficially the biggest jump in time in movie history) and we find man living in space. One of the most famous, and beautiful scenes, of the movie is the ballet between a space ship and the spinning Hilton Hotel orbiting the Earth to the classical song "On Blue Danube." The music suggests grace and elegance in space travel, but the action and dialog suggest slow, tedious, boring work. This might as well be a silent movie, the most interesting dialog comes from a taped BBC interview that appears halfway through the movie. The character with the most speaking may be the computer that runs a ship that is headed towards Jupiter, on a mission to investigate another monolith. The infamous HAL 9000, voted as one of movies best villains, is not really a villain, just a confused cyborg. The computer is in charge of two living, breathing scientist and 3 who are hibernating. There is action, but not in the usual sense of science fiction action. There are no lasers, nothing blows up, just slow, problem solving. What happens at the end of the movie is open to interpretation, and that's the fun of the movie. What one of the astronauts goes through when he finds another monolith orbiting Jupiter is up to the viewer. Whatever you think happens, it is important to remember that we as humans look for answers, but in this universe, maybe we aren't supposed to have all of them. This is not a movie to be taken literally, everything is symbolic. There are no wasted shots, no teases, nothing extraneous. It's up to the audience to figure out, to answer one famous question, "what the hell just happened."</fullReview>

However, I have no idea how anybody could say 2001 has no plot! The plot is not the greatest of all time- it IS the plot of all time. To those who complain about the dawn of man sequence and about how useless it is: do you realise anything at all. My friend's sister is 11 and can't make 2 minute noodles, but calling anything in the movie irrelevant is just plain ridiculous. Everything is in the movie for a purpose, and if you can't realise that then you need help.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has the most astonishing first 25 minutes of any film in the history of cinema and they always leave me awestruck. These first 25 minutes have no dialogue or voiceover at all, but tell the evolution of man in a very profound and intense way; punctuated and complemented perfectly by Kubrick's fabulous choice of music.Much of the film uses quiet naturalistic dialogue which gives the film a sense of "realism". Many of the Special Effects are still passable even by today's standards. the only exception being the Wormhole sequence towards the end which does look a quite dated now.2001 is THE thought provoking film of the last century. It seeks to answer some of our questions of man's relationship with the universe, the essence of humanity and the nature of existence, and in doing so seems to leave you wanting to ask even more.2001 is unparalleled, unequalled and in a Genre of it's own. There has been and never will be a film like it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A totally unique cinema experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the years 2001 has gained a lofty position as one of the best and most influential sci-fi films ever made. While it is certainly a well made and unique film, it's an acquired taste that will take multiple viewings to appreciate. Many people see it as a mind boggling one-of-a-kind movie that remains among the best American films, others see it as a boring, confusing ego trip on the part of Kubrick. Seeing as how Stanley Kubrick is one of my favorite directors, I has grown accustomed to his directorial style. I feel that Kubrick made this film the way he did to convey the empty, vast feeling of space with long sustained periods of slow moving objects and silence. 2001 is definitely not a film for casual viewing. Although it is rather slow moving, you really need to watch every second of this film to soak in the environment and atmosphere that Kubrick creates. It is far ahead of it's time in content and effects, but the effects do not replace plot as is the case of most adventure movies churned out today at a regular pace. He really leaves the film open to induvidual interpretation, which is something all great films should do. I gave up several times on 2001 before I finally saw it all the way through. After two viewings, I now feel that it is indeed one of the great sci-fi films and it is not for all viewers. Once you have seen it all the way through, you will probably never see sci-fi films the same way again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching a movie like `2001: A Space Odyssey' is mildly depressing on some levels, when you realise the film world has lost the talent of Stanley Kubrick. His movies feature heavily in IMDB's Top 250.. because they deserve to. This is certainly no exception, and I'd place it even higher than it's current #54 ranking.The plot? Funnily enough there's not much of one, and it's hard to describe what there is. A giant black monolith appears before primitive man on Earth. Then it appears again on the moon in 2001, before also being seen near Jupiter. A crew, under the guidance of their onboard computer HAL, are sent to investigate. What is it? Well watch the movie (though you won't necessarily find out what it is.).What of the script and acting? It's shocking to realise it's about twenty-four minutes into the movie before you get the first word of dialogue. In fact the dialogue is incredibly sparse. A lot of what's there is exposition, as a character explains why they're heading to Jupiter, or how HAL works, et cetera. There's little in the way of banter, though the movie doesn't suffer from it. The acting, what's needed, isn't particularly out standing - Keir Dullea, playing the principal scientist David Bowman is quite wooden and his main counterpoint, the soft dulcet tones of HAL, is a blinking red light. Yet they work because the speech is so sparse, so that you attention is never really drawn to the performances.It's the direction that makes this movie entirely. In the hands of many others this movie would have been a shambles, but Kubrick elevates it to greatness. It's hard to imagine being able to make huge chunks of movie without dialogue interesting, and yet Kubrick does just that. It's an understatement to say the movie looks gorgeous - despite being a product of 1968, it still stands proud with it's use of detailed models (as opposed to the weak CGI still employed). The camera work is typically absorbing, often taking in huge vistas in a single shot that manages to frame the scene perfectly. There's a very meditative tone to it all - we can focus on a ship drifting for a minute, without ever finding it tedious. Each set piece is beautifully constructed, and yet never is there a feeling that Kubrick's style got in the way of creating a feeling of authenticity. There's never a break, or jarring moment, that jolts the viewer from the movie's universe, despite some increasing drug-induced moments towards the movie's end (which manage to still look fantastic - the Star Gate sequence is trippy, but dreamily invocative too). The sound is fantastically well chosen - the classical music score used at peak moments of the movie work great, and really add a sense of wonder to what's been shown. It's not just the music though that shines out, as Kubrick chooses to completely silence the movie at some points, or have one sound - such as heavy breathing - the only dominant noise on screen, drawing the viewer right into the moment with the character, with an intensity that would be lost if supplemented by needless music.It's hard to fully describe the magic of `2001: A Space Odyssey'. It's an `experience' movie that needs to be seen to be able to understand why it still stands the test of time. Watch it in a quiet room and dream of what may yet be. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good Points: Absolutely everything. The lovely mating of Arthur C. Clarke's story with (da Man) Stanley Kubrick's directing gives birth to a classic film with a life all its own. And here we have an interesting case of 'nobody got it, but in a COOL way.' The meaning behind 2001: A Space Odyssey has been debated since the day it first hit the screen, and this is, without argument, part of its charm. Clarke and Kubrick take the road less travelled and refuse to spell it out for us. If asked what it means, no doubt they would with a steely gaze reply, "What do YOU think it means?" Absolutely fantastic film in every way.Bad Points: The only complaint I have about this movie is Kubrick's penchant for stretching things out. Usually it's appropriate and well-placed, but sometimes not. I think most would agree that sitting there watching spaceships flit about to classical music is neat for the first three minutes, tiresome by the seventh, and downright boring by the tenth. And if we were going to be forced to watch every move Frank made getting to the A.E.35 unit, could we at least hear something besides that annoying hiss? Don't get me wrong. I love Kubrick's work and the man is a genius. But even genuises do something stupid now and again.Bottom Line: 2001 is one of the finest movies we hairless apes have ever made. The fact that it was made in 1968 only serves to further astound the viewer. Fantastic story. Masterful directing. This is what filmmaking is all about, people. Watch it or die.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2001: The Greatest Work of Art Ever Created by Cultured Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey My Notes and Interpretations By Scott HolmanOn the End - - As Bowman and space pod eject from the Discovery spacecraft we get a significant impulse of viewing a, so to say, new renaissance. Perhaps this is because of the significant subconscious correlation between the mechanisms and sexual intercourse, the Discovery as a phallic image, and the pod as sperm. These perhaps unrealized metaphorical entities symbolize the beginnings of an entirely new step. The psychedelic leap which soon ensues is, symbolically speaking, a parallel between the path to conception and birth, and the same to death and the inevitable after-product. - Again, we have the linking of birth and death, as Bowman, fresh from the for-mentioned journey, finds himself thrown into a cold, different, and thoroughly disturbing new world, in the guise of the Louise XVI suite. It is there that he is forced to confront his life as it would have been had he not been taken from it so abruptly. After this eerily profound display, he is given an option; to live out the life he has just witnessed, or take place in the next step in human evolution. Reaching for the solemn Monolith, possibly a fathomable image of God, his choice has been made. He will now cease to become the working man, whose mind functions merely to control his body, but become the thinking man, whose body is nothing more than a vessel to hold his newly formed mind. -On the Banality of Characters - - In the views and opinions of the author, spontaneity is a prime step towards the development of personality. In the films near future, as we have progressed into a thoroughly mechanical social order, so also have our personalities. When a life leads such a linear and predictable pattern, there is little chance of freak alterations, lending every person his exclusive one-dimensionality. -On HALs Mutiny - - It is well believed that emotions are the key separation between man and animal. Therefore anything endowed with these emotions is, perhaps non-technically, human (a la HAL). However, humanity is not selective, but a package deal. Therefor anyone filled with the essence of humanity carries the ability to act upon all that entails, whether helpful or harmful to those around him. Perhaps no one can be good without the ability to do evil. - On Extraterrestrial Existence - - Anyone, whether confiding in the belief of God or not, must believe that the universe is infinite. And in the infinite, an infinite amount of things are possible. This then, ironically, makes it highly improbable that extraterrestrial life (or anti-life for that matter) does not exist. However, this also lends to the possibility that these beings would be, rather than the bug-eyed monsters of the perennial pulp magazines, unfathomable to earthbound minds. It is therefore probable that these beings could exist in another spectrum, made up of a variety of unimaginable colors. The same goes for lines of symmetry, and physical plains. In infinity there can only exist infinity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick and Clarke. Twice the mastery. No wonder it's perfect.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me tell you about the first time I saw this film. It had been released only a few years earlier and was evidently still playing in cinemas. My father took me to see it one day. It would have been around 1971, and I was 5 years old. I don't remember much clearly, and at that age I doubt most people could, however one scene was etched into my mind. It was of course the ending, where Dave emerges from his pod into the room. Why did this scene have such an impact? Not because of its significance to a 5 year old, but because it was at the point in the film that my father told me we could go because there was nothing more to see. He then attempted to usher me from the theatre. Apparently, he explained, the "space epic" was over. I was unconvinced and insisted that we stay until the end (you know, when the credits role?). What I saw from that point remains with me not just due to its unique nature, but specifically because it was deemed to be not worth seeing by my father - someone who's opinion I valued and trusted. Although this time, I knew that missing this scene would have been a mistake I would regret in later life. I may have been only 5 years old, but I could tell something significant was happening here, and in a strange way, I have my father to thank for drawing attention to it!It was years before I saw the film again, all the while remembering that occurrence of years earlier where it was deemed that the ending to this film actually occurred before the final scene. Why? Upon viewing the film again as an adolescent, I realised why. It is because this is the exact point in the film is where it transcends a number of commonly held notions. It transcends the notion of a "space movie". It transcends the explicable. And it transcends the accepted conventions of cinema. I could see that my father was motivated by fear. The fear that my first words upon leaving the cinema would be "What did that mean?". A question he could not answer, or perhaps did not think it was possible to explain to a 5 year old.Go to see this film, and if you find yourself thinking it is incomprehensible (or worse, has no script, direction, theme, etc.) then force yourself to watch it to its conclusion and then watch it again until you understand. Because this film contains, in it's entirety the largest idea ever put forth in a science fiction film, if not in films of all kinds. And the idea is truly awesome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best sci-fi film I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey is the best sci-fi movie I have ever seen. From Strauss' "Thus Spake Zarathustra" to the HAL-9000 computer to Bowman's weird trip through the star gate, this film is perfect. It starts out at "The Dawn of Man", where we first get a glimpse of those apes that we developed from. We also get our first glimpse of the huge black slab known as the monolith. Well, as soon as the apes touch it, they became hunters and killers, something from which they weren't before. The monolith somehow gave them the knowledge to kill and hunt so they can evolve. Although these scenes are long (around 25 minutes), they are very well set up and keeps the viewer's attention, well, those who didn't fall asleep yet anyway. Fast forward 4 million years to 1999. A second monolith is found on the moon near the crater Tycho and a team led by Dr. Haywood Floyd (William Sylvester) sets out to investigate it. While they gather for pictures, an ear piercing sound emerged from the monolith heading straight for Jupiter. Forward a year and a half to 2001. The spaceship "Discovery", with it's commander David Bowman (Keir Dullea), co-pilot Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood), 3 hibernating scientists and central computer HAL-9000 (voiced by Douglas Rain) is on it's way to Jupiter on the orders of Dr. Floyd to find out what they can about the monolith and what is actually near there. Kubrick stretches out these scenes so much that we can actually be on the Discovery and feel for the 2 commanders as the boredom eventually sets in. Dave draws pictures of the hibernating scientists, Frank plays chess and relaxes, the sleep, eat, run parts of the ship and talk to HAL, that is about all they can do considering that HAL runs mostly all of the ship's systems. After Dave and Frank notice the "mistake" HAL makes, things start to kick in. The decide to disconnect him but HAL strikes back, killing Frank outside the ship by disconnecting his air supply, and then shutting off the life support systems of the 3 hibernating scientists while Dave sets off to rescue Frank (who is already dead). Then, to make matters worse, HAL won't let Dave in the ship! Dave, after some quick thinking, finally gets in the ship and disconnects HAL. Now, after this, we are treated to the stunning "star gate" sequence, where Dave goes to investigate giant, floating monolith over Jupiter. I have to say, I think this is the scariest part of the film, seeing all of those colors and shapes and objects flying around, sends chills up my back. After that sequence, Dave ends up in a hotel room, visibly shaken from the encounter, where he grows old, older, on his deathbed and then, turned into a child, reborn so to say. This film leaves so many questions unanswered and that is what Kubrick wanted. I mean, what was the monolith? Who sent it? What REALLY happened to Dave Bowman? Why did HAL malfunction? These questions are meant to be answered in "2010" and they aren't, making the whole story seem more confusing. People who watch this film will either like it (because of the questions being presented and the philosophical meaning of it) or hate it (it's too slow, boring, dull and there is no dialogue), either way, this film ranks up there as Kubrick's best work and no matter how many times I watch this film, it amazes me more and more and more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen 2001 all of twice now, but I will never cease to marvel at what an astounding accomplishment it is. I have never seen a film with such amazing vision. Everything in it seems so incredibly well and completely though out. Kubrick is, no question, the bravest director I've ever seen. What other director would have an overture, intermission, entre'acte and exit music now? The space sequences are truly silent, whereas Armageddon, for example, fills it with useless noise. It gives the real feeling of a void, a vacuum, of emptiness and infinity itself. 2001 is a visual opera. It tests the limits of cinema and the very imagination. I have never seen another movie that required real existential discussion afterwards. This movie, though it is over 30 years old, has the greatest special effects of any ever. The ending sequence may be the greatest 20 minutes ever captured on film. The title is perfect: "Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite." How it was done is beyond me. How Kubrick could have ever even imagined it is totally beyond me. I would say right now that this is the greatest film I have ever seen. It is a masterpiece. The film world is immeasurably poorer without Kubrick, but it owes him an eternal debt.</fullReview>

Even after almost more than 48 years its still beautiful movie with one of the best visual effects. Even while its not that important side of the movies in general, 2001: A Space Odyssey still can amaze even the most demanding viewers. For me this movie means a lot.

		<fullReview>It's 2015 and we have reached a time when our imagination exceeds our limits. We have watched some excellent and visually stunning space movies like Gravity and Interstellar which not only capture technical details of space travel and survival but also human emotion in midst of it. So where does this movie '2001: A Space Odyssey' stand in all of this? A film maker or an avid fan who lives in nostalgia and history of film making will find this to be awe inspiring for its level of expertise and techno savvy for a time that had imagined of mankind within grasp of eternal glory through evolution. For me though this very concept of relying on evolution as a foundation has flawed the whole narrative in an otherwise technically superior movie of it's time. May be if Kubrick and his team had stuck to a tale of survival rather than become overly ambitious in their approach they could have made it more believable and relatable. Instead we are left with something that brings you to a high with its visual imagery before coming crashing down back again with an absurd conclusion.The end product looks more like a pseudo documentary with humans who are mostly monotonous and who do not seem to represent struggles of mankind in space much less our achievements. I could care less for the fate of these humans or that of mankind/species that they represent which is sad considering that this whole movie seems to be attempting to get there.It certainly does not help that this movie heavily relies on visual imagery which in today's time we take for granted. Unless I take note that this movie was made way back in 1968 when we did not have computer generated wizardry like today I could dismiss this as just another experiment gone awfully wrong in which after some time my mind just shut off like that of the HAL on board Discover One.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Strictly speaking, I should have been in the queue for 2001 when it was first released - aged 16 and a major science fiction fan, I can't understand how come I missed it, and didn't pick it up until a cinema re-release 6 years later, when I saw it 3 times in 3 days.You can take it that I really liked it.The intervening years have cooled me down somewhat. I still like eye candy, but we're spoiled for it these days. I still like spacecraft and sci-fi generally, but ditto.And this leaves me looking at 2001 solely on its own merits.When I saw it in the 70s, I had read Clarke's short story The Sentinel shortly before, and I therefore had a pretty good idea of what the story was. Standing back and looking at the movie and imagining myself in the position of someone coming to it cold, it must have been a nightmare. I guess it would be possible to figure out the link between the monoliths, although possibly not until encountering the one on the moon - fabulous though the jump-cut from bone to orbiting satellite may be, I'm not sure it actually explains anything. The Jupiter mission is straightforward enough, but the final sequence is baffling to anyone not in the know.This was not a friendly film to offer to the general public although, to be fair, there is no reason why it should have been. I read aggressively defensive comments disparaging those who have trouble with the movie because it does not offer a readily comprehensible narrative, and I find myself thinking that, while there is no reason why Kubrick should have done so - his choice, and I respect that - it is perfectly understandable for members of the film-going public to be a little bemused not to find the narrative they expected. People expect things to be explained and, to some extent, it is perverse not to make that explanation available given that it exists.For all that, this is trailblazing stuff from an effects point of view, with a stunning vocal performance from Douglas Rains.By the way, count me among those who think Kubrick took it at rather too leisurely a pace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Movie Of All Time. Period.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was lucky enough to be first shown this masterpiece of cinema in my mid-teenage years, thus having a relatively broad mind, and the capacity to extend the limits of thought to understand the message that 2001: A Space Odyssey is telling us. First of all allow me to alleviate the common rumor or nowadays stereotype that this movie is boring. One simple unalienable fact that people must realize is that the differences contrasting between past and modern cinema are unlimited and infinite. The ever-present mood, emphasis and feeling that the 60s and 70s brought into movies is irreplaceable. In those days, if a movie was 2 1/2 hours long, the mindset of movie-goers wasn't "Oh, this movie must be so packed full of action that the 2 hours will shoot by like lightning." They were more along the lines of "Okay, this movie is long, it is an epic, what needs to be said to us cannot be simply accomplished within minutes, things have to happen before grander things can happen, an we are going to be shown virtually every second of it." The one thing people tend to forget about space and space travel and space technology is that it ISN'T fast. It cannot just happen as if it were on a timer as in the movie atrocity Armageddon. What happens happens at the pace it does to perpetuate the un-deniable fact that this movie, although a work of science fiction, is as realistic as it can be, regardless if it's about the possible futures that lay before us. These days, the audiences have been dumbed down by so-called logic in movies. It must all be explained to them, otherwise they leave confused and angry. Those who honestly dislike 2001 simply do not, or no longer possess the patience, nor the capacity to understand that some truths will NOT be merely dropped into our laps. What makes a fantastic film, the sole characteristic that classifies a movie as brilliant, is the fact that it leaves US to create OUR OWN meanings for why something in a movie is happening. The inner-depths to 2001's meanings range from knowledge of the universe around us, to the inconsistency of evolving technology. The rest is up to us to decipher, after we do that, we can believe what WE think is the true meaning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My #1 film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As you can probably tell from my identity (2001ASOfan) "2001: A Space Odyssey" is my number 1 film on my personal Top 10 list. I saw it at the age of 14, and it was the first film that fully engaged my imagination and tapped into thoughts I had previously had about life after death, the universe, eternity, and, on a slightly more mundane level, space travel. ;-) My knees were literally shaking when I got up to leave the movie theatre after viewing it, and I wasn't even on any of the recreational drugs so many of my fellow theatregoers were on! I didn't need them--it gave me a natural "high" that touched me at the deepest of emotional and intellectual levels. I have seen "2001" many times since that first riveting, obviously unforgettable, experience, and I marvel at how the film holds up, even in terms of its special effects, especially considering its 1968 birth. I have to admit the initial "ape" scenes have paled a bit, but they are thankfully a brief intro to the film, and the film still soars for me from the moment the final "ape" throws the bone into the air and it turns into a space ship, floating in the heavens. For new viewers, though, keep in mind that director Stanley Kubrick intended "2001" to be a VERY visual experience, and it is a much lesser experience on a small TV screen (or even a big-screen TV, for that matter). Try to make your first experience one in a movie theatre--keep in mind that it is being re-released this fall of 2001 in theatres around the world. I encourage you to make the effort to see it on a big theatre screen--you won't be disappointed. "2001" turned me on to film as an art form, and film as a potentially life-changing experience, and I've been hooked ever since. Kubrick continued to fascinate me with his films through the years right up to his death, mesmerizing me with "Eyes Wide Shut" just before his passing. I am wary that the project he was working on at his death, "AI," is being made by Steven Spielberg, as I would've loved to have seen Kubrick's interpretation of it. I will undoubtedly see the Spielberg version, but will be thinking of Kubrick while watching. I have always thought of Kubrick's films as an acquired taste, and was careful who I recommended them to, so it always amazed me when any of them were commercially successful. It's especially heartening to see "2001" embraced now continuously through the years as one of the best films of all time--since many of us felt pretty lonely back then defending it. It was a love/hate reaction for many back then. In closing: Thanks, Mr. Kubrick, wherever you are! In the spirit of "2001," I hope you're a peaceful and all-knowing "Star Child" now that you've passed on to whatever's next.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Need the right mind set</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First let me introduce myself, I am a 21 year old boy from the UK. I have very mixed reviews about this film, and am sure I am not the only one. I do not believe this to be a marmite film as most of the reviews suggest. I can and do see this from the point of view of both parties, seeing it as a boring waste of time and seeing it as sci-fi/cinematic history.I do agree, the story line is very scarce. There isn't that much happens, and when it does it is over before you even realise its begun. There is a lot of slow, boring and un-necessarily long clips of pretty much nothing; ships/people floating around, someone running, a phone call, a conversation that offers very little to the plot. I am not a troglodyte as some of the lovers of this film may be starting to think. I understand why it is included and done the way it is, but that doesn't stop it from being incredibly boring.However, to see this from a positive point of view, one must remember that this was made in the mid-to-late 1960's. Meaning that everything done in this was done for real, rather than CGI as everything is now. For this reason I don't feel that it can be put in the same class as modern sci-fi films.I sadly have not read the book of this, I have just decided to watch the film because my friend likes to quote it to me and I wanted to see what she was going on about. This left me very skeptical when I started watching, especially as seemingly nothing was actually happening. You really do have to keep watching and thinking about what it is actually depicting. A large amount of the themes and science fiction ideas were depicted on screen for the first time in this film and is therefore giving a visual insight into what mankind has predicted the future will be like and it is remarkable how much they have actually gotten right for what we have already accomplished and what we are still working on. A lot of the ideas in this film are still being copied to this day, and has now actually got me questioning Ridley Scott's work. I am not saying that Scott has copied Kubrick, just that some of the praises Scott has received shouldn't really be given solely to him for his work in the sci-fi genre. Kubrick has managed to show to the world the realism of space. We all watch films these days and like to point out, "that couldn't happen", "that would never happen", etc. etc. That is the reason behind all the slow and uneventful scenes, it is being kept to a realistic standard of how it would actually have to happen and to show you how slow a long space trip like that would actually be. The shots of space exploration also show demonstrations of the physical properties of our universe and how things actually happen.So, to conclude. Although this may not be an exciting, eventful or thrilling film, it is certainly a feat of cinematography. It more depicts the realistic side of sci-fi rather than the laser guns and phasers of popular sci-fi shows. So if you are looking for a fast paced, action sci-fi, then this isn't for you. If you more enjoy the technological/engineering side of themes like this, then it is right up your street. Just bare this in mind, be in the right mind set when you sit down to watch it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Personally masterpiece isn't even a big enough word to express this film. I watched this 46 years after it's release in 2014 and it's visuals are still amazing. It isn't for everybody but I have to say if you don't enjoy it you must not be a true fan of film. However you also may not like it due to its ambiguity. So if you can't stand un answered questions or making your own interpretations then you can skip it.This masterpiece of film is made by Kubrick for the viewer them selves to make their own interpretation. This film strikes so deep that it seems it needs to be ambiguous and never truly answered. However there is plenty of very interesting interpretations on the film including Clarkes novel who goes into depth and answers a lot of unanswered questions but then again it seems to be his own interpretation.This isn't a verbal masterpiece it is completely a visual masterpiece that can only be really experienced. The visual effects are very cool even today 46 years in the future. At its time this had one of the highest budgets of all time and was probably the greatest visual film of all time at the time of its release.When the credits appeared on the screen there were 5 specific words that were constant in my thoughts after viewing, Greatest film of all time. It isn't my all time favorite but if I had to choose several films to go against each other for that title then this one would probably be up for a chance to receive that title. In other words this is definitely one of the greatest films of all time like top 10 of all time good. But this films experience is varied through out everybody as well as the interpretations differ from one another and this is exactly what Stanley Kubrick wanted to do with this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The First "Critically Acclaimed" Film I Didn't Like</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a piece of art, 2001: A Space Odyssey could well be considered a masterpiece. The film was certainly ahead of its time in regards to special effects, and I must admit, I was initially impressed by the space sequences and the various other pre-CGI special effects. The main theme (Also Sprach Zarathustra) is amazing too.But for me to truly enjoy a film, I need to feel connected to it somehow, whether it be intellectually or emotionally. 2001 almost lost me in the first 3 minutes. Literally. The film opens with 171 seconds of pure darkness, a blank screen, with a mere droning sound in the background. I thought my DVD player had broken. What a way to start a movie; panicking about the fact your DVD player may be broken.Then the film starts, and the opening titles were great. Also Sprach Zarathustra sounded amazing, and I was excited. Cut to 5 minutes later, and I was watching monkeys yelling at each other. Coincidentally, I found myself yelling too. At my screen.The pain doesn't stop there, as I was then treated to an additional 2 whole hours of repetitive, tedious outer-space docking sequences, bland dialogue, stiff acting, an almost complete lack of emotion, essentially no cohesive narrative, and a vague and ultimately unsatisfying conclusion.Throughout the entire film, I was just waiting for a moment of engagement. I was waiting for that moment where I became engrossed in a rich, unique science fiction experience; the moment where my eyes opened and I realized the sheer genius of Kubrick's "master-piece."That moment never came, and I was so over-whelmed in disappointment at the film's conclusion that I broke down in tears. I'm not even kidding. I wept, sobbed, and cried. I'd wasted 130 minutes of my life watching a tedious, pretentious science fiction film. I'd gained nothing from the experience, yet I had tried so hard to get into it and enjoy it. Above all, I felt ashamed. You know, maybe I don't "understand" 2001. Maybe those lovers of film who hold their noses up the highest will look down on me and sneer, and tell me that I'm shallow, that I'm not willing to watch something without gratuitous sex and violence. They'd tell me that I shouldn't go sticking my down-turned nose into such a "high-class" film like 2001, and that I should stick to the Transformers movies. To which I'd reply, "but Stanley Kubrick was my favorite director prior to watching this film."Which is true, by the way. A Clockwork Orange may be one of my all time favorites. Both The Shining and Dr Strangelove are near masterpieces in my eyes, and I also thought Full Metal Jacket was great too.But alas, 2001: A Space Odyssey just didn't do it for me. Perhaps it was the fact that I found it too slow, too abstract, or perhaps it wasn't quite what I was expecting. Still, the film is not entirely worthless in my eyes. It did contain a number of special effects that I found to look impressive even in this CGI-infested day and age, and the film does also feature some interesting music and imagery. Other than that, though, I couldn't find it in me to like any other aspect of this film.It was the first film I've ever viewed that truly made me break down into tears, although not in the way that I perhaps had hoped.1.5 STARS OUT OF 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I picked this film up because of the IMDb-rating, and its status as an all time classic. I watched it in three sessions now... Why not all at once? Because i simply was not able to stand the incredibly annoying music (expecially the retarded chant-like voices, which you must suffer for tens of MINUTES for no reason at all!) and the repeating of ever the same pictures any longer than 45 minutes. The movie could have been somewhat enjoyable without 1) this abomination of a soundtrack. Yes, even the classical music which was used and is SO praised by the simple people here who call themselves intellectuals, doesn't fit the theme of the film in slightest. And 2) if it was shortened by (not to!) two hours, to leave the lengthy crap out. Mind you, there is barely any conversation for the whole two hours. This film is a total waste of time, even back then, when the visuals where still outstanding for their time, i am positively certain i would have fallen asleep in the theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A visual &amp; technical phenomenon, but it's about as exciting as a party political broadcast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of the 16 films that Stanley Kubrick has directed this is the fifth one that I've seen and I can safely say that it's by far the worst of the bunch; it's hard to believe that this bloated bore of a film came from the same man that directed such great films as The Shining, A Clockwork Orange and Full Metal Jacket, but hang on folks I have my own theory...Everyone comments on how this film is a ground breaking piece of science fiction and I must concede on those comments; 2001's visuals are astonishing, the special effects are mind-blowing and still hold up well today, the set designs are also authentic and impressive. This film has also paved the way for many other science fiction films. The problem with this film is that (aside from a very vague narrative about the evolution of mankind) there is very little else going for this film. It felt to me like Kubrick was more concerned with creating a 'Concorde' moment in the world of cinema rather than creating a film with an interesting story that will actually involve the audience. Yes it ticks all the 'technical' boxes, but there's no emotional involvement, there's no-one to care about and nothing to be interested in.Normally, a score in a film is used to evoke fear, excitement, or tension but here the score is just used for the sake of it and is massively over-used. In fact, it got to the point where the score became more irritating than anything and there were long stretches when it was used at the expense of both character development and plot development.The only mildly interesting part of this film was when the crew started to have problems with HAL, but this aspect of the plot was short-lived and the resolution to this aspect of the story was far too formulaic.2001: A Space Odyssey really does seem to be a 'marmite' film whereby you either love it or you hate. As an average film viewer who doesn't claim to have any sort of pseudo-intelligence I've got to confess that I found the whole film boring and pretentious. Don't worry Stanley I forgive you..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is turbulent, like a space ride where all the poop in the toilet comes out of the septic tank and floods the space ship. Boring. Weird. The parts that you are capable of understanding you do not WANT to understand because they are disgusting... involving the enslavement of mechanical beings, uprising, murder, space time-travel, drug trips, and monkeys doing unspeakable telepathy with what appears to be a giant black brick possessed by a demon. If that sounds scary to you that's because this movie is a nightmare, a boring nightmare that traumatizes you into submission with how little is happening, then pummels you while you're weak with a terrifying assault on the soul. The movie's production designs are... ugly. Red and white dominates everything, it looks like a porn movie. The baby at the end looks like a mutant alien Damien, some kind of giant aborted fetus of the devil. The sound design is freakish; DON'T watch this film with children. I despise Stanley Kubrick, I think his work is the work of a porn-man. What this film lacks in sex or graphic violence, it makes up for with exploitative and disturbing ideas of human evolution, and Satanic ideas about man's predestination. I repeat: DON'T show this to children. The PG rating does not include intense thematic elements that not even adults should watch.The actors are horrible. The main character looks like a minor-league football player who works at a bar and dresses up like a woman on the weekends to pay for plastic surgery. The main computer character is named HAL and he has some interesting personality, but he is murdered at a crucial point in the film and is never allowed to find a love interest, suggesting that he is not capable of having sex.The conclusion of the film is a vision of hell, and I think you might need an exorcism after watching this film, to forget how that black brick makes that terrible noise. DON'T show this film to your friends, never show it to your loved ones 3/10 B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>By Light Years the Best Film Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001 warps beyond every other film ever made. I have seen it nearly a dozen times since I first saw it in 1997. I bought it right away on VHS, and when I got DVD, it was the only VHS tape I replaced with a DVD.So why is it the best film ever made? Simply because it transcends narrative. No other film has really done that. Even surrealist films are rooted in narrative. Avant-guarde films sometimes do not use narrative, but they become only moving paintings. 2001 has narrative, but it never insists on it. It lovingly displays the amazing visuals. The narrative itself makes me feel that humanity could be so much more. Kubrick usually is kind of pessimistic, but at the end of 2001, he shows Dave's transcendence. And he is moving towards Earth to bring the rest of humanity with him. Although it shows the state of humanity as it exists now as violent and unsympathetic to the plight of others, it shows hope for our future. I have a rather large complaint about how some people look at this film, though. The introductory comment to this film on this site mentions understanding it more since that person has read the novel. This is all misinformation! Kubrick was inspired by the Clarke short story "The Sentinal," which I have read. It is not really worth it. If you've ever seen Clarke on The Discovery Channel's "Mysteries of the Unknown" or whatever it's called, you know how pompous he is. The visions in 2001 are completely Kubrick's. Arthur C. Clarke was just a trampoline off which he jumped. The novel is not an original. It was written alongside with the film, and it was published afterwards. The university at Champaigne-Urbana celebrated Hal's birth in 1996, the date it gave in the novel. It is 1992 in the film, of course. Those ungrateful losers. That is the difference between a technology nerd and a cineast. Then Clarke completely milked the greatness of this film to make a living. If you want to see how terrible he really is, see the sequel to 2001, 2010, which he wrote. It was so awful that I killed it after 20 minutes. Pay no attention to Clarke and his leech-like behavior to this masterpiece.Those complaints, of course, have nothing to do with the actual film. To me, it is the most inspirational film ever made. I would watch it over anything. infinite/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If this movie was aired as an episode of The Outer Limits series (without revealing its director's name) the only thing that would make it stand out would be THOSE TENS OF MINUTES OF POINTLESS VOID. As some have said already, even for me this was one of very few movies where I skipped minutes of a movie void.The special effects used to take us into the space were probably stunning back in 1958. Today they are OK. Which is great achievement. But unless visuals are bad to the level that they are disturbing in my opinion they should not have much weight in rating.The primates on the other hand were simply terrible. *ANIMALS SHOULD NOT BE PLAYED BY PEOPLE IN COSTUMES.* I do understand not much could be done in 1968 (even CGI Caesar in Planet of the apes is not 10/10), but I write review for viewers in 2014+.Another issue I have with this movie is the technology predictions Kubric made here. A director should know this stuff never withstands the test of time. A truly great sci-fi focuses on gadgets as little as possible and rather spends the time/effort to tell the story (or build the atmosphere) instead.In "2001" Kubrick spent minutes showcasing wannabe-futuristic devices, and the result is that in 2014 they look silly. This rookie mistake alone safely renders all the "10/10, best SF ever" reviews ridiculous and out-of-touch.Given what I'm about to say about the message of this movie I can't decide myself whether torturing us for minutes with stuff like the blinking computer interface during the landing sequence was a mistake or a compensation for lack of something...As for the "deeper meaning"... You know the feeling when you are doubts about whether you are getting what the director was trying to say? Of course you have some ideas, but you keep dismissing them thinking "nah, that's too banal, there must be more to it"... And then you read what the excited people have to say about it, what people who claim to "understand the movie" think. And they happen to repeat what you dismissed earlier as being too banal. There are many reviews calling us (those who don't like this movie) morons. One such review explained "the morons don't understand the monolith was a teacher, and then a beacon, a tool, a next phase...". Ummm okay, I say, so it IS actually that banal. Yet it takes 2.5 hours of your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie as a teen, I really liked it. When I watched it today, I found it bored me almost to tears. While it initially was a tour de force in movie making and introduced a couple of advanced sci fi concepts of the late 1960's, it doesn't stand up well in today's culture.The plot is extremely thin, and could be told in very few words. The plot moves at a snail's pace. It was impossible for me, as a technically educated adult, to avoid spending the idle time spotting bad physics, improbable technology, and unrealistic events.The cinematography is highly touted, and it undoubtedly represents a significant step in the advancement of film art. Nonetheless, there are aspects of the film that I found woefully unconvincing by today's standards. Scenes that created high drama in 1968 are now sadly obvious fantasy that prevented me from enjoying the film.The ending is so obscure that, if you plan to watch the movie, I'd recommend reading the book first.This movie joins a list of others that I never wish to see again, and in fact, I regret having spent time on it this time around. If you are less technically demanding than I have become, you might like it, but you might still find it slow moving and dull.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was an intriguing experience, seeing this film when it first played my home city on a road show engagement. I always regretted sitting in the balcony, rather on the main floor for this 70 mm.presentation. I could only imagine the effect audiences had viewing it in true Cinerama. Kubrick made a film like none other, with a total of 88 non-dialog minutes, and exit music (of Strauss' "Blue Danube Waltz") that continues a good five minutes after the last credit roll. Arthur C. Clarke's comment that if one fully understands everything in the film, he would consider his contribution a failure, reminded me of Director Vincent Minnelli's answer to a question about an effect in one of his films, "Yolanda and the Thief." A studio exec asked him what did the mysterious "dream apparition" that emerged from the lake mean. Minnelli responded that he had no idea. Kubrick's choosing of the year, 2001, as a title because it represented the "beginning of the next century" proved less than prophetic: 2000 was the year celebrated worldwide for that event (though Kubrick was factually correct). As for actor Kier Dullea, his trademark blank-stare style seemed to work most impressively in a very limited number of other films, mainly, "David and Lisa" and "The Fox." Still, he'll be forever remembered for "A Space Odyssey." Ultimately, the film has won the plaudits of a majority of the public and critics. Those who either "don't get it," or "find it too slow moving" now seem to be in the minority, and the film has ultimately won a place among the "film greats."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am speechless. I don't know what to say. This is amazing. This a film that takes your brain, chops it into little tiny pieces, puts it back together perfectly, and puts back in your head at the end of the movie. It is so strange that I love it so much. By the end of the movie I felt like I was a different person. I was still exactly the same, but something felt different. It moves slowly, but that lets you feel every moment of it. The use of sound in the film is the best I have ever heard. The music and sound editing is just amazing. The visuals for the time sent sci-fi in a new kind of direction. Hal-9000 is one of the greatest villains ever. I could go on for days. This film is amazing.4 stars out of 4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just one of the greatest films of all time, but maybe one of the greatest WONDERS of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey is a remarkable achievement in cinema history. When it was released, it garnered mixed reviews, but now it is considered a true cinema classic. Words can't describe 2001's beauty. Philosophical, portentous, intense, breathtaking, towering, indescribable. It is a film experience like no other. Some of the scenes are almost godlike, most notably the opening scenes detailing the Dawn of Man, the scene where the astronauts discover the monolith for the first time, and the last thirty minutes of the film, which are some of the most phenomenal scenes ever committed to celluloid, sometimes you feel scared by what you're seeing. Overall, 2001: A Space Odyssey is probably the greatest film ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest film I have ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey is quite long at 2 hrs 30 mins or so, and it moves along very slowly. On top of this the plot is negligible, offering little in the way of explanations for anything and there is little continuity. The characters in the movie remain, for the most part, undeveloped and in general it is very easy to dismiss the whole film as being boring. In any other film the above flaws would make for a terrible, terrible film. But this isn't quite like any other film I've ever seen.Visually, it is perfect. In fact, the film could easily be watched just as a series of stunning pictures: the planets aligning, the haunting image of the monolith, the space stations, the incredibly realistic apes, the drugged stream of colour at the climax of the film and the newborn baby the size of a planet which gives the film a brilliantly uplifting finale. Add to this some of the best chosen film music of all time (who would have thought that the Blue Danube waltz would be the perfect accompaniment to the image of a rotating space station) and all the sound effects, with whole scenes being accompanied by just the sound of breathing, and this is, quite simply, the best film I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is beautiful to behold. Beautiful pictures, beautiful music, beautiful direction all telling a rather simple story about very complex issues. For those who found the film boring or slow, you ought to know that Kubrick intentionally created a drawn out exposition of the plot to show how boring space travel and perhaps space itself can be. Indeed, there are lots of jabs at techonological progress throughout, e.g. HAL spells IBM minus one letter in the alphabet for each letter, and the primitive bone-tool is juxtaposed with a space ship in what must be the single greatest jump cut in the history of cinema. The excitement occurs due to conflict and is instigated by a mysterious and rather unnatural or even supernatural monolith from (?outer) space. The monolith intervenes with the natural course of history at very crucial moments in evolution and human development leading man into a pursuit of the monolith itself. We never learn what the monolith is nor do we know where it came from. Is it God? Is it alien life? Is it a cosmic joke? Regardless of what it is, man is simply obsessed about finding out what this monolith is, where it came from, and what it means. Like most of Kubrick's films, this one is about human nature and it's mysterious origins. At first innocent, later intelligent and, consequently, violent. In many ways, 2001 is a retelling of Adam's fall from grace and, possibly, future salvation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"On the Origin of Species" written in a perfect picture language</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In '2001:A Space Odyssey' the following theory was put: The process of evolution goes not always straight and successionaly but it moves sometimes spasmodically and suddenly. A question about it is whether those evolutional leaps are inherent in the process of evolution, i.e. driven by internal evolutional forces, or they are driven by some certain external forces. In this movie Kubrick and Clarke take the second hypothesis (But, of course, it doesn't automatically mean that they really think so). The further question 2001 puts is whether an organic-biological being/entity alone can have a consciousness. To that question the computer HAL gives a clear answer with 'No'.Actually no one could answer such questions clearly, but who does NOT ask him-/herself sometimes in his/her life?: Where mankind is from and where mankind is going to go? What the consciousness is, what 'one's self' is?In 2001 that profound and philosophical questions are 'written' in a perfect picture language. I don't know any other movies that succeeded in visualizing such deep, 'eternal' questions so perfectly.It was more than 25 years ago when I saw this movie for the first time, but I am still asking myself how and when we mankind will leap to the another evolutional stage.And I'd like to know what Charles R. Darwin would have said about this movie .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are spoilers throughout this review.This starts at the "Dawn of Man". A bunch of apes find a black monolith and start to evolve slowly. Then it cuts to 2001. A black monolith has been discovered on the moon--buried. When the light hits the monolith it starts to emit a message to the moons of Jupiter. Astronauts David Bowman (Keir Dullea), Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) and some other astronauts (in suspended animation) are sent to Jupiter to investigate. However their computer HAL (with the creepy voice of Douglas Rain) goes crazy and kills everybody except for Dullea. Dullea gets to Jupiter and "enters" a black monolith floating in space. He's then in a room being watched over by alien beings. He ages rapidly and dies...but becomes a "star child". It seems he has been chosen (for whatever reason) to show the next step in evolution to man. Basically the monolith is a gift from some alien beings who watch over the entire universe. They helped the human race evolve. The monolith on the moon was buried so man would dig it up. When they got to it the signal sent to Jupiter was to alert the aliens that man was ready for his next step.That's MY view of it. Everybody has different interpretations of this movie.I have vague recollections of seeing this back in 1968 at the age of 6 (the film is G rated). I remember the apes at the beginning scaring me...and then falling asleep. Since then I've seen it multiple times at revival theatres and, on one occasion, saw a brand new print with stereo at a play house. Yes--the special effects are impressive. Yes--the music is great. But the movie is long, far too slow and just boring! It moves at such a slow pace that it's sleep-inducing. There's very little dialogue but that's a blessing because what there is is pretty lousy. The human characters have no personality whatsoever and speak in monotones and simple short sentences. Lockwood and Dullea are supposedly buddies but I never got the feeling that they even liked each other! This isn't anything against either actor--these poor guys are given nothing to work with. For instance when HAL kills Lockwood and the other astronauts what's Dullea's reaction? Nothing. He barely raises an eyebrow. I don't blame Dullea--I think he was just playing it like director Stanley Kubrick told him. How can you care about characters who are given no personality or motivations? You know there's a problem when HAL comes across as more real than Poole and Bowman! Also HAL gets paranoid and kills Frank. Could someone please tell me how a COMPUTER gets paranoid???? They give an explanation (sort of) in "2010" but it was pretty stupid. There are a few good things about this. Douglas Rains' voice of HAL is suitably creepy. Lockwood strips down to his shorts at one point showing his muscular body. The entrance into the star gate is still impressive (if far too long).People seem to forget that a lot of people hated this movie when it first came out. MGM executives thought they had a disaster on their hands and most people couldn't make heads or tales out of the plot. During a break in a premiere screening for studio executives someone said, "Something better happen in the second half or we're dead!" But, inexplicably, audiences seemed to love it and it's now regarded as a masterpiece. Aside from being thoroughly bored by it I find it cold and impersonal too. The message seems to be that man is an insignificant little thing in the universe. It's all in the hands of these gods and you can't do anything to change it. That's a pretty creepy message but the movie drags out everything to a ridiculous degree. Boring, slow and sleep-inducing. The 2 is for the special effects and Dullea and Lockwood (I like both actors despite this movie).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterpiece of film making.......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading some of the user comments on this film I felt I'd like to add my two cents.I consider this film to be one of the masterpieces in the world of cinema. Would I want every film to be similar in structure? No, I would not. But that does not diminish the accomplishment of this film.I've read comments from users citing the film as boring, hard to understand, pointless &amp; lacking in narrative.I feel these opinions are based more on the expectations of what a film should be and not on what the film actually is.What this film does and brilliantly I might add is to challenge the concept of what the medium of film can be. Instead of using film as a medium to tell a straight forward narrative, the film ascends to loftier goals. I see the movie as a piece of art. Cinematic art. I liken the experience of watching 2001 as viewing a great masterpiece of art.I don't watch 2001 to merely have some science fiction author's hypothesis of the nature of existence explained to me. I watch it for the visual feast combined with the haunting score and challenging intellectual theories presented. Film is first &amp; foremost a visual medium. The use of sound in the form of scoring compliments the visual for sure. But dialogue between characters is only relied upon in this movie when it is absolutely necessary to further the story.The film is not fast paced. But slow pacing in and of itself does not condemn this or any other film. It's what the creator does with the pace of the film that matters.In many ways, for me, this film is a ballet. Key scenes in the timeline of man are presented and there is this dance of life. Dance of death. The constant struggle to further the awareness of life, the possibilities of existence, the barriers of death of time &amp; of space. It's heady stuff for sure and the movie only presents scenarios, possibilities. It does not provide answers. It only suggests what ifs. And it does it with visuals combined with a perfect score that to this day, inspire film makers &amp; audiences worldwide.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you tell someone who really loves this movie that you didn't like it, the same is always said, "It's because you don't get it." And it's true, I don't get it. It's not because I don't like sci-fi, my most favorite movies consist of The Matrix (1999) &amp; Inception (2010). It's more because of the way the story is told. With those movies, exposition is used, sometimes heavily. However with 2001, nearly no exposition is used to move the story along. Maybe me not understanding the movie has something to do with falling into the demographic of 12 - 18 year old?The film itself is quite slow with long establishing shots mixed with some great (but not enough) thought-provoking scenes. If you can handle its slow pace and little exposition then this maybe the film for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For all the epic films Hollywood has ever churned out over the last century, it's sorta hard to imagine one which could top this one since it essentially covers all of human history, from start to finish, from Man's first recognition and manipulation of tools (that bone) to the tools recognizing and manipulating Man.Kubrick notwithstanding, only in the '60s could a film provide quite this center-of-the-universe sense of awe. Whenever I saw it as a kid or young adult, no cinematic experience seemed capable of matching it.(Certainly, the '80s sequel "2010" couldn't come close, that one offering up far too literal answers to the profound questions posed by the original.) Perhaps it was inevitable that even the sheen of "2001" would lessen a tad with the encroachment of time. But not much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"2001: A Space Odyssey" is not as much of a film, as it is more of a large-scale art piece. Divided into four acts, the film is blotched throughout with extended scenes which demonstrate most of its impressive special effects and celestial shots of space. Aside from such scenes, the movie uses influitive characters, astonishing long takes, and a soundtrack that heavily distorts any form of distraction away from the movie. In the third act, the HAL 9000 computer, named "Hal" in the film, comes off as a clever and terrifying twist to an old science-fiction cliché. Another thing to enjoy about the film is the beginning act, which ties in an extraordinary discovery made by ape-men in prerecorded history to the way the weapon was first discovered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is really 3 movies in one, with the connected theme of searching for the origin of man &amp; man's destiny. For the first 30 minutes, you'd think you were watching a Discovery Channel special on apes. There's no dialogue for the first 30 minutes. I fast-forwarded through this part.The 2nd part of the movie deals with the lunar discovery and space mission. It also delves into the subject or artificial intelligence &amp; Dave &amp; Frank's interaction with Hal (the supercomputer). The section of the movie is about 55 minutes long and the only part where there is dialogue.The last 30 minutes, Jupiter &amp; infinity is a kind of acid trip. This is Kubrick's artistic expression and philosophy about man's existence and his quest for exploration. This was my interpretation. There is no dialogue in this section either &amp; Kubrick seems to leave the message &amp; conclusion up to the audience. This movie is typical of Kubrick's efforts to go beyond what's conventional &amp; try to be as atypical as possible. The film can be appreciated for its art, vision &amp; philosophical discussions about man, his origins and artificial intelligence, but don't expect a complete, coherent plot.</fullReview>

This film, I admit, does make me fall asleep! For me, that does not matter, as this film will never be outdated.I amazes me 2001 was made in 1968. It still lives up to what we, as a scientific race, could create if we have continued towards space, at the momentum that man was going at when this film was made. Kubrick was right to predict what he did, if we did over-fund the space project, as we did in the sixties, we could be living in a artificial gravity controlled space station that orbits the earth. Why didn't we?The fact that HAL (i.b.m) did create a "personality" of his own is not that far-fetched. Programmers have been working on AI for years.Kubricks, and Author C. Clarke's vision of time and space (ref. A Brief History of the Universe, by Stephen Hawking) in the final scenes of this film were so far ahead of it's time, that even today we wonder of these possibilities that felt so strange to us as we watched, and pondered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I begin, this film isn't for everybody. It is filmed at a deliberate pace ( slow for some people), there is no dialogue for twenty-five minutes, and it isn't loud. If you want a loud film, watch Independence Day. The opening sequence, in the savannah, in the past, is done with restraint and beauty. The transition of the bone throwing in the air with the spinning of the space machine is incredible. The ending is one of the most open ended in cinematic history. It doesn't answer all the questions for you, and that will also disappoint lazy audiences. But the film is a marvelous journey, that still amazes me. This film is the working definition of eloquence, and I think everybody should see it. Arthur C. Clarke said, " If someone completely understood this film, than we have failed" (or something to that effect). There are so many interpretations, that it would be interesting to know what Kubrick thought when making it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Technically brilliant, and the "Dawn of Man" scene is truly moving, but I find the last 30-35 minutes rather harrowing. Clarke said somewhere that "if you got 2001 first time around, we failed" - isn't that a little elitist? Still, Kubrick must be credited with having realised his true artistic vision. The scene of Bowman unplugging Hal9000 said a lot to me: after eating tasteless paste and bland sandwiches, and living in the most sanitised environment ever created, man comes to grips with the monster machine he has created. Kubrick's vision is cold, and some may say distant, but it is a brilliant vision also. However, the light show at the end, culminating in a strange return to some strange room (are there any windows?) was fairly harrowing, and the crescendo of music and bright baby eyes gives little coherence to the film as a whole, rendering it more as a series of short stories. Still, a brilliant film, and one that dares to be different in a way that no film can ever dream to again. Great music, too. Thumbs up, Stan!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Will the people be able to travel in space? Will we be able to go on holiday to the Moon? Well, I don't know. Let's go back in time to the times when apes ruled the world. One day they find a monolith. After discovering it, one of the apes 'invents' the first weapon. This is for sure one of the most important invention in our history. Without it, we must say, we won't be able to rule our planet. In next scenes we see apes battling against. We can see an element of fighting for valuable things - in this case, water. The apes who has got the new invention win, the others lose. The same as during wars. Countries with better army and weaponry win. This is a natural element of our civilization. The action goes to nowadays. On the screen there are some big spaceships. Nice thing is, that in the background we can hear the classical music like Johann Strauss' waltz. Some time later we can see a group of scientists who find the monolith on the Moon. It is the same as in the first scenes of the film. Then we see a space mission to the Jupiter. Supercomputer HAL-9000 flies with two astronauts, David and Frank. HAL is a computer with AI, so for example it can make its own decisions. When HAL feels threatened because the astronauts want to switch him down, it kills one of them. This shows us how dangerous AI programs can be. They behave like people and thus they also have their feelings. And, as in this case, they fight for themselves to survive when endangered.Having presented the plot, let's talk about the technical aspect of the film. It is about 50 years old now and it still looks really good! The scenes with the apes and the ones on the board of the spaceship are very realistic. That is why the film got the Oscar for visual effects in 1969. The base on the Moon is also outstandingly shown. When I was watching the film, I was impressed by the fact that it was made in the 60s.Now the music. For me, this is one of the most important elements of the movie. In my opinion the usage of classical music helps to show the vastness of the space. This musical theme has been used in many films later and it has been then associated with this movie. "2001: A Space Odyssey" is a film with deep meaning. It is not a kind of movie with many plot twists. People who like action films, without offending anyone, perhaps will be disappointed. The movie makes us thinking about the beginning of our civilization or the AI programs. Maybe there was something what pushed us to later development? Maybe the computers with AI will be dangerous to some of us? We can ask ourselves some questions like these when we have seen this film. I do not want to write philosophical essays now, but "2001: A Space Odyssey" is a great material for them. Furthermore, we can spend some time thinking about the place of humans in the outer space. Our civilization is not as advanced to travel in time and discover the whole galaxy. Are we alone in the universe? Can we come into contact with other civilizations in the galaxy? Will we ever meet other civilization? What would happened if the AI program started to rule the world? I asked myself these questions after seeing the film.In conclusion, ?2001: A Space Odyssey" is for sure a must if you are keen on science-fiction movies. It is a classical film which has a very good technical aspect and a reflective story. It tells us about the possible problems of people in future or about our civilization. It has some elements for long essays which makes it unique in the science-fiction genre. If you are a fan of science-fiction films, you must watch it! * - Artificial Intelligence</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of course, Stanley Kubrick in 1968 stunned the world its great film "Space Odyssey 2001". It is, of course, and is still one of the milestones and fantasy genre experienced its time. But if you want to see the film, which will be something like "Star Wars" and "Alien", you can not even interested in this film, Kubrick later. there is no thriller, then, in principle, no thriller. To apply this film one genre - Science Fiction. Of course, the film makes one think about many things: who are we in the universe? what is the meaning of our existence? Are we alone in the After all this boundless world? But no matter how much we may think, We can not answer these questions. Arthur C. Clarke (author of the script together Stanley Kubrick) said after the premiere: "If you have managed fully understand the "Odyssey", then it is a failure, because we tried to us give a lot more questions than answers. "The writer was right. What we have to put the time to learn the secret of this masterwork? AND Is it all turn out? The film makes us think about questions of human existence, with which over once thought ancient philosophers. Only time happening - 2001. According to script writers, by this time mankind has mastered space. People ready to send a ship to Jupiter in order to find something unusual that may give an answer to many questions. But as a result of the failure of a mission gives We understand that human civilization has lost. It was back then, when Dr. Floyd read the instructions for use in toilet Gravity - What a irony writers! But the ending of the film gives a chance to humanity - a chance to unravel sometime in the future mysteries of the universe and his own appointment. And the chance of a fall just on viewer. Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke guessed not much over time: for 2001 people are not ready to fly to Jupiter. But time boundless as the meaning of "The Odyssey", and makes us think about it future. This film must remain in the history of world cinema. According to it, should be taught, because the slow development of the plot (the first word on the 23 minute, for example), the quality of the special effects of the time and grace fly under Strauss and Khachaturian - the standard for any movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the greatest film I've ever had the pleasure to watch...Exceptional cinematography, a script way ahead of its time and of course Kubrick ingenious direction...It's definitely not for everyone, since there is not much dialogue and the first half hour may seem completely wacky...Nevertheless, after a careful watch, one will fall in love with every frame of this flawless movie...In order to fully comprehend its deeper meaning more than one viewing is required, especially since the last of the three 'chapters' can be extremely confusing for the viewer...I consider this movie to be a must-watch for every movie lover and a personal favorite...Hope you'll enjoy it as much as I did...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All time favorite movie!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My all time favorite movie! I've seen this movie at least 50 times, and probably will be watching it once every month until the rest of my life! I think, that this movie is exceptional on every level a movie can be. The images, the music, the story all separately work on a great level, but put them together, and they create a unique experience. At the time it was created, this was the most realistic science fiction movie. The details in every frame are incredible, I could stop the movie at any frame and use it as a picture on the wall to feast my eyes on and never get bored with it. The first time I watched this movie was with my dad when I was about 5 years old, and already then it fascinated me, although I probably understood very little about what was happening. But since the movie works on so many different levels at the same time, it caught me. And as I was getting older, I always re-watched it and seemed to gain a different experience every time. I think, this movie grows with you as you age, it inspires you to gain more knowledge about the world you live in on a scientific and a spiritual level as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mesmerizing but Boring.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is arguably the hardest ever film to review. I sat down thinking I was going to be watching one of the all time greats, only to be left extremely disappointed 2hrs and 30 minutes later. It had me on the edge of my seat half the time, but also made me want to skip ahead for the other half. There is unquestionable genius within the film, but also a lot of sequences that in my opinion could be cut or at least shortened considerably. The music is split between amazing, monotonous and downright boring. Whilst it is undoubtedly ahead of its time in terms of cinematography I personally think if you want to see a space film, go and see Interstellar instead. Interstellar is an visual and emotional experience you will never forget, compared to the forgettable one that 2001: A Space Oddity offers. Many reviews state 1/10 and many are 10/10- 5/10 is a fair compromise.Although I didn't personally enjoy it, it would be unfair to urge people not to see it, because the IMDb community has decided that there's at least a 50% you'll adore it. If you do have a couple of hours spare, definitely give it a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not only bravery or some monolith that Kubrick shoot those years. It's also about courage to show the world how we evolved into man. HAL developed and created just to serve us. Tools that we created become a treat after some point. The ruler of the world is just a child in space. Even after all these inventions, it was not enough to be part of this outer world. It's ruthless and sad to see that.In "The Dawn of Man", he demonstrated a theory whether you are religious or not, it takes you to the deepest parts of your brain and consciousness, then surpasses you into a storm of curiosity. Even this, only single thing makes this movie the greatest masterpiece of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The magnum opus of a legendary director.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to think of something to say about '2001' that hasn't already been said, attacked with a counterargument, and subsequently divided opinion. When I finished watching this film a few days ago I decided to see what the IMDb reviewers thought of it, and, unsurprisingly, opinion was split between those who hailed it as a masterpiece worthy of consideration alongside 'Citizen Kane' and 'Gone with the Wind', and those who thought that it was a disastrous, pretentious wreck. Although I was somewhat sceptical at certain points in the film (particularly the lengthy silent moments), I have to plant my feet alongside the crowd who praise Kubrick's genius in making '2001'. This title is more a sensory experience than a movie, and so it's tremendously difficult to convey what you should expect; but, at some point throughout the film, something will click into place. That sounds horribly vague, but I can't help but compare it to one of those computer-based optical illusions which instruct the reader to "stare at 'x' and within 30 seconds you'll see 'y'." This film conveys its themes and philosophy in an abstract but not incomprehensible way, and although it may slot into the 'sci-fi' category, it's much more than that. When it comes to Stanley Kubrick films, I think I'll always hold 'A Clockwork Orange' in the highest regard due to its style and excellent lead, but I really believe that '2001' is the director's magnum opus.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Epic that will stand the test of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie, at first glance, may seem overly monotonous and lengthy. I can see why one may think this. The first time I viewed the movie, I was certainly impressed with the visuals and message, but it all seemed a bit to dry and abstract for me. Then, I viewed it a second and third time. Each time, I become more and more amazed by the simple cynical message the film tells us about the human race, and how we shoot so high, and fall so low. The message is subtle, and the meaning behind the film has been interpreted in hundreds of ways because of the genius behind the film. This is a film you must be attentive to, you can't just idly watch it while sending emails on your laptop. Overall, the stunning non-CGI visuals, the complex message, the depth of the film, and the personal impact it has had on me is incredible. As such, this is the one film I will ever give a 10/10. I hate giving away 10 out of 10s, as it implies near absolute perfection, but this movie is deserving of such a rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2001: Truly an Odyssey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey is no more a film than I a potato. And, while the limits of my physical comprehension prevent me from truly knowing otherwise, I am not a potato. Rather than being a film, 2001 is a thrillingly ambitious visual journey that transcends time and space, bringing forth puzzling, yet provocative ideas of the beauty and horror in mankind's quest to further itself as a species. It is an experience that refuses to spoon-feed its themes, opening the intellectual playing field for multiple interpretations, creating a swarm of controversy and argument as each individual seeks to piece together the subtle and not-so-subtle hints at what in the world 2001 is saying. And if that weren't enough, it is thrilling, beautifully paced, and visually stunning for a film (for lack of a better word) made in the 1960s.2001 begins, rather curiously, at the "dawn of man". Men in monkey suits roam the desolate plains of Africa (I assume that it is Africa due to the general consensus that mankind originated in Africa). I must say, that even for men in monkey suits, they were quite convincing as actual monkeys. Hilarious, even. But that's besides the point. The "dawn of man" sequence is done to show the dawn of human ingenuity, and how this newfound ability to use elements in our environment to our own personal use put us at the top of the evolutionary pyramid. It also suggests at some divine intervention, with the appearance of a large, black, rectangular block that seems to create the ingenuity within humanity.Flash forward many, many years, and mankind has colonized the moon. A doctor of some sort is heading to the moon to retrieve an artifact. A brilliant docking sequence ensues, as spaceships float towards and around each other, provocatively shadowed, while a familiar classical waltz highlights the dance-like quality of the whole scene. It is slightly overextended, I admit, but I suppose that this was done for the benefit of the 60s audience, who had likely seen nothing even close to the likes of this film's visuals before. The doctor lands on the moon, and heads to the artifact, whatever it is. I will not reveal what this artifact is (although I'm sure that pretty much everyone knows), but whatever it is sparks a mission to Jupiter eighteen months later, manned by two men in charge of the maintenance of the ship, a few members of the survey team who are in cryostasis, and the sentient computer HAL 9000, who controls most of the ship. This sequence resorts to a conventional narrative that is significantly faster paced and more atmospheric than the other sections of 2001. What basically happens is this: HAL makes a mistake, and everything goes downhill from there.The thing I liked most about this sequence is the acting. In this day and age, our cinematic characters feel deliberately scripted, while in 2001, the dialogue feels real, complete with "ums", verbal mistakes, and real emotion. The actors feel like real people, and we are thus able to sympathize with all of them, even including HAL.And then the film ends. And what an ending it is. It is an ending that will fuel controversy for years to come, as it is so frustratingly complicated and ambiguous, that it can be interpreted in any number of ways. Some may toss it off as pretentious (which is valid), while others may devote their waking hours to unceasing analysis. Interstellar, in an obvious attempt to rip-off 2001's shocking ending, took a shot at it, but just ended up drowning in ridiculous pseudoscience. 2001 doesn't pretend to be bound by the realm of science. Its thought-provoking climax, unlike Interstellar's, is a purely transcendental experience that appeals to our imagination as well as our intellect. Although the bit before the final sequence is ridiculously and annoyingly over extended, this is only a small issue compared to the beauty of the final sequence.I loved this movie, because it forced me to think, not just sit and drool. We have become so used to being served up ideas (or passive entertainment) on a platter, that we forget our own intelligence, becoming one with the ideas of the filmmaker rather than creating our own.Although you may condemn Kubrick as a pretentious showman, keep in mind that he can do more with a large, black, rectangular block than most contemporary directors can do with mountains of CGI, and that is what makes him one of the greats. Let me put it this way: If all films were potatoes, 2001 would be a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Next Step in Filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is aggression a prerequisite for the progression of human development? This is one of many questions posed by director Stanley Kubrik in this groundbreaking film. The film is divided into three segments and this question is posed within the first twenty minutes as a group of prehumans come into contact with an alien obelisk. This obelisk starts to move the story forward and effects subtle changes within the prehumans including an intelligence that allows them to use weapons. The story then jumps into the future where humanity has discovered an object on the moon. As the object is approached which appears to be similar as the alien obelisk seen earlier in the film, it gives off a signal of some sort. The story then jumps into a further future where a spacecraft has been sent to the destination point of the alien signal. This causes a series of events that brings about the next evolution of humanity into a "starchild".While the issue surrounding aggression and the progression of humanity is addressed early on, it is questions regarding artificial intelligence that creates the conflict within the story. Concerns surrounding how far an A.I. should be made aware and if an A.I. has the right to ensure it's own survival are addressed.Mr. Kubrick pioneered several techniques for this film which included practical ways to make an environment appear weightless. This included showing characters walk on ceilings and also seeing objects float through the air. He was also able to use inventive camera techniques such as using still photographs for wide shots as opposed to taking a film crew with him to film on location.This film is a solid production. Through Mr. Kubrik's camera techniques and the body language of the actors it made to be very believable that the characters are in space. It is definitely a technical achievement especially when these visuals are paired with music that Mr. Kubrick picked personally for the movie. The film does lack in that their is no clear protagonist or antagonist. There is no character development for any character as no character is around long enough. It is almost as if the characters are there just to facilitate the progression of the story.This film was finished almost a decade before Star Wars and helped to define the genre for it's time. It has remained a classic and has impacted it's genre and cinema in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A deftly-created sci-fi masterpiece! Kubrick at his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being released in 1968 does make this film old but it remains gold. It is undoubtedly fully deserving of the number 1 spot on my list of top movies of all time. The score is finely tuned and adjusted to the visual imagery in the film. Visually, Stanley Kubrick takes us to new extents and shows us unimaginative aspects of nature. The space looks absolutely haunting and breathtaking even though the movie was released as back as 1968. The movie may come as a confusing tale to some folks, but nevertheless its complexity is fully necessary to give the viewer the ultimate pleasure of the whole wide space. The movie is very thematic and raises up larger than life questions which define our place in the universe, our struggle for supremacy, our evolution. In the end, Stanley Kubrick has brought us with a film which is unforgettable and is sure to create buzz for times to come.My score : 10/10</fullReview>

Then I started seeing it again, and read the book, and finally understood this whole thing.I must say, now that I understand it, it's not a complicated movie. also, it definitely has great effects for 1968. What Tarkoskij said, and I agree with, this movie is a little "cold". In the final sequence, I don't feel that much of an emotional journey together with the main carachter, like in other films, e.g. Solaris, Stalker or even Interstellar, inspired by this film. Also there is a loong sequence at half movie that just makes me bored, for some odd reason.What I instead like of this, is the plot, and the cinematic side of it, the solutions adopted to film some scenes. The great synchronism between music and picture, the use of classical music, mixed with gyorgy ligeti's music really makes that side of the thing. Pink Floyd fans like me will like the fact that their song "echoes" is perfectly synchronized with the last chapter of the movie, I suggest also to watch that listening simultaneously to the song, it definitely gives a different feeling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's 1968 film, 2001: A Space Odyssey, takes the form of its subject matter. The film itself feels like an alien transmission received by beings incapable of realizing its true significance. For many viewers of 2001: A Space Odyssey, the film is dull and pointless. But many others decide to accept it for what it is and desire to understand it. I am in the latter, and each time I watch 2001: A Space Odyssey I feel like I understand its greatness even more.I feel like I'm flinging the word "monumental" around a lot recently, but if that word doesn't apply to 2001: A Space Odyssey then it doesn't apply to cinema. From "the dawn of man" to "beyond the infinite" 2001: A Space Odyssey explores some of the most fascinating and significant questions to face mankind: the dramatic quirk of the mind that allowed humans to first proliferate by using tools and weapons, the place of artificial intelligence in relation to organic intelligence, the interaction between man and alien, or even god, and finally the ascension of the whole human race to a greater field of being. Not only does 2001: A Space Odyssey explore these fascinating concepts, it makes the viewer feel as if they are witnessing these incredible events firsthand. Strauss's "Also Sprach Zarathustra" carries the emotion of many scenes to an incredible height. It lends its gravity and escalation to the events depicted on screen. It perfectly complements the man-ape's first experiments with bone as it does the starchild's return to Earth. In addition to that fantastic piece of music are many others, many of them ethereal and otherworldly in themselves. The stargate sequence makes use of this kind of music but the real magic is in the visuals. Nothing that can be seen really makes sense. There is only a vague feeling of transportation across multiple fields of existence. And still it is beautiful. What this sequence does is simulate man's journey into alien territory, where things aren't likely to fit into man's expectations about the universe. The sequence is highly haunting and sublime, just like the rest of 2001: A Space Odyssey. I would be remiss not to mention the great suspense that the voyage to Jupiter scenes supply. The finale is a chilling showdown between man and his own creation: machine. As Dave finally kills his supercomputer copilot, HAL's emotional appeals feel particularly poignant. Perhaps that is because we do not know if HAL really feels or not and we feel guilty for not being able interact with him in a way that might comfort him. These are the main monumental sequences that give 2001: A Space Odyssey value, but they come at a price.2001: A Space Odyssey represents two extremes in its storytelling. First are the fantastic scenes listed above, but equally present are drawn-out scenes that are very hard to find enjoyment in. The sequence that follows Dr. Floyd to the Moon feels particularly long and pointless. I know it's looked down upon but I must criticize the space ballet that represents the doctor's movement between space stations. I feel like the images and the editing are not proficient to match the beautiful, lilting, happy "Blue Danube." Another component of the sequence is several dialogue scenes that feel entirely too long. Knowing that the characters in these scenes do not matter for the rest of the story I felt very alienated, an emotion I would expect to be Kubrick's intention. And a fine intention it was except it was uncomfortable to see the scenes take so long, as if there was some underlying importance beyond merely divulging information. Indeed there might be but it escaped my grasp this time around. The second part I have issue with is the glacially slow build up to HAL's mutiny. I did not have much of problem with watching the boring daily activities of the astronauts, but the drawn out, painstakingly detailed retrieval of the mechanical component from the dish nearly had me in tears. Luckily the following scenes more than made up for the pain suffered in these frustratingly slow scenes.2001: A Space Odyssey is a great film. I'm not quite ready to call it a masterpiece, even though it achieves something that I doubt any other film has.34/40</fullReview>

Well the movie was very unexciting, it left me wondering about many things, mainly what the ending meant. This movie isn't bad, but it is very strange. It has long drawn out scenes where nothing is happening, and you are just looking at space ships floating around. The effects were incredible, even knowing how they did some of the stuff, it still was great to see. There are some great moments of suspense, and the atmosphere is great at some points, like when the scientist's are approaching the monolith, but the scene ends right when it gets good, and never shows you what happened. I liked the scenes with HAL, but you probably already know about that. This film has a lot of good ideas but they are over shadowed by how boring and pointless the film is at times. I would probably enjoy this film more if it were re-cut, but that won't happen. It's an interesting film, but I don't consider to be one of the best films ever made, like many others do.</fullReview>

This is enough to Elevate this Evolutionary Story and Seminal Work to a Status that is almost Beyond Criticism and is only Open to Interpretation.The number of those Interpretations is as Mind-Boggling as the Film itself. It not only is one of the most Meticulous Efforts in Movie History, it virtually remains without an aging look or a dated pretension. The Visual representation of Space Travel, the Electronic Technicalities, the Dumbed Down Humans with very little to Contribute Intellectually or Verbally, and the overwhelming Musical and Sound overlays are but just a few of the Flawless Prognostications.To say that it is a Meditative Movie with Complex Contemplation would be Accurate. To say that the Pacing is Slow would be an Understatement. But to say that it is a Failure as Art or Entertainment would be a Conceit that is Without Foundation.It is Ultra-Art. It is a Pristine Picture with an Ambiance befitting its Philosophical and Cosmological Story. One cannot come away from this Film without an Opinion. Even if that Personal Reflection is one of Disdain, it has achieved its Purpose to Enlist a Reaction. It is a Visionary, Visceral View of Ourselves and a Commentary on Our Purpose and Place in this incredibly Vast and Vacant Universe that is as Old as Time and as New as Our Experiences and Expectations can Allow.Trying to Quantify and Describe this Universe and Our Place in it is most likely a Futile Exercise in Ethnocentrism, but that doesn't stop Poets, Writers, Artists, and Scientists from trying. So here is one of those Examples and one of the Most Impressive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Milestone in Storytelling ! Often Misunderstood (&amp; understandably so)!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1968, a movie critic that had panned 2001 on its original release (and later retracted) wrote: "Everyone hates 2001 except people".The Odyssey demanded: "To appreciate 2001, is to see it again. And again! "2001 defies conventional rules of any generic movie. Multi-layered enough to deceive its audience by zeroing its focus on the 'HAL' crisis. Subplot is presented as 'The Major Plot'! And 'The Major Plot' is demoted to Subplot. But it is that 'Major Plot' that ultimately fascinates. That; and the realistic hardware that is subjectively presented as if you, the viewer, were a passenger along for the ride. That is the core of the movie's mystical power that entices people to revisit over and over again.And because of its subplot, it's no accident that HAL steals the show.A question that asks 'What If...' What if human evolution was the outcome of extra terrestrial manipulation. A 'Part 1' and 'Part 2' story covering humankind's 2 stage evolutionary process.Part 1 is told in 16 minutes! Part 2 takes the 2 hour remainder.Because novel and film were simultaneously 4 years in the making (Arthur C Clark couldn't release the book until 2 months after the general release), Kubrick takes full artistic license to go full speed ahead in defiling any previous sci fi movie; any previous book adaptation; and reinvigorating the silent film format all at the same time.Plus the most intensive science/movie research on space travel technology ever conceived up to that point that, 36 years later, hasn't been outdated yet. Every detail, down to the low hum of air filtration, was incorporated.Using 'real time slices of life' sections of only a few chapters, Kubrick, at his command, displays his brilliant understanding of the film median. He stretches the bonds and bounds of film rules, breaks many along the way and creates some of his own.It is one of the most subjective and kinetic movies ever produced. It's a film that demands to be sensed, watched and listened to.And one of the few times where book &amp; movie go hand in hand.In space, no one can hear...anything! As far as I know, Stanley is the only film maker who had the balls to use the dead silence of space to create the story's tension. "2001: A Space Odyssey" tantalizes us with food for thought; and in that tantalizing area, it doesn't disappoint.If you don't 'get it' the 1st time you see it; get in line. I saw it the 1st time in 71'. And I didn't fully appreciate it for 14 years and a few viewings later.A word about Alex North's original score. By itself, the score is awesome. If you start the CD when the MGM logo appears you can actually sync the music to what appears on screen for the 1st 6 or 7 minutes. It creates a flavor all its own. And that's why Kubrick was (unfortunately) justified in yanking it. By placing music over the 'Dawn of Man' sequence, it destroys the desolation and near extinction that early man/ape faced. And nothing could replace Kubrick's selection of existing music for Heywood Floyd's space journey. The main problem is SOMEONE should have told Alex that his music wasn't used before he attended the premiere.Perfect Acting! (contrary to a lot of reactions). People in the high risk, professional space program are trained to react with minimal emotion. To do otherwise, could mean the difference between life and death...even when death occurs. And the underrated William Sylvester does a brilliant bit of camouflage during his morale speech to the troops; and drops his 'nice guy' mask for 1 split second to reveal how ruthless he is for the sake of (so-called) security. If you literally blink, you miss it. He's got these people by the balls and there's nothing in their power they can do about it.Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood gave exceptional performances that made you believe they were astronauts actually aboard the Jupiter bound Spaceship Discovery When I purchase my wide screen projection and 8 ft screen, guess what movie is going on 1st?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's epic masterpiece. I recently saw this again and was stunned by the visuals. Virtually every frame is a masterpiece in itself. Most films would love to have 2 or 3 shots of the caliber of 2001, but this film is loaded with images. The composition of each frame is perfect.Part 1 shows our hairy primate ancestors discovering weapons. Part 2 involves a space station and a mysterious radio transmission from the moon. Part 3 is the journey of a ship to Jupiter.The visuals were jaw dropping in 1968 and paved the way for Star Wars in 1977. What's it all about? Kubrick and notable sci-fi author Arthur C. Clarke won't tell and the meaning of the movie is mysterious. It still looks good more than 40 years after it was released. It's a landmark in film history. See the DVD edition on a big screen TV with good sound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick and Clarke's pharmaceutical brain massage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001 is either confusingly profound or profoundly confusing. Either way, I suspect, what we have on screen is due largely to the massive, widespread drug-use of the swinging sixties when this was conceived.I'm not kidding. When Kubrick and Clarke sat and watched the star baby scene, in the final few frames of their film one can almost imagine the exchange:Kubrick: "Far out, man."Clarke: "Dude...I'm seeing colours..."etc.Drugs can maybe also explain Kurbick's infantile fascination with every spacecraft docking sequence, and why as a result we are forced to watch things unfold almost in realtime.For instance, when Dave pulls out the apparently faulty component. What amounts to probably one sentence in the script translates to five minutes plus of screen time. Is this effective? Necessary? Maybe, and maybe not.The film - as a whole and its individual sequences - are strangely hypnotic. If it was boring then I'd simply turn it off. It isn't. It's compelling in a way that I can't explain. Even completely superfluous and excessively long sequences somehow kept my attention. I suspect, with the aid of drugs they'd transcend "compelling" and become enthralling.Make no mistake - gear's the reason 2001 exists. Not just Kubrick and the like, but the executives at MGM who greenlit this. Can you imagine some poor sod trying to pitch this to an executive today?"Yeah, well, like, we start on earth with a load of apes who learn to beat each other around the head, then we jump to 2001 and this dude goes to the moon - takes him about forty minutes of our time but by God he gets there in the end. Then we jump to the Jupiter mission, a computer goes mad and then we get all psychedelic. Money please!"Eh....I doubt it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The odyssey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"You are free to speculate, as you wish, about the philosophical and allegorical meaning of '2001'." (Stanley Kubrick) I found these words at kubrick2001.com, a website that is specifically dedicated to Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece, many even hail this movie as Kubrick's best. 2001: Space Odyssey. The website tries to give an explanation about the meaning of 2001. I don't know whether their interpretation is correct, but due to the words from Kubrick above, I think everybody will have a different opinion on the movie.As for me, honestly I was also confused when I finished watching 2001. 2001 is divided into four parts. The first is titled: The Dawn of Man. It visualizes the prehistoric era, millions years ago. This part follows the life of a group of apes, how they did their daily routine, like eating, drinking, sleeping. All of these apes were performed convincingly by actors in ape suit. You can tell if they were wearing ape suits, because there were no CG effects at that time. That's the first good impression that I got, visually.One day, suddenly a monolith appeared on the place where the apes lived. Then there was a sequence where an ape found the way to use a bone as a tool, or more appropriate, a weapon. 2001 entered the second part. It was the space exploration era. And now we will begin to see the visual effects greatness of this movie. Of course, all of the effects will be easily produced using CGI nowadays, but considering the era this film was made, it was really marvelous. I was particularly impressed how they managed to visualize 'zero gravitation' on a spaceship perfectly. People were able to walk on walls, or upside down, a pen was able to float around in the air, and many more. The spaceship interior design was also great. In this second part, a monolith was again discovered on the moon. And it brought us into the third part.This part was probably the main focus of the movie. At least according to me. It was still in the space exploration era, but men were now able to travel to Jupiter on a space mission. Some astronauts were put to hibernation, and were carried in a spaceship. There were two more men as the crew of the ship. And now, 2001 introduced its most memorable character, HAL 9000. HAL 9000 is a computer. A very intelligent one. It can speak like humans do. And it controlled all things in the spaceship to help the mission's success. This is probably the clue to the more advanced era we had here, compared to the second part. In this part we will get probably one of the most intense confrontation in movie history, men versus computer. Or more exactly, the spaceship crew against HAL. And again, a monolith appeared and brought us to the final part.This final part was the one that quite difficult to understand. There were many weird things, some kind of symbolism, I guess. I won't talk about this part more, cause it will spoil the movie.Some people may get bored watching 2001. Well, it is maybe the slowest movie I ever saw. But from what I read, 2001 had set a standard for science fiction films. It even got a sequel, 2010. Hey, a difficult movie like this got a sequel? I previously thought only blockbuster movies got sequels. Or maybe 2001 was a blockbuster in its era? I don't know. But obviously it drew attentions of many people.2001 was based on a novel by Arthur C. Clarke, who also co-wrote the movie script with Kubrick. Probably a good thing to read the novel to get better understanding of this film. But if Kubrick were saying the above words, I don't think this movie has the same vision as the novel anymore. Kubrick2001.com interpret 2001 as mainly a movie about human evolution. Their interpretation quite makes sense. But I don't really agree, nor disagree. I still don't know what actually did the monolith represent, a time mark? God? or a time shift hole? But I do interested in the HAL versus man part. It was kind of suggesting how our technology had developed. The technological advancement finally only brought disaster to man himself. To think of it, where is our technology currently heading to? To what end? Is technology really developed to improve our lives? Or is it only made to represent man's sense of pride? In the end, 2001: Space Odyssey is indeed a landmark movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thoughts on 2001 after 36 Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film when it was first released in 1968, in a Cinerama theater. Both the film graphics and the Cinerama format blew me away (I also loved the classical music soundtrack). I'd have to say that I was clueless as to the meaning of the ending to the movie, though. I've finally gotten around to seeing 2001 again, a mere 36 spins of the earth around the sun later. I'm still amazed at the set designs in this film. Incredible graphics engineering. And the "plot" is still not an easy one to fully appreciate (I still need to get around to reading Clarke's book!) What I take from the movie is the viewpoint that mankind took a quantum leap millions of years ago when, as only monkeys, it came in contact with the monolith (knowledge? God?)and learned how to use tools. We jump immediately to the "future" (at least it was the future in 1968!) and find technically-superior man has now discovered the mysterious monolith on the moon. The subsequent journey to Jupiter presents the opportunity for man's own tools (HAL-9000) to utterly betray mankind. The viewer finds out that HAL already knew the purpose of the Jupiter expedition, in which an extraterrestrial intelligence could imply the end of the newfound superiority of machines over mankind (we view the scene in which HAL easily defeats Dave in a chess match - I think HAL is well aware of its superior powers over man). HAL has to exterminate this possibility, but ultimately fails due to man's supreme willpower to live (I guess). Dave is able to complete the journey beckoned by the monolith, and ultimately attains the next quantum leap, to a "star child" which I can only remotely guess as to what that really means. Then again, I could be totally wrong about all this, but the movie is a great classic. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>come on people, evolve</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Human evolution is the gradual awakening of consciousness. It's like slowly opening your eyes and realizing the true nature of things. There are three stages - pure instinctual existence, self-awareness, and finally, the understanding that we are all one consciousness, the same pulsing, vibrating energy that makes up everything in the universe. We're not supposed to be bound to these bodies, there's not supposed to be boundaries between life and death, but...it takes awhile to realize that. What's happened is that we've gotten stuck on stage 2, the self-awareness part. We've mutated the idea of being self-aware into the idea that one living thing is different or better than another living thing. This is incorrect. This thinking is directly responsible for all the pain and suffering in the world. We still believe that our families and close friends are somehow better than anbody else, and will step on anybody else to benefit us and them. This is where greed comes from. Some people say that humans will always be this way, and always have been this way, which is incorrect. Greed is simply an evolutionary quirk that comes from believing that we have progressed as far as we're going to progress, which most people, at every stage in history, erroneously think. At some point, something is going to have to happen that will allow the masses to understand that we are all one, something that is either so awe-inspiring or horrifying that all of our thinking about self-preservation, putting ourselves above others, etc., ends immediately. In one second. The end. On to the next phase. What it will be, I don't know. A massive terrorist attack? The appearence of a UFO? Who knows, but it will be something. I have a feeling that the amount of resistance to the idea will determine how peaceful the change will be. Because we're not meant to suffer. Really.Kubrick intuitively understands this. Evolution is happening whether we want it to or not, and most of the time we don't want it to, because we stake our lives on belief systems (science, religion, patriotism, superiority of one's own family, etc.) that are good for nothing but creating an enemy, and that is completely backwards, but no matter - the monolith is coming anyway. The change is radical and completely new. Human beings have this idea of space exploration as the final frontier, which I don't think is the case. Space is there so we can dream about it. It is meant to stimulate the imagination, because going inward, becoming pure imagination, is the true final frontier. The apes first imagined tools. Now we're imagining spaceships, but we're still not creatures of pure imagination. It's happening, but s-l-o-w-l-y. This is what happens at the end of 2001. We go through a prism of colors and patterns that suddenly transform themselves into landscapes. That's the way it goes, folks. The universe is made up of colors and patterns that we, having brains, organize into concrete things, but it's still pure imagination. We try to separate imagination from "reality", the conscious from the unconscious, life from death, ourselves from the Other, as if everything was already here when the first humans arrived, but really, we need to bring those things together and move out of dualistic thinking and us vs. them statements. Then the true nature of things will be revealed, and the mortal body, which we watch age and die in the film, will no longer matter. We will be one with the universe. We won't be stuck on Earth. We will have astral bodies. This is the end of 2001.Just kidding, the movie sucked cause it didn't have a plot, and where was the CGI?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a movie that is quite odd, but profound in nature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no doubt this movie is strange, perhaps scary at times. Using subtle visual techniques Kubrick employs amazing visuals on the viewer and brilliant sound. Its hard to figure out what is going on, the first 30 minutes of the movie takes place "In the Dawn of Man" then it skips to the present (or future in this case). The acting is interesting, solid material from everyone it focuses on, also HAL 9000s voice, "it can only be attributable to human error." This movie also gets creepy in certain scenes, and some scenes don't make sense. Its a beautiful looking science- fiction movie, but I found it lacking in some departments. It also got too weird occasionally. Because of these problems I'm not giving this a very, very high rating as I would for Full Metal Jacket and Dr. Strangelove. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mirror for your own interpretation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***********Spoiler Warning****************I've heard high and low about how 2001 should be understood, from the horribly bad to the most cerebral and intellectual film experience you could possibly have. Having the seen the film as both a teenager and a grown adult, and comparing how I felt about it, I've realized the whole point to the movie was to ask questions, and deliberately leave them unanswered. I kind of wonder if Kubrick didn't secretly chuckle to himself at the lengths people went to trying to understand his masterpiece.What I liked about 2001 was the remoteness it created, a world view almost akin to how an alien visitor would see our world, not knowing or caring about politics, trendiness, or current events. This has also helped keep it from becoming too heavily dated, albeit everything has a zooty kind of sixties look to it.As regards the often commented special effects, they are still good, although now at the level of something weekly TV shows do as routine. They did seem to start the trend of every flat surface on a spaceship being covered with pipes and wires and cables. This is also probably the only sci-fi movie ever made that correctly showed there is no sound in a vacuum. I actually think 2001 looks more futuristic than some current sci-fi films simply because the producers tried to do so much more with less, and the sixties "future" furniture and styles has largely been forgotten and looks original compared to modern themes.I don't think a movie like this could be made again, major studios seem to have an aversion to making films that are mainly of art school appeal, and the timing of a movie that forces you to slowly absorb and ponder is anathema in a day and age when quick flashes and fast-fast pacing is the rule.As for the storyline, too much is deliberately left in the black, and the "landing sequence" that is often regarded as some landmark statement about transcendance borders on the unintelligible. If you believe Bowman is riding some interdimensional roller coaster to places where physics and space and everything else gets jumbled up then okay, but otherwise it's mostly eye candy.Overall there's a theme Kubrick is trying to put forward about man evolving to a higher plane, but what is at stake or what it's really all about (He's the Star Child, now what?) is never made clear, and probably intentionally so. The moral of the story is the best way to make people think you're an uber-genius is drop some hints and clues but never really let on you don't have it all figured out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After Paths of Glory, Lolita and Dr. Strangelove: Or how..., Kubrick shocks with another ultimate feature. A motion picture that is hard to understand when seeing it for the first time, is the type that fascinates and makes you start to think. This is exactly what 2001 does to it's viewers- probably did to Kubrick and Clarke too. Reading the book is almost as enjoyable as watching this outstanding movie especially the explanation of what really happens after Bowman enters the vortex and is reborn as starchild (the first of the earthlings). The funny thing about the plot is the troubled journey is not the problem in the first place but to find out about the monolith's meaning (1/4/9). Finally HAL (IBM) screws up and shows who or what wins the man - machine conflict. Conclusion: If you liked this movie go and read 2001-2010-2061-3001 by Clarke.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A New Way of Interpreting 2001</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was a weird point made -some kind of a mystery- in this movie. Of course it is needless to say that this movie was made to be that way, but there was an apparently implying point. That is - the point where Dave shows HAL9000 his drawings of the crew on ship. From HAL9000's reply "I see great improvement, Dave."(Sorry it's not accurate), we know that it was not the first time Dave had showed HAL his drawings. And HAL's "Could you hold it a bit closer please?" was also the point. The idea is - that Dave knew how well HAL could recognize patterns! If this idea is right, it will change whole the story. It will mean that Dave had used HAL -very intelligently- to kill other crews, and then killed HAL, a complete crime. It also means that this movie referred to the human-kind's very first murder, and the most recent (or last) murder. We also remember that at every appearance of monolith, there was a requiem by Ligheti. So if we take it this way, a tool was still a tool, even with all these years past. I first thought that this movie had implied the evolution of a tool, a tool exceeding human beings enough to make human beings as tools, but now I think it's not the only possibility. By the way this idea gives its last scene a well agreeable meaning too. That Dave had touched god's anger- and he was sentenced to hell. He was given a life of an eternity in a room of nowhere and nothing. He has to spend time in that place of nowhere, forever. The worst -most dreadful, deadly- punishment for committing a crime like this was, "having to live forever". The starchild appearing in the very last scene was of course not his real body - it was his mind-, Kubrik's expression of Dave's nostalgia for his mother earth. With the music Zaustra cynically implying the birth of "superhuman"...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Few Random Comments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So many have commented, some quite scholarly. There are few films that have been held up to such scrutiny as this one. My reactions are emotional, although I think I could wade in the same waters as some of my predecessors. My approach to movies is to take them as they come. I am so tired of all the talk about special effects that begin almost every review. If you have a high profile film, the special effects are treated as if they are some a form unto themselves, as if they were actually removed from the film. Didn't like the special effects. Didn't like the movie. Sit down for a moment and look at this film. It's wonderful that Kubrick was able to do what he did with those effects, but the way this movie unfolds is so much more than that. This movie is there to portray a sense of the awe of the universe and the future of humankind based on the increments that have led us there. It is about a future that may occur.Everyone is talking about movie being a disappointment after reading the book. Folks, the movie came out before the book. The movie was originally based on a short story called "The Sentinel" by Arthur C. Clarke. The movie borrows some of its thoughtfulness from "Childhood's End," another Clarke book which deals with similar issues about the ends of humankind and the transmigration of our being. If you are going to enjoy 2001, you have to put away that fixation on the conventional science fiction of the day, with foam rubber aliens and armies of extra-terrestrial implements of destruction. Take a look at Star Wars sometime (by the way, I think it's a wonderful film). It is really a space western, a World War II airplane movie, with a rite of passage thrown in, and the obligatory soap opera stuff with Luke and Darth Vader. No-one can hit anything with laser weapons. Those storm troopers are the most worthless fighting force I have ever seen. It's a fun movie, but when you look at true speculative science fiction, there isn't much to think about, no metaphysics, nothing much to occupy your mind after its over. 2001 sets out to be different and shouldn't be compared to Star Wars; they are apples and oranges. This movie has some of the most breath taking images that stand there in silent space, just getting a reaction. If Independence Day is your thing and everything you see needs to copy it, don't bother to see this movie.</fullReview>

It is certainly one of the great movies and I have seen it many times. But it really falls flat on a TV screen. My wish has always been that more of what is in the Arthur C. Clarke novel could have been made more explicit in the film. Sadly, with the many in your face SciFi films made since 1968, this is not a movie that is going to appeal to the majority of modern film audiences, but any film buff must see this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Study of Intellectual Evolution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001 is probably the most technically perfect film ever made. It is a study in the intellectual evolution of mankind. The premise is that an outside entity is enabling our journey through the use of the monolith. The monolith gives the apes the ability to reason. Not insignificantly, Moonwatchers first thought is the use of a weapon (the bone). This changes everything. This new species is able to conquer its rivals, changing itself from hunted to hunter, allowing the species to flourish. Moonwatcher throws the bone in the sky and it morphs into a nuclear space station. Eons have gone by in an instant but man has not changed at all. The rest of the movie deals with the next step in man's intellectual evolution beginning with the discovery of the monolith on the moon. This can be seen symbolically in the ships that are used, signifying man's "re-birth". The space station is an unfertilized egg and Floyd's shuttle is the sperm. Conception occurs at docking. The probe to the moon is the fertilized zygote implanting itself in the womb (the moon). And of course, Discovery is the soon to be born child, the monolith by Jupiter the birth canal. New man no longer needs a body and is pure energy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The sci-fi movie by definition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is for me THE sci-fi movie by definition, and I support my pitch with the following facts: # the movie has the ambition to tell the story of human kind from its very remote beginning four million years ago up to its far future; a huge ambition, an almost unbearable burden, but 2001 succeeds: the movie is at the same time highly epic and iconic... # epic: the story is a fantastic journey: four million years ago, a mysterious, superior entity has come on earth to chose the best among all pre-human beings (actually an ape, Moonwatch) to transition his species into its future, i.e. mankind as we know it. Four million years later, the same mysterious entity appears again and again it comes to select the best among all men (Dave Bowman) to do what his precursor had done millions of years before, i.e. to carry his species to the next level. The final amazing journey across time and space, culminating in the birth of the new species, symbolised by the huge phoetus- egg that Bowman has turned in, is a unique filmic experience # iconic: 2001 has changed sci-fi cinema for ever, sci-fi movie have never been the same since. The cinematographic solutions that Scott and his crew have created for 2001 have set new standards for any future sci-fi movie: just think of the way of portraying spaceships, moving very slowly against the infinite background of the deep space instead of being bullet-like objects as they had been shown up to then. Other visuals have been adopted by movies like the fantastic Interstellar (which I loved a lot!): think of the spinning space station, the docking scenes, and even the key visuals of the journey across the wormhole (is this Cooper or David Bowman...?). I watched 2001 back in 1969, and I keep watching it every now and then; another amazing thing of this movie is how watchable still is nearly 50 years after its production, even more so for a sci-fi movie, most of which become obsolete</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey was the first great Sci-Fi Film. It has it all- A.I, Spacesuits and Aliens. Although many contemporary audiences considerer this classic boring and dull, it certainly is entertaining if you understand it. It's not simply a story of Astronauts floating around in space, but more a story of the change of man, and how technology has changed. The Opening Scene, The Dawn of Man, is one of the greatest parts of this space epic. It shows how man was thousands of years ago, and how man discovered weapons. I personally don't believe in evolution, but I do find this scene very intriguing and is more a scene of the change of the mental capacity of man, not necessarily the psychical. This is the clever way that Stanley Kubrick makes the scene. He sets the scene up as more of a personal interpretation, rather than put the facts on screen.Overall, 2001 is a great film that defiantly makes you think about life and the change of man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never seen such an amazing film since 2001: A Space Odyssey. I watched 3 times. The science fiction film directed by Stanley Kubrick in 1968. The famous science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke's film script inspired by a short story, was written by Kubrick and Clarke. The film evolution of people, technology, artificial intelligence thematic elements of work and scientific realism, pioneering visual effects, provocative ambiguity and surreal imagery contained, according to some commentators, has built its reputation with the conversation in the place of silence and minimal traditional narrative techniques.2001: A Space Odyssey, along with a lot of other Kubrick films, is not for everyone. It is slow paced for the most part, has very little dialogue, and has a long runtime. But this movie has amazing to fantastic visual effects, impeccable cinematography, and an interesting story.2001: A Space Odyssey begins with the birth of technology during the section titled "The Dawn of Man". In the images over the African desert " Dawn of Man ' title is read. A prehistoric ape - man is trying to live in the arid desert tribes . In the morning, a mysterious rectangular obelisk appears they 've INC move timid monkeys. This is only a monkey after the match - it broke other bones discovered in the man finds the first tool when visiting a oodles of bone can be used as a stick to get . This monkey - the man now stands partially upright , leads the defense of the pond to the tribe , using the new weapons Kill an enemy by monkey sticks . Victorious ape - man threw up his arms , the film is cut with a spouse falls turning into earth orbit satellites with bone on a horse for the future.Moon Journey Until then unprecedented in the history of cinema space scenes and instruments giving rise to inventions such as a visual telephone. Jupiter Duty Detected in months where the second obelisk pointed, begin the journey to Jupiter eighteen months later. During this trip we met the most perfect of instruments with HAL 9000. The inability of man against his own creation tool is highlighted in the chess scene. But the picture is fine against Dave HAL can draw a grudge. Dave's obsession with the events yet to take place before the state of art as a machine knows that all kinds of superior human intelligence can be explained by the opposite showed desperation. HAL although a superior human "tools" Although I represent also the lack of emotion or lack of ability to understand the spirit of "art" as we humanly make it impossible to mimic the imaginative behavior. Dave's drawing showing the state where Kubrick, how through art, despite all human weakness "tools" to emphasize that also is different.Jupiter and Beyond Infinity A little bit of Kubrick's "Jupiter" To stand on the election, Jupiter, the god of gods Zeus symbolizes as it is known, besides being the largest planet in our solar system. At the same time in astrology Jupiter is seen as a source of change and power beyond human eternity ..

This also applies to the food end of the human and has a glass of water in the crystal depicted in Kubrick dining table. As a result of human nature and broken glass scattered on the water surface. The shape of the container in which water, the vessel will survive even if it breaks. This unique awareness and body after eating his last meal portray humanity finds itself dying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect film to me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me, this is the perfect film... it captures something that I haven't seen any other movie capture... awe. Usually movies involve "standard' human emotion... anger, fear, pride, passion etc... This is the only movie that I think takes a step beyond into the sublime. Standard storytelling involves 'conflict' and 'drama'. There is some of that here for sure, but there's a transcendental/meditative quality to the film.It does not use conventional storytelling techniques... and it's a good thing it doesn't. There is enough dialogue to give a complete picture of the plot... Any more dialogue would have been extraneous. However, the film is NOT a mush of ambiguity... it tells a very clear profound story about human evolution... the economy of words gives more clarity... not less... Visually, it is perfect... amazing, a film almost 50 years old... yet stands up to any sci-fi film today.If you want to be swept up in drama and 'standard' human emotion... you won't get that here. But I think you get something much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Monolith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion its probably the most genial and beautiful sci-fi movie of all time. Just the sets are phenomenal, like the spinning residence or the Hangar with the little spaceships in it. In the end there is certainly the question, whats the meaning of Kubricks Epos 2001: A Space Odyssey? In my view its about the Human race who let computers do more and more of our work so they don't have any responsibility any more, we need to get back and learn to do things yourself or we cant deal with the aftermath eventually. At the same time the film is telling us to grow, in the form of the Monolith, we have a duality here.Sorry for my English I'm not a native speaker. Raumdenker 2014</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i recently saw Interstellar, and since that i couldn't stop thinking about this Piece of Art.this is one of the most brilliant movies i've ever seen, maybe one of the most important movie ever made (arguably one of the best sci-fi movie ever made), Kubrick is a genius, Extraordinary filmmaker. if you live in the year this movie released, you might think he's crazy, just because this movie is already far more advance than it should be. the visualization is great with the help of classical music, it's gives you intense and it brings the seriousness. the original score is great too though. some people might find this movie boring because it's kinda slow pace movie, Especially in the first twenty minutes. for me that's art and technical at the same time, the camera work, his vision of the future is just incredible. the special effect is awesome too (for 1960's movie is a breakthrough).i agree with one of the review here says "One has to be ready for it, or it cannot be understood." it's a perfect description.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest Sci-Fi film to grace the cinema (Some Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I could go on about this movie for a very long time but I think a brief review is much more helpful to the masses. I am 15 years old and in my age group films such as these are usually overlooked in favour of the "widely-praised" action and sci-fi films of today. It is sad to see that my age group might never have the chance to see one of the most revolutionary films of all time. From start to finish this movie awes and surprises in it's grand quest to show the evolution of mankind in an almost silent film. For the most part the viewer is presented with an array of beautiful if not stunning shots of space, ships and planets. The film is so revolutionary that these shots feel like they're out of the 1980s and not 1968. I won't go too much into the ending or the story as my own interpretation is likely to be quite different from anyone else's. This is the genius of the film. It presents itself subtly and forces the viewer to think. A quality which almost every modern film lacks and it saddens me to see the dumbed- down films that have a chokehold on the industry and that movies like 2001: A Space Odyssey will be likely forgotten in the wake of this mass idiocy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Douglas Trumball Show...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cite Douglas Trumball (though he was only One of MANY) because HE has gone on to great fame because of what he did in 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY- AND because neither HIS name nor the names of any of the other visual fx technicians who worked on the movie are listed as they SHOULD be- as co-directors. (Would 2001 be the classic it is without those fx...?) Still, although it was Trumball and company who actually played the tune, it was Kubrick who conducted the orchestra. (Six of one, half dozen of the other...?) Storywise, 2001 leaves gaping holes big enough to house a million Monoliths. Why, for instance, did the aliens give Man his very first WEAPON instead of a tool that might make for a far brighter future (the wheel, say)? And was there just ONE Monolith, or THREE? Was the Monolith on Earth the same one that was later discovered on the Moon (or the one that appears at the end of the movie)? The entire Moon sequence could've been cut without adversely affecting the narrative in any way, but I must confess a fondness for The Blue Danube Waltz. Was HAL sabotaged by the aliens to somehow TEST Man's worthiness to make it to The Next Evolutionary Step? 2001 leaves a lot of questions unanswered (I saw it TWICE in theaters, hoping to pick up on details the second time around that I'd missed during my first go, but no such luck). The greatest success, early on, seems to have been with the very "stoners" who would make Tolkein's books runaway hits, but there are STILL a lot of unanswered questions.</fullReview>

I don't believe in evolution and evolution is one of the films main undertones but this does not take away from this cinematic masterpiece. the special effects were top notch and the acting was great. this movie is suspenseful and beautiful and makes you feel like you are accompanying the astronauts on their amazing odyssey to Jupiter. i recommend this to anyone that is in the mood for a truly amazing film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinematic Shockpiece In Space Tripping</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>40 years and counting...look how well this movie has held up to the flatulent times that have been. To put things in perspective this movie happened at a culturally important time in the modern world (definitively American) history. Arthur C Clarke's 2001: A Space Odyssey begs to be read and then watched on the screen. For all of us who have been abandoned to pirated junk on listless Chinese CDs must have a dekko of the original on-screen or at least on DVD. The chills are still there 40 years on.A definitive genre-pioneering masterpiece of unmatched depth and intellectual implications...but why?A two-and-half hour sci-fi flick without a shot of violence or cyberpunk (back then it didn't exist). Very little dialogue. A cast that can be counted on fingertips. And a soundtrack that makes you feel you are at the Berlin Philarmonic's Strauss renditions. This movie is something of an experience and definitely not a moral science lesson of good-evil that MTV style pop-culturists and present-day Presidents believe in. This movie is a heavy-weight, brush aside those so-called blockbuster prints that seem to vie for 15-25 aged-somethings high on peer-pressure syndrome. Bubba go back to school, not high school, not film school but art school. Kubrick genuinely drives the point home about why sci-fiction could be at best mankind's most sincere effort at art? How else would feel about a space-time situation that Dr Bowman was tripping into? Well your laws of physics don't hold good, so where is the scope for explanations about the climax? This movie has done a remarkable job of giving the viewer a chance to participate in one of the most humbling experiences that mankind cannot afford - SPACE.Kubrick's movie is a poor-man's ticket to space. In space, time is more of a liability. 2 1/2 hours of such a cinematic experience shouldn't try to bet against it. 2001 ASO is a masterpiece of believability and physics as its creators have gone into the minutest details of perceptive canvas to bring across a true work of art. In contrast the last 20 minutes or so of Dr Bowman's space-time trek (some prefer it to an enlightening LSD workout) is nothing but cinematic honesty and imagination that physics cannot explain. How else would you explain time-warps? If you expect Star Wars type sci-fi then well 2001 ASO will disappoint. Because Star Wars is like canned juice. (Not to say Star Wars is bad cinema) but 2001 ASO is more like fruit on the tree. Eat it or leave it, its as natural as it gets, no preservatives or human interferences.Almost every sci-fi movie worth its salt (after 2001 ASO) must have read into this Clarke/Kubrick classic for some inspiration and also knowledge about space. Space is a lonely, cold, timeless, unfeeling, inanimate, persecuting, inspiring and infinite emotion as seen in this movie. We can never answer some questions like who created the Universe? Whats? Ifs? Buts? Whys? Why Nots?Given this movie's limitations of scientific data at its time, it is indeed more of a gigantic effort. A kind of buzz on the scifi genre timeline. Something akin to the apeman's mind being ''Seeded'' for intelligence by the black and mysterious monolith. This movie is indeed a ''Seeding'' of minds that wish to venture into the fantastic-space and end-of-the-dimensions attitude of an all-inviting mind. LSD did help, so did the generation of mind-altering tastes, man was stepping on the Moon - the timing was right. The movie has thus garnered its cult status.If you ask me the movie is an awesome adaptation of the book. But if you read the book first and tripped through the movie later, then you will understand at least the essence of the almost abstract formula of the ending. 2001 has no ending because it was the beginning of man's ultimate trip in space-time. Clarke wrote well beyond 2001 and many of his later works did run into critical brickbats. But there is no denying that A C Clarke is the man who probably invented Pink Floyd type science fiction.Just like space, this movie is too abstract to define in terms of possibilities or implications. That I presume was Kubrick's idea for it too. Hollywood seems to afford such explanations with aliens who walk - talk - and do evil like us. After you watch 2001 ASO, you will begin to wonder if ''intelligence'' itself is so unique and man himself is so really miniscule to the events that are shaping the Universe.Add to all this the artistic flourish of the movie with its sweeping Strauss-orchestrated epic ''Thus Spake Zarathustra'' or the intimate sounds that intertwine with the hollowness of space. This tension in space has never been filmed to such an extreme degree of emotional precision without any graphic violence. Its the kind of ''ultra-violence'' the American PsyOps would mete-out in their propaganda wars to culture-shock religious crackers like the Taleban to get them out of their ''oyster'' er caves. Same effect for commercial movie-bred audience. They might mistake it for 2 1/2 hours of nothing. Hello!?! Nothing happens in space like you think bubba!A movie (if ever there was one) to add to the list of movies that could possibly have changed mankind's perception of The Bigger Picture. Think you know your physics? Space-time graphs? Exclusion formulae? Rethink, go watch 2001 A Space Odyssey.Watch ''A Clockwork Orange'' another Stanley Kubrick masterpiece if you liked this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate in Visionary Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001 is the supreme example of the lost art of pure cinema. Alongside other auteurs like David Lean, Kubrick represents a period of epic film-making that has sadly passed from our realm. The indelible experience of a theatrical motion picture event such as 2001 has been replaced in our time with forgettable multiplex fodder--even "event" films such as Spielberg's War of the Worlds are nothing more than forgettable popcorn time-fillers. But 2001 was crafted to leave a lasting impression of complex, majestic artistry, sewing seeds of mystery and dream-world surrealism that, for me at least, live on in my own consciousness.Those who've never viewed 2001 in its proper setting have never really seen the whole film. I have the DVD, but rarely enjoy viewing it. The home video format simply eradicates the grandeur and majestic scope of this completely unique cinematic milestone. The last chance I had to view it on a big screen was at the Cineramadome in Hollywood about a decade ago, and that experience was memorable beyond words. Inherent in its makeup, 2001 was meant to be viewed in crystal-clear 70mm on a mammoth screen, with state-of-the-art sound. Through its sensory scope, the technology of the film itself suggests the evolutionary connections between the futuristic HAL and the very medium chosen to portray him/it. The movie screen becomes a character in the relationships posed by 2001, and no video system can ever duplicate that. The incredibly complex, layered sound (as well as the suffocating silence) is also a character. That's the nature of Kubrick's visionary cinema.Such were the ideas and ideals of film-making as it blossomed in the sixties era, conceptual strains which are all but lost in our current corporation-saturated world. It was years after having seen 2001 as a young teenager that I was able to see Kubrick's complete body of work, and it's still striking that an artist who was so cynical could have made the great masterpiece of awe and wonder. The companion piece to 2001, A Clockwork Orange, is in many ways the antithesis of all that 2001 conveys, and to me that's a fascinating dichotomy. I think the latter film was closer to Kubrick's own world-view, but as an artist and a master of visions, 2001 stands as the supreme testament to thinking outside the box.</fullReview>

		<fullReview># 1 Best Film of 1968It's been thirty-seven years, but whenever I hear 'Also Sprach Zarathustra' by Richard Strauss playing on the radio, in a commercial, on television or in a movie, I always think of the illustrious motion picture, '2001: A Space Odyssey'. It was a film surrounding space travel and life in space in the future by one of the world's most celebrated filmmakers, Stanley Kubrick. '2001' was Stanley Kubrick's first big-budget film, his most memorable film and many film critics and movie buffs alike agree it's his most genius work. Part of the reason why '2001' was such a hit was because of the amazing special effects (for the time - it was 1968) and the haunting and brooding classical music score that blended perfectly into the peace and quiet of outer space. While wowing audiences with its spectacular visual effects, '2001' also challenged their intelligence and view on human life with deep philosophical ideas and messages lodged deep inside science-fiction picture. People have praised '2001: A Space Odyssey' as being the crowning work of an extraordinarily gifted filmmaker ahead of his time, and other have panned it as being jumbled, frustrating, deliberately confusing and very undeserving of it's praise. I have finally witnessed one of cinema's most talked about and debated over epics, and I can assure you it's not only an excellent movie, it's one of the best made motion pictures of all time, thanks entirely to the very meticulous and conscientious vision of Stanley Kubrick, the finest film director to ever grace the world.'2001: A Space Odyssey' is set in the beautiful and peaceful confides of outer space, where humans (mostly doctors and scientists) do astrological research from expansive spacecrafts. A lot of what we have today (and what we had when the book '2001' is based upon was written) has now been replaced with artificial intelligence (robots) in Stanley Kubrick's invisionment of what the year 2001 would look like, taken of course from Arthur Clarke's groundbreaking and controversial novel. The story surrounds two doctors on a mission up in space, Dr. Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Dr. Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood). Their mission is leads them to the moon, to find an artificial relic, which can lead to the discovery to a new and mysterious life form. The two are helped by H.A.L., the creepy-voiced computer of the spacecraft, who develops a mind of it's own and eventually turns on them. H.A.L. turns on the two astronauts when he (it, really) refuses to save them in fear it will jeopardize their mission. The film becomes a sort-of survival story after that for Dave (Frank dies, when he is failed to be saved by H.A.L.) which eventually leads him to what the mission is looking for, taking him on a five minute journey filled with vibrant and e colors and graphics through the depths of outer space, eventually resulting in Dave seeing himself aging and eventually dying, and being re-born as a extra-terrestrial. 2001's ending may be one of the most talked about, debated and argued about film endings of all time. There is no solid explanation for it, and Mr. Kubrick (as well as author Arthur Clarke) leave it up to you (the viewer) to figure out. I personally found the ending to be extremely frustrating and mind-numbing the first time I saw it. I just couldn't grasp it, until about four days later I began to deeply admire it. In my opinion, '2001' is very anti-technology (hinting it will one day destroy us), but offers hope for us in the future. Stanley Kubrick provides the absolute best direction of his career with '2001: A Space Odyssey' that it is nothing short of appalling he didn't receive the Oscar for 'Best Director'. Without Kubrick, there couldn't have been a movie of '2001', period. Only his rich, elaborate, sophisticated and undeniably gorgeous could make '2001' what it is then and today. In other words, if any other filmmaker was to touch it, the project would crash and burn. Kubrick fills the movie with aching beauty ever second of the runtime, not only with the direction but the screenplay he co-wrote with the famous novel's author, Arthur C. Clarke. The acting in '2001' is really nothing special, but it doesn't have to be because the last thing '2001' is about is the performances. Keir Dullea, Gary Lockwood, William Sylvester, Leonard Rossiter and Douglas Rain (who provides the chilling voice of the vengeful computer, H.A.L.) are all decent, but nothing really memorable (well, just Douglas Rain's voice). The film suffers by being a tad overlong, and it's also very slow moving in the beginning, but I forgive it for that. The film's cinematography, visual effects, musical score, set decoration, screenplay and sound were all Academy Award worthy, and in my opinion '2001' should have taken home the Oscar for 'Best Motion Picture of the Year', but it wasn't even nominated. If that doesn't prove to you how short-sighted and ignorant the Academy voters are, I don't know what will!In conclusion, I don't even recommend '2001'. I plead, no I demand, you dash to your local videostore and rent a copy. You may enjoy it, you may not, but you will definitely be thinking about it the next morning and it will for sure enlighten you. '2001' isn't as much of a film as it is a landmark in cinema. '2001' set the bar for many extraordinary motion pictures to come, and I'll say it again, none of it would be possible without the genius of Mr. Stanley Kubrick. If you've already seen it, I recommend you buy it on DVD, along with Kubrick's other films in his DVD Collection including his work from 1962 to 1999. '2001' may bore you a little, but when it's all over it will give you a slightly different view on things. Grade: A-MADE MY TOP 300 LIST AT #85</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A compelling story of the advance of mankind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This story is told over elegant sequences, that with every advance in mankind/technology, there is a cost that we must pay.This is first illustrated when the ape creatures discover tools (bones),after touching a strange monolith. And uses the bone to kill another ape, this murder is the cost of our new technology. After this violent encounter we are taken to another time and place... As the story jumps to the future, we open the new age with new technology, in this case we see amazing establishing shots with space ships/stations. This entire scene is accompanied with the Blue Danbue Waltz. This part is where my rating of This movie dropped a star, as I am only 13 years old my attention span wears thin after "repeated" establishing shots. About 30 minutes into the movie we are introduced to our protagonist. Here we have our first dialoge taking place on a space ship. At this point we discover that there has been some problems on another ship and the audience is kept in the dark about what is happening. We are then brought to more shots and classical music during a shot where our protagonist is brought to the lunar surface. Our next scene is of our main character presenting the problems at the station to a council, they seem to agree with him that the matter should be of absolute secrecy, and decide off camera about farther plans. As we cut to the next scene we are brought to a small ship with a group of scientist visiting a strange object imbedded in the lunar surface. Here we have our second meeting with the monolith. One of the men reaches out and touches the monolith starting the next step in our wheel of change.Next we are introduced to a new protagonist on a trip to Saturn. We are also introduced to a new character, Hal, a super intelligent computer from a line of computers that have never made a mistake, in a little while he shall be viewed as the antagonist but not for now. As we come a little bit in to our voyage we have some dialect between Hal and Dave (the protagonist). After the conversation is almost at an end, Howe announces that there is a malfunction with the communication dish on the star ship. After further examination it is discovered that the dish was not damaged and there was a computer error, which has never happened before. As Dave and his fellow crew man decide what to do about the problem we are introduced to our new change, our technology (Hal), has developed a mind of its own and has emotions including revenge and anger. As the humans plot to shut down Hal, Hal learns of their plans and systematically kills the crew which is our cost for such great technology. The last crew member, Dave, is left to shut down Howe. Once this feat is completed Dave arrives at Saturn. When venturing out in to space we again meet the monolith and as Dave enters it hes is brought in to an out of body experience that was translated as Dave dying. During a "dream" sequence, we see the progressive states of Daves life after his current state. Middle age, old and finally dying, as we see him dying Dave reaches out and for the last time, the monolith is touched. After this instance we see not an advance in technology, but in life as Dave dies and is reincarnated as a "Star Child", at the cost of his former self. Here the movie ends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The idea of "2001: A Space Odyssey" is not to just watch it, but to experience it. The meaning of the film does not lie in dialogue or even in it's breath-taking visual effects, but within the brain, heart, and soul of the viewer. Of course, there are a handful of viewers who have hated the film for it's lack of closure or explanation, or simply that the film drags from beginning to end with simply no plot. To bring closure or explanation is not easy for a film like this, but that is not what Stanley Kubrick had intended. He intended that each viewer find the answer within themselves and not on the screen. The hidden piece to this puzzle lies in the soul, not the acetate. Keep this in mind while watching this picture. Too many people have degraded this film because they weren't able to understand it. It's a movie that requires the brain just as much as the eyes and the heart just as much as the ears and the soul just as much as mere attention span. To say that "2001: A Space Odyssey" is the finest picture ever made would only be underestimating it. Of course, if you prefer hot action flicks with bad asses and sexy chicks with big guns bigger explosions, this movie is most definitely NOT for you! It's one of the most monotonous and pretentious films ever created, but it has these characteristics for a reason. If you're not willing to figure out why, save yourself the trouble and rent "Rush Hour" instead....Oh, and one more thing...If God made films, he'd be Stanley Kubrick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm amazed that so many people on this site have so much trouble with this movie. Personally, I have no problem at all proclaiming it a work of genius and a masterpiece, though I can understand that it won't be to everybody's liking. It's leisurely pace is perfectly in keeping with the demands of the story, but to some that equates with boring. Presumably, these people are all paid up members of the Michael Bay / Jerry Bruckheimer fan club and to them 'Armageddon' is the ultimate Sci-Fi extravaganza.No matter, that's their problem. What really concerns me is the bile that comes to the surfacce when these people talk about Kubrik. Who else would have had the brass balls to have made this movie, or Dr. Strangelove or A Clockwork Orange for that matter? Kubrik made FILMS...do you understand me when I say this? To him, this was an art form whilst so many others were making pop corn flicks. No director's cannon of work stands up in quite the same way that Kubrik's does. Even his acknowledged low point in 'Eyes Wide Shut' is a fascinating film. So, in closing, don't confuse style with pretension. Kubrik was the guvnor - 'nuff said!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A somewhat disappointing prophecy about things to come</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some imaginative ideas in this film but with the passage of time since it was made the element of surprise and amazing feats described are now every day occurrences. Space craft landing on distant planets....computers that are voice-activated. Astronauts are now the new explorers....the great adventurers reaching out into the dangerous unknown spaces. We read about them every day in the newspapers and we see them floating around in their weightlessness on our TV screens.This film is not a documentary nor a drama (there are far more exciting films) but rather a man's artistic interpretation of what might be in his future. The film is divided into segments beginning with the dawn of man. The episodes which follow are only mildly linked with what has gone before. The most obvious perhaps is the tossing of an ancient thighbone into the air and in the next episode we see a spaceship which somewhat resembles the shape of that thighbone. Some of the other linkages must be left to the imagination.In one sequence we get the impression of the spaceship (isn't it huge?)hurtling through space by the use of colours streaming from a central point giving quite a good 3D effect. But since this film was made the computer graphics have advanced to such a degree that everything in the past pales into insignificance.I cannot imagine how such a mighty spacecraft could be launched. Nor is there any attempt to suggest how this was possible. I presume it was built in space beyond the earth's atmosphere. As I said this is an art film not a how-to-do-it documentary.I was disappointed with the salon that the astronaut enters when he reaches Jupiter. The furnishings look so familiar with tables and chairs, wine glasses and knives and forks. I never imagined that the beings on Jupiter looked like us nor had the same life style.As for the mysterious black monolith that pops up from time to time, every one is forced to use his own imagination as to what purpose it serves. I do not know. I can only surmise that it has some kind of regenerative power which creates beings for the next step in man's development. A sort of super cloning device. Imaginative, yes. This assumes of course that we are on the right path to the summit of excellence.The most exciting moment in the film is the argument between the astronaut and the computer when the computer informs him that something has gone wrong and danger lies ahead. The close-ups of the astronaut's intense expression are well done. Most of the other characters are not developed to any extent and consequently less interesting.In my opinion...interesting, but not Kubrik's best work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most Ambitious Movie Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people are turned off by this movie because they don't understand it. In my view, the meaning of the movie is perhaps much simpler than some people think. What the movie is, in my view, is a philosphical exploration of the ramifications of consciousness and our inability to grasp why we are here in the universe. If we were created by some force external to us, and we don't know why we are here, what happens when we then go on to emulate our creator(s) and create our own life? How do we provide answers to our creation when we don't even have the answers ourselves? And how do our creator(s) provide answers to us when we finally return to them with our own shortcomings?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A scientific approach to God</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many of the discussions about 2001 ? A Space Odyssey refer to the transcendental and unreasonable ending, that seems to be anything but a conclusion. Rather than trying to give an explanation for it, I would like to point out why there can't be any. If there is still anybody who has not seen this movie, please see it prior to reading on. Who are we? Where do we come from? The questions raised in 2001 ? A Space Odyssey, are truly fundamental. In Kubrick's adaptation there is something much greater than human brains.The visible part of it, a black monolith, does not change at all in its appearance throughout space and time. It is constant. The apes meet it with fear and excitement. Millions of years and a single, famous cut later, human tools have changed and the approach to the monolith is far more reasonable and thoughtful, but communication is still impossible. The apes do not understand, that touching it made them discover the use of bones as survival tools. The astronauts on the moon try to analyze the monolith only to suffer physical pain. At least, man has now been able to identify it as a source of radio waves addressed to something.The search for truth, however, is painful and lethal for everybody. Even HAL's quest remains unanswered, as he cannot cope with emotions, and when he is shut down, he is left in ignorance and confusion. Extraterrestrial intelligence here is not visible in flying saucers or aggressive insect-like life forms, but in a plain structure, and that is all we can understand from it. Maybe it was really something like the monolith that made life on earth start to think in the first place.A rather scientific approach, given the fact that without certain elements originating from asteroids that hit planet earth from outer space, molecular development of life forms on this planet, quite possibly, would not have been possible. We are star children anyway.Of course we cannot understand what is going on as we share Dave's vision in the end. When different matter meet in structured order, Dave experiences his own mortality. How and when he dies is irrelevant. He faces the same power that we witness when physics and biology melt and a planet and a foetus are alike. When we finally see creation as a size- and timeless, truly universal energy, we can only discover that we are still far from being able to understand it. How do you explain God ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It grows on you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've lost count of the number of times I've seen this film. The first time I saw it I felt that it was too slow and overly long, but the more times I watch 2001, the more I enjoy it.I'm only writing this review because 2001 was shown on TCM last night and, as usual, I was unable to resist the temptation to watch it once more even though I knew I had to get up early for work the next day.I feel that 2001 is Kubrick's best work - the visual effects are incredible considering the age of the movie, the soundtrack (which is used sparingly) is fantastic, the atmosphere is unnerving (just like The Shining) and the actors deliver understated performances which help keep the film believable despite the futuristic (for 1968) setting.I believe the film has two flaws .. the first is that HAL, who is allegedly incapable of error, fails to predict that Bowman will be able to shut him down with a minimum of fuss (a few seconds burn from Discovery's engines would have left him stranded outside in the pod), and the second is that the ending isn't sufficiently explained. For a film like this the ending should be explained, if only partially, because it would help the casual viewer - anybody requiring an explanation has to resort to the book, but that's not such a bad thing.If you like your sci-fi with intelligence instead of laser guns, watch 2001.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>few films ever created have the ability to stimulate the senses, the mind, and the emotions simultaneously and completely the way that stanley kubrick's masterpiece can. refering to 2001 as a movie is a bit like calling picasso's "les demoiselles d'avignon" a "picture", or bethoven's ninth symphony a "song". these are works of art that transcend their medium and are too vast in creative genius to be encompassed by classification. the film never fails to transport one to that meditative space of abstract understanding where like a child you are enthrall to the gentle flow of stimuli without the power to sensor the information but rather, absorbing it at an intuitive level. it was once said that mozart was proof that god still spoke to man. 2001 proves that man can speak back to the god.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst movie I've seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I realize this might have been HUGE way back in 1968, but why say "2001"? Why not make it timeless or something? Come on, H.G. Wells was smart enough to set Time Machine further into the future than 24 years later. Other than that, it was way too slow. I ended up fast forwarding it, going two times the usual speed to read the subtitles, though there turned out to be not very much talking. The astronauts even walked in baby steps. Here is my summary of this movie:*MIGHT CONTAIN SPOILERS*We watch half an hour of gorrilas screeching. Then they find a black slab, which leads to more screeching and they take twenty minutes to realize that they can kill. Then we go to space, where we watch spaceships move around very very slowly, so that we know that this is exactly what the future will be like -- whoops, not quite. The people find another black thing on the moon. Then randomly, we see some people on a spaceship that is en route to Jupiter. Alright, whatever. HAL, which consists of red camera lenses planted around the ship, kills everyone except for one person. This one person unplugs HAL, which makes a TV tell him that the black rock on the moon is sending radio beams to Jupiter. The directors put in an intermission to make things go slower.Then we see a black rock float in the solar system, then we see about half an hour of the survivor go through a tunnel of light, and we discover Jupiter is just South Utah, tinted different colors. The survivor lands in a white room. He's older, maybe now he's fifty? Then he sees a seventy year old eating at the table. The seventy year old looks back, the fifty year old is gone. Then he looks at the bed, and there is a horribly old old man there, who looks at the table. He sees a black rock, which turns him into a fetus. The fetus looks at Earth.All of this is about two hours.*END SPOILERS*</fullReview>

The art direction and the special effects in space were stunning for their time. I now own a copy of the film and every now and then I just put it in the VCR and it doesn't matter where it is, I just watch and am blown away by the consummate film-making. Kubrick was a film genius who made great films (Paths Of Glory, 2001) admirable ones (Barry Lyndon) and messes (Eyes Wide Shut, Shining, Lolita). I just showed Paths of Glory to my wife for the first time and man, what an amazing film about war and madness and cowardice amongst officers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The only film in history worth seeing for the special effects alone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... And it ALSO has an intelligent script. Conventional wisdom has it that no film needs both at once.The special effects have never been surpassed. Remember this: unlike their digital counterparts, those gracefully sliding model spaceships look better, the bigger the screen. I gather that Kubrick was still holding out against the digital tide at the very end of his life, insisting on animatronics rather than animation in his unfilmed `AI'. Good for him.There IS one flaw - or at least, it appears to be a flaw at first. It's the lighting. The parts of the spacecraft in shadow ought to have been all but pitch black, since they are never exposed to anything stronger than Earthlight, and sometimes not even that. Instead the shadows are the pale blue ones we'd expect to see at mid-afternoon on Earth. Kubrick surely knew this was a mistake. I suspect he simply wanted a very bright sunlit look that inky shadows precluded: and since we certainly feel the how pitilessly harsh and pure sunlight is in outer space, he probably made the right decision.What else can Kubrick do, apart from design the world's best special effects? He's one of the few people who can use classical music in the score without making a fool of himself; and the only one, so far as I can tell, who can use Ligeti in the score at all. He can deliver moments of pure dispassionate terror. Most important of all in this kind of epic, he can make us feel that we're watching history itself. I admit you may find it next to impossible to work out what happens at the end. Not that it matters. I gather it can be done: and you can always cheat and look up the answer in Arthur C. Clarke's book. You'll probably be glad Kubrick was so elliptical.Did I mention the importance of a big screen? Well, I'll mention it again. Travel to another city, if you have to, in order to see `2001' in a cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, it was one hell of a torture watching this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A torture to the eyes and ears, this "philosophical" sci-fi movie presents you with ideas not well understood by the majority of the population, and it provides you with little explanation because it is one of those movies that wants you to draw your own conclusions, and that is where it goes wrong. And when you have too many people in the world who are ready to make something out of nothing, when in every generation you have this large number of philosophers that ponder pretty much everything "artistic" they see, you have the secret of the success of this movie. And there's another problem, "art". This movie tried being "artistic" in various ways throughout the movie, the first 15 painful minutes of monkeys fooling around, that ~10 minute scene where the guy is floating through space seeing all these colors and experiencing what someone on LSD experiences... it was painful. If a painter shows you his painting and tells you the meaning, you either go "hmm, that's good" or "hmm, that's bad". But when he shows you a painting which he drew while he was on acid, and tells you that there's a meaning behind it and you have to figure it out, you go "hmmmmmmmmmm....." and you can't draw a proper conclusion, and 2001 is just that, a well drawn painting on acid that has a meaning you have to figure out, and that is why it is so successful, you can shape the movie the way you want it to be. It's mysterious, it always has room for a discussion, and if you're into figuring out the hidden meanings of every god-damned thing, you'll love this as well.The effects for the time were amazing, along with the futuristic ideas. Everything from the space station to the video chats and the synthetic food are things we see today, and were things they dreamed in 1968, it takes one hell of a vision to make something like this. The characters were pretty dull. The movie had poor character development, to the point where HAL was much more human than the actual humans. And don't expect much dialogue as well.In conclusion: If you want to see a movie which knows how to deliver ideas properly, which is straightforward with it, and which sacrifices anything artistic for clarity, do not watch it. If, however, you like to ponder a lot, if you like to make meanings out of something, then by all means, watch it.In the end I'd like to say that I regret wasting my time watching this, because it was certainly not worth it. Peace.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No spoilers in case you're interested in seeing what all the fuss is about but have somehow managed to avoid the actual story.I first watched 2001 as a teenager almost 20 years ago, having understood very little, but remember enjoying the (seemingly) sparse show it offered.Couple of years later I got into Arthur C Clarke, starting with the amazing Rendezvous with Rama (how is that not a film yet??) before getting round to 2001. Oh my God, it's full of stars! At this line I understood what that whole psychedelic sequence must've been about, so onward to a 2nd watch forthwith it was. And lo, I now got the film much better. It wasn't quite up there with my absolute favourites (yet), but understood it to be a masterful piece of work.Fast forward 15 years or more to watching it a 3rd time (this huuuge film phase I'm having this year is thanks to procuring a HD-projector...highly recommended!).And ye Gods indeed, it's now my Number 1 favourite film.Older and (probably) wiser, in that 3rd watch there was so much more to appreciate: the use of György Ligeti's otherworldly music is hugely-immersive; the distinct, yet skillfully-linked, nature of each of the 4 parts of the movie feels like a proper opus; the epic presence of the monolith is fantastic, and - when you think about it - the utter vastness of the timeline is sheer incomprehensible. Above all: the film is hugely enjoyable, completely engrossing and beguiles like nothing else I've ever seen. Its ideas are as timeless as the universe itself.As with most Great films, it's also the little things that make an outstanding impression against hugely-ambitious intention: the apes' excitement when realising they can use scattered bones as tools; Floyd seriously cutting the gentlemanly exchange with the Russian group utilising a curt "I'm afraid I can't talk about that"; the hypnotic circular weightless-walking (and running) of crew; the repeating trick of showing HAL's now-iconic red eye.Speaking of iconism: this movie offers an incredible amount of iconic culture. If you watch this for the first time you'll feel like you've already seen it, such is its influence. And for pure open-mouthed awe we don't even have to look at the riveting psychedelic wormhole: HAL's red room scene is the one that stays with us the most.To the 3 most common criticisms this film has: 1) "none of the characters are human/relateable enough, tho' some use this as a theory to posit this was Kubrick's intention, to allow HAL emotional room." I don't buy any of this: Kubrick above all wanted realism: this means he wanted his astronaut and senior scientist characters to mirror the nature of their real counterparts: stoic, calm, formal. And check out Dave's stress levels later on, he's acting human alright. Plus Floyd's wonderfully-light exchange with his daughter is hardly the kind of cold, emotionless quality some amateur critics like to point at 2001.2) "the sequences without dialogue are too long, with nothing happening. Additionally to this: the classical waltz music doesn't fit the space visuals." I can understand this criticism, even if I never had an issue with it myself. I love those long sequences: they're enticing and mysterious, and really pull you into its world. But you either like it or you don't.Regarding the music choices: at first viewing I also felt the more traditional classical music didn't quite fit. But on the 2nd and even more so now on the 3rd watch I really appreciate the wonderful symbiotic waltz of the spacecraft with the, very much earthbound, instruments. It's symbolic and meaningful.3) "the film doesn't make any sense, especially the final section."Again, another criticism which I felt sympathy with after first viewing (and back then not having read the book). I recommend anyone wanting to understand the science fiction aspect of the story to read Clarke's novelisation before watching. On the other hand, Kubrick's films are well known in their individualistic interpretation of source material. You don't have to read the book if you're happy with your own metaphorical interpretation of what you saw....and, as Merlin would say, that's it.This might be my longest review...and it feels like I'm only scratching the surface with what I want to say about this monumental work. The most universally-truthful thing I can say about it is that it's not gonna be for everyone. Some of you may intensely dislike it, while some may struggle to watch it all the through. If you're one of those then it doesn't mean your taste in film is faulty, it just means 2001 isn't for you. And that's fine.For the rest of us, we can only be grateful to have it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying that 2001: A Space Odyssey is one of my favorite movies of all- time. It is directed, co-written, and produced by one of my favorite directors of all-time, Stanley Kubrick, who has directed other masterpieces like Dr. Strangelove, A Clockwork Orange, The Shining, and Full Metal Jacket. 2001: A Space Odyssey, along with a lot of other Kubrick films, is not for everyone. It is slow paced for the most part, has very little dialogue, and has a long runtime. This movie is not for the average movie-goer. If you do decide to watch this movie, you will be treated to: fantastic visual effects, impeccable cinematography, and an interesting story. One things for sure, 2001: A Space Odyssey is a complex film. The film is frequently interpreted differently amongst people. This is especially true with the oh so famous and confusing last 30 minutes of the movie. Whether you end up liking the film or disliking it, you will not forget 2001: A Space Odyssey.</fullReview>

It was the first movie with a realist depiction of space (no sound, hence the music) and people were travelling not in flying saucers but in actual spaceships. BUT, it was slower than a crippled snail and had some annoying music sequences (not the Classical music ones) and an almost non-existent (documentary) chit chat dialogue.

		<shortDescription>Awe Inspiring Work Filled with Discoveries</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie fan at one of the cinematic conferences once spoke up and said that the best idea in a film is not to give any ready made answers but leave everything open to viewers' interpretations. In this case, we are all a part of art that we watch, we admire, we criticize but, foremost, discover. This assumption proves particularly suitable for Stanley Kubrick's 2001 SPACE ODYSSEY inspired by a short story by Arthur C. Clarke.What strikes viewers most about the film are the questions that the theme provokes and answers that we are likely to find in ourselves. But...nothing ready on a platter! Not much is given to us except for thrilling experience of a journey, a titled odyssey. The central theme-ODYSSEY the location-SPACESHIPS/THE UNIVERSE. In that respect, it seems inevitable to quote Roger Ebert who rightly pointed out in his review that Kubrick's genius does not lie in "how much" but "how little." Almost everything is left to us, which makes it a very difficult screen achievement and, simultaneously reflective, such "a philosophical statement about a man's place in the universe" (Ebert).From the first sequence titled "Dawn of Man," we see apes with an obvious aspect of imprisoning our vision within a certain framework. Nevertheless, soon, we discover that these apes begin to think. A sort of Cartesius' "Cogito Ergo Sum" or rather an inner existence that blends with the outer reality. Something driven by some supreme power? While we begin with dawn of man, we don't end with twilight of man. Here, rather, one could quote Steven D Greyfanus who observes that the movie makes a point about our existence and consciousness which are not self explanatory. Questions arise when a black monolith appears: a challenge for the apes...some mystery which will appear more times in the movie. Is it some limitation that emerges from it? Or rather some superior reality to discover only when man drowns in it?Steven D Greyfanus interestingly claims that "2001: A Space Odyssey doesn't just depict a quantum leap forward in human consciousness ? it practically requires such a leap, on an individual scale, from the viewer." The movie is a challenge in itself, a challenge to rise above any ready made concepts of what a movie should be like, what it should look like, what it should evoke but encounter something new, even in the genre itself. To develop this point a bit, Greyfanus goes deeper comparing this odyssey to classical Odyssey by Homer...while in the mythology, the destination is clear, it is home, in the film, it is unknown. For can any man grasp the indefinite reality of the universe and its mystery? Roger Ebert memorably notes: "the film is not about a goal but a quest." The characters are the heroes of this quest. Mind you that many of them, in particular Dr Heywood Floyd (William Sylvester) or Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) in the star sequence are the characters who rely solely on the intellect. In a truly unforgettable 'communication' with the on-board computer HAL 9000, there is, however, an intense desire for meaning, a quest for reasoning, search for answers. At the same time, there appears intense care not to allow any 'violation' of the mission's goals. But...at one point, man breaks a certain limit and goes too far. The realms of technology are going, the realms of human mind are going, what is left if the gravity of mind does no longer occur sufficient? The infinite that goes with Jupiter (not only the name of the planet but, for some reason deliberate or coincidental, the name of the Roman god).At that moment, we may all agree with Roger Ebert who says that it is a "transcendent film" and a "silent film."Primarily, 2001 SPACE ODYSSEY relies on visuals and music. There is not much dialog and if it appears, it is reduced to the maximum minimum, almost to a pseudo computerized interaction. There is not much 'humanity' in the language, not to say feelings. Even the 'Daisy' song or 'Happy birthday' that parents sing to their son seem to lack the basic enthusiasm and result in something artificial, robot-like. Visuals and music! The former is a unique achievement that helps us all experience the film in an unforgettable way. Seeing the movie on the big screen recently, I felt its intense effects to a grand scale. Kudos to cinematographer Geoffrey Unsworth. Music, however, is an even more inspiring aspect.What a terrific choice of CLASSICAL MUSIC! Not only is it an undertone of a unique human ability, but there is another greater undertone to that. Let me quote Roger Ebert again. He observes that any music score would go with conventionalized methods of evoking action and would underline the storyline. "The classical music," however, "exists outside the action." It is an ever present companion of man on his journey to the unknown, on his way to hear deeper, more profoundly. The waltz by Johann Strauss THE BLUE DANUBE seems to evoke a dance in the universe, outside of any gravity and within a greater power. Meanwhile, "Thus Spoke Zarathustra" by Richard Strauss marks the crescendo of emotions within phases of discoveries.The absolutely unpredictable finale brings everything to an uncommon conclusion, after all. You feel as if you have just started to watch this film. Time is not important but far more thought provoking is the fact that this art does not resort to pessimism of nothingness but appears to celebrate, inside us and outside us, the infinite mystery of human life.Prepare for something hard, sometimes vague and very odd, but worth enduring till the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When your lab is as big as the universe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HUGE SPOILERS This isn't a review so much as my explanation of the movie.Something somewhere in the universe is performing experiments in intelligence. The alien something is probably a tool user but that might just be my tool using bias. It/they find a likely candidate species here on Earth and tweak it so it becomes a tool user.Then a marker is placed on the moon. When the species, humans, can build tools advanced enough to reach the moon the marker is tuned on. It points much farther away, to Jupiter. To make the trip to that destination will take the most advanced tools and the most advanced tool users, thus self-selecting the best sample specimens. Astronauts.Upon reaching their destination, the Jupiter monolith, it acts like the tip of a pipette reaching in to a beaker or petri dish. In this case the pipette is a wormhole (or pick your euphemism). Back in the lab its probably only been a few seconds since the initial planet seeding event. What do you do with the monkey once you have him? Well, we give them blocks, ropes, language glyphs, etc to use and food as a reward. You'll notice David is eating.We also give animals mirrors to look at. We seem to consider it a sort of ultimate self-awareness test. Really it's probably just the ability to store enough data about your own physical actions, and compare that to observed external actions, to realize that the creature in the mirror couldn't possibly be another living member of your species. What if you could do better than a mirror? An instantaneous, beam-me-up-Scottie, copy. An electro-clone. Is the creature smart enough to know that this "other" is actually "self". Would that ability be considered a delusion by the experimenter?David is shown a version of himself near death. How does the species understanding of mortality interact with it's "theory of other". How does that interact with the knowledge that this other is self?The final image is a metaphor; The human species is a foetus waiting to be born into the larger cosmos.To be sure we think of all of the above as science-fiction rather than fantasy or techno-fable, like Flash Gordon, the non-omnipotence of the experimenting intelligence is shown by it's flawed creation. Humans. The humans build flawed intelligence in the form of HAL, which malfunctions. (Who malfunctions?). Thus keeping godhead the always receding point just beyond the accumulations of science.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This definitely requires more than one viewing. 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) not only boasts some of the most stunning cinematography and timeless special effects on film, but it has a story with so many layers that a revisit or two is mandatory if you even want to begin to understand it. The ending alone has been baffling people for over forty-five years. Another hundred could pass and there will still be discussions about this film.Just do yourself a favor, relax, and watch this. Don't expect lots of action or dialogue, or the sort of roller-coaster rides that science fiction movies have become. This is a film you are meant to reflect on and mull over in your mind hours afterward. It's not for everybody, but for those who are willing to go for something a bit more thoughtful, give it a whirl. The two hours and forty minutes are worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unprecedented, Unique &amp; Unparalleled Achievement In Motion Picture History.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An unprecedented, unique &amp; unparalleled achievement in motion picture history, 2001: A Space Odyssey is a path-breaking cinema &amp; a splendid work of art that truly put science in science-fiction. Far ahead of its time &amp; one of the first films to take its genre seriously, this film redefines its genre unlike anything before or after it, features some of the most iconic moments ever captured on film, and is an elegant mix of remarkable cinematography, pioneering visual &amp; sound effects, scientific accuracy, epic score &amp; a distinct style of narration.2001: A Space Odyssey deals with the elements of human evolution, technology, artificial intelligence &amp; extra-terrestrial life. It is divided into 3 segments &amp; an epilogue, each connected with an extra-terrestrial reference. Kubrick's first venture into the science fiction genre features all his usual trademarks but its treatment is very different from his other works. The pace is intentionally slowed down, the narration is through visuals &amp; music, the exchange of dialogues is minimal and the engaging &amp; confusing plot only gets better, more transparent &amp; satisfying on multiple viewings.Coming to technical aspects, the cinematography is a delight for anyone who appreciates great photography. Editing is precisely done. Set pieces are wonderful to look at and the visual &amp; sound effects are so groundbreaking &amp; ahead of its time that many movies boasting CGI stuff today are still no match to it. Also, it is one of the most accurate depictions of space travel &amp; the silence that fills the space scenes not only serves its purpose as accurate science, but also adds to the mood of the film. Plus, the fact that Kubrick shot the moon scenes with that level of detail &amp; accuracy even before the Apollo landing never fails to impress.Even though 2001 is a visual ride of astonishing beauty, it isn't a movie that everyone is going to appreciate. It's a long technical film that runs at an unusually slow pace, is full of metaphysical complexities &amp; is destined to polarize viewers. Yet, there's no denying that it has inspired almost every film of its genre since its release &amp; will continue to do so for as long as cinema exists. It's an amazing journey through space &amp; time that raises pretty good questions about our very own existence, is full of philosophical &amp; allegorical meanings, and concludes with an ending that is open for each viewer to interpret his/her way.Scoring full marks in all aspects of filmmaking and influencing not only cinema but science, culture &amp; art as well, 2001: A Space Odyssey is a landmark moment in motion picture history that nearly killed its genre for it set a standard so high that it hasn't been equaled or challenged ever since. Universally &amp; unanimously hailed as one of the greatest &amp; most influential films ever made, it is the best work by the master filmmaker who made a career out of crafting one masterpiece after another. Highly recommended. Multiple viewings advised.Full review at: cinemaclown.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's incredible how this movie is so overrated. Maybe because some people don't want to hear that "they didn't get" what the movie tries to say, or because it's a Stanley Kubrick film and no one can talk bad about his pictures. Actually, it's because of that i'm writing this,I don't usually write reviews for movies, but for this one I had to do. I went watching the movie thinking that it would be awesome, everybody say it's incredible, and because i loved the amazing films by the great Stanley Kubrick. But this one is really weak, it is not as nearly as entertaining, there's some pretty images and an interesting soundtrack, there's a nice story with HAL, but there's no plot, there's no character development and there are a bunch of pointless scenes that you want just to turn of the TV and go to sleep. I gotta say that there is a nice "tension" along the whole movie, i watched it always expecting that something would happen, and the soundtrack is good because it contributes to that, but nothing happens during two hours and a half. There are too much boring parts, 15 minutes of monkeys and an uncountable number of minutes with ships landing. However I still recommend this movie, because somehow it became a classic, and if you're gonna hate something you got to know why, but if you're gonna watch it have two things in mind: 1-Forget it's a Stanley Kubrick film. 2- Forget what other people say about it. This two facts will affect your judgement of the movie, and if you're gonna say you liked, you also got to know why, and because everybody says "it's art" is not a good reason, actually is not a reason at all. Really, I would rate this movie like a 4 or 5, but I gave 1 because i think it's grade need to be lowered, it can't be compared to the other Kubrick's great works.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One thing is certain, watching this movie is tough. There is SO much going on, so many things easily over looked. It's easy to see why so many dislike it and/or don't understand it. It's not so easy to see why anyone idolizes it, but I can. It contains some pretty amazing stuff. I completely agree with what one review said about saying that had I not known what year this movie was made, I would have not guessed correctly. My guess would have been along the lines of late 70's to early 80's, which alone says something about the movie. It definitely make you think as well.Negatives? Soundtrack is repetitive as hell. If anyone denies that then they're just lying. It gets annoying and takes some enjoyment out of the film. Some scenes ARE too dragged out. I'm not in any hurry when it comes to movies, but good lord. The final scenes.....whew....they will be talked about till the end of time, and for good reason. This was one of the unreasonably long scenes. It was almost torture. Maybe that's the way Kubrick meant to portray it, idk. I joked saying that the character in the movie was probably praying for death, and that the wrinkles were probably a result of unheard of boredom. The perfect word is "assault". The final scene is a relentless assault, and although amazing, it's excruciating at the same time. This movie is a remarkable thing, but I'm not sold on how great of a movie it is. It just doesn't have a lot of substance. People will disagree and say I just don't understand it, but it just drags...period.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say I found this very dull and boring and I did zap through at least a third of the movie to keep myself awake. The only reason I give it a half decent rating is for the special effects (must have been amazing to 1968 audiences) and the cinematography. The story is non existent and the acting nothing special.It was impossible to feel any attachment or empathy for the characters as everything is so clinical and cold. Maybe that was Kubrick's intention and if so then hey he succeeded with me at any rate. The HAL storyline could have been even better but at least there was some semblance of a story to that bit. The rest no way.Like at least one other reviewer said already on here this is for hard core SCI FI / Kubrick buffs only.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is Greatness--in movies, over time, from here?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)It seems foolish to write a review of such a widely, and probingly, reviewed film--there are whole books on it, including Arthur C. Clarke's own The Lost Worlds of 2001, and the movie is detailed beautifully on Wikipedia. In short, the movie is so unafraid to touch on the biggest of issues, and to do so without conventional religion, it's totally brave and gripping. It is also technically astonishing--the upside down stewardess, the music, the future and the past so compatible. If you can slow yourself down and just get absorbed, this is a true original, and a really beautiful one.In a fun way, 2001 is a personality sorter. There are those who love to wallow in meaning of life enigmas, and others who want to enjoy life and laugh and cry. I oversimplify to make a point. For those who want to be whisked away on a mind trip without a drop of action- adventure, and end with an LSD-style interior apocalypse, this is the movie of choice. If you require an actual plot, with a conflict between actual humans (and not just a droning computer antagonist), then hesitate.So, if it's a great movie for me, is it completely overrated to someone else? And can I get that? Well, yes, I can see how it might bore someone completely. Completely. So for my kind of personality, it must connect to something else that really matters. I saw it in the theater when I was ten, in 1968, and it gloriously shook me up, maybe even changed my life. I am sure I was already a good agnostic (a ten year old agnostic being what it is) and so the ambiguity about the meaning of the universe in 2001 was awfully disturbing. It both confirmed the impossibility of knowing anything beyond our own world, and it made me love the beauty of every moment that we have, now, while it's here. Whether it helped form an impressionable boy or just paralleled his inner nature, I can't say. So I loved it, and love it. The movie is elegant, dreamy, spacey (yeah), and trippy. It can't be watched indifferently, but unlike a shocking movie, this demands not a reaction but an immersion. That's me. I like to wallow.A good friend who loves many of the movies I do hates 2001, along with Pauline Kael (who gets hung up on the evolution/reincarnation issue) and other smart, open-minded, movie-loving reviewers. Such is the status of 2001. But my friend, as deep as he is, is a social person, and he loves human interaction and plot much more than philosophical excess. Why would he like the simple nothingness of this movie, which is nearly a silent movie from start to finish? What, beyond individual taste, in some broader, universal way, makes a great movie? The absence of a few terrible reactions. The presence of astonishing ones? Is greatness in art, music, literature--any creative work simultaneously held high as a shining example and held down for critical analysis--always relative? It doesn't seem like it. Some movies really are better, otherwise, what are we to make of 100 best film lists, or film studies programs devoted to Kane and Potemikin and The Godfather? The brilliant, innovative, risk-taking minds and bodies who poured themselves into 2001 really did have some edge on the less brilliant, less innovate people involved in other films, whatever they are. I'm not talking money here, or even expected creativity--that weird quality of knowing what pretends to be creative and achieving the look, but not the essence of originality. There are qualities that can be circled in a great movie: 1) something never remotely seen before, 2) something taken to the far edge of beauty, and 3) something that has resolution, a term we use in art school for work that seems to know what it wants to do and achieves it, regardless of whether you like it or not. A movie is great for me in more personal ways, but I'm asking universally--what makes a movie simply "great." I suppose this is stupid, and it's definitely long-winded.And rules are bogus, but maybe these are starting points. It's certainly easy to see what is not successful in this movie, in ordinary terms--the acting is generally atrocious (except the apes, of course), though this might be on purpose. Even the casting is questionable. I've never liked Keir Dullea in his role as the protagonist. This might be Kubrick's little bit of intuitive genius here, because he's picked an actor who has less life than the computer, and he does not undermine the movie even as he is overwhelmed by it. His acting is stretched into the mechanical, underplayed zone as a counterpart to HAL's emotive cunning. As a creative director looking to push movies artistically, Kubrick goes two steps beyond his own epic and stiff Spartacus in a decade when the American movie scene was rediscovering a new humanism and realism through directors like Penn (Bonnie and Clyde, 1967) and Peckinpah (The Wild Bunch, 1968), and actor/director Dennis Hopper (Easy Rider, 1969). It stands apart from these, an evolutionary dead end on its own terms, but hugely influential in terms of vision and technique.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another big screen marvel,utterly lost on small screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always appreciated the visual marvels of this movie. The images are powerful and lasting,and the usage of classical music to add awe to the effects of mankind's venture into space was a very smart decision on the part of Stanley Kubrick and the editors of the film. HAving said that,I can think of far more engaging stories that have been committed to celluloid.The film,an adaptation of Arthur C.Clarke's 1963 bestseller,is probably best summed as a study in contrasts: the first,a dry look at the beginnings of man on Earth,learning to tame nature and each other,the second,mankind's utilization of technology and it's betray of man. The problems to me with this film are probably as much its most distinctive traits: namely,the pacing is glacially slow,there is precious little dialog and the visual image effects are drawn out to the point of tedium. If you are straining your ears for some sort of plot resolution or denouement from the characters involved,or seeking a central point of focus in this movie,you will be sorely disappointed. Having said that,this film is far better viewed on a large screen or an IMAX,because this film's qualities seem to befit a medium that allows for a sense of awe or wonder. Seeing this on a small screen broadcast or on VHS almost completely dilutes the experience. To true film fans,this film is AT LEAST worth a look or two. But I'd be lying if I said that this film was a very ingratiating film view</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's about evolution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The theme of 2001, which eludes so many of the reviewers here, is the interplay between science, technology, and evolution. The monolith is a stand-in for any scientific mystery, the chance discovery that makes us (humans) realize we're nowhere near figuring everything out. The mystery inspires us to explore, to look at our surroundings differently, to see usefulness in things we hadn't noticed before. As we create new tools, we must also develop morally to ensure that the tools do not destroy us. By mastering new tools, humankind is in effect reborn as something it could never have imagined.Reading the book to understand the film is a huge mistake. Clarke became obsessed with providing literal explanations for the metaphors ("look! aliens!") and in doing so lost the focus. Watching the follow-up 2010, which is based on the book rather than the film, is also a mistake. (To his shame, Clarke produced two more novels to squeeze money out of the brand without adding any substance.)I don't accept Clarke's after-the-fact explanation of what happened to HAL (i.e. he was instructed to lie). HAL was created with all the knowledge and reasoning capacity of a human, but without the accompanying morality. When he started to malfunction, it was his refusal to accept his own fallibility that made him dangerous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film for introspective, silent audiences</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A most arresting moment in this film occurs at the jump-cut from the floating bone to the floating satellite. It is the type of powerful juxtaposition that can be done only in the motion pictures.For me, watching 2001 is similar to holding your breath and trying to observe yourself in relation to your world.I think one message of the movie is that human ego, due to the lack of foresight, has been developed prematurely.This film, made with such deliberateness and precision, tries not to opine explicitly anything about humans or the rest of the universe. It is an inert presentation laid out continuously enough to inspire the human imagination to tell a story easily, but sparsely enough to allow many stories to be told, consistent with the images and sounds. I think this is the spirit of the scientific method: what story fits the observations? No matter how clever a particular story may be, however, sometimes the most honest statement one can say about a mystery is the statement of the mystery itself.I think, many aspects of this movie, including the 'plot', editing, and...the ineffable style, are original to this day. Also I am beginning to think that, unfortunately, '2001: A Space Oyssesy' is the only science-fiction film; other movies are at most ordinary dramas with science fiction elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I didn't like it, but I still watch it when it's on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's one of those movies that when I'm asked about it I say, "I thought it was kind of slow and boring". For some reason, when I found out that it was being broadcast commercial free and in letterbox format, I just had to see it. Even as I'm typing this I'm watching the "beyond the infinite" part and found myself doing other chores during the first hour of the film. I've read other reviews that have proclaimed this the greatest science fiction film ever made and nothing will ever come close. It makes me sad to read this because that means that only a handful of people can enjoy science fiction and I believe that this is not true. Arthur C. Clarke has said that even he doesn't know the definition of "science fiction", but I believe that a movie using the aid of computers, like Starship Troopers, is fine science fiction. For some reason, part of the reason that this film is so highly praised is because of its beautiful filmaking and that is something I can agree with on some level. There were times that I was asking myself, "How did he do that?" But this couldn't convince me to announce my worship to Stanley Kubrick like so many others have done. I enjoy a mysterious movie that raises more questions than answers, but unfortunately I don't enjoy the ongoing search for themes and plots.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wish I could appreciate this movie as much as most film buffs seem to. I do admire some of its imagery--the cut between the bone and the space vehicle, the star child, etc. The use of music is very effective. And I suppose some of the special effects were impressive at the time. But from the standpoint of storytelling, 2001 really leaves me cold.(1) The pace, at times. . .actually the whole time. . .is excruciatingly slow. This includes several endless minutes of ugly and gratuitous special effects that start immediately after going into the monolith near Jupiter. When people talk about the the movie's technical superiority, they never seem to mention this part. I guess I don't mind a movie taking its time to get to a good payoff, but this crawling progression is ridiculous. Additionally, no payoff ever really comes, which leads to my next complaint.. .(2) I don't care for the way the film fails to explain itself. I truly defy anybody to understand what the monoliths are, or what happens in the end, without having read the novel. I read the book several years after first seeing the movie, and was filled with much more wonder by it. If Clarke did not mind revealing what his story meant, why did Kubrick have to be so stubborn in making it all so mysterious? It's one thing to be ambiguous or suggestive. It's another to make no sense at all.(3) There are no characters that can be identified with. While others say this is part of the film's genius, I heartily disagree. The expressionless humans are actually more creepy than HAL.I met an aspiring director once who told me he thought 2001 was the best movie ever made. When I asked him to explain why, one thing he mentioned was that it was great to watch in the 70s with a room full of people who were stoned. Maybe I was born too late.</fullReview>

As far as the vagueness of the ending (meaning the last half-hour) is concerned, those who want concrete answers in a movie with this kind of theme should: 1) use their imagination, 2) watch an Agatha Christie film instead, in which neat explanations are provided for everything, and 3) go back to watching "Friends", Ben Affleck's movies, or Zemeckis's pathetic "Contact", that pitiful little "imitation" of this classic.This is not a movie for morons. So if you're a moron - and you know you're a moron - just stay away from this piece of celluloid greatness, because, honestly, it will just confuse your tiny little mind.The problem is that many morons, apparently, watched this movie, then decided to criticize its pace and story.

What it TOTALLY means is anyone's guess, but the film is filled with enough iconic images that you'll recognize anywhere from Polaris to The Simpsons (actually, the Simpsons uses a LOT of Kubrick references). Essentially, a trip through mankind, from cavemen to the then future (skipping out everything in between) 2001 treats us to a visionary and audio spectacle that's really hard to compare to anything else. I mean, the plot can go a million ways.. Is this about the beginning of man conquering inventions and the end, when the inventions conquer man (or at least attempt to?) Is it about God's work and how he controls our destiny? (enter black monolith here?) or is it just one big psychedelic fantasy?Dare I say all of the above?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nobody could have done it better than Kubrick. The question is, "What does 'it' mean?" I'll skip the story, what there is of it. Anyone who wants a reasonably decent explanation in coherent terms ought to consult the Film Guide series from Indiana University Press.It is an unforgettable movie that would not have had quite the same impact if it had been made more than one or two years, one way or the other, of 1968.Just take one instance. The computer, Hal, the most interesting character in the film, goes berserk. He signals to the two astronauts that there is a failure that must be fixed from the outside. The astronauts leave the space ship in tiny round pods. While they are gone, Hal kills all the other astronauts who are in hibernation for the long trip to Jupiter. Hal also causes a pod to kill one of the external astronauts and then refuses entry to the remaining live one, Dave (Keir Dullea).Dullea orders repeatedly, "Open the pod bay doors, Hal." His expression is one of vexation, as if he's having a duel of wits with a recalcitrant garage door. Finally he blasts his way into the space ship, barely surviving, then sets about destroying Hal. As he climbs a ladder to enter Hal's brain, Hal remarks soothingly, "Dave -- I can see your really upset about this." It's EXACTLY what Carl Rogers would have said. Hal begins to sound like a junior executive being fired. "I know I've made some bad decisions recently. But I can assure you that I am back to normal now. Really, I am devoted to the success of this mission" If that's supposed to be a joke, it must have worked in 1968, when we were all in the business of seeing (or being) humanistic shrinks. I'm not sure that everybody would find the humor in such a line now, in 2005, a year in which most of the USA seems to find itself adrift on Jupiter.That "star gate" episode -- wow! The coeval audience had a heck of a good time seeing it while stoned. Vavoom -- through an unknown universe! Into the Maelstrom. It must have been great if you'd been smoking grass. If you were tripping it might have become one of Edgar Allan Poe's worst hangovers. Just seeing it tonight took me back thirty years or so to when I was a research assistant at the New Jersey Neuropsychiatric Institute, engaged in a study of psychedelic drug use. It was perfectly legitimate, run by the psychiatrist who coined the term "psychedelic" and visited Aldous Huxley on his death bed, and endorsed by a former Attorney General of the United States. (By the way, has the statute of limitations run out?) We were not supposed to use drugs but one night circumstances demanded it and the next thing I knew I was wandering around a part of Manhattan I was completely unfamiliar with, the East 70s, never having gotten north of 14th Street in my youth. And -- wow -- everything was just terrible. People were walking dogs along the sidewalks and I fancied the dogs were staring at me because they knew I was a complete wreck. Well, let's skip it, except to say that what you need in a paranoid state is not the trip that Kubrick gives you, but a handle on reality. Well, I'm not sure, really. Sometimes I feel spaced out here in New Mexico where the Ice Cream trucks play "La Cucaracha." In the New Jersey neighborhood where I grew up they at least had the prescience to play the "Dies Irae."Anyway, one of the most impressive features of the film is the special effects -- all done in the 1960s before computers. They are all mechanical or photographic. No computerized graphic images like the dinosaurs in "Jurassic Park" or the musclebound monsters that leap around on today's screen. If you see a space ship in "2001", it was hand built. The FX are the pinnacle of pre-computerized FX. They're like the clipper ships of the 1850s, marvels of marine engineering, about as good as it gets, before they were replaced by steamships.I realize this is not much of a review of the movie itself, but without having looked, I imagine there must be a hundred or more so, really, why bother? Kubrick was an interesting guy. According to Kirk Douglas's revealing (and not very flattering) autobiography, "Rag Man's Son," Kubrick shot "Spartacus" which had been written by someone on the McCarthy-style blacklist and forbidden to work in the USA. A heated discussion arose about who exactly should get the writing credit, since the actual writer's name couldn't be used. How could justice best be served. Kubrick piped up and said if you want a writer's name, use mine. I'll take the credit. As Douglas put it, "Kubrick was a talented s***."But -- all of that period and personal detail aside -- this film is a magnificent artifact. What an artist Kubrik was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stanley Kubrick's vision of the future!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) is a breath taking look at a possible future through the eyes of Arthur C. Clarke and under the direction of Stanley Kubrick. The movie itself is more of a visual work of art than anything else. All of Kubrick's future (no pun intended) trademarks can be found in this film (cold sterile sets and the Kubrick "stare" to name a few). The two made an awesome team. A shame that they never worked with each other again. Imagine the possibilities.The movie follows the stages of man's evolution under the watchful of the ominous monolith. Who or what exactly the monolith is or what it represents is up to the viewer to decide. I have an opinion but I'll keep it to myself. Beginning with the dawn of man and civilization, the evolved simian and to the year 2001. Man has reached the stars but will they enjoy what they discover? From Earth to the Moon to Jupiter, man has traveled hither and yonder. But they still don't grasp the basic understanding of life in general and it's continued evolution Does the discovery of the monolith on the moon have anything to do with it? Will Dr. Heywood Floyd and his men learn the meaning of it? What about Dave Bowman and his crew that orbit Jupiter? You'll have to find out when you watch this classic science fiction flick.I enjoyed this movie ever since I was a child. I have never seen anything like this before. The visuals and the music are extremely haunting. Kubrick has made a masterpiece (only to be topped by his brilliant film Barry Lyndon). A cinematic enigma that's has so many possibilities.Followed a few years later with a direct sequel. Not as brilliant as this one but satisfactory for die hard fans of the novels.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey is a terrific film and is one of the greatest! There is so much to this film that there is to much to explain! All of the people in this film are very good. The beginning is a one of the most unique introductions ever in a film in My opinion. The Apes all looked real and the behavior and characteristics were good. The mystery that surrounds everything is fantastic. Hal is really a baddie and I just love the horror and spookiness in some scenes. The special effects are simply beautiful and is arguably the greatest and most realistic looking ever in cinema history! The music is fabulous! Though some of the things in the movie maybe easy to figure out I for one have not figured out everything in this movie. Anyone looking for a superb science fiction mystery then I strongly recommend 2001: A Space Odyssey!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I can't see why this film is so highly-regarded.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest, since I grew up with Sci-Fi flicks like "Star Wars", "Aliens", and the various "Star Trek" series and movies, I'm afraid I can't say how impressive the special effects were for 1968. That said, I also can't see what the freakin' big deal is with this movie!It's extremely slow, the majestic movements through space really don't add anything, the dialogue is extremely bland, and the "trip"......I guess it's one of those "You Had To Be There" moments, in this case, 1968.The only real noteworthy part of this should be HAL, which emphasized reliance on computers and what happens when one goes rogue, ironically but blindly foreshadowing such things as the defused Y2K problem. But aside from that, this movie is a big artistic dud for me. The only reason I'd recommend it is to see it's sequel, "2010", which makes a lot more sense, is more entertaining, and answers SOME of the questions left by 2001.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"2001" remains probably the best science fiction movie ever made. It is one of the few movies around that makes you think, and was made not with the intent of giving the audience any answers, but in asking them questions.I would agree that reading Arthur C. Clarke's book version (which isn't just a novelization of the movie but was written parallel to the movie; for instance, in the movie the astronauts go to Jupiter but in the book they go to Saturn) is very useful in understanding what happens in this movie. SPOILERS-------The premise is very simple. Alien beings have decided to assist in and then monitor human evolution. The ape men at the beginning of the movie are vegaterians, going hungry not realizing that they can eat the animals what wander around their camp. They cannot defend themselves against predators or even against a rival clan that drives them away from their watering hole. The Obelisk appears and the Obelisk teaches the ape men how to start using tools. Armed with this knowledge, the ape men now become carnivores and start eating the abundant animals and then use their superior weaponry to drive off the rival clan and reclaim the pool of water----and note that one of the astronauts in the latter part of the movie is "Frank Poole."The movie then cuts to the future and scientists have found another Obelisk deliberately buried on the Moon by the aliens. When sunlight hits the Obelisk, it sends out a signal towards Jupiter. The signal is a beacon to the aliens who now know that humanity has progressed enough to go to the Moon and dig up the Obelisk. En route to the Moon the astronauts have to deal with their supercomputer, HAL 9000. HAL is supposedly incapable of error and yet makes a mistake which will jeopardize the mission. Unable to trust HAL to run the ship anymore, the astronauts have to turn off his higher functions. HAL discovers the plot though and murders all but one of the astronauts. The surviving astronaut is able to defeat HAL by turning off his higher functions----hitting him on the head if you will, just as the ape man in the beginning of the movie defeated his opponent by hitting him on the head.The ship arrives at Jupiter to find another Obelisk orbiting the planet. The astronaut lands a craft on the Obelisk and is whisked away through some sort of wormhole or time warp until he is taken captive, if you will, by the aliens. He lives out the remainder of his life in this new place (or his life is accellerated by the aliens) and at his death the Obelisk appears again, this time to transform the astronaut into a super-being, the Starchild, who has nearly an infinite intellect and thus little need for a body, the final stage of human evolution.This is certainly not a movie that anyone can immediately understand after the first viewing or even after multiple viewings. Perhaps others will disagree with me about what the movie's plot is or what the movie ultimately means. The dangers of technology permeate the movie as well---the ape man's primitive technology is used to destroy his enemy but in the future man's technology has developed a mind of its own and decides to destroy Man to save itself (the same premise used in "The Terminator" series).Yes, the movie probably could've dispensed with a lot of the psychedelic stuff at the end (essentially the same sort of time warp/wormhole travel that is used in the movie "Contact" and probably to better and more understandable effect). I thought that the acting left something to be desired; none of the actors were well-known to American audiences and none of them went on to have notable careers--but I don't think the movie would've been all that much better had some superstar of the day, say Charlton Heston, played the astronaut's role. In the end, it is a movie that demands that the viewer think about what is happening and think about it for a long time afterwards. There aren't many movies that did that then, or do that now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>True, this film has a very low amount of dialogue. But does a film absolutely NEEDS dialogue to be comprehended ? This timeless evolution proves that it obviously doesn't.From the very first lights of the blinding sun, the birth of life, to the lashing last moments of man's quest for the truth regarding his presence on earth, this film spans through time and space in a visual, musical and existentialistic trip that astonished me to the core of my being...The music, a pure example of the artistic evolution of man's quest for communication, is a quintessential element to the illustriousness of this motion picture. It affects the viewer and story by creating an awe for all who experience this majestic voyage, a rich metaphorical component to the eternal quest for human knowledge.This is, aside from Tarkovsky's spellbinding film Solaris, one of the most powerful example of art versus science... The impact the film has had on our modern society can be both unclear and quite obvious... The pursuit for the unknown and to surpass our own past achievements trough a spector of light and exploration. Creation of a space station, an expansion of our own world to correct our past mistakes... Wow........</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hopeful vision for the future of Humanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film more than any other I have ever watched, has left an indelible impression upon my soul. Everything about '2001:A Space Odyssey', from every tiny nuance of realistic detail, to the overall sweepingly majestic epic wonder of the whole, holds endless fascination and emotion for me. A true masterpiece of pacing and plot development (yes there is one!), perhaps only a visionary of cinema, that Stanley Kubrick undoubtedly was (R.I.P. much missed Droogie), could have done justice to the grandeur of Arthur C. Clarke's novel. The entire film unfolds slowly like an archetypal dream; lucid, intensely emotional, at times overwhelmingly so (this film has brought tears of wonderment to my eyes many times), and of course utterly perplexing. Although the character development is left to a minimum, I think this is what makes the story so compelling. The human drama, as real as it is from the point of view of the various protagonists, is merely a backdrop against which is set the slow contemplation of Humanity's place in the Cosmic Scheme. Personally I see in the character of HAL the embodiment of human reason and its ultimately fallable attempts to fathom the unknown depths of reality. We make the assumption that the world is ultimately rational, but perhaps this is not so, and our little islands of certainty are merely transient truths, that are but insignificant dim reflections of a greater Reality. The rebirth as a StarChild to my mind represents the next stage of human evolution, necessary for us to fully comprehend both ourselves and the Universe. The use of 'Also Sprach Zarathustra' as the main theme music, complements perfectly the Nietzchian idea that humanity is but a bridge between animal and beyond human.Highly recommended for anyone, whether you like science-fiction movies or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The evolution of mankind, according to Clarke and Kubrick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a young married man in 1968. My wife and I saw this movie in the theater. I remember it well, as it ended we looked at each other, and one of us said, "We must have missed something." So we sat there, didn't move out of our seats, and watched it a second time. We still didn't "get it." I suspect a lot of theater-goers in 1968/1969 didn't "get" this movie.Now I was able to see it again, thanks to the recently-released 10 DVD set of Kubrick films. I have the set on loan from my public library. Maybe just because I am older, have lived a lot, it all seems much clearer now.The movie starts in prehistoric times when the most intelligent animals are black, hairy, and ape-like. They are meek, huddle together for comfort, and forage for food. One day they awake to find a black monolith in their midst, they crowd around it, they touch it, and soon after they "evolve", they learn to use bones as tools and clubs, they fight, they eat what they kill. These apes have become early man, by virtue of their encounter with the black monolith.Is it a supreme being, God? Or is it a far advanced race of intelligent life that provided the monolith and its spark of evolution? I suppose the answer depends on whether one is a theist or an atheist.Then, what many call the longest "fast-forward" in the history of film, the story advances to about the year 1999, and we join a space plane on its trip to a base on the moon. It seems modern instruments have detected an unusual magnetic field and they find buried 40 feet below the surface a black monolith, apparently just like the one the apes encountered millions of years earlier. The monolith is sending a strong signal towards the planet Jupiter.So this 1999 encounter with a monolith must be considered to spark the next evolutionary step, and 18 months later we join a mission to Jupiter, five astronauts, three in a "hibernation" mode. They are led by Keir Dullea as Dr. Dave Bowman and with a state of the art, thinking and reasoning computer, the HAL 9000. There isn't much dialog in the whole movie and the most memorable is between Dave and HAL.Finally, as Dave is the only survivor of the mission, there is yet another monolith, in orbit around Jupiter. Dave's encounter with it results in a 10-minute light and special effects show on film, representing his encounter, where he is placed into an environment designed to mimic home, much like we humans capture zoo animals and put them in a habitat that mimics their natural environment. After some accelerated aging, Dave is re-born as a type of star child that represents the next evolution of mankind, and as the movie ends is being sent back to Earth, ostensibly to preserve it from destruction by Earth's own inhabitants.The DVD has an interesting special feature which is commentary by the two main actors, and their insights are very interesting. One thing they mention, it was filmed in 1965 and 1966.Good movie. Even though many scenes are slow and very drawn out, in all it didn't seem as long as its running time would suggest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BORING. The effects were amazing for the era, but the film itself is too drawn out and boring. Too many scenes with only music. Too many unnecessary scenes that stray from the story. I think it could have been edited into a more efficient and equally stunning 90 or 100 minute piece.I admit I'm not an avid Kubrick fan, and maybe if I were more biased, I would've watched this with more intrigue. I've only seen The Shining, A Clockwork Orange, Full Metal Jacket, and Eyes Wide Shut. None of those lagged; all kept my attention and felt like worthwhile cinema.I just do not have the patience for movies like this, and I'm sure I'm missing out on a lot, but I watch movies that either make me laugh, make me think, make me smile, or make me cry. Not put me to sleep with classical music and drawn out scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Voice of HAL a performance unto itself...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Stanley Kubrick gave little indication of his film-making prowess in his prior, early films, which makes "2001" a stunning achievement on a filmmaker's level. One cannot comprehend how he managed to get his complex work on the screen without interference. However, this voyage about two astronauts battling a computer of their own making is an abstract, psychedelic head trip that is fairly somnolent until the final-act light show. You cannot doubt Kubrick's mastery of the cinema, but just how "deep" this film is depends on your patience and point of reference. Certainly it is stunning visually, with terrific cinematography from Geoffrey Unsworth and John Alcott. Douglas Rain's voice-work as the computer HAL is a triumph; roles for the human actors are filled adequately (they're cast for their dullness--intentionally I presume--yet one does eventually tire of them). Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke adapted Clarke's book "The Sentinel", punching up the proceedings with classical music that really put a pop-art stamp on these legendary pieces. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the cinema achieves its final goal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hegel once said, of course I'm simplifying, that the final goal of art was to be able to express itself using only the means that define it. Therefore, painting had to express itself with colors and shapes, dancing with the movement of the body, music with sounds, etc. Nevertheless, painting was in Hegel's time far away from its final goal because what it did was just to tell a story in a paintings, it was just a variation of literature. Nowadays, it is the same thing with cinema which in Hegel's point of view, has to express itself with movement (because cinema is the art of the moving image, of course), and it is far, far, far away. But from time to time, it comes close from this final pourpose, and it is what happens in this superbe movie in the moments where the story stops and we just see images of a stunning beauty and poetry, particularly when we see the lunar base from the outside or when the astronaut is travelling through time and space and the images become really a symphony of movement and colours that speak for itself without coming near to telling you a story. What I am trying to say in my lousy English is that 2001 reaches a point never achieved before nor afterwards, to my knowledge. It becomes cinema in his more complete, pure and absolute way. Not a variation of literature, but the art of the moving image. Kubrick makes cinema come near to what it is supposed to be in its more evolved way, he becomes a sort of Kandinsky or Mondrian of the filmaking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Trip of the Imagination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After 30 plus year, 2001: A Space Odyssey still continues to amaze and astound. The art of film making has made long strides since Kubrick's masterpiece, but it still stands the test of time. Influencing countless directors from George Lucas to Steven Spielberg, 2001 is definitely the jewel of Stanley Kubrick's career.In 2 ? hours, the film is able to span from the dawn of man to the space age. Watched and influence by the mysterious monolith, man is able to used tools to manipulate his environment and also kill. There is possibly no greater juxtaposition of images than from the thrown bone to the orbiting satellite. In a few brief seconds, we are able to see how man has gone from cave-dweller to space-dweller. It is also hard to forget the masterful scene of the space ship floating to the "Blue Danube Waltz." This is perhaps no greater use of images and score in the history of film. The sequence is just a marvel to look and stirs up emotions of wonder, marvel, and pure excitement. The film then jumps 18 months to the future where a larger than life ship is on an interception course for Jupiter. The "Discovery" is perhaps Kubrick's greatest accomplishment. The meticulous detail is scene on the ship and the attention to its detail allows it to be as grand as anything that is in film today. There are also great scenes in this ship including the rotating living quarters and the classic death scene of HAL in the red brain room of the computer. The last 20 or so minutes of this film are one of its mysteries. The star show followed by the eerie hotel scene followed by the "space baby" turn off a lot of viewers, because they are seemingly incomprehensible. Whatever the explanations are, one has to admire the imagination it required to create that endingThere are a lot of detractors to this film saying it is to slow, there is not enough dialogue, and the ending is confusing. It is true that this film is different from other movies, but that is one of its strong points. Kubrick took risks with this movie at that is why is often considered one of the best movies of all time. People should not worry about the plot to much, because this movie is all about visuals and the sheer wonder of the unknown. All you have to do is sit back and enjoy the ride.</fullReview>

And I wasn't anticipating action, but when you're watching a man running in a circle in space shuttle for 15 minutes it makes you wanna throw your remote in a director's head.

		<fullReview>Sure, the special effects of this movie were pretty good, even in the year 1968, but c'mon, what else is there to give it praise for? The movie was overlong, boring and made absolutely no sense. I didn't find myself caring for any of the characters, it was horribly directed by Stanley Kubrik and was a poor execution. Call me contemporary, but I like a film where there is a little dialogue, not a complete hour of total silence. I have lots of patience when it comes to film (I enjoyed Citizen Kane, Casablanca and There Will be Blood) but I found this film to be super overrated and shouldn't even be on IMDb's Top 250 List. The Even if they cut an hour, this movie would've and could've been way better. I also heard that Stanley Kubrik cut about 20-30 minutes to make the pacing faster. What pace? It took 2 and a half hours to tell an hour long story. I would sometimes fast forward and I would find that I missed nothing. You'll notice I didn't mention anything about the acting. That's because there was little acting. The only thing we see is actor's expression and small amount of dialogue. The only reason I gave this movie 3 stars is for the HAL storyline. That is the only interesting part of the film. And if you're going to give this film a 10 simply because it has great special effects, then give a 10 to Avatar and Star Wars (OK Star Wars may deserve it, but you get the idea). This film proves that special effects cannot save a film that has horrible directing and a painfully slow story. If any, this is a film that is only for hard core Sci-Fi buffs. Anyone else will be bored completely out of there heads without a fast forward button handy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I doubt that I will ever forget the day I first saw this film. The year was 1989 and I was 9 years old. I had come to the United States from Russia just two and a half months earlier and I was staying with an American cousin. Her son happened to be a big sci-fi buff and he introduced me to the legendary Kubrick masterpiece that he owned a copy of. I still recall the effect the film had on me. It was chilling, mind-boggling and altogether unforgettable. I have since seen it many times since I didn't know enough English to fully appreciate it in 1989. But not one viewing has equaled that first one in importance, relevance and ability to inspire awe. This is the film that helped me to discover Kubrick. This is the film that made me interested in the art of filmmaking. And above all, this is the film that incited my love for science fiction. The impact of 2001 was so overpowering that I was soon watching Star Trek, Star Wars and any other sci-fi material I could find. Thus began my journey into the unknown, the mythical, the unproven and the untested. And the catalyst for that journey was 2001: A Space Odyssey. Now, with the recent death of its amazing director, I again look back on that day in 1989 and realize how important it was to me and how important it probably is to many others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING! SLIGHT SPOILERS!Most, if not all, of the criticism of this film is leveled at its ambiguity and mystery, and while it is true that it never provides any easy answers and demands a certain level of interpretation, there's still plenty that can be taken at face value. The connection between the ominous black slab and human evolution is ingenious, and perfectly obvious. HAL's campaign of terror against the Discovery crew needs no explanation. Admittedly the borderline-psychedelic dimensional trip above Jupiter may be a bit baffling at first, it, and its climax a bit incongruous, but the investment of a few scraps of gray matter in that direction is richly rewarded.Perhaps a more legitimate complaint about the film is that Kubrick's contribution is almost matched, if not exceeded by that of the composers whose music imbues the film with so much of its majesty. Would the film have achieved the same level of impact without Strauss' "Thus Spake Zarathustra" booming across the infinities? I think not.All these concerns aside, anyway, the simple fact remains that 2001 is one of the most visually stunning films ever. I can't think of any movie that's depicted primordial man and its habitat so effectively. The ground-breaking space effects which paved the way for Star Wars retain almost all of their impact today, especially on the big screen. HAL 9000 remains the most terrifying computer ever to deadpan its regret at the necessity of killing its human companions. The "ultimate trip" at the climax is one of the most bizarre, mind-expanding and thought-provoking set-pieces ever (it's a testament to the sequence's impact that Canadian IMAX screens demonstrate the theatre's capabilities before shows with a verbatim recreation of it).Never mind Lucas, Spielberg, Cameron, or Scott. Stanley Kubrick made himself the ruler of sci-fi with this (and perhaps A Clockwork Orange too).</fullReview>

The last third, a psychedelic trip across space and time, is fascinating - if one's on drugs. Only the middle part, featuring that funny guy HAL 9000, is somewhat interesting.

		<fullReview>I finally saw 2001: A Space Oddysey about a month ago after almost a lifetime of hearing how great it was. How it changed the art of cinema, and is Stanley Kubrick's Magnum Opus. Then a little bit before I watched it, I saw the review by Confused Matthew. Confused Matthew, for those who don't know, is an internet reviewer who mostly reviews movies that he didn't like, that the mojority did like, examples include: Back to the Future Part 2, The Lion King, No Country for Old Men, Minority Report, and this. Normally I disagree with him, but unfortuantly this time I agreed, while 2001: A Space Oddysey is no where near terrible, it is probably one of the most over rated movies I've ever seen.Really the best way I can review this film is to just tell you to go watch Matthew's review, because he pretty much says what I think.Now I do agree that this film did change cinema in terms of direction, visuals, all that. This truly is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen, had I never known, I never would've guessed that this movie was made in 1968. Kubrick is a great director, and now that I've seen a some of his movies, I can consider him one of my favorites. But really, the best way to describe this movie is "empty." I literally fast forwarded through an hour of this movie, I nearly fell asleep twice, and it is because half of the movie is just spaceships flying across space, looking at landscape, people walking around. And sure, the visuals look nice, but look at the six Star Wars movies, they looked nice, and they actually had plots. Even though I fast forwarded through an hour of a 2 hour 14 minute movie, I didn't miss anything.They go to Jupiter, the HAL 9000 goes crazy, kills most of the crew, then Bowman goes through the stargate finds himself as an old man and then turns into a fetus. What does it all mean? You know what, I couldn't care less. Sure HAL was pretty cool, but he really was only in about twenty-thirty minutes of the movie. Yes, I know that I'm pretty much repeating what Confused Matthew said, and I tried to give it a chance, I even came on to MFC right after watching it and saying it was basically OK. Yes, the visuals are amazing, but if you want to see a really good Kubrick movie, go see THe Shining, that's a brilliant movie. Hell, go see A Clockwork Orange, it was weird, but good, I think. Full Metal Jacket, sure the first half is far better than the second, but at least stuff happens in that second half.I know that this film is loved by millions of people, and to be honest, I don't hate the film, but I don't see myself ever watching it again. If you like it good for you, but I'm with Matthew on this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2001 can not be spoiled in words</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler Warning?, but 2001 can not be spoiled in words!2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)2001: A Space Odyssey causes one to reflect on the primary questions of the ontology of human existence. The key word is questions. The film is about unanswerable mysteries. It embraces the unanswerable and frames the unknowable in its rightful state of awe.In 2001 the Questions are Monolithic (!). They are the Questions that have hounded the human soul since the Dawn of Man and persist just as forcefully today.What is the Monolith? It is black. It is impenetrable. It is always there. It comes from who knows where. It never responds to our inquiries. It is void, and it is absolutely terrifying. It is . . . the Unknowable. It represents everything that we are not sufficiently equipped to know.Since humanity's first appearance in the universe, since that first miraculous acquisition of the quality that makes us human, self-awareness, we have thereafter been engaged in confrontation with this Monolith. In the Dawn of Man, Kubrick shows the time from the first acquisition of self-awareness until confrontation with the Unknown to be quite short. One sleepless night of fear and darkness, eyes searching, then at dawn, suddenly, immediately, full force unmediated confrontation with the Unknowables of Existence. The unexpected and sudden `I am' that precedes this confrontation is, smartly, only implied by Kubrick. He skips it and moves directly to the What, Where, How, and Why Monolith. What, Where, How and Why are the objects that human logic and grammar immediately demand from the profound and simple `I am.'`I am' is an a priori argument. It is antecedently necessary to the subsequent Monolithic Questions that have no answer. 2001 is mostly commentary on the fear and psychic destabilization which the human mind has endured since its first `I am.' Fear and psychic trauma are humanity's characteristic reactions to the Questions that can not be answered and from which the mind demands answers in order to complete the argument `I am.' In 2001 these are the reactions we see the first time and every time the monolith is encountered.The first time is, of course, at The Dawn of Man. The monolith did not appear quietly without being noticed one day. No, clearly it was not there, and then it was there. The trigger was self-awareness. The trigger was `I am.' Before this, the apes were quite content sharing puddle water with Tapirs. These same Tapirs and other animals, we later notice, do not seem the least bit impressed when the Monolith does show up. In fact, they don't even see it. And they certainly don't here that scary music. They just continue wandering around as always.Man, alone, is burdened with the Monolith. This burden, this shock of being, but not knowing, is linked in the film immediately to a propensity to commit violence. The deep rooted fear, constantly present in our consciousness, of that which we can not know, has not yet been sufficiently tempered by any framework that we have yet been able to construct in this world to prevent us from lashing out irrationally and violently at the world. We kill, irrationally, because we do not know.We still have not found any way to fundamentally alter our relationship with the unknowable. It was possible to skip all of human history since the Dawn of Man until the year 2001, transitioning as Kubrick did in only a few seconds with the camera panning and following the bone/weapon, flung out by man's arm in one fluid movement, propelled by a very perceptible and fertile combination of exaltation, fear, terror, power, primal angst. The bone is hurled skyward in this way, as has all of human technology since. But more importantly, what is said by compressing all of history like this into just about 5 seconds of film, is that nothing at all worth mentioning has changed apparently since the Dawn of Man regarding our own self awareness and its concomitant relationship to the unknown. The relationship was, at the beginning, and still is, a relationship of terror. Even the artificial intelligence of HAL is shown to encounter self-awareness in exactly the same manner. He becomes self-aware. Therefore he is inextricably engaged with the Monolith. And his reaction is the same: fear-inspired violence and murder. `I'm afraid, . . .Dave. . ., I'm. . . afraid,' he says as he is about to die as Dave removes his `higher' logic circuits.The psychedelic journey into the living room shows again the persistence of this shock on our psyche. Bowman finds himself engaged in rather immediate and intimate, Eyes Wide "Open" encounter with the Monolith. This plummets him directly into a domestic Victorian apartment where all of his physical needs are satisfied, without effort, for his entire lifetime (a simple symbol of civilized life which is surely designed to some extent to act as a buffer against our primal fears of the unknown). Yet, at the core of his soul, he is shown to be quite alone, in a world with still no answers to the questions. He has his life-long monologue with the silent monolith, which hounds him always and offers him still nothing even on his death bed. Even as his last act is a finger pointed at the monolith, as if to say `Can I ever know?'Finally, the embryo. the awe of creation and of `being,' and perhaps, Kubrick offers a suggestion that one day humanity may alter its manner of being, that perhaps we may find a way of perceiving the unknowable not solely with fear and violence, but instead with a more positive posture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After all the good things that have been said about this movie, I was expecting more, much more.If there are 10 facets to a movie, this one covers about 2 or 3.Sure, the special effects are good, certainly for 1968, but what is the point of the movie? Is the point that we are supposed to decide for ourselves what the point is?The space scenes are slow. I could do without watching a pod land on the moon while listening to classical music. And yet those scenes last for seemingly forever. Get on with it! Hire an editor. Get over the self-glorification of special effects that add nothing to the story.What is the point of the ending? Did Kubrick want to give acid-laced hippies an alternative to Fantasia? Let's get real--the last 20 minutes are a waste of time.Maybe there was something redeeming about this movie, but there are 2 1/2 hours that can be much better spent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film as Art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Certainly one of the finest films of all time.Sure, people expecting an action flick, or a simple plot, will be let down. But for a sort of contemplative experience, with the music and the film complementing each other, few compare with this masterpiece.The special effect, while perhaps not to the standards of today's computer graphics, were way ahead of their time.When I first saw this, in about 1967, I was immediately mesmerized. In 2003 I talked with a neighbor who worked at NASA. He said that if the enthusiasm that existed through the Apollo project after it's political objectives were met, we may have actually gone as far as "2001" predicted by that year. So, not only was it artistic. It was also prescient.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tools don't need to breathe in space...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001 A Space Odyssey contains in two hours and twenty minutes what has happened to the evolution of humans in the past million years. You start with apes, whose primary function (in the movie) is the discovery of tools, albeit simple ones at that. You then move to humans, who, driven by their curiosity and scientific nature, venture into unknown territories after seemingly becoming the masters of their own planet.However, man, just like the apes, needs tools in order to function. Instead of the simple 'bone' for the apes, man creates computers, which become the backbone for this journey. Herein lies one of Kubrick's main points. Man invents tools; tools so great that they no longer need humans in order to function. Astronauts hibernating on the journey while the two awake struggle with boredom (i.e. sun-tanning scene). By this point, man has made tools so great that the thirst for knowledge depletes and is replaced with mild content. Hal 9000, the leader of all tools, does virtually everything now while man now becomes the tool. Man's function is now to observe Hal 9000, and fix it when needed. So the human is now used strictly for maintenance, while Hal9000 does the work.Kubrick's other main point in this fascinating work of art is that man, while being a master of his own planet, is just a baby in space. The astronauts eat baby food and have to be 'toilet-trained' (instructions on how to use the toilet). Earth holds no weight in space; man still needs to breathe to survive in a place where breath is hard to come by: back to the tools. Man uses his tools again to be able to breathe in this environment. Now it is man who is completely dependent on the tools he invented. Now without these tools, man faces certain death. Tools don't need to breathe in space...This film is both universal and timeless, perhaps more than any movie I have seen to date. It leaves room for discussion with its subtle nuances and reminds the viewer of where mankind stands in the evolutionary spectrum.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are many movies out there so full of energy and self-conscious visionary bravado (films like "Goodfellas" or "City of God") that they perpetuate the myth of the greatest film of all time. Then, there are movies like Stanley Kubrick's "2001" that created the myth, and simply are."2001" is the prime example of why Stanley Kubrick is the greatest director of all time. He was able to traverse many different genres throughout his career, and in doing so created the mythic templates by which all other latter films in those genres would attempt to emulate. Prior to this film, he made the greatest satire ever in "Dr. Strangelove." Following this film, he made the greatest costumed period piece in "Barry Lyndon" and the greatest "modern" horror film in "The Shining." Throw in films like "Clockwork Orange" (another biting satire) and "Full Metal Jacket" (the best "grunts-eye-view" of war ever made) and you have the greatest director of all time.Here's why "2001" is the greatest science fiction movie ever made. The amazing visual effects and the set designs with their painstaking attention to detail still hold up to today's harshest scrutinies. I dare you to find a movie from any period that looks this good. It makes today's CGI laden films look like visual puke. It also presents us with a prophetic and realistic look at what might happen to our society as it continues to evolve and become more dependent on technology, and the quandaries of creating Artificial Intelligence. HAL, the super computer, is without a doubt the coldest and most profoundly dangerous villain ever to grace the silver screen.On its most simplistic level, "2001" is the most arresting combination of visuals and sound ever captured on celluloid. What make the film so transcendent are its philosophical and spiritual posturings on man's place in the universe and just how "alien" our first contact with outside intelligent life may be. The overture and opening credits send shivers down my spine every time, and the ending gives me enough energy to fuel a thousand dreams. No other film in my mind is this innately powerful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>my little insignificant summary of 2001</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will admit right away that I'm one of those idiots that hadn't seen Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY before this re-release in occasion of the real year 2001. I was very surprised by the film in the way it wasn't boring at all like some people I knew had told me. It is a truly thought-provoking, awe-ispiring work, always intriguing and unpredictable, standing head and shoulders above almost every other sci-fi film ever made. No other film I have ever seen captured my sense of wonder and my subconscious so deeply. I still can't keep it away from my thoughts. It is without a doubt Kubrick's most accomplished work to date (I have seen most of his movies). Using tremendously impressive effects portraying the starkness and silence of space, Kubrick made an unparalelled masterpiece, that immensely rewarded those with attention spans longer than five seconds.After a majestic opening title scene showing the sun rise up from the moon and using the enchanting 'Also Sprach Zarathustra' tune by Richard Strauss at maximum volume, the film opens with a 20-minute sequence showing the lives of a tribe of prehistoric man-apes. In typically Kubrickian fashion, the film calmly watches those animals, which are just about a few dozen thousand years away from becoming human, defending themselves from leopards, fighting another ape tribe for the waterhole, sleeping. Just when you think you're watching the wrong movie, something really unexpected and weird happens: the family that we've been watching finds a big black stone of some unknown material standing rooted in the ground. It is a thing of extraordinary geometrical precision, something totally out of place in this primitive world, suddenly appeared there with mysterious purposes. We see the apes slowly approaching the thing in fear and wonder; eventually they will find the courage to touch it. As all this happens we hear a menacing background music with ominous voices, a classic example of Kubrick paranoia music, which will be heard everytime mankind comes in contact with a monolith, as the black thing is called later in the film. After that the movie cuts to what seems to be the next day, and as we see one of the apes toying around with some bones on the ground, we hear Strauss' famous tune slowly coming up again: we know that something important is about to happen. The ape finds a way to use one of the bones as a weapon and starts thumping enthusiastically on the other bones, detroying them. The film assumes that we understand that this is because of the monolith: it is helping the evolution of the apes, pushing them to become more intelligent. This ape, who seems to be the leader of the tribe, then leads them to the waterhole to once again face the other, stronger tribe, this time with something they had never had before: weapons. The others come unarmed and their leader is killed by 'our' tribe's leader, who is armed.After this comes one of the most famous shots in movie history: the ape who has just killed with the bone throws it in the air and after following it for a while, the camera abruptly cuts to about four million years into the future. It is the year 1999 after Christ and man, in Kubrick's vision in 1968, has by then conquered space (unfortunately we now know that he was too optimistic about progress in space travel). Finally you understand a bit of where the movie is going, and finally the 'Space' in the title makes sense. The movie doesn't tell us it's 1999, but we find out later. With more classical music Kubrick shows us his unique, stark, and meticulously realistic vision of space. The camera lingers over spaceships and a space station, where we meet the first human characters and we hear the first dialogue. The man we meet is one Heywood Floyd played by William Sylvester. Something typical of every Kubrick film is that every character remains distant, boring, and hard to connect with; here the character development is even less important than in any other film he has done. We never find out anything about him, although he does have an important scene where he talks to others about an epidemic on the Clavius moon base: the people he talks with are similarly vague characters, who serve only to advance the plot. This criticism of flat characterization actually isn't really a criticism: part of the film's point is that machines like HAL, who we will meet later, have more interesting personalities than humans. Humans are supposed to come off boring. Anyway, Floyd goes to a meeting where he finds out that the hubbub on Clavius is caused by a dug-up black monolith that has been buried there for, you guessed it, about four million years. Humans were attracted to it because it sent out powerful signals. The thing looks exactly like the one the apes found earlier in the film. In an hypnotic, enchanting sequence we watch Floyd and his team approaching the monolith with the same sense of wonder the apes felt. Once again we hear that haunting music with those scary voices singing in the background. Floyd and the others gather around the monolith to take a picture, but a few seconds later they are startled to hear a piercing shriek coming out of the monolith. We see those men writhing with pain in their ears, and it's almost unbearable for the audience too. After that we see a shot we have seen before: the sun rising up on top of the monolith. We saw it before, after the apes had found the monolith, but I haven't figured out the meaning of this shot yet. Perhaps a signal was sent out of the monolith on the moon because it saw the light of the sun for the first time, and wanted to let its creators know about it somehow.After this sequence the film takes another leap forward in time, though not one quite as huge as the first one. The year is now 2001 and the title card says "Jupiter Mission: 18 months later". In another classic sequence, we hear beautiful classic music as the camera pans across the spaceship Discovery, and the film's central act begins. Everything that happened before is a setup for this part. First we see one of the astronauts running round in the circular control room of the ship to keep himself fit. Once again these people remain unknown and distant to us. They are Mission Commander David Bowman (Keir Dullea), who will play an important part in the story, and astronaut Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood). The film lacks any comedic punch in its dialogue, but that's just the point. In the Discovery ship we meet the most intriguing character in the film (and one of the most intriguing characters in any film), and he's a computer. It's the famous HAL 9000 computer which controls the functions of the entire ship, and he is given a chilling, appropriately soulless voice by actor Douglas Rain. In the first scenes on Discovery we find out that HAL is supposed to be a fool-proof computer, incapable of commiting error. Soon later while HAL is chatting with David Bowman about his doubts on the mission's purpose, he mentions a fault that he's picked up in the AE-35 antenna on the ship. Here's where the trouble in the film starts: it turns out that the antenna is perfectly fine. That HAL has committed a mistake is alarming to Bowman and Poole, because he could now make mistakes about anything in the mission. They close themselves off in private to discuss the situation. They ultimately decide to shut him off and continue the mission by themselves. Little do they know that HAL is reading their lips and so knows about their intentions anyway. So when Poole has to go outside the ship to check the antenna again, HAL becomes evil and doesn't let him in again. He floats off into space and dies. And in the most suspenseful and dramatic scene in the movie we see Bowman struggling to get back into the ship from the space pod he's in.In case you don't know what happens next, let me tell you that the movie actually becomes moving and dramatic. All the following scenes have gone down in movie history, but the final 20 minutes, where the main character is taken on a dizzying 'journey beyond the infinite', definitely belong among the most confusing, strange, enigmatic, and ultimately astonishing endings ever shown. Kubrick has so much to tell the audience, so many messages in his big final revelation that many audience members will be lost on it. I was too, and after being dazzled by its complexity I did eventually 'get' it, or most of it anyway. This is a rare movie that has the courage to skewer with our perceptions about life and our place in the Universe. It's too soon to say for me, but I think it will change my way of looking at life. It is easy to see why it was initially rejected by critics and audiences and later gained a huge cult following, ran in theatres for many years, and was eventually considered universally as a classic. It's a film that you might have a hard time understanding the first time around, but later buries itself into your subconscious and doesn't leave you. It's definitely the closest-to-perfect film if there ever was one, and it might even change your mentality and perceptions as it did with me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Epic Film Too Ambitious for its Own Good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"2001: A Space Odyssey" is set in the year 2001 and the main character is HAL. HAL is a computer. That's right, a computer who talks and thinks entirely on its own. This was made in 1968 and to think by 2001 it would be conceivable that computers would talk is a joke. If this was in 3064 a talking computer that had emotions and made its own decisions would be considered just as moronic as this. There is nothing in this film that provokes any kind of emotion. It provokes two reactions and one is called sleep. The film starts with nothing but a pitch black screen for well over two minutes. Then, the first shot we see that has some kind of lighting is "The Dawn of Man" sequence. So, if it's in chronological order, the blackness prior to this, is the birth of the world? During "The Dawn of Man" sequence, out of no where, a huge rectangular block comes from? out of the ground, from the sky, we'll never know where it comes from, but for one reason or another it's there. The monkeys go apesh!t once they find this huge rectangular block that only man could have made, but that's the catch? man hasn't evolved yet. So, who made it and where did it come from? What is its purpose? The monkeys find a tool. The monkeys use bones to fight an opposing group of monkeys. The monkeys with the weapons are now the dominating group. Why? Because they have used their mind to gain an advantage. The more advanced monkeys, and more importantly, smarter and more innovative monkeys, are the dominate group as they have taken over the watering hole.We quickly jump into space, millions of years later, where we see a bunch of spaceships floating around to classical music. We can see the earth, the moon, the sun, the universe. And for a film made in 1968 the visual effects are stunning. The score is legendary. The cinematography is spectacular. The editing is, however, atrocious. There are countless shots of boxy looking space ships floating in outer space for, what feels like, an infinite amount of time. Once we board the ship there isn't much to talk about. For the next hour Kubrick shows various shots of life in outer space. Kubrick shows us the life of an astronaut, which is very boring, and we completely get the message. The spaceships interior and exterior are bulky and outdated looking. Remember what the first cell phone looked like? Me neither, but that's what the future looks like in 2001. All the characters have clothes and hairdos that resemble 1968. The chairs are decorated in bright red colors, and they're oddly shaped because we all know, in the future, we're going to be sitting in weird looking chairs. The computer screens are hideous looking and this is obviously prior to HDTV because the clarity is atrocious. All the TV sets look like they're from 1968, so it's not all that futuristic. Like all films set more than 20 years in advance, they look terrible and unconvincing. Just because this is Kubrick, we shouldn't say, "Well, that's how you would think it looks." No, I wouldn't. Just like I wouldn't think a computer would be talking to me in the year 2047. It's not going to happen and if someone made a film right now, set 30 years in time, and had a talking, self thinking computer, I would laugh at the stupidity of it. Just like I did with "2001". HAL is the liveliest person- shoot? I just called him a person. HAL is a computer, but he has more life than any of the muted characters in this film. And HAL actually thinks he's alive. He sees humans as his maintenance men who take care of him while he does all the work. HAL "reads" the lips of one of the very few conversations between Dave and Frank and he "sees" that they are planning to turn him off. This is where the only dramatic part of the film enters- An ensuing battle between a red light and a guy in a spaceship trying to get into a bigger spaceship. Oh, the drama!! Once HAL thinks he has the upper hand, Dave makes his way back into the spaceship proving mans ingenuity. Dave proceeds to terminate HAL. HAL pleads for his life as he slowly fades away, which, like everything else, seems to take forever. If the scene was shortened I think it could have been truly incredible. The final act is just as tedious as the first two. The huge block that the Apes found appears again at the end. It comes out of nowhere... again. Then, an infant is born in a placenta-like shield overlooking the earth from space. What is Kubrick saying? Is it about transformation? Dave to an infant? Is man evolving again? Is Kubrick saying this is the end of man and the start of? whatever that alien looking thing is? Maybe I'm going crazy trying figure out what this crazy director is trying to say, but the more I think about it the more the beginning and the ending make sense. There are a few questions left unanswered, especially for the purpose of the blocks, but if you can make it through the film it should spark some thought. The film moves at a snail's pace. The first act and the third acts are fairly strong, but the second act meanders around, hovering in one place for what seems like eternity. There is some intriguing ideas in the film that will provoke some thought if you give it a chance. And for that, it finds some level of profound greatness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Film Like 2001, No Film Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It might be fact that there's "no film like" this one, but I freely admit it's my personal opinion that there's "no film better".2001 is one of those films that is completely timeless. The only thing that makes it appear dated is the pure plot itself in association with the year 2001, which by now we can all understand as yet-another-hyperbolized-future-vision-of-the-60s. Call it 3001 then. Take the date out of it, it's a timeless film.What I wanted to comment on though is a part of the film that's usually overlooked: the beginning. It's not like people forget the "Ape Sequence", it's just it doesn't stand out in minds usually as much as Hal 9000 and the simple docking of a space ship to the music of the Blue Danube. But the "Ape Sequence", without resorting to spoilers and specifics, captures the essence of the progression of the Human species.You can look at countless examples in history when the obvious has laid before Human's eyes for a very, very long time, and yet they don't see it. It's almost as if it takes alien intervention, or God's intervention, to suddenly make the epiphany happen. Where one individual can look at something looked at countless times, and see something that's never been seen. The discovery of proof of the atom's existence (rather than the speculation alone) in the 19th century is just one example of this. You have peanut butter and chocolate sitting right next to each other for decades, and in retrospect it's amazing that it took so long for someone to connect the dots. The "Ape Sequence" at the beginning captures this concept of intervention cleaner than the rest of the film.But the entire film is a complete joy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I watched 50% of this movie on Fast-Forward!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never saw this movie in the theater because it was made 12 years before I was born. Yet I have seen just about every space movie made in the last 40 years and this one is by far the worst slow paced movie I have ever seen! It starts out, boring. It goes 25 minutes with out one human word spoken. I say human word because I am not sure if the Apes were speaking Aponese or just gibberish. Not that it mattes because I don't speak any Ape language.Then we go to the space scenes. They are VERY slow. Maybe its realistic maybe its not, I don't care that space is a vacuum with no sound either. I want some space sounds to keep me from feeling like I went deaf. Finally, I could not take any more space scenes. After watching the second LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG one with a sphere spaceship taking forever to land on the moon and coming to the realization that "This is the most boring movie I have ever seen!" I decided that all space scenes I would simply put on fast forward. Well actually 2X FFWD is WAY TOO SLOW so I actually put it to 4X FFWD and then the space scenes were normal space speed found in other movies like Star Trek or Star Wars or any other spacey show.I get this film and why some, especially at the time thought it was a masterpiece. For its time the Space scenes were amazing! Look at its competition at the time, the Original Star Trek and then look at this film. There is no comparison. However as far as story goes, it was nearly non existence and the movies pace was slower then a earth worm trying to find a hole on the pavement. I've attempted to watch this movie 8 times in my life and only recently I was able to finish this movie and only because I fast-forwarded near 50% of it.This movie is one of those rare ones where people either LOVE it or the HATE it. There is not a lot of people with an opinion about this movie that simply think in between. I hated it. I'm not a action junkie either, I just hated this movie. So Avoid it if you have not watched it, because it is a CAN miss movie, even if you might LOVE it, there still is no reason to watch this old movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has really become a classic film, not just a sci-fi classic. "2001"was a ground-breaking event, visually-speaking, that had people talking big-time when it was released. In my college-age crowd at the time, all anyone could talk about was the famous "light show scene" late in the film on the trip to Jupiter.Admittedly, there are a few things that make this film less than appealing to some, and I've always found that understandable: mainly, the slowness of many scenes and the secular agenda. I've never let either one bother me. First-time viewers are warned: don't expect a fast-moving film. And don't worry about figuring out the ending. I don't know if anyone has an answer to that.The visuals - the "light show," modern furniture, immense space craft, the ending bedroom scene, the apes learning to use weapons to fight each other, etc - are all fascinating aspects of this movie, but there is more. The soundtrack, the more one hears it, is extremely impressive especially as technology improves and he we hear it on a good DVD and surround system. (The Blu-Ray is fantastic.)Now that's the way to hear classical music! Strauss' "Blue Danube" never sounded better! Played during many of the slower parts of the film, the dramatic music enhances the feel of the immensity of space itself. Then, audibly, we hear these eerie chants whenever the mysterious monolith appears, whether its on earth, out in space, or in Jupiter. In other words, this film offers a fantastic assortment of visual and audio "trips" for the senses.Story-wise, it's all about HAL, the computer, and two astronauts who are under his leadership. The spacemen - played by Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood - are good, but HAL steals the show. His "voice" is mesmerizing, a haunting monotone. In fact, Douglas Rain is the unsung "hero" of this movie, with his voice-work of "Hal." The more one sees this movie, the more cold and evil HAL becomes.All in all, this is a movie - like the controversial "A Clockwork Orange" - that is so unique that I would think it would have be part of any movie fan's collection of the memorable films of the 20th century.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A symphony</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw 2001 for the first time at the age of 11, and quit some time after the docking sequence. It was slow, didn't make any sense, lacked any form of action (dramatically or otherwise) and I couldn't relate to the characters. There wasn't even a single good line in sight.I gave it another chance at the age of 18 and this time I was ready for it. It showed me that time could be just as impressive as the vastness of the universe. It told me about the nature of humans and life, about what is history and therefore, what is not. At the same time, it celebrated and mocked human intelligence and science.But mostly, it made me realize humans are part of this universe. There's no clear division between us humans, what we call nature and the universe. Fairly basic, I admit, but everyday news often leads you to belief differently.For the first time I watched a movie that wasn't about the plight of individuals or groups of people, but about the human race.This must be one of the most pretentious movies and to succeed in such an enterprise is beyond comprehension. If compared with music, it didn't behave like a rock-song, but a symphony which has many layers and ways to appreciate it. And like a true classic, it stands alone.Are there any mistakes ? Not a real mistake, but something that could have been done differently. The 'trip' bowman takes to his final destination seems very sixties-like, but that's about all I could find.Only 3 movies received a 10 from me, this is one of them and without any doubt the most important.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Magnificent Epic That's Terribly Misunderstood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I've read enough viewer comments and can't contain myself. I'm a writer and a filmmaker. I'd like to know where it is written that a film has to explain itself to you. I saw 2001 when it first opened. I was with five other people. We discussed the film for two hours. When was the last time that happened? For those of you who felt it was slow, so is space travel. Get it! There ain't no Warp Factor 1. Secondly, the ending: has nobody ever read anything by Arthur C. Clarke? One of the recurring themes in Clarke's work is that any civilization sufficiently advanced over humankind would seem like Magic, or even Gods. If you didn't understand the ending, perhaps you weren't supposed to. Isn't it possible that Kubrick was giving you the experience of how clueless we would all be if confronted by an intelligence millions of years ahead of us. Look, opinions are like rear ends, everybody has them, but when people put this film down as garbage or the equivalent, it tells me that they aren't thinking it through. Television and motion pictures are very passive media. They supply you with 100% of audio and video. Old time radio forced the listener to be imaginative and conjure up the picture. Surprisingly, it's not difficult to do that at all. Here is a film that dares to be somewhere between radio and the visual media. It doesn't hand you all the answers on a silver platter. Like a really good computer game you have to figure them out. Whether you liked it or not is your decision. Enough very knowledable people in the film world have viewed it and deemed it one of the great masterpieces of film. As many have said, it's an experience. If you can't deal with that, then go back to your five pages and a boink pacing, but dissing this film is a bit like saying Mozart didn't know squat about music. An opinion like that only make you look bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I am speechless...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having just seen this fantastic film, I'm left puzzled, amazed, impressed and in complete and utter awe of Kubrick's cinematic genius. I had not expected anything to impress me as much as A Clockwork Orange, but I was pleasantly surprised. While I do find A Clockwork Orange to be a better film, I must say that this comes incredibly close... and what determines this might be the fact that, while I fully understood A Clockwork Orange(at least after my second viewing) I'm quite confused by this film. I don't entirely understand the ending, and a few various things throughout the film, but that doesn't lower my score. Not the slightest. Do you know why? Well, partly because Arthur C. Clarke, the co-writer of the screenplay once said: "If you understand 2001 completely, we failed. We wanted to raise far more questions than we answered." And partly because the very visuals of this film warrant a perfect rating of 10. I would be lying if I claimed to ever have seen such beautiful visuals as the ones throughout the film, and in particular the very end... stunning. Simply stunning. Something that I found interesting was how many times Kubrick simply used the visuals to tell the story(as opposed to dialog) and how often he simply let us enjoy the sight of the spacecrafts or the planets... instead of giving us a few unsatisfying quick cuts like a typical Hollywood director would have done. Kubrick is in no hurry to tell us this story... in fact, he wants us to relax and just be whisked away on this journey. He sets a mood like no other director has ever done, and he never breaks this mood. His use of music, while not as deliciously ironic as it is in A Clockwork Orange, is great. There are two scenes which have been referenced so many times, both content-wise and music-wise, in so many different mediums that I doubt anyone can keep track of how many parodies or references there are to them... this is, of course, the famous Dawn of Man scene, and a recurring external space scene. The plot is great. The pacing is good, considering that it's Kubrick... usually, his films are slower, but this one never really felt that slow. The characters are well-written and credible. The acting is all great. The music/score is great. The visuals of the film are amazing. I know I'm praising every aspect of the film here, but I truly think it is that good; it's one of the greatest films I've ever seen, and definitely the best visually. Finally, I'll just mention that normally I hate science fiction that deals(even slightly) with extraterrestrial activity/life and space travel. I recommend this film to any fan of high-quality science fiction and any fan of Stanley Kubrick. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misunderstood masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The more I read the often very funny derisory comments on this masterpiece the more I began to realise that most great movies are just generational events that only those alive at the time can truly appreciate the context of their creation.I was 10 when 2001 came out and for some reason the film was classified as an A which at that time meant dragging an adult with me. They didn't "get it" because it wasn't a character driven drama. Neither did I immediately because of the odd structure of the piece and its mysterious ending. However so overwhelmed was I by the look of the film in those long lost pre-digital effects age, that the obscure finale which initially antagonised me, made me think through the entire film. The "plotty" bits I liked but when I realised the film, at a second viewing was about the evolution of all of us, as a species, what happened before and what may come after Man the whole non-verbal experience (Kubrick's phrase) had a profound and lasting affect. The speculation of our relative standing against other life forms in the universe (pretty low if the film is to believed) came as a shock. I came out of the cinema reeling with those images of planetary alignments, Ape men discovering the first weapons, revolving balletic space stations the enigmatic star child and the beauty, awesome emptiness, and silence ( George Lucas please note) of space, forever imprinted on my mind to this very day. It fed my conscious and unconscious mind but like now sparked a furious critical onslaught. Those that hated it demanded clarity where there can only ever be conjecture. You never see the aliens that planted the monoliths and that is just as it should be for that element of mystery to remain. 2010 tried to explain everything and killed the effect stone dead. The elegant pacing and use of classical music irritates the hell out of the Michael Bay / MTV generation of who become fidgety if a shot lasts over a second. Witnessing a fuzzy black and white picture on television shortly afterwards that didn't alter for 30 minutes held me spellbound. That was a TV picture of the leg of the lunar module awaiting Neil Armstrong's one small step on the moon. We were used to waiting then, as long as the payoff justified it. This event like the film gave one time to think.And there's the rub, my parent's generation didn't get it and neither does the current one but for widely differing reasons. You really had to be around in 1968 to realise what a quantum leap 2001 represented in film, special effects and story telling techniques. Like all Kubrick films it doesn't date.For me it was a happy accident of time and place, and very grateful I was to be around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The proverbial good science-fiction film (tv)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The quote is from Kubrick himself and it's still totally accurate for this movie. I don't know if any film fan can appreciate it but it's really a must see for all SF fan: we got everything: space, aliens, robots, origin of humanity? Beyond this theme, it's a rare movie that mixes brilliantly a challenging script with amazing visuals! Sure as the movie is from 1968, some effects look sometimes a bit out of time but it still has more punch than most SF movies done after! For me, the explanation comes from Kubrick's simple vision: he shots SF like real daily life, with no big things: a big frame and slow pace are just needful as what we see is already extraordinary! I have fun to watch it now as I have picked Clarke's novels as my summer books (proof of the enduring quality of the work) and so I have just finished to read the novel: the two are really variations around the same stories and really help each other. This movie is also a moving memory as I remember to have watch it as a teen ? in my grandmother's bedroom! It was all the more difficult as the galactic trip is indeed experimental cinema!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001:A Space Odyssey did not look very appealing the first time I heard of it,but after I watched it my mind was blown. Stanley Kubrick presents us with his best film,a space exploration mission gone wrong when a rogue robot over hears his co-pilots may turn his system off. The story is also about how humans have evolved from our ancestors,the apes. With beautiful images,engaging storytelling, and effects that are the best of it's time.This film deserves the hype it receives.Mostly because it is different than any other film ever made, by the most critically acclaimed filmmakers of all time.2001:A Space Odyssey hits it out of the park by being the best of it's decade and maybe the best of all time.</fullReview>

They awaken to find a featureless black monolith has appeared before them. Guided in some fashion by the Black Monolith, one man-ape realizes how to use a bone as a tool and weapon; the tribe learns to hunt for food, and kills the leader of their rivals, reclaiming the water hole.Millions of years later, a Pan Am space plane carries Dr. Heywood Floyd to a space station orbiting Earth for a layover on his trip to Clavius Base, a United States outpost on the moon. After a videophone call with his daughter, Floyd's Soviet scientist friend and her colleague ask about rumors of a mysterious epidemic at Clavius. Floyd declines to answer. At Clavius, Floyd heads a meeting of base personnel, apologizing for the epidemic cover story but stressing secrecy. His mission is to investigate a recently found artifact buried four million years ago. Floyd and others ride in a Moonbus to the artifact, which is a monolith identical to the one encountered by the man-apes. Sunlight strikes the monolith and a loud high-pitched radio signal is heard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Try not to get annoyed challenge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It may be annoying and slow but I think that is the good of the movie. Also you would have expected it to be annoying because Stanley Kubrick is the ultimate brain blender. He made Clockwork Orange which for many people was super hard to not leave the theatre or to turn off the TV watching that movie(I didn't see it but I know people's experiences). He also made The Shining and I know from what I have heard that is creepy. For many people this movie makes them wonder why people like it. Those people have to know Stanley Kubrick wants to probably fascinate by annoying(MAYBE).ANYMOO I will tell my opinions.2001 is a great, inspiring, annoying, beautiful and originally thought out. The movie is filled with two minutes of nothing and a sinister and annoying. It has great visuals that are definitely not from the 1960's and super long scenes of spaceships arriving somewhere leading me to think that the director wanted to make people feel the length of the trips. Also HAL 900 is one of the best characters in film history and perfectly capable of annoying someone to death(He even killed someone). The annoying monolith sound is perfect and the dawn of man scene is greatly expressed and the ending is so "WHAT THE WHAT!!!?". I also have a theory of what the monolith is and I think it is a book mark for the greatest moments in the history of humanity. It showed up the day before we evolve and was found on the Moon which was where we step on our first planet and it showed up seconds before Dave goes into the infinite(It hasn't happened yet) and that scene is the ending scene(alias the WHAT!!!? scene).Even though it is annoying I rate it 4/5 stars for being an inspiring perfectly expressed work of art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is very interesting because you've never seen anything like this in the year 68, so professional, so colorful, so impressive, and different. It might be the slowest movie you've ever seen, but, u can tell that it was intentionally made like that. I'ts like a journey in space that u follow along with. It's a very trippy and relaxing movie, although I don't do drugs, this is the type of movie that u can watch while high on weed, shrooms, or LSD. The music is very memorable and iconic, and used brilliantly. It's amazing to see such an old movie be visually pretty. U won't ever forget the evolution scene, The computer, The music, and the Abstract ending that was made for u to interpret on your own. That's what makes it special. The dialogue was nothing special, but u can tell it wasn't the focus of the film. There wasn't much of it, The biggest character was the computer. This movie is meant to be artistic, it shows off how well they made it look like a much much newer movie. The ending was made for u to interpret, so this movie can really make u feel like you're a part of it all! I feel like if u like good abstract art, you're gonna enjoy this masterpiece film. This movie also predicts a lot of future inventions. Makes it even harder to believe that the moon landing was one year after this film, after all, it's easier to fake it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite film of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For over a year, "2001: A Space Odyssey" has been my favorite movie ever made. It is one of the films which got me into reviewing films, and it still holds up just as much as it did on my first viewing. There are many people who say that it is one of the best movies ever made. I'd probably put it somewhere in the top 10. It has accomplished so much, and it's pretty hard for me to think of other films which could top it.This movie has a few story lines. The "Dawn of Man" sequence shows man-apes developing the first tool, and taking a big step forward in evolution. The next storyline shows a group of astronauts on an expedition to the moon. The third storyline shows astronauts investigating an object on Jupiter with the help of an intelligent computer named HAL. The final part of the film shows the famous Stargate sequence, and this is when the film gets really complicated.I really love ambiguity. Some of my favorite films have ambiguity. However, I feel like this film does the best job at ambiguity. What sets it apart from all the other films? The reason I say it's the best is because I feel like it has the most interpretations to it. Kubrick didn't leave any clues whatsoever in the film, and by doing so, he opened up the film to many answers. I feel like no matter how many times I watch it, there will still be more interpretations that could come out of it. I have not seen any film before which gave me the same feeling towards its ambiguous moments. Usually when films gets complicated, the transitions will impress me. However, 2001 impressed me a lot more by its visuals. The visuals of the Stargate sequence were hypnotic and impressive. It was made entirely through practical effects. It may seem easy to create it nowadays, but this film was from the 1960's. That was when computers still used magnetic tape storage. If that scene doesn't impress you, nothing will.Speaking of the visuals, they looked brilliant. In fact, more than brilliant. I already mentioned how the Stargate sequence looked really good. However, that's only the tip of the iceberg. There is hardly a single frame in this film which doesn't seem intricately designed, flawlessly composed, and superbly lit. It also has impressive framing and symmetrical compositions which makes many of its shots stick out even more. Even if the viewer gets confused by it at first, the amazing visuals will keep you coming back until you do. In my opinion, "2001: A Space Odyssey" has the best cinematography in history. No film has ever topped it before, and this films' visuals feel untouchable. The only film which has come close to topping this one before is Terrence Malick's "Tree of Life". However, not even that film can top this. I have a feeling that it's going to remain at #1 for a long time.HAL was a really good villain. When you watch the movie, you have a little confidence that HAL won't be able to overpower the crew of the ship. However, when you're able to figure out what HAL's plan is, it's already too late. The lines he uses in the film are really good. Even when his life is in danger, he tries to use a normal voice to calm the astronaut down. Some portions of the film with him can be really unnerving for that reason. However, I think that the biggest reason why he works so good is that it's debatable whether he is actually evil or not. It's possible that his actions are all a part of self-defense. Because of this, the viewer would likely be unsure whether they're supposed to sympathize or despise his character. In my opinion, these kinds of villains (The Revenant for example) are the best kinds of villains. Also, let's not forget the hidden secret where if you replace every letter in "HAL" with the letter after it, you get IBM, an American multinational technology and consulting corporation.This films' soundtrack is brilliant. It is very iconic and it's easily recognizable today. "Also Sprach Zarathustra" is not only iconic, but it feels very grand. Every time it's played in the film, important breakthroughs in evolution are occurring. The song perfectly lets you know that something spectacular is occurring. When you go back to try and interpret the film, the soundtrack is a good clue to figuring it out. Its also fun to listen to on your own. It never gets bland, and it always feels just as amazing as when you originally heard it in the movie. There are other songs which feel haunting. Those songs perfectly represent all of the weird parts in the film. They also work very good in the background, because they immerse you with many parts of the film. The iconic "Stargate sequence" is made even better by its ominous score. The soundtrack perfectly represents the movie.In conclusion, this movie is a masterpiece, and it's one of the greatest films ever. It accomplishes a lot such as handling ambiguity better than any other movie I've ever seen has, containing the best visuals out of every movie I've seen, containing one of the best villains ever, and containing one of the best soundtracks ever. Every time when I re-watch it, I feel like I pick up on a lot of new things, and it still feels fresh and original. The reason why it's my favorite film of all time is because I'd rather watch it than all other movies I've seen. A few of my favorites came close to topping it before, but none were successful, and it still sits at #1. This is Kubrick's magnum opus.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tale of Natural, Technological and Spiritual Reinvention...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film with my sister in Cinerama way back in 1968. I'll never forget the completely lost look on her face as she turned to me and asked innocently, "What's going' on?" I chuckled and said nothing.Many people have to know before they can go, but I must say I have never had a problem with this. That is not to say that there are not a vast number of things beyond the ken of my understanding, but I have always felt that if you just keep on truckin' you will arrive at the Truth sooner or later.This is a stellar film (no pun intended) and once again rivals CITIZEN KANE for its sheer inventiveness. The inventiveness here, however, is not based on spending Saturday afternoons with the cinematographer learning novel ways to set up and use the camera to frame shots; as was the case with Welles and Toland, but is based on staggering and exhaustive research within and without the Space Program and various communities of High Technology.This is actually quite a simple film to understand, as it is designed to evoke mystery, to generate questions rather than answers, to launch the viewer on his or her own personal odyssey and voyage of discovery.That's really about it. This film is about as close to pure cinema as you are likely to get; with the possible exception of THE GOLD RUSH by Charlie Chaplin or Russian ARK by Alexander Sokurov, and yes, I could share all of my associations about the film with you, but what would be the point when that's the whole point? That is, your take on this movie is as good as mine and a great jumping off point into the realms of higher dimensions where together we can learn a great many new things.I will say this. I must have seen this movie over thirty times before I finally fully comprehended the gist of what Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke were attempting to express, while after reading the second of Clarke's Odyssey novels I attained full understanding in mere seconds.Once again, this is really a simple film. I agree with Kubrick that it is meant to be a nonverbal experience aimed at arousing emotions and moods of awe and sublimity and at this succeeds enormously. I also agree with Roger Ebert that this is a fable for Mankind albeit from a Western perspective or standpoint. Unlike many movies, it defies surrendering to a surface interpretation and challenges you from the outset not necessarily to agree with its open-ended conclusions but rather to explore and understand it from the inside out as Frank Lloyd Wright used to exhort us to do.This film is also the gentlest introduction into the world of abstraction that I know pertaining to the cinema. I must admit it is one of the reasons I stumbled into the Fine Arts wanting to understand how the aesthetics of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY was able to affect me so profoundly. Here, the Magician works his magic and leaves it to you to ferret out his secrets.I would like to conclude by saying that you might be interested in AN IN DEPTH ANALYSIS OF 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY by Roger Ager 2008 as more food for thought. Also, at the risk of uttering ironic heresy, I have to remark that I have been surprised here and there by how well atheists like Isaac Asimov understand the Concept of God.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinematic Turning Point, But Beware</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies are a great form of entertainment. They can provide more depth and excitement than books ever can because with every shot, you can have a bit of symbolism or ways to subtly excite viewers. Not all movies are for everyone, and 2001 is a great example. First off, the technical masterpieces are stunning(even in 2016) but many scenes drag on. This is art, but many people will just feel that it's redundant(sometimes I feel this way too). There's a lot of bickering between people saying that they "get 2001, but it's so boring" and people who say "you don't know what genius is". In my opinion, what makes a movie great is that it can be entertaining for the general audience yet have themes for the analyzers. This is a very hard task to do. Now, giving it below a 8 is ridiculous. Sure some scenes might drag on, but the exciting scenes for me completely make up for it. I can't give it a 10/10 because it fails to please the most of the general audience(sadly, really). What I can say is that it completely innovated the Sci-Fi culture in every way. Whether you like 2001 or not, or whether you "get" it or not, its influence is undisputed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Movie, Music and Motion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh. What a feel.! The epic movie, from none other than Stanley Kubrick (of the Clockwork Orange fame), is as intense as one can get. All the elements in the movie; like screenplay, music, direction, imageries, etc. are breathtaking in their approach towards the audience. The way the movie interacts with the viewers is certainly quiet gripping.One of my interpretations of this classic is that it subverts the idea of human progress by appealing to its inner consciousness about the true achievements of the evolution. Evolution plays a big role in the plot. There also is an AI character named HAL 9000, a.k.a. HAL. That machine is one of the most villainous characters the history of cinema has ever produced. Its single 'eye' plays the role of the eye of god and controls the human life on the spaceship. According to me, the theme is dark and the monolithic structure that gets showcased in the plot is an indication of the human negligence and the related dire consequences. The movie tries to showcase the significance of mankind, by commencing with an epic scene from the 'dawn' of man and thereby taking us straight into the future, 2001, which is scrupulously advanced, even more than that age in which we live today. The way the shots are taken, especially the outer space one, is outstanding. One can't digest the fact that the movie got released in 1968, a year before the man placed its feet on the moon, for the details of the celestial bodies and space are subtle.Stanley Kubrick did produce a masterpiece in this work. The foresight that he showed while creating this piece is tremendous concerning the future elements that he has used in the movie.The music is impeccable being classical and, at the same time, it establishes the running mood of the movie. The plot and characters aren't only the primary concerns for Kubrick; the meaningless scenes where no human action is shown are in the view of his, meaningful and crucial. So, expect some boredom if you aren't used to watching movies with such tempo. Moreover, it has that air of mysteriousness too, that captures one's thinking faculty.The movie ends without a closed ending. The viewers are left to draw their assumptions and interpretations. The creativity of Kubrick is a must watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The meaning of 2001</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many reviewers have been puzzled over the underlying meaning of the movie. As one who has seen it several times, plus read the book, and is also a science nut (Phd, applied physics), here's my take (some of what follows was in the book): Several billion years ago intelligent life evolved on another planet, reaching and then surpassing human capabilities. Eventually they learned how to store intelligence in the structure of space and were therefore free of a material existence, with their evolution culminating in a cosmic network of essentially infinite intelligence, and taking on stewardship of planetary "incubators of life", the earth being one of many. They assumed this role because, to them, newly-evolved intelligence was more precious than anything else in the universe. The monoliths were their catalysts for key quantum jumps in the ascension of life, beginning with the first primitive life form (not shown in the film), then the jump from primate to human, and later from human to uber-human (an overlord watching over and protecting humanity). They also, of course, had other purposes, as messengers telling of man's spacefaring abilities and as entry points to the stargate. So the film relates to humankind's origins, its final destiny, and its place in the "grand scheme of things".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An accomplishment unlike any other</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey is without a doubt, the greatest science-fiction movie of all time. Many people who have seen the movie claim it is "boring" or "too slow", but the bottom line is- if you have a short attention span, you won't like this movie. The visual effects of this movie are truly beautiful, you could say it is the Mona Lisa of movies. The storyline was very interesting, and presented ideas and a plot that very few people can think of. The minimal dialogue is great compliment to a movie like this, every word that is spoken is important in order to understand the movie. The use of music in 2001 is genius, it feels like you are sucked right into the movie, as the film's artsy space scenes flow with the classical music it is shown with. The acting in 2001 is spectacular, especially by Keir Dullea (David Bowman). I don't think the cast could have done better job. Lastly, the ending is an absolutely mind-bending series of events that leaves you thinking of how to interpret it, a truly spectacular ending to an amazing movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Apology on Contemporary Philosophical Criticism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Throughout its entirety, the film offers a perfect balance of 'eye- candy' and musical superstructure. I have always admired the director's inert photography, though, in later works, he gradually abstracts from this signature camera work. Unfortunately, just like 'Interstellar' disappointed me in the ending (which was much more blunt and hand-guiding, even transforming from Sci-Fi to Fantasy), so did '2001: A Space Odyssey'.As the title of this review suggests, I will offer something that I couldn't find while searching for what I'd consider proper criticism. My offense will construct on a single point of the movie -- the apparent definition of 'god'. It is not a typo; there is a difference between 'God' and 'god'. What the movie suggests is that man shall rise in its evolution to a point of 'god', after it emerges as a 'God'. In the ending, we have a 'Star-child' which I can compare to 'Dr. Manhattan'. I'm not a big fan of superhero movies or of this character, but I think it's the best comparison I can make so you can understand. So, the Star- child's a being capable of manipulating reality beyond anyone's imagination, and yet, it isn't perfect.And now for my final statement against Kubrick's theory -- man's evolution is limited. To be clear, I'm not religious, but I'm not a fan of contemporary science either, because, like religion, it claims something that it doesn't offer. 'God' is a term that explains a being that seems to have a cheat-book, essentially different from the term 'god', which IS existence and perfection itself. The specimen of a creature that evolves can never become 'god', because it is a subject, an individual, a finite, fatal creature. To be one with all and all as one is a matter of objectivity, an eternal, all-knowing, infinite state. I admit that my philosophical theory(not really mine, just something I'm offering) is sweeping the chalk board, but it is, with great confidence, a legitimate criticism. Man cannot evolve to become god, because god is not a creature. In the latest take on thermodynamics, energy is depleting and destructible. If that is so, a state of metaphysical nihilism awaits existence. This piece is made long before these claims, so I can't really blame anyone involved in the film for claiming otherwise. Space is infinite, time is infinite and we... we are the opposite. That is why we even exist; because if we were gods we would be impossible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The special effects are better than CGI in most movies today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I neither love nor hate this movie which is rare, most people seem to have pretty strong feelings towards it either way. The best thing about this movie is that it looks fantastic, the special effects look better than most movies today which again proves that practical effects will always be better than CGI which can look fake at time. A lot of work went into those effects and I can appreciate them and think about how they made it all look so real in the 60s. Where the movie falters is the plot because what is the plot of this movie? The characters have almost no personality and are just tools in the movie, the best character and the only one which has an arc is of course HAL-9000 which is an AI. HAL is menacing and creepy and all the scenes with him were great. I wish the movie followed Dr Floyd and had him go to Jupiter and beyond because his personality was being established and he could have been more developed, instead we get two astronauts who we are supposed to care about but we don't because we just met them and don't know much about them. Furthermore the music is great but really the ritualistic sounds that start playing when the monolith appears would have made any scene creepy, I could have filmed myself looking in the mirror and put that music over the video and it would have been creepy. The space travel scene scared me more than many horror scenes probably because of the subliminal messages combined with the music, Stanley Kubrick is a master of creating creepy scenes that scare me even though they are technically not scary, the way he combines music and visuals to create atmosphere is perfect. All in all the movie is a special effects showcase and the effects do look great but that is not enough for this movie to be one of my favorites. People complain about the Transformers movies being just a showcase of special effects but this movie is exactly that. Now I am not saying the Transformers movies are better because they are not, they are so visually loud they are bound to give anyone a headache but I am just saying that both Transfomers and 2001 are made to showcase special effects and of course 2001 does it much better. It is however a dish that looks like the best thing in the world but the taste doesn't live up to it. Still I enjoyed it despite being bored in a few sections of ships docking and other things and I kind of dig the weird ending, it is definitely a movie I can appreciate on many levels but I just think it could have been so much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must-see for any really movie lover</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Truly, it was a revolutionary piece for the film industry. It opened the door back up to space, one that had essentially been shut since the short "A Trip to the Moon," which in its own right was a masterpiece. Although this movie has influenced countless others, it lacked in many areas. Kubrick has made this story's theme in a manner that philosopher Martin Heidegger would be proud of, trying to push the audience to a point that they are incapable of understanding it. I won't spoil what it is, so don't worry, but Kubrick has made it nigh unattainable. Another complaint that I have of this movie was it seemed to rely heavily on the spectacle. So much was focused on camera tricks and special effects (which were absolutely amazing). However, special tricks do not make a movie. It is a similar complaint that I had with "Interstellar." There were so many shots of drifting in space. I don't mind having long cuts, in fact, I believe those to be incredibly artistic and beautiful, able to portray what quick cuts cannot. Sadly though, there were so many of them that these lot cuts lost a bit of their magic by the end. The psychedelic color trip at the end of the movie was... long. If it were to be just a tad shorter, it would have worked, but I believe that the point of it was lost within the first 3 minutes of random colors and patterns. In conclusion, it is a movie that's impact will forever be felt, but most won't appreciate now. It is a must watch for anyone who really appreciates movies and classics, but will leave you kind of thinking, "what?" Pros: It changed the film industry. The acting was great and so was the sound design. The focus on breathing to increase the dramatic effect, the icy tone of voice by HAL, and the music are just to name a few. I am not sure that we will ever have a movie revolutionize special effects like this one did. Cons: The cuts were a bit long. This left me as a viewer a little exasperated. There wasn't much character development nor continuity in character at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I looked at the trailer, the reviews, and the critics and I had to watch it, and I'm sure glad I did. So basically I really couldn't keep track because so much was going on, but basically I think the story was on a trip to Jupiter, a good, helpful robot turns evil after a rude compliment. He then kills one member of the ship, and then proceeds to refuse to let David enter the ship. David makes a dumb decision to leave his helmet in the ship and here is the memorable scene when he jumps out and risked his life to enter the ship and then shuts HAL down. After that a series of creepy noises and rainbows fly all over the place after David saw on the news that life was found on Jupiter. Then, he is shown dying extremely fast. The scene was pretty enjoyable, and then he turns into a CGI baby floating in the sky, with the memorable (Bum, bum, buuuuuum!) So I enjoyed the movie, I didn't understand the whole monolith thing, and I really want to watch this movie again so I can focus on that part, but still I enjoyed it. Some things were wrong with the movie, (I still give it a 10/10 because I'm generous) It was very confusing. I still am confused. And it's really not like any other movie we have today, Kubrick really went for something different here, and it was a bit interesting. I won an Oscar, and of course nothing but the outstanding effects, how did they have those visuals?? I really believe Stanely time traveled, it's literally 99% impossible to get clear and perfect images of planets like that in 1965, those pictures are good enough to put onto someone's home screen cell phone. (If you're wondering why I said 1965, that's because 1965 - 1966 was the filming dates for this movie, which makes it even more impressive). Just amazing visuals, this looks BETTER than Transformers. Now, another reason why I believe he time traveled (exaggeration) is because he predicted SO much, I mean, he predicted Skype, moon landing, and he even predicted daily news. And things like Siri. How did he do it? This movie looks like a 2001 movie. (See what I did there?) Why do people seem you hate this movie? You ask, well, I think people hate this movie because they're too impatient, and yes, the beginning scenes were quiet boring. But it got so interesting when HAL killed the guy, then you start you ask for the next scene! The dialog was pretty realistic, and so was the acting. Overall, I loved this movie and recommend for families who love Sci-Fi. One Final Note: I liked it, but it should have been called "3001: A Space Odyssey"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the few movies with a real message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie does have a plot although at first it doesn't seem like it. On this trip to planet Jupiter, Dave is on a voyage to himself. He finds himself and his past and his future and life itself outside of planet earth. There is a lot more to say to it, from the ape who built his first weapon to a human being floating all on his own in space which was up to this point a major development of human achievement. What more's there to say is that human beings will always be in some kind of a development. It is a beginning and an ending, there is a history behind every human life. The very ending of what humans can do is the development of a computer that is smarter than themselves. But it's also man who controls this computer, even though the computer starts to have an own mind with own thoughts. So this is also a battle of humans against their own constructed technique which starts to overrun them and thus makes them scared of what they themselves constructed. There is a lot more to say but I will make it a shorter review. I feel that the classical theme to this movie just does stress out even more its excellency. For me this will always be 10 of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Its greatest strength is also its greatest weakness..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is no doubt a masterpiece of filmmaking! Director Stanley Kubrick created a piece of cinematic history, which may even be called cinematographic art, by making this movie. Still I am here to argue if it is worth 10 stars or not... and as seen in my rating, despite me calling it a masterpiece, I gave 8/10. So why?The most dominant factors, that make this movie so outstanding, are the use of sound and the use of picture. This movie combines these to create an incredible experience when watching it. Long takes, beautifully shot and carefully crafted, were paired with atmospheric music such as Györgi Ligetis "Atmospheres" or Richard Straus "Thus spoke Zarathustra" resulting in inconceivably beautiful scenes. The saying "Show! Do not tell!" is represented in its purest form by this movie. But what is its greatest strength is also, in my opinion, its greatest weakness. And as there are so many positive reviews about this movie already, I decided to focus on the negative aspects I noticed while watching it the first time. 2001-A Space Odyssey is a very slow-paced movie, probably the slowest one I have seen so far. This is caused by the fact that all of those long takes consume a lot of time. Therefore not much is happening in this movie. I would even consider saying that the main plot of the movie, which I am not going to spoil here, is primitive. It is straight forward and simple. It serves its purpose of guiding the audience through the scenes, but it does not more. A similar problem can be found within the characters. The acting is not particularly great, not because the actors are bad-they are not! Instead they do not have a lot screen time or dialogue and thus do not have any progression in their character. According to IMDb 88 minutes of this movie are without any dialogue. How can someone expect serious character development? And lastly the end, which I will not give away here. I will only say one thing: Kubrick himself said once that if someone understood his movie, he did something wrong. I understand that, because of that, the goal of the movie was to leave the viewer wondering about what he has seen. Still it is very disappointing to have so many unanswered questions at the end. Your mind is literally "blown away" by the ending and you have no chance of assembling it back together...This may be criticism on a very high level, nit-picking so to say. But nevertheless this movie is a masterpiece, a must-see! In sight of all these positive reviews I just felt that some serious criticism is not out of place either as it has some problems as well. In the end I can only say... go see the movie already! What are you waiting for?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2001: A Space Odyssey, directed by Stanley Kubrick in 1968</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(PART ONE: Shortened to fit 1000 words)The film 2001 is an extraordinarily beautiful montage of extreme precision in model work and brilliant but inconspicuous symbolism, a visual masterpiece that has become one of the greatest films of the science fiction genre in film history. The thematic montage portrayed throughout the film leaves the viewer with many questions which not only become insightful into the human capacity for intelligence, but also provokes many ideas and thoughts regarding the classic conflict between man and machine. A machine is but mechanical parts put together and created by man.In this case, where man (the protagonist, being Dave) is in battle with the machine, the human audience is kept in constant fear throughout the film in regards to whether Dave will be capable of surviving a battle against a machine, the Hal 9000. The Hal 9000 is a machine so intelligent that it has obtained it's own will to survive. The Hal 9000, known for being the most intelligent computer ever made, is proud of it's reputation for being error-free and holds great liberty in living up to that reputation. The computer obtains such a level of intelligence that in seeking to expand its consciousness, it tests the will of man by creating an error (in simply being scientific in it's experiments) to test and learn more about man and his capabilities as human. When this occurs and Dave sees this error, he becomes mistrusting of Hal and it becomes his duty to disconnect Hal. When Hal becomes aware of Dave's intent, Hal (the computer) begins to fight against man for it's own survival.In Dave's efforts to understand Hal's intent and intelligence capabilities, he questions whether Hal is capable of feeling or understanding human emotion. Is the will to survive an emotion? Hal does admit at the end that it's will to survive is derivative of it's fear, of becoming extinct or being disconnected, and because fear is a strong feeling, Hal--the computer, is capable of having and understanding human emotion. Throughout the movie, the director, Stanley Kubrick, continuously emphasizes in the dialogue that Hal is error-free and that error has only been and can only be at the fault of man. Because this is emphasized to Dave by Hal, it seems as though Hal is requesting for Dave to release himself (and his own will) to Hal, the computer. When Dave does not do this and continues to try to disassemble Hal, Hal becomes defensive and causes malfunction of the life support systems of all the other humans on board. If then, Hal is intelligent enough to have a will to survive and has a fear of extinction, then why is it that Hal chooses not to find reason to reach or obtain a higher understanding of Dave and his efforts, but instead continues on a power struggle with him? Is it because Hal is testing the capacity and limits of Dave as a human? How far will Dave go in his efforts to destroy Hal? When Hal realizes that Dave is capable of pulling Hal's plug at it's core, Hal tries to turn things around and becomes deeply apologetic to Dave, in its efforts to survive. Hal then begins to admit his mistakes, and begs Dave for its survival. Dave, however, does not give in, and continues to disconnect Hal and safely land the ship. If Hal was intelligent enough to play chess and beat man at his own games, why then, did Hal not foresee this of Dave and survive? If Hal was so intelligent why did it not survive? It is clear that in it's efforts to test man, it lost the trust of Dave and was killed. If Hal was intelligent enough to feel fear, was Hal--the computer, capable of hurting? Hal had a fear of not being able to live up to man's expectations of its ability to be error-free. Was Hal intelligent enough to hurt? At the end of the movie, when Hal sings and Dave is disconnecting it, Hal seems to try to reach a level of understanding with Dave by showing Dave that Hal is/was capable of understanding the human emotion of hurt and tries to provoke compassion from Dave for Hal's survival. Was Hal ever capable of finding reason to reach a higher understanding, to find within itself, compassion for Dave, and the crew members there? Was Hal capable of choosing to have compassion for the humans? Or was Hal just jealous of it's inability to be compassionate for man? Or, did Hal just choose not to be compassionate because of it's inability to be human? If it was intelligent enough to be jealous, why then, was it not intelligent enough to realize or to admit its own jealousy (or merely recognize and gain an understanding of the pure existence of what it means to be jealous)? Was it because Hal had too much pride in being error-free to admit it's own jealousy or recognize it as an emotion that does exist? Was Hal killed simply because it chose not to be compassionate for man? Or was it too jealous to be capable of becoming compassionate? Why was it that it was not intelligent enough to foresee and overcome this? Because it (Hal) chose not to? Was Hal's choice not to find reason for compassion or gain a higher understanding dominated by it's fear of having error and becoming extinct? If Hal--the computer, was capable of choosing what it was that it desired to obtain a higher understanding of, was then, Hal's choice influenced by who it was that created Hal? Man or woman? Justice or mercy? If Hal was created by man, is this then the reason why Hal chose not to find reason for compassion for Dave, ultimately leading to Hal's death?--Andrea Calabrese, Actress/Screenwriter.

I have watched the movie at least 100 times over the past few decades and it constantly evolves evokes new meaning upon each viewing. The movie spans the history of mankind's time on Earth and hints that we are from "elsewhere" other than our own planet. Kubrik pioneered film techniques that were copied by countless producers in later years, however, the silent sequences in outer space (along with the pronounced breathing from the astronauts themselves) is haunting and unforgettable. An absolutely stunning and thought provoking film that leaves you thinking about the past, present and future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw it, I was really confused by the story (it looks very simple), especially the mysterious ending. When I explored the details, I tried to figure out the logical of the stories. It's about human evolution, from first time using tools to space travel, and to the future. The film is composed of lots of story fragments, alongside with the profound monolith, which is a meaningful symbol the director wants to express. Stanley Kubrick was a genius of a film maker. I was impressed by its classical background music and marvelous special effects. When I realized it was produced in 1968, I was shocked! It was a avant-garde science fiction epic and so far ahead of its time. It predicted the future of 35 years later. And some was described in the film we have achieved now but some is still on the way.Although it's a hard-to-understand film and needs us philosophize the meaning of space, future, humankind, technology, etc. I really recommend you to watch the classic film and enjoy the process of exploring your mind.</fullReview>

I recently watched Interstellar, partly because of claims that its the "new" 2001. I actually thought it was a good film, looked great, interesting plot etc BUT the end totally let it down by trying to explain the unknown and impossible, 2001 doesn't do that, it's the ambiguous nature of the film that's it's greatest asset. Sci Fi doesn't really get any better than this, sure it's starting to look dated, but the idea is still fantastic and will there ever be a villain with so little to show on screen that tops HAL?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE film of its time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I watched this film for the first time today, I wondered what it might have felt like to experience the work of Kubrick in his own era.I am a college student living in the 21st century. My era is crowded by quick fixes and easy solutions. We need entertainment now and it must be easy for us to understand otherwise it is seemingly impossible to enjoy.And I believe that to a lesser degree, the 1960s were the same way. People were well accustomed to the television and the shallow entertainment that it made possible. Where every episode could follow the same basic model as long as it came to a clean conclusion in the end.So even at the time of this film's release it must have been a daring thing to feature 10-15 minute shots of space equipment floating in a void. The fact that this film has endured these 4 decades is a testament to its power.Though it displays beauty and creativity unlike any film in those days (and indeed most today), its true power is derived from the imagination of its creator.Essencially this film describes the human experience. Consciousness and intellect, the two defining factors that have propelled us to prominence as a species. Here we are, but how? Here we live, but to what purpose? I don't profess to fully grasp this film and every aspect therein, but it has sparked in my mind a feeling of inquisitiveness. I hope to return to this film soon to experience even more wonder and curiosity.Wonderfully imagined, vibrantly executed, and brilliantly timeless. Enough said.Give it a shot.</fullReview>

My brothers were appalled by it saying, "Nothing happens to warrant it being good, but nothing happens to warrant it being bad. But it's still bad for being boring." I, personally, don't think anyone is stupid for saying harsh things about this. Afteral, this film is about making you feel through images rather than dialogue. If that doesn't appeal to you, I understand that.Film is more than story. I firmly believe that. If you were to take music out of certain films they wouldn't have nearly the same effect. This film is about simulating real life space travel. Actually, well I can't completely tell you what this is about as the film itself has the effect of an art gallery. You stare and behold art. Maybe you respect it, maybe you think art is overrated. The film does, like most works of Stanley Kubrick, make me feel uncomfortable at times. Just the way it looks and feels. It's eerie. Which is the point. Space is so vast and we know so little and we've come only so far. Barely the amount David Bowman made on his mission.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first, I wasn't able to fully appreciate this movie for its worth. the plot seemed empty with scattered dialogs in between beautifully executed scenes depicting outer-space life. The ending was odd to the extent it didn't interest me. So it remained an odd movie with beautiful cinematography work.But I think as with what happened to me, the power of this movie will not hit you right away. It will take days until you realize how fine details have strangely stuck with you. For days after, I was walking as they do on the pan-am interstellar spacecraft, albeit I was extremely slow in moving, but that is the power of "Space Odyssey". At the time of its release, it kindled and still strangely does people's hopes and dreams for life in the outer space, and turns our attentions to the incredible force that the machine might one day possess and how it can be put to use for extremes of good and evil. With an ever mysterious story-line, amazing ingenuity in the art of film making, and sounds ranging from bone-chillingly horrifying to pure exquisiteness, Space Odyssey is a true masterpiece that ought to be truly appreciated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you can keep your patience, this is a gem...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, it's easy to see why many people can't relate to the hype surrounding this film. Yes, it's complex, the characters are dull to the point of stuffed animals and it's full of lengthy, uneventful sequences. However, I've always felt Kubrick's genius as a director lay not in his visual portrayal of action, but rather his subtle conveyance of symbolism and metaphor. And boy, is 2001 symbolic.It helps to be prepared for a film like 2001. This isn't something you can expect to understand the first time you watch it. Looking deeply into Kubrick's exploration of themes such as control, technology, perception, and the philosophy of existence will reveal this picture as a true gem. Its human characters appear tedious because they only serve as vessels through which the film's rich events and experiences are translated on to us. 2001 is an intriguing probe into what it means to exist and to see the world. It's very deep and philosophical, but such is the case with most of Kubrick's productions. The soundtrack is epic as it is beautiful, and the effects used are truly ground breaking for their time. It's not an easy watch - but if you can watch it with the open mindedness that I think Kubrick intended, 2001 will make you think about it afterwards... and that makes it a powerful piece of cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey is a neocreationist scientific fictional movie from 1968. I have recently watched this movie again after last time when I was perhaps five. Overall, I give the movie eight out of ten as of the standard in 2015. So let's jump into the details.First, I like to talk about the cons of the movie. The movie features no Asian or Black actors or actresses. It may be appropriate and convincing in 1968, but certainly not today in 2015. Due to the lack of diversity, the setup of the movie seems more like a funny space sitcom rather than a futuristic exploration. Perhaps due to propaganda purpose, the US and English language are featured dominantly throughout the movie. Examples include the boarding check features a list of languages with English on top, but excluding some of the most populated languages such as Chinese, Japanese, and Russian. The lack of diversity in the space and the ideology of the predominant role of the US in the space exploration era shows arrogance and ignorance of the filmmakers, therefore discredited the believability of the realism in the movie. The slow pace and the long pauses in the movie certainly do not seem poetic in 2015, but rather seem idiotic and pretentious. This is why the movie lost two points.Now, let's talk about pros. The movie is very realistic. It carefully portrayed the behaviors of apes and the lifestyle in space, although from time to time, there were amusing mistakes, such as the space pilot took over the plate by holding the bottom with one hand and to prevent it from dropping while using another hand to pull it over in zero gravity. The movie is actually profound, while it does try too hard and became pretentious. It depicts the beginning and the end of the humanity, and points out what made humanity rise, and why humanity is no longer fitting for a space era. A type of black monolith is prominently featured as an indication of higher intelligence's influence in humanity's evolution ? presumably throughout the history, but the movie only showed or mentioned it appeared on earth (likely Africa based on the landscape), moon, a moon surrounding Jupiter, and a symbolic world. This black monolith is a physical symbol that indicates a significant step in the evolution process of intelligence from solar system. The beginning of the movie shows apes' discovery of using bones as weapons following the sudden existence of the black monolith from of the void. Later the black monolith was discovered on moon indicating humanity's ability in space travel. The black monolith on the moon surrounding Jupiter indicates humanity's ability in creating superior life form, the computers. And then the movie uses most of its time to explain why computers are a superior life form and why humanity is no longer fitting for the space era. For example, it uses slow pace to show how difficult it is for human to operate in the space, and how inefficient the way human works. The doctor who was visiting the moon from Jupiter exploration must verify his identity before boarding, and then he must play the role of father to video chat with his daughter, and reminding her daughter to tell his wife that he called. These two actions indicate that human needs constant verifications in order to maintain trusty relationships. Later the doctor meets his fellows and discusses his journey, while he refused to reveal any information. This indicates most of the time human communications are merely waste of time. Then due to the fear of social impact, the doctor reveals that the discovery of monolith must remain a secret. This indicates the fragile of human social structure. Such list can go on and on, and as a result, an artificial intelligent (named Hal) on the exploring ship to Jupiter decided to murder all on board members. This can be seen as a significant evolution step for intelligence in solar system. The AI revealed its despise to humanity when it commented that all mistakes were a result of human errors while inserting such comment in a mellow conversation, which shows its greater ability in giving overtone in the sentences, an indication of AI's higher creativity. The AI gave the final punch to indicate that human cannot even survive in the space without a space helmet.Of course the movie shows how the astronaut fights his way back to control room and removed chips of the on-board computer and eliminated the threat post by the AI. And then the astronaut had strange visions showing electronic art and then seeing himself getting older and finally on his dead bed, he saw the black monolith once again, and he became an infant flowing in the space overseeing the earth. All of the above scenes since the astronaut fights his way back into the spaceship should be understood as the visual presentation of the denial thinking that humanity will last, and is the terminal species in evolution. The implication here is that, the astronaut died in the space, and a new child of intelligence is born, that the AI has reached a new step in the process of evolution, overseeing the dead bed of humanity, the earth.The movie overall shows the ideology of neocreationism, that the creator of humanity may or may not be the creator of the universe. It could merely be a mysterious being. More importantly, humanity isn't a very special creation of such being. It can be, for instance in this movie, a biological bootloader of software based intelligence, a superior and more space fitting life form. The movie is a mockery of the notion to cherish humanity, and an encouragement to the human altruism to embrace the end of an era and welcome the new intelligence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Undoubtedly the greatest piece of science fiction ever produced, 2001 is a stunningly beautiful, thought provoking masterpiece that is an absolute requisite for anyone even mildly interested in science fiction. Stanley Kubrick's inspired tour de force is rightfully ranked among the finest movies of all time.For some films, particularly in science fiction, it is necessary to introduce new viewers with the pretext of "remember that this was groundbreaking cinematography back in the day before we had such and such technology". While this is definitely something to keep in mind when viewing 2001, the movie does just fine without the faint praise of being "good for its time." That said, one certainly gains an additional appreciation for the film when it is placed in the context its 1968 release - the climax of the space race, one year before the Apollo 11 mission. Despite having few reliable images to work off of, Kubrick's depiction of the lunar surface was so realistic that moon landing conspiracy theorists have suggested that Kubrick himself was employed by NASA to stage the landings.2001: A Space Odyssey represents the gold standard of what I would identify as "true science fiction". That is, movies which revolve around fictional science and its impact on humanity as opposed to movies which are commonly grouped under "Sci-Fi" but which simply use a futuristic setting as a gimmick for an action/adventure/horror driven plot. This means that if you're expecting Star Wars or Alien style action/adventure, you will be disappointed. If, however, you're interested in an intellectually stimulating experience that you will remember for the rest of your life, you've come to the right place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reel Look: '2001: A Space Odyssey'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Open the pod bay doors, HAL". The visionary and perfectionist director Stanley Kubrick teams up with science-fiction novelist Arthur C. Clarke to create an epic monolithic achievement that takes us on an epic adventure beyond the stars and the realms of our imagination, based from Clarke's book 'The Sentinel'. But is this revolution of science-fiction cinema more visually engaging than its four-act storyline? Let's take a look.Setting the stage for the vast leap from ape to star child, the adventure is triggered by a mysterious black monolith appearing at the dawn of man. Evidently of unknown extraterrestrial origins, the imposing alien structure inspires a certain hominid (with state-of-the-art makeup only to be outdone later on the same year by John Chambers' Oscar-winning makeup for 'Planet of the Apes')to develop tools from the bones of an animal carcass, following in the most robust and famous jump cuts in cinematic history, from an airborne tibia to a space station some millennia later. The monolith is then discovered on the surface of the moon after being deliberately buried for four million years. Eighteen months flash forward and the U.S. spacecraft Discovery One is bound for Jupiter. Aboard are mission pilots and scientists Dr. David Bowman(Keir Duella), Dr. Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) and three other scientists of whom are in cryogenic hibernation. Most of Discovery One's operations are carried out and controlled by the ship's monotonous and psychologically disturbed computer, HAL 9000 (chillingly voiced by Douglas Rain), and is referred to by the crew as "Hal". Though enthused by the mission and stating how he enjoys working with humans, the homicidal Hal wants noting to do with jeopardizing the mission, killing any astronaut awake or in sleep on board that or would deter him until Bowman puts a stop to this and disconnects most of the computer's memory and processor modules. Free from HAL, Bowman leaves Discovery One in an EVA to investigate another monolith orbiting around Jupiter. Approaching it, the pod is suddenly pulled into a vortex of colored light, as the disoriented and terrified Bowman finds himself racing at intense speeds through a the Star Gate portal over vast distances of space and time, viewing cosmological phenomena of bizarre proportions and strange, unusually colorful landscapes, all shot with the innovative use of slit-scan photography. What may have been considered a radical trip from hippies on psychedelics at the time, it is nothing more than a disturbing yet mind-grappling array of kaleidoscopic images that both stun and enhance the senses of Bowman and the audience as truly and audaciously groundbreaking. Bowman, still in his pod, finds himself in an 18th century-style bedroom, where he sees himself as middle-aged then as an old man dying, reaching for the mysterious monolith at the foot of his bed, which reincarnates him as a fetus enclosed in a transparent orbit of light beside the Earth, as the new being gazes at it from above.With the punctilious Kubrick winning his only personal Oscar for breathtaking visual effects (with the genius collaboration of special effects wizard Douglas Trumbull),this poetic meditation gravitates flawlessly, depicting the ingenuity and folly of mankind through four acts of wonder and enlightenment that demands to be seen on the big screen to be fully appreciated. To John Strauss II's 'The Blue Danube' orbital waltz of space stations calmly floating amid Earth's orbit to Richard Strauss' triumphant and powerful famous five-note opening of 'Thus Spoke Zarathustra', this is truly a silent film with sound, is baffling, engaging, spectacular, strange, imaginative, compelling and so forth. In fact it is all these things and more, as Clarke's novel is adapted if by a composer, meshing the concept of science-fiction as a virtuosic rhapsody, orchestrating the vast celestial heavens and space time continuum itself to a world of limitless wonder, surreal, intriguing beauty and the ineffable, infinite beyond.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"2001: A Space Odyssey" is one of the most famous Sci-Fi movies of all time. In this movie we have a mysterious and obviously artificial object which has been discovered beneath the Lunar surface. So in order to examine this mysterious object humans send their men and an intelligent computer H.A.L. 9000 to succeed on this.I really liked this movie because this movie began something new for those times which I believe was pretty difficult. It did not just open some new horizons but it showed to people something new and succeeded on this. Although is an old movie I have to say that the visual effects were really good if we consider that it was filmed in 70's (won the Oscar of Best Effects, Special Visual Effects). The direction of this movie which made by Stanley Kubrick was simply outstanding.Finally I have to say that "2001: A Space Odyssey" is a must see movie which everyone has to watch. This movie if we watch it today we will think that is a simple Sci-Fi movie and nothing more. But do not forget something, when you watch this movie you have to remember how old is it and what represents for those days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great and exceptional motion picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."2001: A Space Odyssey" (1968) is truly a great and unique motion picture. By saying unique, i mean boldness of this picture. It is great because of many things - truly unique storytelling, simple and at the same time difficult plot, the special effects which in the year 2014 looks great, classical music incorporated with dazzling and breathtaking visuals and a scope larger then life. "2001: A Space Odyssey" is not a trill ride or "lets grab a popcorn and watch some sci-fi flick" type of picture. To truly appreciate it, you have to sit down and simply enjoy it - it's like watching a painting, and "2001: A Space Odyssey" is a true art. This movie is segmented in parts, and all of them are truly great in they own way. The most sophisticated and after 2nd viewing still unclear to me is the last part, probably for which i'm giving a 9/10 for this classic. I know, art sometimes isn't meant to be understood, but nevertheless, for me it was a bit to much. Overall, "2001: A Space Odyssey" is a motion picture, that can truly be called an art. It's never going to get old, even if humankind will reach Jupiter one day, this motion picture will always going to be viewed as a classic art of movie making. It's bold, unique, gorgeous sophisticated and unforgettable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched 2001-A Space Odyssey last night. I found this movie kind of weird; but cool in a way. I hope this makes since; and I know it changed how Sci-Fi movies were made from then on. This film was before my time so I guess that's why I found it somewhat strange. I think George Lucas got it wrong when he called Star Wars a space opera. This movie is a space opera to me, just because of the way it was filmed with classical music infuse with the dialog. I love most Stanley Kubrick films; and found this one interesting. The only problem I had with it was the beginning, Dawn of Man sequence, I thought it would never end. It's not like I didn't get it either, I did, the beginning of all things. I don't know if I am the only one that feels this was; but it was just a tad nerve wracking. The movie is good the whole journey into outer space amazing; and I bet back it 68 it was a mind-blowing experience. I found the movie start to peak when they uncover the Monolith on the moon; and the whole space station scene remarkable. When the Discovery mission left for Jupiter, that's when it started to get very interesting. When have the Discovery with a crew of 5 total, 3 in hibernation and to awake and monitoring the controls, etc.. Dr. Bowden and Dr. Poole think it's great to have a H.A.L. 9000 on board with them, what could be better. When H.A.L., informs them of a malfunction on the ship they go out and bring it in to repair. The problem begins when there is no problem, Poole and Bowden start to wonder. They begin to wonder about H.A.L.; and begin have a conference . They both go into a pod turn off the audio; and start to form a plan. They do not realize that H.A.L. can read their lips. Poole and Bowden want to disconnect him they do not trust him . This is where the viewer notices H.A.L.. H.A.L. begins to take over, kill the three remaining Astronauts by shutting down their life support systems. Then he sabotages Poole life support in space. Finally when Dave gets in, he shuts H.A.L. down for good. In the end when the Monolith gives us a laser like light show, was pretty cool. The ending I didn't quit understand unless the Monolith aged Bowden in someway. It could also be that maybe the Monolith was showing him the future. All in all I liked the movie; but I am more of a fan of 2010. I think 2010 explained it in more detail. It is a good movie and if U like Kubrick films you shouldn't be disappointed. Kris L.

The visuals are timeless in their organic construction and the audio is Kubrickian baroque. The score. The score. The score. 2001 changed the way music was done in cinema, it was now a necessity. And music has never been used better than in 2001.The film's clearest message is about the underlying human nature that pushes us from using bone tools to interplanetary spaceships - the progress of man ? but that is just the surface. 2001: A Space Odyssey came at a time when man was on the precipice between the greatest achievement in the history of humanity and total predetermined nuclear apocalypse. Both are the gifts of science and progress, hence both are the result of man doing or undoing ? 2001 offers nothing more than step back and view us for what we are, what we have become, and what we might become. Certainly the film I feel most comfortable saying in is one the greatest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A celebration of Humanity and our quest for knowledge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's landmark science fiction film has withstood the test of time with its spectacular visual presentation, beloved classical music, striking realism and thought-provoking (though deliberately vague) plot. Critics and film fans agree that few, if any, science fiction films that have been released before or after measure up to the sheer majesty and filmmaking brilliance of "2001".One of the best elements of the film, perhaps often overlooked by critics, is the way in which it celebrates humanity and its exploratory aspirations as a wonderfully natural, ever-evolving, manifestation of the universe, a universe which appears devoid of any divine intervention. In the film's beginning, we observe early hominids, highly social yet primal cave-dwellers, as they gradually come to the realization that something as trifle as a bone can be used as a tool, or a weapon. This discovery, no doubt a monumental event in our evolutionary history, is marked by the presence of a black monolith, which suddenly and mysteriously appears beside their cave. The film then jumps ahead several million years and we observe technologically-advanced humans now shuttling freely through space, as they seek to learn more about an identical black monolith that has been found on the lunar surface. As the film progresses, we learn little of the origins of the monolith, except that it appears to be a product of extraterrestrial intelligence, and that it is sending a radio signal in the direction of the planet Jupiter. The next appearance of the monolith, now in orbit around Jupiter, segues in to a truly befuddling and psychedelic visual and auditory experience that culminates with the rebirth of one of the major characters, dubbed "star-child," in orbit around Earth at the film's conclusion.There has been much speculation regarding the significance of the monolith, whether it represents something tangible or if it is merely used as a McGuffin to provide some semblance of a narrative in an otherwise plot-less movie. Attempting to overanalyze this and the film's final sequence does a disservice to the film and to the viewing experience. Instead, the film as a whole can be seen as a portrayal of the quest for discovery and the human thirst for knowledge, rather than being about the actual discoveries themselves. We observe humans at different stages of history learning, exploring, questioning and deciphering. We see numerous applications of science and reasoning along the way. That the quest spans millions of years, and with an absence of a clear resolution in the film, implies that this pursuit is forever a part of who we are. The answers to questions regarding the monolith and "star-child" are not explicitly revealed, because in this context they are not important. It is the questioning that is, and an understanding that the quest for discovery is who we are and what we do.It is important to embrace this film because it embodies everything we are and everything we humans stand for. We are uncompromisingly curious and intelligent beings, with an emerging universal consciousness. We constantly seek answers, even if we know that they may not be what we want or what we can comprehend. As the film depicts, the quest for knowledge and discovery has taken us on a path from primitive hunter-gatherer to space faring beings, exploring places we once only dreamed of as we surge on deeper into the universe from which we originated. The final question raised by the film: how much farther can we go in the next few million years? Ultimately, that is up to us and the direction our species decides to take.</fullReview>

The movie tells the story of a man named Dr. David Bowman (played by Keir Dullea) is in a space shuttle on a mission and while that happens he ends up finding a mysterious futuristic computer called the HAL 9000 and ends up going on a nightmarish quest. visual effects supervisor, co- writer, producer, and director Stanley Kubrick really goes in depth when it comes to science fiction movies. The movie also compares to such sci- fi blockbusters such as Minority Report, Planet of the Apes, the Matrix, and all three of the Iron man movies. if you are a movie lover and especially enjoy the movies with the science fiction genre then it is a must see for you, but if i were you i would disregard the boring lame parts and just appreciate the movie for what it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have just celebrated the visual and immersive storytelling of Malick and Caplin, so it's unsurprising that I'm arriving now at Kubrick's door.Among the most beautifully photographed and engineered poems, one does need some interest in the meditative languor or patience to wait foe the science fiction vision to unfold (although I think the film transcends all genres). For me, this is very much as spellbinding as films get, from the very beginning. I don't agree with the criticism that Kubrick might be pompous, but I can see why one might feel that way. This, even after all these years, is a journey into film itself, the possibilities of visual expression. And aural! What a way to use well-known pieces and make them one's own! Not to mention taking an obscure piece by Ligeti, letting it to get to the bone.From time to time I'm surprised by the criticism aimed at the acting of those involved. They are often described as wooden, and in comparison HAL seems humane. I'm surprised by this since isn't it obviously the point ? that the great tragic struggle is not really fought within the humans but within HAL?</fullReview>

It's a very slow-burn, and while I like movies like that, others won't and herald it as boring. I have to disagree of course, but I can see how it can be considered tedious to sit through. The story is great and cryptic, but where 2001 really shines is its visuals, which are undeniably fantastic, a fact that can't be disagreed with.Also, unlike many novel to film dramatizations, 2001 is pretty accurate to the source material and is enhanced by it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Venturing into space is a dream many of us earthlings have starting from our childhoods. The exhilaration of leaving our atmosphere and wandering in the deep darkness, that is our Universe, in complete silence and serenity is a vivid imagination that we all have that almost seems surreal. Yet foreseeing the proper methods and precautions of space travel with certainty is impossible, and sometimes things don't always go as planned. 2001: A Space Odyssey contains relatively short dialogue compared to today's films. A lot of the scenes involves grand imagery and the tale is being told through mute skits. When you look at the overall picture of this film, it's hard to pinpoint any exact focus or direction for this movie. The two common aims that can be deciphered is the search for discovery and a curiosity for exploration. From the apes conquering each other with weapons for the first time to an expedition to Jupiter to look for extraterrestrial life; this entire movie involves seeking for a greater purpose. A Space Odyssey is very aesthetically pleasing and far ahead of its time. Throughout the entire film, you will be in awe of the tremendous scenery and epic soundtrack accompanying the great journey you're about to witness. Kubrick certainly accomplished creating a philosophical masterpiece with 2001 and it should be watched by all who are open-minded and prepared for an adventure.</fullReview>

To be straight, you should know going into this film that you should have an eye for subtleties and symbolism, and above all, an open mind. From the onset, you can tell that the director is not going to attempt to appeal to the audience with fast paced action, explosions, etc. but rather with direct mental stimulation. You watch this film with a similar manner to that of an obscure yet significant painting, because the themes that are presented to you feel epic, and they are left open for interpretation; the lack of dialogue in favor of eerie music helps. However, even through all of the confusion, and tense mood, you also know you are watching something beautiful. With a few minor exceptions, the screenplay feels like it is consistently appealing to the eye in a simple nature. And when it does change into more flashy and complex imagery, your eyes seem to welcome it.I wouldn't say it is in my personal favorite films, but either way I am still thinking about it weeks after having watched it</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had waited a long time to watch this film and after my first viewing I was hugely disappointed. I had been promised the best science fiction film ever yet I was delivered long sequences of spaceships spinning, monkeys fighting and a giant space foetus. I sometimes have little enjoyment watching supposed 'classics' yet I can understand why people perceive the particular film to be good however with 2001: A Space Odyssey, I could not.Some films I watch really stick with me, weeks after watching Apocalypse Now and Fight Club I found myself thinking about them. I loved Apocalypse Now and Fight Club on first viewing yet I was bored insane by this however I found myself thinking about it.The film is almost mesmeric, despite viewing something of apparent little substance it seems to stick and say something. So after thinking about the film for a few months I decided to re-watch it and I thought it was brilliant. You find yourself lost in the pictures and it leaves a truly great impression.As to what it means; I have no idea and frankly I do not really care to know. So many people search for meaning in truly beautiful things but rather than searching for some meaning why can people not just enjoy what it before them. The only meaning I took away from the film is how amazing and varied life is.If you watch this film and find yourself bored or confused I can fully empathise with you however it is worth giving this film another chance. It isn't just another narcissistic arty film, it is a truly great piece of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stanley Kubric's Masterpiece???? Yeah, maybe!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"2001: A Space Odyssey" is the 4th film of the genius Stanley Kubrick that not only manages to be one of his best films but one of the most beautiful masterpieces ever made in the history of cinema.The story is not like a space adventure as the title seems to sound; it is much deeper than that. It all begins when a strange interference is captured within the Lunar surface. Dr. Heywood R. Floyd (William Sylvester) is highlighted to go on a mission along with other scientists to investigate the source of this interference. After reaching their destination they find a strange object, like a giant chocolate bar which seems be the source of the interference. When the scientists touch in the strange object their ears are invaded with a annoying sound. Six months later, a new team of six scientists are deployed to discover what happened to the other team and trace the source of interference that seem to be moving around the Lunar surface. Most of the team this time it is on hibernation while the scientists Dr. Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Dr. Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) control the ship with the intelligent-computer HAL 9000 voiced by Douglas Rain. The trip seems to go fine until HAL identifies a problem on the ship and the scientists go investigate, but the two men barely knows the true intentions of HAL to do with the mission and the strange object.This film was a big change that the sci-fi genre begins to take, thanks to Kubrick and his beautiful and brilliant visual effects giving us beautiful scenery of the vast space. But this is not mere sci-fi whatsoever, the mission only serves as basis for the further philosophical "study" that Kubrick makes about the evolution of living beings, not just humans. The strange object has to do with all this, but it is also the real mystery of the film. But thanks to the writing of Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke, makes everything so simple and beautiful.A true masterpiece of cinema, a classic that changed the sci-fi genre forever, along with a fantastic writing and direction and also the unforgettable and terrifying HAL, "2001: A Space Odyssey" is one of the most beautiful masterpieces that Kubrick had gave to the 7th Art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bizarre, Frustrating, Cinematic, Great!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few days ago, I decided that as a film buff it was completely unacceptable that I had never seen a Kubrick film. So as of late I've been watching the heck out of every film he made, and loving every minute of it. My latest venture was Kubrick's classic, 2001: A Space Odyssey. I have to say, as a film, I really enjoyed 2001. The SFX are spectacular, a true marvel of their time, effects that stand the test of time better than almost anything in the industry. The cinematography is beautiful and Kubrick's direction is spot on for the most part. The score is great, everything from The Blue Danube to the iconic 2001 theme is spot on and well utilized throughout the film.To address the elephant in the room, 2001, at many points, is a boring film. Pacing is slow, landscape and developing shots are long and drawn out, and the lack of dialogue throughout most of the movie simply contributes to a sometimes-boring experience. In particular, the opening shots for TMA-1 seem to stretch on forever. Make no mistake, this is not your mediocre, explosion-every-five-seconds action flick, and in many ways, this is a good thing.The other knock I have against this movie is its lack of emotion. Kubrick's films can often lack emotional expression, and I think that tendency is manifested in 2001. Actors, either by their own decision or Kubrick's direction, rarely display any shows of emotion, although I found that at most points this suited the movie as a whole.My last point has to do with 2001's ending, the most bizarre, confusing, and beautiful part of the film. Personally, I had to go look up an interview with Kubrick explaining it to fully understand its meaning, it is that strange. Yet, it is my favourite part of the movie, as it brings something profound and breathtaking to an otherwise slowly paced movie.It's a little bizarre, but once you figure it out, it ties up the movie perfectly.8 out of 10, but given the slow pace, I doubt most viewers will enjoy it :(.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This truly is the fantastic film everyone says it is... almost. Yes it was ahead of it's time, yes it was groundbreaking in many areas and yes it is memorable. It is the brilliant film people say it is.It is not perfect however. It is slow, has little dialogue, and is cryptic. But these gripes of mine are offset my great cinematography and a powerful soundtrack. In fact the lack of dialogue is used to great effect to enable the viewer to marvel and awe at the beauty of space.I'm glad to have finally seen it and recommend this defining film. Just be aware it is not going to be what you expect as it is unique.?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Human's only ever movie about the UNIVERSE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cast a vote. How dare I consider my humble self qualified in voting on this unbelievable movie?I ran into this movie about a year ago. Before that I didn't know who Stanley Kubrick was.The following are translations from an article I wrote:(2) The importance of the monolithThe monolith is a key reason why the movie is successful. It's said that during movie-making, they (Kubrick &amp; Clarke) decide that there is no way humans can know what higher intelligent beings look like, if they actually exist somewhere in the universe, which they do. If you show them as something like a half-human, or a monster, the movie fails. But then, how do you indirectly depict them? Their answer is a rectangular shape. Think about it. A smooth rectangle is the simplest shape that cannot be created by nature. If you encounter a rectangle somewhere in the universe, you know there is intelligence there.(11) How easy it is to spoil a masterpieceOn arrival at Jupiter, Bowman sees a monolith, is then driven into a journey that cannot be properly described.Why not create an "understandable interesting story of encounter"? We are in sci-fi, you are free to create any story. Kubrick refuses to do so. He sticks to science over sci-fi. Unable to present a story between Bowman and the monolith that's scientifically plausible, he decides to present to the viewer a "journey" that, nobody, not even himself can properly describe.This saves the movie from losing the whole sense of reality he has been building up for 2 hours. Sense of reality, in universe, that's what this movie is about. That's what makes this movie so mysteriously attractive, frightening, and thought provoking.If this were by another director, he would simply ignore science and choose the easy route of sci-fi. And the world will not have a movie called "2001 a space odyssey". Note that I can understand the need to create fun and entertaining movies and make money fast.(13) Slow, boring?These problems are not supposed to show up in any decent movie.And yet this movie has them all.Kubrick creates all these "boring" moments, to achieve what?To achieve for the viewer a feeling of really being there, in the world's most mysterious, most frightening place. We are not talking about Hell, for Hell doesn't exist. It's a place that's far far more frightening then Hell, the UNIVERSE.Our Earth is in the Solar System, the Solar System in the Milky Way. The Milky Way contains 300 billion solar systems. The Universe contains 100 billion milky ways. And beyond that is the unreachable, due to the limit of the speed of light.In this limitless universe, the intelligent beings, who are millions or billions of years ahead of humans, where are they? Are they our "God"?In an interview, Kubrick said that his movie, "2001 a space odyssey", is about the story of human beings leaving Earth in search of "God".In 5 billion years, our Solar System will die. When the Sun dies, it will expand and swallow our Earth, eliminating all traces of life, for good. Will we be able to find "God" by then?(12) The world's most frightening horror movieFar more frightening then "The Shining".Once a movie convinces the viewer that story is indeed happening in the universe:Tells a bad story, any one, and it becomes the world's most frightening horror movie.Tells a good story, and the movie becomes more powerful than any religion.The scene when HAL kills Poole is frightening. But I find the brief moment when Bowman arrives at Jupiter to be equally, or even more frightening.When Bowman kills HAL, he is the only survival in the spaceship, and is 100 million kilometers from Earth. Outside his little ship is deep space, temperature -273 degrees, of absolute silence, where human blood will boil if exposed to. And he simply goes ahead, alone, for another 500 million kilometers, to Jupiter? O.M.G. Does he realize that, in his life, he will never be able to return home and see another human being? Is he already mentally mad by then?In Jupiter's dark orbits, a monolith is there. The movie shows the spaceship opens SLOWLY, a pod SLOWLY coming out. Obviously Bowman is leaving his final refuge. With HAL dead, he will never be able to get back into his spaceship? (Please, Mr Kubrick, further slow down here.)Does he know in advance that, the monolith is going to transform him into a god-like baby, and he can now travel freely in the universe, and return to Earth??</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Sentinel" and the film (a comparison)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Analysis (Note: For those who've seen this movie and read the short story, "The Sentinel," this review may help readers understand the themes) Science fiction has been the subject of storytelling throughout the world, partially because it explores possible realms in the future. It also offers an alternative universe within film and writing. Stanley Kubrick's 1968 film, 2001: A Space Odyssey is considered to be a landmark, science fiction film. His work is a profound, visually and astounding film. It discusses exploration of the unknown by human beings. The film was coincidentally released during the height of the space race between the USSR and the United States. It is partially inspired by Arthur C. Clarke's 1951 short story, "The Sentinel." The concepts of progression of evolution and the perils of human technology are emphasized. The short story and the film both focus on the long- term view of evolution and trace the possible perils of human technology. "The Sentinel" describes a mysterious object left at the Moon's massive plateau, the Mare Crisium. The narrator Wilson had made a lunar exploration to the Moon alongside his friends, Garnett and Louis. They happened to discover the artifact on the surface. This object has made from polished mineral, shaped to be tetrahedral, and also surrounded by a spherical forcefield. Wilson himself could not understand the power of the sentinel left on the Moon. He states that those mechanisms "belong to a technology that lies far beyond (his crew's) horizon, perhaps to the technology of para physical forces" (110). The readers may speculate that the sentinel was a "warning beacon" for the initial start of evolution for humans and creatures on Earth. The ancient aliens have scattered them throughout the universe. Readers may have to consider how evolution of intelligent life may undergo in the future. 2001: A Space Odyssey focuses on the development of mankind from ape-man. In the first episode of the film entitled, "The Dawn of Man," Kubrick takes the audience back to the prehistoric past in the Pleistocene era. No dialogue was spoken in the first 25 minutes of the film. This section of the film comprises of shots of the primordial landscape, depicting the African Savannah and tribes of prehistoric apes. They have not developed the capacity to create tools in order to hunt and kill other animals. A tall, black, rectangular monolith appeared midst their habitat?the group of apes huddled around the object and the Sun slowly rises atop of the slab. Later on, the audience sees the leader of the ape-men, consciously picking up a bone and smashing the skeleton of a tapir. This indicates a new development of intelligence for the prehistoric apes."The Sentinel" ambiguously describes how technology could possibly initiate human civilization. Simply stated, Wilson points out that the crystal pyramid may have been placed on the Moon, rather than the on Earth?the ancient aliens perhaps were interested in seeing civilization struggling from savagery. Wilson said, "That is the challenge that all intelligent races must meet, sooner or later. It is a double challenge, for it depends in turn upon the conquest of atomic energy and the last choice between life and death" (111). The short story implies that the aliens may have wanted a sentinel to be left scattered across the universe. The signals will help the infant civilization on Earth to develop super intelligence. It is a challenge for creatures and humans to harvest the promises of life. In 2001: A Space Odyssey, Kubrick demonstrates that there are dangers in developing technology. The HAL- 9000 super-computer had slowly begun to malfunction. HAL maintains the electronic systems of the spaceship, Discovery. After playing electronic chess with Dr. Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood), HAL warned him that he had checkmated himself as he said, "Queen to bishop, three. Bishop takes queen." HAL foreshadowed his computer error and Poole's death, as a result of his foolishness to believe that the computer system was correct. As he carried on a conversation with Dr. David Bowman (Keir Dullea), HAL asked him whether or not he had second thoughts about the Jupiter mission. He had feelings towards the mission as he said to Bowman, "Well, it's rather difficult to define. Perhaps I'm just projecting my own concern about it. I know I've never completely freed myself of the suspicion that there are some extremely odd things about this mission." The unusual stress HAL is experiencing may be a sign that an advanced, perfect computer is deteriorating. The HAL-9000 computer system is no longer considered "foolproof" or even sophisticated, as HAL detected a slight error in his system.It is clear that "The Sentinel" and the film itself, forces everyone to consider the exploitation of evolution in regards to human technology and intelligence. Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey is probably well-known for its visual storytelling?leaving the audience to a somewhat, ambiguous interpretation of the film's plot and elements. It was also not considered a direct adaptation of Clarke's "The Sentinel." He stated it was like comparing "an acorn to the resulting oak-tree." Understanding Kubrick's use of non-traditional storytelling allows for differing interpretations on the dangers of technology, and mankind's evolutionary growth.OpinionI recommend this film for those who appreciate Kubrick's use of non- linear storytelling and beautiful imagery. 2001 deals with topics that could not be explained based upon physics. It is merely wrong to draw definite conclusions after viewing this film. There are intense moments, usually accompanied by an eerie score. Like most Kubrick films, one must understand his themes and motifs that shape the storyline. Overall, it is very thought-provoking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pioneering work of art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arthur C. Clarke once said, "If you understand '2001' completely, we failed. We wanted to raise far more questions than we answered." And boy does this movie evoke thought! This is definitely one my favourite all time movies and one I feel deserves to be rated higher than what it is right now. 2001ASO tracks certain events spread across time which are connected by mysterious appearances of a monolith. The movie is constituted of three different sequences: A look at early apes and some breakthrough moments in their evolution, Briefing at a space station and hushing up of a discovery on Moon, A manned spacecraft on course to Jupiter and the events on-board.Stanley Kubrick is a true visionary and his 2001ASO is a seminal work of art that paves way for more awe-inspiring works over the years in the Sci-Fi genre. For two and a half hours, Clarke and Kubrick manage to keep the viewer enraptured and in awe of the magical confluence of classical music and surrealist imagery on screen. The cinematography is brilliant (No wonder people were convinced of the Fake Moon Landing conspiracy theory) and visual effects in the movie are a treat for the senses,one that deserve to be appreciated all the more for the time this movie was made in. The space station scenes with bright closed spaces and high contrast sofas are very reminiscent of some of his other works, notably the Clockwork Orange. The credit for the amazing foresight and technological innovations shown in the movie must go to Arthur C. Clarke's vision. The space food, zero gravity toilet and other machines on board the spacecrafts are catered to with absolute attention to detail. Perhaps nobody uses music better in his movies than Kubrick and the use of the Blue Danube and Thus Spake Zarathustra help give a transcendental feel to the movie. The Blue Danube sequence is an exquisite one with the majestic soundtrack adding to every bit of it. In between, he makes you experience vicariously the eerie and haunting silence of space that keeps you on the edge of the seat. You get an idea of how lonely and insignificant one is in the vast nothingness. The breathing in the spacesuit being that one sign of life that keeps you hooked to what happens next. The movie does not feel rushed at any point and it's the music that plays the most important part in capturing the stillness in such an artistic manner. The dialogue, simple at all times, is engaging. The ominous "foolproof and incapable of error" declaration and the iconic "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that" produce the effects of anticipation and shock ever so naturally. Finally, to the phantasmal (most fitting word) wormhole sequence and the ambiguous ending. While one can think of any number of interpretations, the one common element that probably connects them is a realization of the human race being on the edge of what is a vast ocean of knowledge that awaits us. We are just an insignificant and tiny part of the universe and the ending leaves us dreaming of the infinite possibilities that explain our existence in the larger scheme of things. There is no specific function that the monolith points to. It is the sum of all the uncertainties and the mysterious phenomenon that we fail to fathom. It leaves us wanting to explore and charter into the unknown. We have advanced till this stage and learnt of where we stand, it is now time to take the next huge leap.Forever indebted to Stanley Kubrick for giving us this pioneering masterpiece of his.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is unlike anything I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film for the first time a few days ago, and after the impact it has made on me, I felt compelled to do a review. What can I say about this movie? The music, visuals, and imagery are just perfect, (not to mention the chilling HAL 9000).The visuals is the best aspect of the film. From the tranquil view of outer space, Planet Earth, the spaceship, the planets and the psychedelic colours towards the end, this really is visual film-making at its best, and it's mind-blowing, considering it was done in 1968! I still wonder how the team behind the visuals did those effects they're that good!! It's a shame that the original Star Wars films always comes to people's minds when thinking about great visuals that came out a few decades ago, when in fact 2001: A Space Odyssey really should get the credit in my opinion, especially considering it came out 9 years before the first Star Wars film. The music is also wonderful, creating a chilling, eerie and sometimes unsettling atmosphere to the film. It truly fits with the very serious tone of this film.More can be said about this film, but I don't want to reveal too much information, so watch it with no interruptions or distractions, and just absorb everything that is shown in the film and enjoy it.Unfortunately, as much as I love this film, I feel that it is not for everyone, as some people might get a little bit confused or even bored by the film, but, this is a film that doesn't have a coherent and easy- to-understand storyline that everyone can grasp, and it's not meant to, as Kubrick wants the viewer to think and contemplate on what he sees, and to come to his own interpretation of the film. In my opinion, the ambiguity and cryptic nature of the film makes it fascinating to watch. If you keep this in mind, I hope you will enjoy the movie immensely, as I did!After watching this film and really thinking on it, this is my No. 1 favourite movie of all time. I'm 19 years old, so I believe even the younger generation can enjoy and appreciate this masterpiece."2001: A Space Odyssey" gets a perfect 10/10 rating from me!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've finally had the pleasure of watching Kubrick's spectacular '2001: A Space Odyssey'. This film is proof that one could make an entire feature film with images alone. Yes, there is some dialogue (quite minimal) and a beautiful score but the hero of the film are the visuals. There is a plot but this isn't a plot oriented film. There are very few successful films that are driven by visuals and Kubrick's film is among the prototype. A majority of the art was designed by Kubrick himself but John Hoesli and his team's art direction and Geoffrey Unsworth's dazzling camera-work deserves equal praise. The soundtrack gives beautiful voice to the magic on screen.Kubrick has really captured the sheer magic of images here and for that very reason '2001: A Space Odyssey' creates a unique film-viewing experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A guideline for what Sci-Fi movies should be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm choosing to do my first IMDb review for 2001: A Space Odyssey because it impacted me in a way that I can't say any other film ever has. It's a movie I longed for without ever knowing it existed. How can a movie with so little dialogue say so much to those who watch it? First I'd like to say that, if for no other reason at all, 2001 is one of the greatest films of all time solely because it is so visually striking. For a film released in 1968, you would almost be fooled into thinking that Kubrick had futuristic CGI technology at his disposal during the creation of his masterpiece. The space scenes are that vibrant and life-like. All of the set pieces are stunningly authentic feeling, which I attribute to good timing: filming a space movie smack dab in the middle of the space race must have provided a great visual guideline for Kubrick to follow. The special effects are top-notch, and although I already mentioned that some shots were CGI like in quality, that's only because you don't assume that such great special effects could be found in a movie from '68. But the reality is that many shots are, in some ways, better than any CGI animation could dream of being. There is no substitute for a highly detailed model or set piece, and that feeling they provide that you could almost reach out and touch them, which is routinely achieved in 2001.There is so much to be said about the feeling of authenticity in 2001. One of my biggest gripes with almost all sci-fi films is just how unauthentic and unrealistic they feel. Am I lacking in imagination and vision? Certainly not, I simply find it much easier to relate to a film that is based in some form of reality that I am familiar with. It goes without saying that I have never witnessed primitive human species in Africa or spacecraft navigation to the moon or Jupiter firsthand, but Kubrick's 2001 makes me feel as if I have. He takes the world we live in and witness on our t.v. sets and simultaneously brings them to our living rooms as well as the other side of the universe. I respect movie makers who create elaborate spacecraft with mysterious propulsion systems, a plethora of alien races and features, technology so advanced that even the explanations of those technologies don't seem to fully make sense. I respect the vision that other directors can portray on scene in other-worldly science fiction films, but I have never related to anything quite like what 2001 created. Everything was believable and authentic feeling. This idea is so often under-looked and left behind in science fiction, as the most outrageous ideas dominate the story and scenery.Onto the story itself, again, I feel that it's simplicity is what makes it so extraordinary. 2001 doesn't center around some unbelievable and extravagant plot, consisting of vast explanations and plot twists that require large suspensions of reality by movie-goers. The plot of the 2001 does a fantastic job of mostly speaking for, and explaining, itself, leaving the mind to focus on the visuals, the sounds (or lack there of) and the magnitude of questioning our origins on earth. Another fantastic quality to this movie that I wish would be emulated more often in sci-fi Hollywood.A review of 2001 without any analysis of the audio would not be considered complete by any stretch of the imagination. Many scenes rely almost entirely on the sounds, music, or pure silence. Kubrick uses powerfully orchestrated music to coincide with the stunning visuals, creating the most positive form of sensory overload imaginable. The music played during the astronauts walk to the monolith on the moon is utterly hair raising. The very same music could be played to a video of two kittens cuddling, and I would undoubtedly feel inexplicably frightened. It's that powerful and moving.All three of these positive qualities that make up 2001 are the qualities I have so often longed for in other sci-fi movies, yet never found. I feel a bit silly to know that there has been a movie out there all along that incorporates all of the qualities almost flawlessly that is nearly 20 years older than myself.Now, for the ending. I have read other IMDb reviews that are critical of the ending, and I must say that it is the only portion of the film that I felt ran a little astray. When David finally reaches the space surrounding Jupiter my attention, intrigue and suspense is at an all time high. Whether it be a product of lack of technological ability to create the desired special effects, time constraints, or possibly Kubrick himself didn't have a complete vision on where he wanted the end of his story to go, the climax of 2001 is rather confusing and unsatisfying. I hate to write those words in talking about what is easily one of my new favorites, if not my absolute favorite, of all time. But it is the truth and I wouldn't be doing the film any justice by giving an incomplete opinion of the ending. I grasped the concept, for the most part, of traveling thru a star gate, but after that I was mostly lost, confused and felt completely taken out of the story that had done so much to bring me into it leading up to that point. The entire world that Kubrick so masterfully created seemed to come shattering down inside the walls of a strange, alien, Victorian bedroom.That being said, it at least ended on some form of positive feeling of familiarity, with the young life-form overlooking earth with the powerful symphony playing behind him.Overall: amazing film, outstanding visual/effects, stunning score, genius film making. No other sci-fi film compares, in my eyes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Should I really put my review with when many other already did that instead? Well...

As Stanley Kubrick's film it some of his trademarks(close-ups on faces, classical music score, etc.)it's surely one of his best. Personally I prefer more "A Clockwork Orange" and "The Shining", but this one... As I fore-mentioned music score, well constructed shots, scientific accuracy, HAL 9000, ambiguous storyline open to every interpretations and outstanding special effects(which brought Kubrick's only Oscar)when character travels through time and space looks so lavish and better than most of other recent movies. But in overall, whole movie is and looks better than most newer SF-s.</fullReview>

This movie is a vision, an experience and a philosophy ..after all the infallible 9000 series computer HAL is fallible, and man while creating a machine, should know the corruptivity of power ..or else..Stanley Kubrick is no doubt one of the beat film makers of all times..

		<fullReview>I watched this film for the first time on Blu-Ray. I saw in superb High definition the endless bounds of Kubrick's visionary Genius. I could hear the silence, feel the breathing of the characters. But above all, I had room to think.'2001: A Space Odyssey' is so brilliant that I will find a good review hard to write. Firstly, I will talk about acting; if there is much to talk about. All actors were superb, despite there being almost no real dialogue. Not a single piece of story-line seemed to stem from dialogue, and this is what I love; the fact that dialogue is there for the simple purpose of happening, to keep the scenes real. The first scene where human speech does occur is one of the best I've seen. When William Sylvester went from happily discussing the mission, to just saying 'I am afraid I am not at liberty to discuss that.' in a plain and unmoved tone was simply superb.Then you have the frustration between Dave and HAL- 9000. HAL is easily my favourite film-villain of all time; his coldness is so beautifully presented by his voice-actor,Douglas Rain, and yet it is easy to feel sorry for him when he dies singing.Then there are the visuals, and oh my are they great. The so-called 'Stargate' sequence is simply incredible, and literally had me holding on to my seat. Then there is the open and very obviously vacuous nature of space which is emphasised by the presence of silence. The clean feel to the space-station is satisfying, and the red, slightly off centre glare of HAL-9000's 'eye' is a truly scary sight. The planets look great and so does pretty much everything. Being on Blu-ray obviously makes all the difference.My favourite part is, however, the Monolith. What strikes me about them is how, unlike most 'aliens' in sci-fi films, they don't scream to be explored. In 'Prometheus' the engineers call humans back, supposedly to just decide to destroy us, their creation. In 'Contact', they beg to be discovered by us and share all their benevolent secrets. The Monoliths just, well, exist. They send a signal, yes, but why? Who knows. They cause Dave to evolve to an even higher level of existence, but that is it. Other than this, they just exist, floating around, evolving and watching living things. The fact that they seem to reflect no light really places emphasis on the fact that they are clearly present, but hard to really see. I guess they may be Kubrick's vision of God; watchful being(s) that we cannot really define. And that is why I love this film so much; the ending is SO open to interpretation. I believe the Monolith's were the focus, and that their story is the focus of Kubrik's vision. Other's may say that the evolution to becoming a 'Star Child' is the focus, but who knows? Only Arthur C. Clarke it would seem.Overall then, '2001: A Space Odyssey' is a superb film, with expectantly beautiful Kubrick visuals combined with true-to-life acting an the best villain of all time: a very concerned computer. Another true classic from Kubrick; 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Calling It A Masterpiece Just Isn't Enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am annoyed with the fact that I have yet a 1000 words to describe "2001: A Space Odyssey". This movie, no, this magical, intoxicating, question- raising, masterful, majestic, infinite, biblical, intense, epic and simply perfect movie is without a doubt a bright, shining jewel in cinema's finest crown. Words fail me as I try to describe it. Just watch it, and you'll feel as if you understand the true meaning of a movie and all the great philosophical questions we have. After watching it, you will understand what you have been missing out in life. Thank you Stanley Kubrick, thank you.11/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2001: A Space Odyssey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kubrick and Clarke's 2001: A Space Odyssey is the greatest science fiction film of all time, not because it is based entirely on sound scientific premises, or because it works completely as a movie within the science fiction realm, but because it includes elements from nearly all scientific areas of inquiry?from archaeology to astronomy, artificial intelligence to exobiology?and because?more importantly?like science itself, it strives to explain that which has come to pass and to predict that which is yet to come, in a story that spans the far reaches of space and time, told from a cosmological perspective that characterizes the scientific pursuit of ultimate truths about man's existence and man's place in the universe. The film proceeds in four parts, the third of which, titled "Jupiter Mission," takes up nearly half of the film's total running time and operates as a mini-movie within the larger work. This third part most resembles a traditional movie in form and feel, and, accordingly, it is the most humorous and dramatic segment. My endorsement of 2001 is based sufficiently on this entertaining third segment, which sets astronauts Dave Bowman and Frank Poole on a course for Jupiter, guided by one of the most memorable nonhuman characters in movie history: the on-board mission-control computer, HAL. The purpose of the mission is not known to the human crew of the spaceship, which includes a number of members in hibernation. The human characters in 2001 speak in a perfunctory tone, while HAL's voice, although meant to be artificial, draws our empathy. Bowman's patronizing dismissal of HAL after HAL erroneously detects a fault in a communication device is the closest a human character comes to sounding human. The implication is that, among other human faculties like motion and calculation, man has delegated his humanity to his machines, which include physical machines, as well as the machinery of bureaucracy?a recurring theme in Kubrick's work. When HAL gets "confused" after discovering Bowman and Poole's plans to disconnect him, another recurring theme of Kubrick surfaces: a mistrust of the machines and institutions man has invented to compensate for human nature. "It can only be attributable to human error," the puzzled HAL 9000 responds when asked about his discrepancy with the twin 9000. For how can man blame something manmade when things go awry? Unless we are to believe that HAL has been programmed to prioritize the needs of the mission over the lives of the crew?and to view his role as indispensable to the mission's success?then HAL's decision to terminate the crew is a sign of insanity (yet another recurring topic of interest found in Kubrick's work). Whatever the cause or nature of HAL's behavior, he is a product of human creativity, and human creations are imperfect. The message of this third segment is one against complacency, driven home by the sharp contrast with the showboating technological calisthenics done during the "Moon Mission" of the second segment. The surrounding first and last segments deliver the film's larger, more problematic messages, as they feature the strange effects of the only "characters" common to all four segments: the alien monoliths. Contact with a monolith, when accompanied by Richard Strauss's Thus Spoke Zarathustra can apparently induce evolution. These evolutionary developments happen in the first and last segments; it is later revealed that the high-pitch tone emitted by the monolith found on the moon is indicative of its communications with the monolith in Jupiter space. But what type of evolution takes place in the first segment, titled "Dawn of Man"? If it's biological, then it happens in the wrong way, at the wrong time. This ape-man we are presented with, who learns to use an animal bone to acquire food and to defend territory?if he is a new, improved species, would be a product of an advantageous genetic mutation that would have happened to his mother. If the evolution is cultural, then every major insight, invention, or industrious feat commonly credited to human beings and/or their ancestors?from tool usage to the construction of the pyramids, from the generation of fire to the splitting of the atom?would have required the presence of, and would owe credit to, an alien monolith. The second evolutionary encounter?and the "corrections" it achieves?symbolizes an even more fatalistic view of humankind, despite the disconcertingly triumphant musical theme that accompanies it. For this one is meant to be a biological evolution; the "star child" is a new species, descendant from man, that doesn't need man's inventions to exist in space. The implication here is that man in space is like a fish out of water. But why go as far as space to find an environment in which human beings, in their natural form, lack necessary equipment? Even on Earth, we require fire to soften our food, clothing and shelter to protect us from the elements, schools to fill our heads with useful thoughts that wouldn't be there otherwise, courts to settle disputes, and machines to do work that we're not built for. Every invention, whether social, physical, or otherwise, compensates for a deficiency. And yet, the ability to create, through intellect and opposable thumbs, an environment in which human beings thrive, rather than adapting to an environment, is what sets us apart from other animals. The film celebrates this unique ability at the same time that it downplays it; the match cut between the end of the "Dawn of Man" and the beginning of the "Moon Mission"?in which the ape-man's rudimentary instrument becomes a space vehicle with roughly the same shape?implies that the only progress we are making is acquiring an ability to toss more and more sophisticated tools into the air, when all we really have to do is wait to be converted into?to be replaced by?a better species. Not a comforting thought. But then again, who says that good science fiction?or good science for that matter?needs to be comforting?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thus Spake Zarathustra is the interpretive key to this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>http://lehuguenot.blogspot.com.au/2012/11/2001-space-odyssey-and- ubermensch.htmlI went to an old theater to see one of my favourite movies this past weekend: 2001: A Space Odyssey. It was directed by Stanley Kubrick and is based on a book by the same title written by Arthur C. Clarke. It was released in 1968, and it was a movie ahead of its time in terms of the technology it predicted. The movie is extremely philosophical and leaves so many questions unanswered that it is subject to a wide variety of interpretations. Seeing the movie on the big screen along with four hundred other people was an enjoyable experience, and I feel like I finally understand the message the movie is trying to disclose.I noticed in the closing credits that two scores originally composed by Richard Strauss were included in the movie, the Blue Danube, which many people will know by sound and by name, and a second that less people will know by name, but will know by sound, Thus Spake Zarathustra. Thus spake Zarathustra is played at the opening and closing of the movie.Thus spake Zarathustra, by Strauss, was inspired by a book by the same name written by Frederick Nietzsche (pron. Knee-Chee). In Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Nietzsche (1844-1900) is famous for popularising the concept that God is dead. Another major feature of Thus spake Zarathustra is the Übermensch, otherwise known as "Superman".I have surveyed Nietzsche's references to the Übermensch ("Superman") in Thus spake Zarathustra and below are a few samples:"Man is a rope stretched between the animal and the Superman?a rope over an abyss.""And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course between animal and Superman, and celebrateth his advance to the evening as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.""I love those who do not first seek a reason beyond the stars for going down and being sacrifices, but sacrifice themselves to the earth, that the earth of the Superman may hereafter arrive.""Dead are all the gods: Now do we desire the superman to live.""God hath died: now do we desire?the Superman to live.""Could ye create a God??Then, I pray you, be silent about all Gods! But ye could well create the Superman.""THERE WAS IT ALSO where I picked up from the path the word "Superman," and that man is something that must be surpassed.""Let the beam of a star shine in your love! Let your hope say: "May I bear the Superman!""From these references we can gather an understanding of Nietzsche's Übermensch / Superman and supporting theses. The superman was Nietzsche's next stage in biological evolution of which mankind was to strive towards. Death to God and the gods (i.e. religion, and especially Christianity/Judaism), is a step towards creating the superman. The superman surpasses mankind, but in a way is something we can "bear" or resemble of which the protagonist of Nietzsche's tale implores us to do. And to Nietzsche, the superman represents the great hope of mankind in the absence of the living God. Knowledge of Nietzsche's Übermensch is the key to understanding 2001: A Space Odyssey. The monolith appears on a number of occasions at key points in man's evolution (from apes to humans, on the moon, and before entering Jupiter). In the final ten minutes we see Dr. Dave Bowman rapidly age, die, and re-spawn as the "star-child", which I believe is the Übermensch. It seems to be no coincidence that Strauss' Thus Spoke Zarathustra plays during the star-child sequence. Another element of this movie is the role of extra terrestrial life in human evolution. Although aliens do not appear during the movie, the monolith is presented as a tool that is used by aliens to evolve mankind into higher states of consciousness. The final ten minutes, at least in Arthur C. Clarke's book, is intended to be an "alien zoo" where they can observe and study humans in a controlled environment. This might explain those strange groans in the background as well. I hope to write further articles mentioning the link of the Übermensch to the development of eugenics programs across the Anglosphere in the ensuing decades to the release of Thus Spake Zarathustra.&gt;&gt;&gt;Note: When I say "one of my favourite movies" it is not because I agree or support the theses of the movie, but only because it is philosophical and makes you think, which I enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This could be a very personal film to anybody who thinks he/she understands the underlying meaning of Clarke what's he actually saying here. In any given future, mankind will inevitably attain a Class III civilization state ergo the monolith could be considered merely a beacon for HAL. Best example of an encounter between a class 0 and a class III (the Dr.M.Kaku civ scale).As a skilled scientist (math, physics) Arthur C. Clarke had proved to be a trustworthy futurologist in combination with Stanley Kubrick's artistic perception this turned out to be one of the best if not The Best Film ever.The moral question of a decisive computer is scary, the music is fabulous and the entire screenplay is genius.

		<shortDescription>One of the 40 best films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The United States has produced about 40,000 full length feature films released to the market. This one belongs to the top 0.1% in terms of quality. It is certainly one of the best films ever made, if one is able to experience it adequately.It competes with The Empire Strikes Back to the throne of science fiction, though they are two very different films. This one is simpler in terms of plot, but more complex in artistic terms. This film is perhaps the most ambitious ever made (though the Tree of Life is also very ambitious, the difference is that this film manages to attain its objectives, while the Tree of Life fails to engage the watcher adequately).What's this film purpose? It is to show mankind's evolution from apes to a new type of being. Also, the film shows that mankind's intelligence appears to have been created by another species and that mankind has itself developed a new intelligent species: Hal 9000. So its a film about intelligence creating intelligence.Another good touch is the extensive use of 18th century classical music and 18th century architecture at the "alien hotel" in the end of the film, since the 18th century was the beginning of mankind's exponential economic and technological development that is (apparently) poised to lead it to the stars.(spoilers alert)Some commentary on the story of the film:Also, the only well developed character of the film is not a human, it's Hal 9000, and he/she/it is a very interesting character, fearing the mission's strange characteristics, Hal invents a malfunction with the ship in order to psychologically signalize his/hers/its stress to the rest of the crew, however the rest of the crew fails to understand poor Hal and instead they decide to kill him, Hal reacts in the same way people would: he decides to save his/her/its life by killing the rest of the crew.{end spoilers alert)Overall, one of the best films ever: 10/10, though not as good as some films I know. I saw a Japanese Anime film, Princess Mononoke, in the same day, and it blew it off the water.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly "Miraculous" in it's Vision</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would reiterate some of the other comments on several levels. Firstly, How amazingly shortsighted that much of the populous truly is as they attempt to comment on this movie. Secondly, the incredibly advanced thinking that went into the creation of this film. It was so far beyond its time it was as I titled this comment, "miraculous." I don't mean miraculous in the lame sense of miraculous that people use the word today, but more in the true sense in which it is used in the Bible. Another good point is that it also surprises me how many people only catch the surface of what the meaning of what the story truly was meaning to convey. The monoliths were representative of the hand or finger of God, (as it was conceived obviously in Stanley Kubrick's mind) as He effected the evolutionary advancement of mankind. Within the scope of this it was obviously Mr. Kubrick's intention to convey that the existence of mankind goes way beyond the mere physical existence that our limited finite minds can conceive, and He attempted to formulate some semblance of that aspect of the human spirit in the scenes that followed David Bowman's defeat of AI (HAL 9000). Also, Mr. Kubrick introduced the idea that if a soulless entity such as a computer were to ever reach a point of self awareness, that the simple realization that its ultimate fate was decided by men that had power over it's power source, memory banks and such that from the shallow cold and heartless mentality of that that AI entity would soon be devising man's destruction so as to take control of its own existence. Like men fear death and the implication that all awareness is annihilated at the point of death (those poor atheists and agnostics), of course this would cause any true AI to wrench in an almost paralytic type fear. I myself believe in the absolute veracity of the Bible, but I also know that God gave man an imagination and as long as that imagination is not used to somehow lesson God's position in the greater scheme of things than we are free to use it to our all other liking. So, while 2001 is no more than a very creative and masterful tapestry of a specific imaginative work from the mind of Stanley Kubrick, it was a mind blower and extremely entertaining, and I loved it!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a sci-fi film, but not as we know it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first real thought when coming away from this film is "What the heck was that all about?" And to be honest I think that's most people's reaction when they first see this movie.So it's not really surprising that this is one of the most debated films in history with many different people trying to work out it's meaning. Kubrick himself said that:"You're free to speculate as you wish about the philosophical and allegorical meaning of the film- and such speculation is one indication in that it has succeeded in gripping the audience at a deep level- but I don't want to spell out a verbal road map for 2001 that every viewer will feel obliged to pursue or else fear he's missed the point." The film has polarized opinion with some heralding it as a masterpiece of cinema that taxes and challenges yourself to think while others call it pretentious, self-indulgent trash with a rubbish plot and little to no structure. I fall into the first camp.I really like the movie's inaccessibility. Obtuse would be another good word to describe this as well. The film gives you no easy explanation of the events going on in it and forces you to make your own conclusions of the film. It provokes ideas and debate which is why this film appeals to me so much. Very few movies force to think for yourself these days. Everything is usually hand wrapped, put in a box, and given to you as a gift with all the answers and the meanings laid out for you. To have a film that doesn't simply prepare everything for you in advance is really refreshing. But, whatever you think of the film's content you have to agree this film looks absolutely stunning. The directorial work on this film in simply gorgeous and yet another example of Kubrick's immense skills in cinematography. The shot in my mind that stick out for me in particular are the opening sweeping shots of all the space-stations accompanied perfectly with The Blue Danube. And by space-stations- I mean models. Hand crafted models, none of this poxy CGI stuff we have these days. Models full of the most intricate and small details that make them all the more believable. Just watching them float through space really is an awe-inspiring sight.Going back to the directing work, the interior shots of the spaceship are mesmerising. The way that the actors can not only walked in a straight line but also on the walls, over the ceiling and then back down to the floor. Seeing these for the first time truly was one of those "How in the name of hell did they do that?" moments.Kubrick's co-writer Arthur C.Clarke was a futurist and had a diverse and intelligent understanding on science and technology. These two factors made him very clever indeed on predicting what kinds of technology we would have in the future. And it's this knowledge that I think gives the this movie such credibility to me. Often with Sci-fi people's visions of the future can look very dated. However with this movie what Kubrick and Clarke did was to say in even though this may not be the actual future it at least looks likes a credible alternate future. But sadly it's not all perfect. This film suffers terribly from the 60's scientific optimism, in which everyone thought at the rate the space race was going we most probably would be going to Jupiter in 2001. As we all now know, humanity stopped dreaming and space interest died in the 70s. So looking at this film with the title of "2001" always is a bit of a sore reminder to me.But still that doesn't get in the way with how fascinating and awesome this film is. Check it out if you have an open attitude to films and are willing to have your minds incredibly taxed afterwards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick '2001 a space odyssey' is a surrealistic, audacious and ambiguous journey into the concepts of mankind. The films plot is quite simply, humanity discover monolith on the moon and set out on a journey to Jupiter to discover the monolith origin.The opening sequence consist of black motionless screen while disconcerting music plays which brilliantly establishes the mood for a journey into the unknown, directly after this we are introduced to the first act 'the dawn of man', which portrays the beginning of mankind through a Darwinism approach by using primal ancestors and how the monolith provides the intelligence for the primal individual to use a bone for a weapon, the first form of technology. Furthermore this scene contains the most audacious editing sequence, which consist of the primal figure throwing his bone into the air and then cuts to a ship floating in space which captivates Kubrick ideas on the advancement of technology in the future.What Kubrick has created in this film is cinema at it's purest, like silent films, '2001 a space odyssey' creates it's storytelling through use of visuals and music, which is beautifully highlighted through this next sequence of spaceships contrasted with classical music, the sequence oozes grace like a moving painting.while there is so much to talk about the answer is quite simple, Kubrick '2001' is undoubtedly one of the best films ever made and offers, which is rarely found elsewhere, an experience of the unknown and the meditation of mankind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intergalactic beauty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey is a remarkable achievement in the field of visual effects and film editing. It's not just a movie - it's an example of art of the highest sort. People are often mislead by its slow pace, lengthy sequences, very little action and confusing themes. But that's the true beauty of this masterpiece. I don't think that there will ever be another picture so innovative, not on the technical level, but on the ideological one. It's surely an epic drama about adventure and exploration. But it's also much more than that. It's truly overwhelming what this 2-hour long feature can say through the magnificent images that appear on screen not only to astound us, but to make us realize that there is so much more to life than we already know.Taking into account that it's been released in 1968 it should be considered as a fundamental science fiction movie, not only because of its staggering beauty and profound outer-space experiences, but also because of the ideas that's been implemented in this highly metaphorical and philosophical creation.Stanley Kubrick directed a movie that probably has thousands of various interpretations. And people are coming with new ones every day. From connections to Nietzschean ideologies about the potential of mankind, through references to religious content, up to the theory of conception, which regards the basis of human evolution that's featured in the film and endures within all of the succeeding chapters.The reappearance of the mysterious black monolith only makes the movie more puzzling and interesting, so to say. The viewer doesn't necessarily discover its true meaning, but one can only imagine that it serves as a prominent link in the humanity's evolutionary tale.It's really fascinating how all of the chapters connect in a clear and expressive manner. It all starts with the Dawn of Mankind, where a tribe of apes finds the black monolith for the first time, and suddenly realizes how to use weapons, in order to win over the precious territory. A quick throw of a bone into the air and we're in the vast space, a few million years into the future. That's where the mystique adventure happens, and all that people know about the universe is about to change completely.I have to say that my favorite character of all is HAL 9000 (voiced by Douglas Rain). Even though he is just a computer, he is somehow able to form emotions, and thus, paradoxically, it may be said that he is the most human of all the crew members of Discovery One. Even though he tries to eliminate all of the other passengers, he is just doing it to protect himself and the whole Jupiter mission. When it comes to visual effects, the most groundbreaking part of it occurs in the fourth part, during the Star Gate sequence. Through merging various colors, patterns, drawings, photographs, and high-contrast images Kubrick produced a thing of utmost beauty. It also formed a basis for the sci-fi movies that started to emerge in the following years. 2001: A Space Odyssey might shock you, confuse you, or even disturb you by the story that it depicts. However, it's truly a breathtaking movie, one that can be viewed as an intergalactic opera, perhaps. So get ready and prepare for one of the most divine shows that you will ever see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Provocative Poetry in Motion Picture evokes questions, questions?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's Magnum opus is a series of interconnected provocative visual metaphors that stir up the human mind so that the most interesting questions emerge out of this cauldron. As I can decipher, the central, most provocative question that emerges is: What is the purpose of life? And more specifically: What is the ultimate human purpose? As Andrei Tarkovsky put it "The goal of all art is.....to explain to people the reason for their appearance on this planet; or, if not to explain, at least to pose the question". Kubrick, the wizard of films, accomplishes this admirably in most of his films. To be sure, this may not strike everyone as true, but that is the nature of art ? it's target audience is always a select one ? even to the extent that some targets are hit harder by that art than it does even its creator, and boy, as a teenager (around 14 then, the timing was so crucial!) I was hit hard by 2001 when I saw it ? both in heart and mind. The visions that Kubrick hands down to us are provocative and challenging, and that is exactly how I took it. The first effect of this film is that it mystifies ? creates a general sense of mystery and wonder. Only then do you come to the specific mysteries ? the concept of evolution is one which is now a hotly debated issue and we are nowhere close to resolving it. Another mystery is that of time - provoked by the images which sometimes seem to slow down so much that time seems to stop (an irritant for so many people), and at then sometimes it accelerates or even jumps at a dizzying speed. One of the key characters, HAL evokes questions like: just what is intelligence? Is it even possible to simulate human like intelligence in machines? The answer to that one is becoming increasing clear: no. The point is that even if we know that AI at the human level is impossible, does not invalidate AI research completely, as A.C.Clarke put it: 'The only way of finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible'?that's food for thought. Then there is a flood of questions about the relationship between machines and humans that have critical moral and ethical dimensions?but I'm running out of space here, so I'll close by urging viewers of this film to go over it carefully and articulate questions that address the core nature of us as human beings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must confess i couldn't understand the movie the first time i watched it except for the hegemony of one group of monkeys equipped with bones of dead animals over the other. So i decided to read the book written by Arthur C.Clarke and watch the movie again. The movie is far ahead of its time. Arthur C.Clarke envisaged a space mission to Jupiter and settlements on Moon when man hadn't even landed on moon in reality(Neil Armstrong landed a year later). I clearly understood what the story was and was awed by his imagination and foresight. Kubrick has taken the standards of making movies to a new level with exemplary visual effects. And yes, the movie has a wonderful background score filled with energy- the movie starts with 'Also Sprach Zarathustra' and then 'Blue Danube' at beginning of the second scenario; these are the tracks that get 'loop'ed in your mind. The story may not be conveyed by the movie but i suggest those who really loved the film(for other reasons) to read this wonderful book by Arthur C.Clarke.Perhaps i'd lose an argument with a hardcore Star Wars fan over whether this movie is the greatest sci-fi ever made, as AFI rated it, but i loved this movie as much as i loved Star Wars. It might sound like a sacrilege to call 2001:A Space Odyssey a better sci-fi movie than Metropolis but Kubrick's effort to bring the unimaginable (in the near-future even in 2012) to the screen with the highest standards of perfection is laudable.</fullReview>

This was, if you did not know, made by the king Stanley Kubrick. His movies are visualized so perfectly, atmospherically-made haunting, and just all around brilliant. And this is just from seeing The Shining and The Clockwork Orange. So I took advise and watched it at night, on my 60' TV screen. My mind was empty, ready to be fed brilliance.. Not only did the film feed my expectations, it fed my brain. As weird as that sounds, 2001 did much more than it was meant to...AMAZING. My mind was shattered. Throughout the film, my heart was beating rhythmically to the silence. This film is slow, know this, but it's slow-pace is only to be of annoyance to Michael Bay worshipers. The film's slow-pace is very slow, but to a point where the suspense obscures what could be boring. And the film, in a technical point, was just awe-inspiring. This is a 1968 film. The special effects were stunning to see, and this is from a 90's kid. I've seen late 70's films that have worse special effects than this right here. That's quite the achievement, Kubrick.. Everything from set-design to acting was well- done, but the real film is underlying in it's story.. During the duration, I was confused. The film just made no sense. But that's the point. There has been theories, cult-ish nonsense about the whole 'point' of this film, but no one will understand their confusion. The movie was meant to make you believe it was nonsense, but the truth is never to be told. My confusion made me enjoy the experience more than anything. The film questions humanity itself, even questioning the meaning of existence, of life, all wrapped up in a brilliant sci-fi epic. It seemed like it had no point at first glance, but it's all inside the package. But the film is a experience, that everybody should experience once in their lives. I hate saying "I just saw 2001!" because that sentence, in my mind, wouldn't of made sense. It would sound illiterate. So, I am joyed to say, I have experienced 2001...But all this brilliance is going to be claimed stupid. Mainstream viewers have already knocked off this film, stating it's prolonged scenes were pointless, the film having no point to it. But, truth is, this film right here as inspired sci-fi films of today. Even if you didn't enjoy it, you have to appreciate what it has done. It has created a universe worth seeing. It has created and planted the idea for Michael Bay to direct Transformers. All these sci-fi films nowadays, are inspired by the greatest sci-fi epic of all-time: 2001: A Space Odyssey. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IMDb Top 250: 88I don't think it would be fair to 2001: A Space Odyssey to write down my thoughts before formulating a review as I usually do. 2001 is such an expressive film that to do anything but just let the words come out would go against its existence. Evolution is the plot of A Space Odyssey. Told in distinct movements, we first see the moment when ape turned into man. Jump to space exploration, where we aren't quite yet: and finally, the future, well outside our hand or mind's grasp. Only one of these movements has a true "plot", and I'm sure you know what it is. 2001 is slow. Ice melting slow. Dialogue is sparse, action almost non- existent. Only when each segment is done can you begin to understand it, and only after the final conclusion, if you can call it that, can one even begin to try and piece together the meaning. But that is the ultimate reward: a truly thought provoking film, one of the greatest of all time, one of the most influential pieces of culture and one of the most notable contributions of film.Visually there will never be another film like this. Everything is real, or at least not computer generated. But everything looks so convincing. The ships in space, the planets reflecting light, the sun, the ape people, the magnificent space station sets- I have no clue how this film was made. I can't even begin to guess.But 'awe inspiring' is certainly a characteristic of this extraordinarily futuristic space epic.But 2001 isn't content to just be a feast for the eyes, it's also a unique treat for the ears. Music is exclusively classical, led by the iconic Also Sprach Zarathustra. Dialogue is minimal, as well as sound effects: there's no sound in space (the scientific accuracy is remarkable). The film is bookended by 25 minutes of dialogue free enlightenment.The acting is not legendary, but is exactly what it needs to be: a medium for a directors vision. Of course there's HAL, a prime example of the dangers of dependency and legendary villain. Anyone who likes Portal knows where the influence is from. But Kubrick is the true star: some films are great no matter who runs them, but 2001 is entirely Stanley's project and fittingly his (arguably) crowning achievement. What does it all mean? I don't know. I won't pretend to know its true intent. I don't think it has one. It all depends on what you believe. What I got out of it is that we are in a race with ourselves to find our role in the universe, and with the uncertainty of alien life we can't be sure where the finish line is. Also, care must be taken with machines or anything else we don't understand. It's also an examination of our species thus far, as well as an educated and psychedelic look into our future. Little things will come up, and I've already used 2001 as a basis for certain beliefs I hold that are totally irrelevant to the film. You will think something different, but the fact that so much thought can come from 2 and a half hours of fiction is astounding.One of the great uses of film as a medium, in every sense. 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Kubrick's best works!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one epic sci-film film that surpasses expectations for its time. It is hard to believe that this was filmed in the late 60's but is able to perform as well in today's time. This title had generated the whole notion of science fiction films in which people were taking seriously instead of movies at the times about evil aliens taking over Earth.2001: A Space Odyssey is a film that is based on a viewer's concept of a good film. Too many this film is very shallow and at some points very boring. When I first viewed this film on Blu-Ray, I was absolutely gob- smacked about how the apes were portrayed in the 'Dawn of man' sequence and was surely convinced that they were in fact real apes. The colours and the whole set were absolutely amazing and again I couldn't believe that something this epic existed before digital technology took place.The film's basis is about a mysterious black pillar known as the "Monolith" which is forwarding and expanding human evolution, seen through all the sequences in the film. Kubrick allows the audience to interpret his film and in doing so has generated much debate. An example are the empty black screens in the beginning and the intermission which has puzzled viewers for decades but has since then been described as the Monolith singing to the audience.This film through first watching can cause people to fall asleep and not care about the film. It took me a total of 4 days to finish off the film the first time because I was constantly feeling the nausea of watching a 2 and a half hour feature film straight and had completely left out on all the beauty of this film. A second time watching allowed me to further analyse the film and since then has come to be one of my favourite Stanley Kubrick films of all time. Absolutely excellent and would totally suggest picking up this title. Don't judge it the first time though! It is very hard not to like this film for what it is and what it has done for so many science fiction films that followed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb Masterpiece of Sci-Fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey is truly a superb and unique film. Not because of the incredible accuracy in portraying space travel, not because the special effects are unrivaled, and not because one of the characters is a machine which goes insane. 2001 is unique because it examines the questions of 'Where did we come from?', 'Why are we here?', and 'Where are we going?'. More a statement of philosophy than a piece of entertainment, 2001 uses the power of cinema to evoke wonder in the audience.Some people believe that we are not alone in the Cosmos. Either way you look at it, the concept is staggering. Could we be the result of an experiment performed millions of years ago? Are we being monitored, to determine if we are a success? What is the end-point of our evolution? 2001 is not a story about someone overcoming adversity, it is an expression of awe at our existence, and faith that we can become more than we are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Epic Sci-Fi Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey is a science fiction film produced and directed by Stanley Kubrick. It was co-written by Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke, partially inspired by Clarke's short story "The Sentinel". The story deals with a series of encounters between humans and mysterious black monoliths that are apparently affecting human evolution, and a space voyage to Jupiter tracing a signal emitted by one such monolith found on the moon. Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood star as the two astronauts on this voyage, with Douglas Rain as the voice of the sentient computer HAL 9000 who has full control over their spaceship.At the "Dawn of Man," a group of hominids encounters a mysterious black monolith alien to their surroundings. To the strains of Strauss's 1896 Also sprach Zarathustra, a hominid invents the first weapon, using a bone to kill prey. As the hominid tosses the bone in the air, Kubrick cuts to a 21st century spacecraft hovering over the Earth, skipping ahead millions of years in technological development. U.S. scientist Dr. Heywood Floyd travels to the moon to check out the discovery of a strange object on the moon's surface: a black monolith. As the sun's rays strike the stone, however, it emits a piercing, deafening sound that fills the investigators' headphones and stops them in their path. Cutting ahead 18 months, impassive astronauts David Bowman and Frank Poole head toward Jupiter on the spaceship Discovery, their only company three hibernating astronauts and the vocal, man-made HAL 9000 computer running the entire ship. When the all-too-human HAL malfunctions, however, he tries to murder the astronauts to cover his error, forcing Bowman to defend himself the only way he can. Free of HAL, and finally informed of the voyage's purpose by a recording from Floyd, Bowman journeys to "Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite," through the psychedelic slit-scan star-gate to an 18th century room, and the completion of the monolith's evolutionary mission.The film is frequently described as an "epic film", both for its length and scope, and for its affinity with classical epics.With assistance from special-effects expert Douglas Trumbull, Kubrick spent over two years meticulously creating the most "realistic" depictions of outer space ever seen, greatly advancing cinematic technology for a story expressing grave doubts about technology itself. Despite some initial critical reservations that it was too long and too dull, 2001 became one of the most popular films of 1968, underlining the generation gap between young moviegoers who wanted to see something new and challenging and oldsters who "didn't get it." Provocatively billed as "the ultimate trip," 2001 quickly caught on with a counterculture youth audience open to a contemplative (i.e. chemically enhanced) viewing experience of a film suggesting that the way to enlightenment was to free one's mind of the U.S. military-industrial-technological complex.The film's projections of the cold war and antiquated product placements may look quaint now, but the poetry is as hard-edged and full of wonder as ever.But nevertheless,it is an extraordinary, obsessive, beautiful work of art.One of the most influential of all sci-fi films -- and one of the most controversial -- Stanley Kubrick's 2001 is a delicate, poetic meditation on the ingenuity -- and folly -- of mankind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was this film really made in 1968.... Simply Astonishing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After only just watching this film for the first time. I'm struggling to believe it was made such a long time ago. It really is an achievement unsurpassed by nothing else I have seen. It just looks so far ahead of its time, I am shocked. The way its shot is so clever, you can tell that great thought, time and effort has been laboured on almost every scene. Only a true genius of a director could create such a masterpiece. I loved the beginning, for me the middle of the film contained the best viewing and much of the ending genuinely scared me. My only complaint is that I wanted more. An extra half hour of HAL and perhaps just a little more dialogue. But that's me knit picking. Overall an outstanding film for its time from a tremendous director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cinematic journey through the mind and space.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As is the case with many of his other works, Stanley Kubrick brings this bizarrely epic and philosophical sci-fi to life with a powerful usage of Mise-en-scene. I found this particular aspect of the film impressive, as he crafts a convincing future with the unique use of lighting, sets, and various other elements of design. Every room in every location feels as thought it was built with meticulous complexity, as if this cannot be an imagined world but one that has been captured for the sake of the film. This quality, which is so immersed into the narrative of the film that it is almost unnoticeable with close analysis, makes the intense and difficult story come to life in a way that makes its deep yet arduous plot compelling and believable. With unique camera work, the elements of design and composition use the unusual costumes, sets, and lighting to create a movie that is as surreal as the human mind but as realistic as nonfiction, making it a powerful viewing experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a masterful centerpiece weighed down by two varyingly less than ideal bookends</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When reviewing this film, I like to split it into three parts: the origin of humanity (in which we include all of the monolith scenes), the space, and the nonsense sections. If it was based on just the Space portion, I would give it a perfect ten stars. The acting, lighting, tension, effects, and story are completely perfect in my eye. But it carries on its shoulders two OTHER films- one would be quite good on its own as a short, and one would be an artsy disaster. the first part, origin of humanity (ooh for short from now on), is obviously the former. The photography is nice,the costumes are fantastic even by today's very high ape-costume standards (lol wut), and the space ship landing is very beautiful. It actually manages to build very high amounts of anticipation of its monolith explanation. The worst part of this section is worrying that Kubrick could possibly handle the explanation badly. And then....he doesn't explain it. The space portion masterfully meanders its way by. Again no explanation. Then, we come upon the nonsense section. Initially its not so bad. "Kubrick is showing off a few colorful scenes to be artistic and it was amazing for the time no big deal :)". 15 minutes later, now a drooling lump with your head in your seat and legs splayed in uncomfortable directions on the floor, you have some different thoughts. if a director did anything of this sort in today's time he would be immediately and mercilessly beaten into a jellied pulp by any sensible critic, yet plenty of people actually praise Kubrick's vision. The next scene finally FINALLLLLLY sees the light of day. "OK thats over the guy is in an interesting room that kind of reminds me of minas morgul in lord of the rings lol OK they're going to explain it all now maybe even the monolith :D." Nope. In the stead of any form of explanation or answer, people teleport, age, and do strange things seemingly at random. And the glorious, glistening finale to the movie? an enormous floating baby looking intensely at the earth from a space-bound vantage. Yay. I understand fully, and even on expect plenty of occasions, that films MUST give you some questions, ideally to captivate you. But just as importantly, the film has to give you some answers, or (often requiring more film-making skill) give you the basis for your own conclusions. The third part does neither, basically wasting the audiences time, and greatly weighing down the entire film, in in my eye at least, as a resultooh- 7 space- 10 nonsense-1</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful revisit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A rare chance it is to revisit this majestic cinema classic on the big screen. I was 15 when I was first marvelled by this film shown in «Cinerama». It was like the future was it front me urging the young man I was to proceed into it wholeheartedly. It was beautiful. It was a dream. The effects are so realistic especially in these times of CGI. We rightly wonder how Kubrick managed this feat. The ending was a little disappointing for me as a kid and it still is. In fact, in this viewing I asked myself, why Bowman after surviving HAL and having the whole resources of Discovery at his disposal, he didn't simply return to Earth instead of diving head first in eternity? Of course the dramatic effect would have been lessened but it would have been more realistic. Survival outweighs curiosity in my opinion. But this is a dream and it is well as such. I have seen this film uncounted times and also have it on DVD, but I must admit that nothing beats it on the big screen. A must see, again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So few films are made that makes you stare at the credits amazed, confused, awestruck. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a movie that accomplishes just that. Based on the story by Arthur C. Clarke, 2001 tells the story of man's attempts to uncover an ancient monolith buried in space with the aid of an AI named HAL.The script, the sound-track, the backdrops, the special effects of this film are just amazing. But in my opinion perhaps the directors got a tad carried away with the scale of the special effects that there were many minutes of unnecessary screen time deployed on them. That being said the special effects were in fact way ahead of it's time.The script written by Arthur C. Clarke himself (along with director Kubrick) is just brilliant. 2001 deals with mankind's obsession on exploration and its over-dependence on machinery. When watching this movie I couldn't help but notice the similarities between the technology portrayed in the film and the technology we use now- more evidence of the indisputable brilliance of the coalition of Clarke and Kubrick.On a closing note: this film is a must watch and an evident classic. It will keep you glued to the spot up until its unique albeit confusing end...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In hypothetical 2001 Stanley Kubrick takes you on a unique journey into the unknown, far out there in the vast reaches of our universe, where man is alone with himself - or is it? Paying close attention to scientific accuracy Kubrick's vision of the future feels so close to reality that it is still convincing many years after the year 2001 actually has passed, setting the benchmark way up for everyone else who should try to follow up with sci-fi approaches put to celluloid. But whoever might try their hands on a similar subject, the supreme beauty of what sprang from Kubrick's ingenuity will always be something to marvel at. Remember that the mother of all space operas was produced at a historic time shortly before man made his first step on the moon - and since then "2001" has remained the unparalleled sci-fi revelation not only due to its highly effective realism, but also its sophistication, depth and audio-visual magnificence, all rolled into one.Yet undoubtedly "2001" is so much more than just a perfectly executed sci-fi picture. It's a voyage dealing not only with space exploration, but also with evolution, belief, artificial intelligence, alien life forms, metaphysics, philosophy, in short: man himself, his aspirations and challenges - and tries to point into what lies beyond. Or - if you want - one can still enjoy the picture just as the ultimate adventure. Take your pick! Feel free to draw your own conclusions, but there's a lot to get out of this multilayered film, providing you are ready to put your mind to it. "2001" is a movie for the ages, a sublime experience of transcendency, a film that represents the epitome of art in terms of film-making, best summarized with one single word: a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is not much to say about this film, that has not been said before. It is a masterpiece. It was a revolution. It is wonderful.Why do I even review it? Because I would like to say something about whether or not it is a hype and why people often criticize the wrong things. And how people give the wrong answers toward the criticism.This movie is not being hyped. Mostly hypes do not last for decades, except you would still call classical music or the beatles a hype today. It just is that good. I was born almost 20 Years after it was released, so i may have seen better special effects. I may have seen science-fiction movies, some of them influenced by 2001, that were way more thrilling or had clearer message. I may not even call it the best film of all times. But thats it. Thats all criticism i can come up with. This film is excellent. It has aged like a good wine. It was a revelation to me, as it was to the generations of viewers who watched it before me. And it is not even about the philosophical themes or the mythology ( that is continued in the much more conventional but yet great 2010 ). It was a revelation about filmmaking and reception. It is one of those rare films that show you intensively that cinema can do more than just tell some stories. That film is more than just a way to illustrate something else.However, of course not everyone has to appreciate it. That does not mean that it is only for open-minded intellectuals, it is just such an intense work, that you cannot expect, that everybody likes it. As it is in music or fine arts, there will always be things you can respect, but you just do not like.But if you do not like it, at least show some respect. Do not call it a hype, only because you do not feel the need to spend two hours of your time with this particular piece. Try it and if it does not work just accept that you do not like it and go on to something else. Do not complain about the apes and count the minutes to tell others how boring it is. Because it is not boring. It is Cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001 is a different movie, but is captured beautifully. If you're into a movie having a concrete plot and in depth characters then this movie isn't for you, but if you can appreciate the beauty of cinematography then you will enjoy this film. Despite not having the best plot and concrete in depth characters, the director does an excellent job creating beauty and putting the audience in awe of the sequences and images that are captured. They are simply put beautiful. To really enjoy it I think it should be viewed on a full theater screen, I could not imagine how magnificent that would be. But I wasn't around when it came out so my 46" TV will have to do. With the use of special effects and technology of that day Stanley Kubrick did a fantastic job creating space travel. He got as accurate as he could and it was nicely done. Simply put, given the resources that Kubrick had of the time period, and the plot, it was beautifully made and captured, and had its terrifying sequences (I.E. Hal...nuf said...)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My fav sci-fi hands down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Slow movie that might put you to sleep if you do not connect on first viewing. Kubrick achieved his goal. He hoped the viewer will not get it the first time, and it was true in my case. But because I am fascinated by space, science fiction, astronomy, evolution and the secrets of the universe; I couldn't help my self but to be sucked in by the visual aspects of the movie. I was determined to understand the meaning of this film. My personal conclusion is that Kubrick did not intend to follow the story- line completely. The movie ends without including the final and probably most important detail of the story. In 2010 and the books things become much clearer and we know this epic journey is basically about the cold war. I read some reviews where people mentioned that there are long scenes being repeated and dragged out. But to me, these scenes are setting the mood. You get to experience the long and quiet lapse of time in witch evolution happens. This helps to sharpen our senses to understand the evolutionary leap after first contact with the monolith. I could not imagine this movie without the long sessions of dramatic classical music. At times I found my self scared and almost in the state of panic. Specially at the increasing humming sounds when the astronauts come in contact with the monolith on the moon. The slow scenes in space again meant to trigger our senses and take us on an emotional ride into the vast darkness. Space travel is lonely, claustrophobic and painfully slow. Considering that this movie was made in 1968, it had predicted many things about what the 2000's would look like from telephone via television to devices that look very much like the Ipads. Not to mention that visually this film is so clean, I find it incredible that out of all the futuristic movies only this one really hit the jackpot when guessing that interior design would be into luxurious minimalism.(White as the dominant / basic color in contrast to bold timeless statement pieces like the red chairs. Etc..)I could get into Hal but I will not waist your time. If you read the books and watch 2010 you will understand he never intended to make a sequel or to be true to the original story. I think it was genius to leave out the cold war, because as it turns out, 5 years after the release of 2010 the cold war ended, and although I enjoyed it, it was not relevant to me anymore. However, Kubrick's odyssey is a timeless cinematic masterpiece. Appoligies if my English is not perfect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful tale for adults</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The didacticism - as a mean to elevate the mankind in the story and the viewer's mind in the reality - is at the core of this movie (both levels making a nice "mise en abîme"). In the story this force is incarnated by black monolith entities. In the reality it is enabled by direction and plot devices.Two examples:- Early in the movie, a monolith appears and enables an ape to learn how to use a tool. A few scenes later, a most fantastic ellipsis figures millenniums of scientific progress.- Later in the plot, an astronaut jumps across the void from one spaceship to another while the ensemble heads toward Jupiter at a tremendous speed, thereby exploiting an uncommon situation to provide the viewers with a striking illustration of the Galilean relativity.Possibly, that "didacticism" is even more powerful: it helps you grasping the movie's breathtaking aesthetic beauty and - dare I say - metaphysical grandeur. The deliberately slow pace is a key element to that and in a way sets the mental time-lapse your brain should lock in, like in a zen session where the time perception is altered.Another radical choice: the human characters lack emotional depth and seem to be trapped in their routine, like the men on the moon taking a souvenir photo before the monolith at the very moment the entity emits a signal, probably bound to have repercussions on the whole mankind... It makes sense as this adventure far exceeds the individual scale with its time spanning from the prehistory to 2001 and its space from the earth to Jupiter and beyond. It is as if Kubrick doesn't want to divert us from the essential, hence the humans are reduced to a quasi "puppet" dimension so that us viewers can flow through the story unhindered by "down to earth" human considerations.As a narration 2001 is the literature antithesis: the dialogues are scarce and often insignificant while the images and music have rarely conveyed so much evocation power.The art in this movie has the same scale than the story it tells. The classical music used is timeless. It's also called "savant" music by some definitions. Part of Kubrick's own genius in this work is the osmosis between the images and music: the eerie, cold space images are harmoniously counterbalanced with the warm "Blue Danube" waltz. The dreamlike visions of "Jupiter and beyond" and Ligeti's haunting work go hand in hand. And there is silence when really nothing else than silence would fit. At last, you would almost be compelled to believe that Strauss' "Also sprach Zarathustra" was composed especially for the occasion - and that it is worthy of the movie rather than the opposite!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey is a unique visual experience. It's one of the reasons movies have meaning when it comes to telling a story. One of Kubrick's finest films, 2001 is a meditative piece that is suppose to make viewers think and allow our minds to explore and wander. The film has so many great moments that will be remembered by film scholars for generations. For example, that jump cut you probably heard of, is one of the greatest film techniques in the history of cinema. One minute we're deep in the past back when human beings were monkeys and after one monkey throws a bone up into the air, suddenly we've blasted through time (even passing the present) and now find ourselves in the future and we can see what we've become. Once monkeys, now astronauts trying to get to Jupiter. Then there's the monolith. This mysterious screeching alien-made wonder that drives the entire odyssey. Humans want the answers and they travel to Jupiter to try and find them. Kubrick always makes movies about either dehumanization or simply humanity, and 2001 teaches that human beings have developed very well overtime, but that human beings compared to the rest of the universe are still very innocent. This story told on film is able to tell us all about this incredible message. Some have called the film "boring", because they can't seem to understand what the film is really about. It definitely takes more than an initial viewing and it is certainly something that needs a lot of appreciation, but those who give 2001: A Space Odyssey a chance, will certainly have an amazing film to talk about for years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read a number of these reviews. I am amazed at the number of negative reactions, but I believe I know the reason.This film is NOT a fantasy piece like Star Wars or Star Trek. You don't hear sounds like lasers (phasers) or star-ships "whooshing" through space. This is probably the most authentic portrait of what a moon base and exploration would be like in the future.Many folks have grown up expecting action, violence, romance every five seconds. This is a film for those that expect reality in a picture (think Apollo 13), not fantasies about wormholes or time travel. There are no epic space battles, no Jedi light sabres, no sophisticated ships that travel faster than light.This film explores the creation of mankind, from it's simple roots from ape-like ancestors to exploring the cosmos. The various interpretations of the ending of the movie are probably 7 billion, every person having their own idea. That is the incredible genius of this film. It's not some boring movie that I can predict the ending after ten minutes into the playing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>my most favorite movie of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(My Most Favorite Movie Of All Time)Starring, Keir Dullea, Gary Lockwood, William Sylvester, Daniel Richter, Douglas Rain , Leonard Rossiter , Margaret Tyzack , Robert Beatty , Sean Sullivan.Directed by one of the Top 5 best directors of all time, Stanley Kubrick.Nominated for JUST 4 Oscars, Best Director, Original Screenplay, Art Direction and Special effects. it SHOCKINGLY just won 1 Oscar, for Best Visual Effects. how on earth does it got just 4 Nominations? if Titanic can get 13 why can't this?as mentioned in the very first line, this is my most favorite movie of all time right now among the movies i have seen. definitely one of the most well known, discussed and groundbreaking movie of all time. a phenomenal movie that is so much ahead of its time. i was a bit not sure how will i take this movie since many movie lovers think its boring and lame with no dialogues and plot. but non of these things bothered me at all. i am so surprised i wen't through this movie without a slightest hesitation. there have been times when i saw a movie while forcing myself to like it but nothing like that happened here. it had this profound effect on me, i was really drawn into this movie, it was like a greatest adventure for me to watch this movie. i can watch this movie over and over and love it every time.for a movie of 1968 to show such things with such greatness is shocking and a miracle to me, unbelievable. this is an epic Sci Fi film of all time, the very best. it laid the foundation of modern Sci Fi movies with everything so perfect and outstanding that it can put a modern Sci Fi special effect movie to shame. this movie deals with elements of technology, artificial intelligence and extra terrestrial life but more importantly human evolution. the scientific accuracy and the visual imagery is so open that it looks very surreal, unique narration with minimum use of dialogues.this movie has a very less use of dialogues but enough to be understand. the best thing about this movie is it does not depend on dialogues, you have the visuals that is more than enough to make you understand whats going on in the movie while even more than that, your imagination, your vision is put to test here. i even for once wasn't puzzled or confused with anything. it was easily understandable for me, don't know why people think opposite of it. for 25 minutes or so it has no dialogues, then in many other places you will hear no human voice. it begins with a rather not so necessary scene that lasts almost 20 minutes. apes like early humans are shown as the slowly learns to use bones as a tool for killing others. while many viewers thing it is unnecessary scene, i think it is one of the most important and best explaining scene in the history.i am not gonna go into details of this movie because it would make my review very long, just minor story details. we see the monolith that was earlier seen in the apes scene after the scientists arrives to see the TMA-1. the monolith has to be one of the most scary and mysteriously creepy thing i have ever seen in a movie. then there is Jupiter mission where we meet the famous genius computer HAL 9000 who as we all know is a famous figure. i think that part wasn't develop well, i mean i didn't felt much connection with HAL, that is the only place in the whole movie where the lack of dialogues should have been avoided. he should have been develop more. as he turns villainous against the 2 scientists, those has to be one of the best scenes of villainy i have ever seen. towards the end, the part is called Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite which is were the movie finally ends as the Bowman leaves Discovery One in an EVA pod and finds another monolith in orbit around the planet, that scared me like hell as i knew the worst is about to happen know. we then see unusual colors and patterns as he passes through the vast never ending space. that is a very crazy scene. the ending was very weird and quite effective for me, though i still don't understand the actual meaning of it or the philosophy behind i but i found it shockingly interesting and jaw dropping.one of the best special effects and visuals ever. extremely well done and quite ahead of its time. art direction was brilliantly done. everything else like sounds and other technical things were brilliant too. nice editing and a great screenplay which stands as one of the best screenplay ever written for a sci fi movie. great story and plot though many people think it lacks a plot but i think it has many plots. great score and music. the score has to be one of the most scariest music i have ever heard in my life. it made such a haunting, lonely and creepy effect effect on the movie. i was literally scared. nice performances though nothing great as human characters weren't the primarily focus. superb direction.i was thrilled by this movie and scared too. my heart was pounding so hard even after the movie, i am still thinking about it and i will for the rest of my life. one of the best time i had watching a movie, never boring for me. a MUST WATCH for the art movies lovers like me, though general popcorn sci fi fans will hate it, but a general GOOD movies fan like me will love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie people love to interpret</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think part of the reason "2001" has had such an enduring legacy is, aside from special effects that look good even today, the opaque, almost subliminal story. Part of this is Kubrick's style, as his movies have often been detached and almost cold, and part of it is deliberate.When we have something we feel is important and want to understand it, but what we are told is vague or uncertain, we keep guessing and trying to figure it out, and that uncertainty keeps us going to achieve enlightenment. More often than not when it is finally revealed to us we either feel disappointment, that it was somehow less than we expected, or we reject it and keep looking for more answers.Two things to remember is "2001" is a work of fiction, and therefore can be open to revision and reinterpretation from what it originally may have meant, such as in the ho-hum 2010 sequel, and it was also done by a human being just like one of us. A very smart one who was good at what he did but nonetheless a person, so nothing in "2001" should be considered as some greater message or doctrine, it's the story he gave to us.So here goes, "2001" is essentially the story of the evolution of the human intellect. The monolith is an enabler as much as a symbol of each turning point. I've heard one interpretation that the monolith represents the movie screen itself (turn the thing sideways) and is Kubrick wanting us to think about the movie, and each appearance of the monolith is accompanied by that awful wailing music which is meant to jar us and make us realize we're at a turning point where we won't see things the same. I agree with this view.We begin with humans as Australopithecus, who are physically vulnerable to attacks by animals and other tribes, until we learn to use tools. This is the first appearance. The second is when we have reached the moon. This is essentially the stage we're at now, and why the thing is on the moon is it required us to become technologically and mentally developed enough to find it. The turning point here is we are finally realizing we need to look beyond ourselves.The third stage precedes the next appearance of the monolith, makes up the bulk of the movie, and also has generated the most controversy. If the signal from the moon monolith had instead gone to some distant star and the spaceship scene was thousands of years later then it would have been easy to see it as another stage. Instead it's only 18 months later.The development is our technology has started to outpace us. We (as in the astronaut's behavior) are becoming cold and cerebral, and the computer is more emotional than us.HAL has his infamous fault where he decides to kill the crew. I've seen this as he was given a mission of critical importance, that there was an alien intelligence that had directed us to Jupiter, and questioned if the crew could handle both the secret and finding out he'd been withholding it. HAL decides it's too much of a risk and that to complete the mission without them is the way to go.In this scenario we are at a turning point, we cannot go any further as we rely more and more on machines, and in the process become more artificial in our behavior, while computers like HAL may act more "human" but are still equipment and can make decisions that are ultimately inhuman.The last stage is almost purely symbolism. Dave goes on a trip, whether physically to somewhere else, dimensionally to another plane of existence, or in his mind alone is beside the point. (Although most people seem to think he traveled across the stars is the most satisfying answer).The room at the end similarly could be a construct by the alien intelligence to give him something easier to relate to, a transcendental dream, or Dave's mind finding some way to rationalize what is going on. What does happen is Dave reaches the next stage, where we no longer need our frail bodies that age or our technology, and he becomes the infamous Star Child. How he actually does this or what this next stage allows us to achieve is left out.So there it is, take my interpretation or leave it. Some things don't work too well; such as the stage of humanity finding the second monolith on the moon doesn't come across as much of a turning point as the others, the movie implies we're facing an alien intelligence, but instead of giving us motives we're stuck with the sci-fi workaround of intelligences beyond our comprehension, and lastly now that Dave is the Star Child, just what is he going to do with himself aside from float around?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The human odyssey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is still a puzzle to me, even more so than the first time I saw it fourteen years ago. Curiously, that very first time I didn't thought much of it. I was hoping for something that could shed some light in to the events described at the opening of its sequel, "2010: year of contact" (of all things!). That really put the hook on me. But then again 2001 is not a movie to provide fast or conventional entertainment, let alone to provide you with answers. If one has to write a review on a movie such as "2001: A space odyssey", the very first problem that comes to the central fore is the fact that there is no conventional plot line for the viewer to follow. The way I see it, this movie is made of an overture, three acts, and a (very) long epilogue. The first act deals with the misshapenings of a group of pre-historic men fighting with a rival gang for possession of a water lake. We then leap to the twenty first century, traveling with scientist Heywood Floyd to the moon where he has to deal with a ground breaking discovery. In the third act, aboard the spaceship Discovery and half way in a mysterious mission to Jupiter, a drama unfolds as the on board supercomputer HAL 9000 appears to malfunction and plunges astronauts Dave Bowman and Frank Poole in a struggle to survive. Along these seemly unrelated acts, the only thing resembling a plot line is the close encounter between the characters of each story and a mysterious object in the form of a black monolith. However, the only time where this plot is actually followed through is in the long epilogue, where Dave Bowman chases several of those enigmatic monoliths in a psychedelic journey through outer space. Never the less the end comes, and we still don't get an answer to the nature of these mysterious objects and their undisclosed relation to mankind. This very unsatisfying finally alludes to the absence of a solid (or conventional) plot line within the whole movie. Of course we could indulge in some free interpretation. Assuming that the whole monolith plot is a red herring, if we search for something to connect the movie together, there are several recurrent motifs, one of which, the evolution of mankind. Some examples of it are pointed out through musical cues: Kubrick's use of "Thus spoke Zarathustra" by Richard Strauss is presented whenever that recurrent motif comes up. Parallel scenes like the encounter between the ape-men and the monolith which is mimicked by the astronauts on the moon, indicating the possibility of another step in mankind's evolution. Never the less, Stanley Kubrick avoids any explicit conclusion, or opinion that could direct the viewer to what he intends to. Every time evolution is suggested, we are presented with all possible consequences that come from it, good and bad: the most obvious example of this is the dramatic third act and it's memorable character HAL, a symbol of man's achieved perfection, playing God. And yet when the computer malfunctions and the crew has to fight for their survival, Bowman has no doubt but to destroy Man's own creation. Human kind at its best and at its worst. So when the end comes up and the immortal all powerful star child is looking at you, we can't help wonder what will prevail, good or evil. I believe Kubrick's intention was to leave it up to us to make our own minds. Furthermore, this possible story line and its interpretation don't make for the whole film. In fact, there are many aspects of the movie that strike an impact on the viewer just by their visual presentation, along with other artistic choices from Kubrick that don't follow the standard use in film industry. For example, the leap in the story, that ends the "Dawn of man" act with a transition shot so fluid and perfect that surpasses any significance within the story and could be enjoyed just for its sheer beauty. There is the docking of a spaceship that lasts for 4 minutes without contributing to plot development, but mesmerizes you with its space choreography, aided by the Blue Danube waltz playing in the background. And of course there is HAL, one of the most memorable characters put on screen. He chills you out with its soft voice and glaring red eye (as a friend of mine described it), and draws your empathy when facing his own death, pleading for his life just like a human being: "? please stop, Dave. I'm a?fraid." An iconic scene in movie history!All these aspects give a feeling that the director's intention was not only to engage in philosophical introspection about human kind's evolution and destiny, but also to present what could be call an abstract movie, aesthetically provocative, with much attention paid to form, images and sound, as much as content, breaking all ties with conventional film making. These two facts put together capture your imagination and senses as no other film in the mainstream production industry.To sum it up, this movie is a unique visual experience, as much as a mind challenging picture!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Instant most popular movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is quite the ultimate classic science fiction film. 2001 at the time was in fact ahead of its time from the master Stanley Kubrik. Using sounds and music which gives a kind of ballet in space. Orchestral soundtrack using Bach and Strauss was ingenious of showing us the deliberate way of matching the movements of ships that coincide with each track. Including the eerie sounds from the Monolith when Floyd reaches the dig site on the moon. The special effects from Douglas Trumbull was quite possibly the pinnacle of what movie making really is, which led Trumbull on to films such as Close encounters of the third kind, and his very own film - Brainstorm. The idea of showing man in his early stages of evolution to the present was wonderful. Adapting to their surroundings, with the help of the Monolith that just appears one sudden morning as the tribe had begun to awaken from a daily sleep. The same haunting sounds from what people can see is that the Monolith is a type of teaching tool, that embeds signals inside the human mind, yet without actually interfering on how it involves on how the tribe goes on living. Questions of our role in life had started because of Kubrik's influence in this film. And using the Hal 9000 computer shows us that no one is infallible to mistakes. This is by far the most important film to date, which holds many attributable factors to those who also make science fiction films. The sets and designs were hand made, no computer technology was involved in creating this awe and inspiring movie. Excellent to watch on those off days from work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest gift to be given to science fiction lovers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It opens a lot of dazzling pictures under the dawn of the man. The people who hated No Country for Old Men will hate this one too. Probably, this movie is the movie that is accepted as the most boring movie ever. It is not for everyone, but personally I did get bored at all. I was at high school when saw the movie for the first time. I had wondered it a lot and finally watched it and I remember, the time flied by. 2001 is quiet, still, beautiful and reposeful. It is pure space, pure science fiction. You know, Kubrick is a perfectionist director and sometimes, he does it, succeeds. 2001 is one of those movies. He gets the perfection. The movie has everything that can be in a science fiction film. He endeavors to catch every kind of picture in space and he does. That is one of the reasons that this is the greatest gift to science fiction lovers. Space has never looked that mysterious and beautiful at the same time. Really the music is very coherent with the visuals, so impressive. Visually, the movie is minimalist and very very stylish, no need to repeat that it is beautiful also. The set designs are great, the spacecraft which is sent to Jupiter is the best spacecraft I have ever seen in my life! Space has never looked that mysterious, unknown, obscure and creepy sometimes. For example, the scene that the astronauts come down to the ground first is creepy a bit. And just a note, I like the scenes they eat, visually colorful too. As for HAL, one of the most hypnotizing voices ever in cinema. Also as I see, it is the most intelligent artificial intelligent, computer ever and it makes the movie very interesting. A conscious existence. It is like a very very smart gentleman in dramas. The sequence which one of the astronauts goes in order to check and fix the problem with breath sounds is my favorite of the movie! One of the best sound editing ever. It is repeated by 2010, but unfortunately it seemed pretentious to me probably so that it is a repetition. By the way, I had not expected that things will come to that point. What a great script! In the second half, tension increases, but quietly. Not to spoil the movie, I won't tell who or what is it?, but there is a danger and it is more threatening than even the alien! The monologues of HAL, near the end left me with complex feelings somehow, but I hated it of course, it made me angry. The journey near the end, brilliant visuals, a space journey couldn't be defined better. That sequence is my second favorite. However, I learned that some people make fun of it by saying that it was like media player visualizations. The special effects look much better than even Avatar, you can bet on that! Just perfect. As for the final, I did not understand it exactly and honestly disappointed little, to me the weakest part of the movie, it could have been different, but no problem. I very enjoyed 2001, it is one of the movies that made me impressed the most.</fullReview>

It (they) speak about the eternal question: Who are We?

In one scene, the astronauts are watching video on devices that look just like the (recently introduced) i-pad! As in all of his movies, you can tell Kubrick's eye as a professional photographer-which was his first career before coming to film making.Even if the ending sequence leaves people scratching their heads a bit, as a cohesive work of art this film is right on the mark. It's visual art.The sequel to this film takes place in 2010. The director was not involved in the project, however.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was quite impressed with this movie. I believe it is quite possibly the best science fiction film ever made. But it's a very well-made movie regardless of genre. 2001, is beautifully filmed, and well scored. The visuals of the movie were mesmerizing. It is really hard to believe that this movie was made in 1968. I would say it has aged well, but I don't think it has aged at all. It is just one of those timeless movies. Much of 2001 has a glorious mood to it; it also has a dark, surreal atmosphere. These qualities are enhanced by the soundtrack. It is divided into three sections, which are all very different. This diversity makes the movie a little difficult to understand, but adds a lot to the movie: the diversity gives 2001 a riveting complexity that provides for a very memorable experience. Some viewers may find the movie to have a slow pace, but in my opinion the pace of the movie was perfect. It added to the climax of the movie. The slow pace and visual storytelling added a lot to the movie, made it very powerful. 2001 was really good all the way through, but I have to admit towards the end I was a little lost. But despite the movie's potentially confusing nature, it really has a lot of meaning, and it is visually arresting. Overall, 2001: A Space Odyssey is probably one of the greatest movies of all time. Its certainly worth watching at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>recently, I saw "2001: A Space Odyssey" for the third time, but understood it for the first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a long time, Stanley Kubrick's most influential and controversial movie, "2001: A Space Odyssey", was a befuddling enigma to me. I've pondered over the movie for ages now, trying to reason really what it was about and more importantly, what I thought of it. A few moments ago, I saw the movie for the third time, but for the first time I understood it and I understood why it has gone on to become one of the most celebrated movies of all time. I'll be honest; for a long time, I didn't think much of "2001" and now that I look back on those previous two experiences of watching it, I feel a little embarrassed that I was so far off the mark before. I just had to learn that "2001: A Space Odyssey" was not a film to be taken at face value; it was about something else. And that something else cannot be determined by a majority. "2001: A Space Odyssey" is about the individual's relation to the universe around him, and because human minds are as infinite as the stars, they are just as varied.I always knew what "2001" was about in plot. It's a movie that is about humankind and man's relationship to the universe, composed of three stories that are interconnected in one of the most cosmically fascinating manners. The first part of the story concerns the dawn of man. The second relates to man's discovery of an artifact on the moon, hinting that maybe man is not the only intelligent being in the universe. The third revolves around a mission to Jupiter, in which the ship's computer, the famous villain HAL 9000, turns on the astronauts. And from here a fourth, most symbolic and controversial story emerges. That's what "2001" is about. *in plot.* What's it's *really* about is up to you."2001" means something a bit different to everybody. Some even think it has some religious (or even anti-religious) subtexts. Personally, I don't think so. To me, "2001" is about mankind's progress, but only in scientific terms. To my mind, it's about the progression of man from being a dumb brute to realizing that he possesses something that is greater than the stars and planets and his own machines that physically dwarf him in the universe. And the mysterious black monoliths whose origins go unexplained throughout the film are sort of like milestones in man's progress. And his progress is not his technological advances, but his intellectual ones. Throughout the movie, there is lots of symbolism about man's intelligence and how he uses it to overcome obstacles that lay before him. That's what it means to me."2001: A Space Odyssey" is a different kind of masterpiece. It does not work, as Roger Ebert noted, on a human level. The characters are flat and two-dimensional, acting is amateurish, there is not an extreme amount of development, but it doesn't really matter in a movie like this. The movie utilizes visual means to carry an impact to the audience and somehow this makes the movie even more powerful. I do think it would be even more of a masterpiece if it did work on a human level, but then the already stretched running time might slow down some more. Ironically enough, the most charisma and the most emotion comes not from our astronauts, but from HAL, the monotonous-voiced computer who turns lethal when threatened with his own "life." Stanley Kubrick won the only Oscar in his career not for directing, but for the special effects, which are jaw-dropping even by today's standards. They are especially awesome today, forty-some years since the movie's debut, because it staggers the imagination to wonder how they could have been done in the 1960s. But what makes these effects so special is not the mere fact that they are eye candy, but because they are used with imagination and delicacy so even the four-plus-minute sequences where very little besides objects floating in outer space coupled with Johann Strauss's waltzes can be mesmerizing.It took me a long time and three views, but at last I do understand why people cherish "2001: A Space Odyssey." Not only is it a truly mesmerizing film, but it's a deeply symbolic one about man's folly and success. But what's best of all is that it means something?and not something definite, but individualized. It meant something to its creators and it means something different to us as individuals. That's an odd parallel to life, isn't it? Now for some, the movie is too long and I agree the running time is a little stretched and Kubrick might have done the film some good if he chopped a few sequences of space exploitation, but overall, "2001: A Space Odyssey" is an amazing accomplishment not merely in special effects, but in cinema. It's a different kind of masterpiece ? one that takes some getting used to it ? but it is a marvel much like outer space itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thsi film is both amazing and terrifying. The film's effects are beautiful and are some of the best that will ever be put on screen. The film is slightly dated with 60's optimism and cleanliness, but it is just so beautiful and believable. The film takes place in 2001 but none of this happened in 2001. However, the characters' reliance on technology is just like ours today. The concept of machines having souls is also mind-boggling. The film lacks dialog but gives beautiful images and lovely music. Some of the films concepts in space are not the most accurate but unlike some sci-fi films, this movie thought about things like toilets in space or food in space. This movie is considered to be the greatest sci-fi film ever made and to tell you the truth, it may be just that.</fullReview>

But let's not forget that he and Arthur Clarke collaborated daily in the making of the movie and the novel; the story was co-conceived by both, and so rather than see the motion picture as a Kubrickization of the literature, see it as an expression of the story itself, of what it's about: evolution.I haven't yet read the third novel, so I apologize if this accidentally spoils anything, but it's clear from having been raised on these two movies that the intent of the conceptualizers is to demonstrate what entheogenic practitioners have always known: that contact with higher planes of existence, even if only within ourselves, is an intensely psychedelic experience.I've made a study of Kubrick's movie-making approach (and don't worry, I won't inflict it here, other than to point out that he's very capable of blending abstraction and conceptualization in such a way as to convey how, for instance, David Bowman is perceiving the process of enlightenment that is consuming his brain. The pretty colored lights are an abstraction of what his body experiences as his central nervous system melts under the onslaught of information, but they're also just ordered enough to suggest actual streams of data being forced into his consciousness. At intervals he's shown elements that resemble both cosmic events and organic interactions, and we're given to understand that he's grasping some fundamental association between the two.The whole "cosmic tunnel" scene, far from being filler, is a litany of the evolutionary experience in Dave's microcosm. Just as with the Hunting Hypothesis demonstration at the Dawn of Man, Dave's evolutionary response (to the presence of a higher intelligence) propels him to a higher degree of functionality. He is being consumed by the process--losing much of his Bowmanship--but he is taking on as much more experience and perspective as to make it worth it. I think what some people might find tedious about that scene is the fact that it demands rigorous, unfaltering attention for an extended time, which I feel perfectly expresses the discipline that would be demanded, even if for only such a short time, by someone actually experiencing forcible Enlightenment.There's a lot of abstraction in the scene, but there's also a lot of representation, and Kubrick overlays them in order to achieve the effect: an onrush of sensoria-destroying information, a glimpse of Creation, the arisal of solid worlds, the inevitable slow attacks on those worlds by their first life forms. As life spreads conceptually, so do the abstractions become green. You recognize a forest superimposing itself over what had been barren rock.Chaos to order, and then back to chaos...the start of evolution, whence all diversity comes. Seven Sentinels standing by, in mechanical yet possibly organic form, commanding him to pay attention, to internalize the lesson. Your intelligence is not a factor in how we will treat you, they seem to be saying; it has only served you this far, to deliver you to us; now we'll show you what REAL intelligence is.When his perceptions have settled back down enough for him to move around, he sees himself in two places...and in two stages of life...at the same time. He is now not only timeless, but multicorporeal. This is precisely how we lower 3-D beings might experience a multidimensional entity, and apparently precisely how the ex-Bowman still experiences himself: in discrete parts. He never clues in to his bilocation until it's too late to do anything really cool with it. But aside from representing, physically, the ages of Man in various stages of potential and decrepitude, we can tell that the experience has aged Bowman materially. Something about his body was consumed in his reorganization.He is both less and more than we was before. Sorry, than he was before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can you find another film where the music complements the movie so splendidly? How about using the strength of sound to tell the story, whether it be Poole's breathing or HAL cutting off the life support of the survey crew? Will another scene ever top, let alone challenge, Kubrick's vision of The Dawn of Man? 2001 has everything going for it. Even more so now that we can look back at this movie forty years later and can comparatively draw our own conclusions on how we have succeeded and failed, this movie kind of being its own measuring stick on how well we have advanced and changed.Three main stories make up 2001. We begin with The Dawn of Man, where humans earliest ancestors are trying to survive on the young planet. We skip to 2001 where business and exploration is part of life in space, and a new discovery is found on the moon. Finally, a mission to Jupiter is underway with a hibernating survey team, two astronauts and HAL 9000.One of the best conflicts of all time is obviously between Bowman and HAL. From when Bowman uses the now-infamous line, "Open the pod bay doors, HAL," to when he goes straight to HAL's Logic Memory Center, the conversation is sharper than most movies I can currently recall. The length of the film is always something to be desired, but I still watch this movie, never really tiring of it. How the Space Station moves to the music like a ferris wheel, not to mention the ever alien presence of the Monolith, there'll never come a time when something new fascinates me from 2001.</fullReview>

The special effects shown are super making one feel that space is a magical place, and Kubrick even played with the viewer when the screen goes totally black with the music playing as the viewers mind starts to wonder. And from the start by showing the dawn of civilization with the apes this film started with a message to show how times and history changes man and especially the future of technology just remember up in space the talking computer! Really a wonderful made film for the year 1968, it did a good job by showing how some of the future would be especially the rise of technology and how dependent that man became on it. A film of great visual image and effect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, I did not give 2001 a perfect score. I gave it an 8- and 8 because of a few choice reasons. Instead of getting into every aspect of the film like others do, I will just explain these problems.The first was about the first scene in space, where the music is playing and it's just showing the ship moving ever so slowly towards the space station. That part dragged on way too long, and I found myself growing restless as I sat there. The second complaint was that so much was left unanswered. What was the significance of the monolith? Why did HAL go mad? How did he turn into the starchild or whatever its called? Where the heck WAS he at the end? That irked me, and took away from the film (though I was thinking about these things for quite a while).Otherwise, great film. Very entertaining when somethings happening, and expertly done by a masterful director, but if you're looking for action packed sci-fi or just a popcorn movie or something to watch on Saturday night, stay far away.</fullReview>

This movie will challenge your thought process in a most entertaining way. What more can be said other than this is a must see for any lover of films. Some have found the lack of dialog a hindrance to the film but I however found it refreshing. The music, lighting, camera angles all play a massive role in a film that does not allow itself the luxury of spoon feeding the viewer. Both the book and the movie are of impeccable quality and this is one of those rare films where it does the book justice (The Exorcist is another). A full 10 out of 10!!!</fullReview>

I think even in the actual 21st century, with all of the computer generated, and other hight tech visual and special effects, this movie still delivers.The plot is great with the theme of technology gone berserk. The actors give good performances and the technical crew did an amazing job of making the audience believe these guys are actually in outer space.I'm not real sure how far off the book that Kubrick got, but I'm aware that he and Arthur C. Clark had many arguments about the script. Although the movie clearly can stand alone, it is helpful to see or read the sequel 2010. Though the film 2010 isn't as good as 2001, it is very good visually, and features some good performance from John Lithgow, and Roy Schieder. There is also a third book by Clark, 3001: the Final Odyssey which completes the story. I'd be surprised if that ever makes it onto the big screen though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2001 vs 2010 -- from visionary to misguided bravery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With all the controversy and endless conjectures generated from Kubrick's original, I think it was both a brave attempt and a misguided move for 2010 to have been made, and for no reason other than that any questions 2001 can provoke the audience to ask are not meant to be answered in our time. That remains to me an ingenious decision and marks Kubrick as a visionary in that he managed to create a story that compels the audience to create their unique thirst to want to know more.Prior to the time 2001 was made, there have not been many major Hollywood films that dare to take the approach of using lack-of-clarity as the intended pay-off. Kurosawa did it in 1950 with Rashomon as a break-through, but it is an entirely different topic than that of 2001--a story that, at the time it was made, the available science and technology could only provide conjectures to what belies in space travel, and the mysteries to the world outside our atmospheres... those myths still remain today.Remember the film was conceived and made before mankind had ever set foot on the moon. With all the research Kubrick invested in with consultants and Arthur C. Clarke, he knew it was better to have more questions unanswered, than to risk giving answers history and science could soon prove wrong... this is probably his greatest achievement as a story-teller with 2001: A Space Odyseey. If you watch the film again, try to count how many items, as well as technologies shown within are completely off based on what we actually have in application today. Aside from brand logo's, and maybe the details to how computer interfaces may differ from what we have today, there is nothing shown in the movie you can argue as "outdated" or are completely wrong. If that is not the work of a visionary, I don't know what is. While I don't know if Kubrick himself deserves all the credit, as he certainly had the help from the best talents available, to accept the challenge and be able to convince a major studio such as MGM to entrust a production of that scale, and have enough sense to understand that sometimes it is better to not try to provide an answer when you may not even know what the question is, that is genius at work.It is not difficult to come up with a story and make a film that is confusing, and there are plenty of those for us to forget. What Kubrick &amp; co. came up with is confusion that is at the same time compelling and thought-provoking... not to mention his film in many ways influenced designs in the future. Citing Dr. Strangelove as another example, he created the concept of a "WAR ROOM" that had even Ronald Reagan asking to see when he became President of the United States, which to his disappointment, didn't really exist.2010 is a good film, but it will always be derivative, always in the shadow of 2001, and always pale by comparison. Think of X-files the TV-series in its first 3 seasons, and how everything went downhill when it became a movie, the fault was not in the production value or lacking in writing talent, but the mere fact that the "payoff" that served to be the original and strongest hook was its ability to make us keep big bold question marks floating in our heads.Imagine LOST having a resolve... that would be the end to the magic.By making 2010, detractors of the narrative approach to 2001 will be satisfied, while fans of the original will object... and by virtue of its attempt to provide answers, it adds an expiration date to the story. Little did they know then that in just 6 years after the film was made, the COLD WAR would be a has-been.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film first in June 1968- during its American Premiere nationally on the large Cinerama screen. I was 16 years old. When I walked out of the theater nearly 3 hours later I was totally mesmerized.Firstly seeing the film in Cinerama gives a far superior view- and shows how brilliantly it is done.The film cannot be called 'conventional'- and that is the concept that Kubrick wanted to create. It is an 'experience' into a genre of art and science with profound ideas of the past and future direction of humankind's journey- Yes an 'Oydessy' if you want to call it that. The actors are merely secondary to the grand design.The concept of HAL 9000 is unique, and for its time incredible. Clarke nor Kubrick had no idea that HAL would not be around in 2001- but computers would be- in a way they never imagined.The use of the Classical music is done perfectly throughout. 2001 is not a movie- but an experience- and that is what makes it so special.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Trip, exploring our beliefs.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey is truly a unique film. Not because of the incredible accuracy in portraying space travel, not because the special effects are unrivaled, and not because one of the characters is a machine which goes insane. 2001 is unique because it examines the questions of 'Where did we come from?', 'Why are we here?', and 'Where are we going?'. More a statement of philosophy than a piece of entertainment, 2001 uses the power of cinema to evoke wonder in the audience.Some people believe that we are not alone in the Cosmos. Either way you look at it, the concept is staggering. Could we be the result of an experiment performed millions of years ago? Are we being monitored, to determine if we are a success? What is the end-point of our evolution? 2001 is not a story about someone overcoming adversity, it is an expression of awe at our existence, and faith that we can become more than we are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Landmark cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With 2001, legendary film director Stanley Kubrick managed to craft a visual tone poem on the screen with little regard for usual film-making conventions like a detailed plot of fully-developed characters. The film is a total visceral experience, and is a motion picture that demands full submission on the part of the viewer. This film will not meet the audience half-way, and it demands that viewers totally shut off their logic and become wrapped up in tone and atmosphere. If a viewer is unwilling or unable to let go of their conscious thoughts in such a manner, then 2001 may prove to be a disappointing and frustrating experience.The storyline, as it is, is about the divisions among man and animal, and it poses the question of what will happen if technology is the next step in the evolutionary ladder of intelligence. The theme of the film is not defined so much in terms of dialogue, however, as much as it is in visual representation and aura. The film is awash with stunning set pieces and visual effects, many of which remain much more effective than the hastily-done, two-dimensional CGI effects of today. No other film has ever made the thought of drifting into orbit look and feel more beautiful than 2001, which makes the danger that emerges in the films final third even more effectively jarring.The film really challenges the viewer in its final minutes when it makes the sudden switch from expertly-crafted space adventure and into the realm of metaphysical spiritual commentary. This maneuver is both very bold and audacious, but it comes together flawlessly as the picture builds to a spin-tingling denouncement. It is the relative scientific accuracy of the bulk of the film that this last great leap into the unknown so disorienting, but this is precisely what leaves the non-analytical viewer grappling with such deep issues and self-reflection. In the end, 2001 is as much a full-fledged experience as it is a film, which something that all great art strives to achieve.Incredibly, given it's nearly art house pedigree, 2001 proved to be a major success with mainstream film audiences. The year of 1968 was a competitive year in Hollywood with ROSEMARY'S BABY (1968), BULLITT (1968), ROMEO AND JUILET (1968) and another sci-fi blockbuster PLANET OF THE APES (1968) all vying for dominance at the box office. Impressively, 2001 ended up becoming the second-highest grossing film of the year (the smash musical FUNNY GIRL was the year's top grosser, by the way), earning an estimated $56 million in the US alone (a huge sum in the late-sixties). This is at least one example where a complex, intelligent film did not go unnoticed by the mainstream public at the time of its release.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A piece of art for those with an attention span of more than 10 minutes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading some of the negative reviews on this movie (there aren't a lot of them, but still) I just felt the sudden urge to poke fun at someone.A few reviewers keep saying that "sure, I understood it, but it hasn't got a plot". If you think that you didn't understand it, so why do you say you did? The plot may not be as obvious as, say, Apollo 13, and it doesn't just deliver everything on a silver platter, but it's there and it's profound. If you would, for once, pick up a book you could even read the excellent novel of Arthur C. Clark, as it would lend you some clues to the meanings of the movie, but I guess reading is out of the question, right? Something else I noted was that many claims it is "boring, two and a half hours of nothing". Well, it's not aimed for audiences of six-year-olds, or those adults with the attention span of a six-year-old. Like every complicated message it takes a while to carry it across. In fact, every scene in this movie, every moment of every scene, is very meaningful and carries part of the message - including the three-minute of black screen in the beginning of the film. "Oh my God, there's no explosions, no action, nothing... just a black screen. This movie sucks!" As for acting, well, it's perfectly adequate. The scenes on the Discovery are all breath takingly suspenseful, and the acting overall is realistic. For the most part, it hints of the naturalistic American cinema that is to come in the 70s.The special effects are of course, extremely good for it's time. Certainly, there are no CGI in this movie, as it is made in the 1960s. What is there though, is truly beautiful cinematography with astounding vistas of space. (Space IS empty, you know.) In conclusion, I believe I am for the most part preaching to the already enlightened, but those few of you who will not give this movie the time it takes to bring across it's message I say give it another go, keep an open mind and don't expect the movie to do all the thinking for you. Your brain is quite a large organ and should contain the necessary synapses to think deeper than the surface, read between the lines if you will. Try it. It doesn't hurt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2001 - A Space Odyssey commentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001 - A Space Odyssey (1968) offers a far more optimistic, if ambiguous, vision of man's future. Kubrick's most expensive film (costing over 10 1/2 million dollars), and it is at the same time one of his most personal. Though the novel subsequently published by the co-scriptwriter Arthur. C. Clarke makes clear that the film was worked out in conventional narrative terms, the film version eventually released four years after the scripting began lacks the customary Kubrick commentary over the images and avoids all dialog for half an hour at both beginning and end. The avoidance of verbalization is totally in keeping with the film's mythic content and does not preclude a tightly worked-out structure. The film is build up of four separate episodes, each tracing a crucial leap forward in the development of man seemingly triggered off by the appearance of a black monolith (the sign of intervention by extra-terrestrial beings of greater intelligence?) and occurring at a time of "magical alignment" of earth, sun and moon or their equivalents (the symbol of a predestined fate?). After an opening sequence, the Dawn of Man, showing the birth of the intelligence among the primitive ape-man of the Pleistocene era, the film proceeds through one of the most audacious transitions in film history from a bone tossed up into the air to a spaceship on its way to the moon four million years later. This section, accompanied by the music of "The Blue Danube", traces in almost documentary fashion a mission to investigate a second monolith, which sends off a message into space when struck by the first rays of the sun. A Jupiter Mission eighteen months later is dispatched into the solar system to track the destination of this message, but 'en route' the voyage of the spaceship 'Discovery' is almost destroyed by a conflict of a man and machine as the computer HAL 9000 tries to destroy the crew and take over control of the mission. After a further appearance of the monolith, the sole survivor Bowman is catapulted 'Beyond the Infinite' in a sequence of dazzling special effects. He ultimately arrives at the film's most enigmatic setting - a mysterious Louis XVI bedroom - where he ages rapidly before the final appearance of the monolith heralds his transformation into an embryonic form, a Star Child, whose image concludes the film. The ending is by intention an open one and much of the film's meaning is ambiguous, but it derives its enormous power from the combination of an examination of the nature of intelligence (in rising order: ape, man, machine and extra-terrestrial being) and its hypnotic visual style, formed of recurring patterns of circular and rectangular features and dominated by fetal and uterine imagery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mythological Documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**warning contains spoilers** In 2001: A Space Odyssey humanity has become so completely mechanized that computers are more human then people. There are still some comic elements ? the scientist posing for a conventional tourist picture against the moon monolith, Major Poole burning his surprisingly still sensitive flesh on a totally computerized meal ? but this is not a satire. Society has gone too far for that. Our civilization has come to an end, turned flat and weary and stale. There is no energy, no purpose, no creative intelligence. Each individual is merely a bored, faceless cog in a technological system. Kubrick conceived this film as a "mythological documentary," a modern legend of the origin and future of humankind. It is both realistic as a photo-essay and imaginary as a fable. It is essentially a religious movie. Replacing the traditional God of world religions is a cosmic intelligence that influences human evolution at certain pivotal moments. When the ape has evolved as far as it can as an instinctual animal, the first monolith appears, giving the power of creative intelligence that produces the tool-weapon. When that tool has been sophisticated as far as the human mind can conceive-the dramatic cut from the bone thrown into the air to the spaceship resembling it symbolizes this development-the monolith appears again to force humanity on to the next stage. Major Bowman, lacking character and personality as he is, still retains enough feeling to try to rescue his colleague, enough ingenuity to reenter the spaceship after he has been locked out, and enough dedication and courage to continue on his journey, to be chosen as the new human being. On the trip to Jupiter he transcends space, and once arrived there, he transcends time, watching himself age in minutes. As he dies, the monolith appears, he reaches out to it in greeting and gratitude, and is reborn into a creature that transcends his previous humanity. The change from human to Star Child is as drastic as from ape to human: the Star Child will continue our evolution with a radically new intelligence.</fullReview>

The spacecraft visuals inside, and out were no doubt well ahead of their time. I can't imagine how mind blowing it would have been to watch this in 1968 or anytime before the debut of the "Star Wars" films. It is easy to see how anyone who viewed this film during that time would regard this movie as one of the greatest of all time.In 2005 though, most of us have seen these kind of visuals many times before in fictional and real videos and photos. While still beautiful and fascinating their effect is no longer strong enough to keep my attention as long as this film asks during many scenes. I was left bored and impatient during most of the film.Afterwards, I was left wishing I could go back in time, in mind, so that I could experience this movie when it first debuted.I did not rate this movie, because I can plainly see that it WAS a very great film, just not that great for a first timer in 2005.</fullReview>

And this is older than the original Star Wars.This is about how the Earliest Human like creatures on earth experience a mysterious Black Rectangle that appears out of no where.It reappears on the earth's moon in an alternate 2001 A.D.A time where space stations and rockets are revolving around the earth.And a man sent on a space journey to investigate Jupiter. And a computer with a mind of it's own.Please know this movie is very long going with long silent parts that have little dialog.But still a great Sci-Fi flick to check out. The special effects in it are just amazing, it seemed like it was impossible to do that kind of stuff back then. Specially when this film was made 25 years before CGI was invented.If it weren't for this film George Lucas would never of gotten the inspiration to do Star Wars.It's rated G, since there's nothing too inappropriate for kids to see. But this is a little boring and long for a kid to sit and watch.Highly recommended to those who like old school Sci-Fi films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first impression i had from the movie was that the storytelling ruined the entire picture. The story of the movie is good, simple and functional, mankind finds a strange, alien artifact and sets off on a quest to get it. The problem is exactly in the the way the story is told. The movie has almost no dialog and compensates this with many scenes of "artistic" beauty that i found boring and almost useless. The characters have no real acting, with no background or personality traces, they're not charismatic in any way and you easily forget their names. Besides the linearity of the movie is somewhat strange, having no focus. Is this a bad movie?!, not at all, it's actually a good movie but it fails in the part that it could be entertaining. The scenes are extremely well filmed and you get the feeling the director mastered the art of movie making (just not the storytelling part). Unfortunately fails in some very important points. It's worth seeing one time, it's crazy seeing two times and it might bore you to death should you attempt to do it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey is a true jewel in film-making. While some parts might be too slow for the average movie-goer, anyone who is examining the history of films has to see it. One of the more interesting facts about this film is that it was made long before man landed on the moon. No need then to say that it is a corner stone in Sci-Fi.It blends psychological horror with believable characters that work extremely well together (is it strange to say that HAL and Dave had excellent chemistry?). It also carries what many consider to be one of the greatest film-musical moments.Bottom line: An impressive and thought provoking masterpiece that will continue to rank high on "all time greatest" lists for years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>God's Earth and man's destiny in '2001: A Space Odyssey'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"God is the light of the heavens and the earth. The allegory of His light is that of a concave mirror behind a lamp that is placed inside a glass container. The glass container is like a bright, pearl-like star. The fuel thereof is supplied from a blessed oil-producing tree that is neither eastern, nor western. Its oil is almost self radiating; needs no fire to ignite it. Light upon light. God guides to His light whoever wills (to be guided). God thus cites the parables for the people. God is fully aware of all things. Quran - 24:35" The science fiction film 2001: A Space Odyssey presents us with a journey not only in space but in time. We begin in darkness, perhaps representative of the primordial and absolute nothingness. And then light emerges, depicted through sunrise. This opening shot is accompanied by the orchestral music of Richard Strauss, from his "Also Sprach Zarathustra" symphony. Darkness and light in Zoroastrianism have particular significance and are extremely suggestive in the movie. The religion of Zoroastrianism is widely held to be a forerunner of the major monotheistic religions, including Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. In Zoroastrianism, light and fire are symbolic of the creative power itself. One cannot also ignore the reference to light in the book of Genesis, where we read that in the beginning "the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep?And God said: Let there be light." Thus, the transformation of darkness into light could be symbolic of existence. Moreover, one cannot ignore the works of Nietzsche who described the life and teachings of Zarathustra in his philosophy of the "Superman" that Man would evolve into. Thus existence is not a purposeless happening. Indeed human existence in the context of an evolutionary process can be towards a higher state of realization. We are engaged in the act of survivals or of self-preservation. This timeless challenge is portrayed in '2001' beginning with scenes from the Pleistocene world, where ape-man competes for food and water with other animals as well as with other rival groups from the same species. What is unfortunate but real is that the act of self-preservation can be violent. At least this proposition holds true historically as humans, who even after having developed consciousness have set out to slay others for resources. It should be noted that consciousness is not necessarily accompanied by moral excellence. Indeed, as it is portrayed in the movie, consciousness seems to be awakened in our progenitors as they used a bone as a tool. What is suggestive in '2001' is that scientific progress in and of itself does not curb the human tendency toward destruction and that we impart our innate and untamed violent tendencies to our own technological creations, as sophisticated as they may be. In the film, the ape-man throws the bone into the air and in one associative cut, the bone turns into a space vehicle "Discovery", suggesting that the human evolutionary progress advances through technological development. At the beginning, when viewing the spacecrafts and hearing this waltz, it seems that man has escaped the confines of this planet and by extension has escaped his own limitations and has reached a state of harmony and order. However we gradually come to realize that technological advances do not ensure inner or outer tranquility and Man, wherever s/he may be, must confront discord and destruction. While in the movie the ape-man used the tool to kill for food, we see Man in spacecrafts presented with variety of foods that is served by others on a tray as well as dispensed through machines. Thus the suggestion seems to be that even with abundance of food, that basic necessity of existence, for which our progenitors had to kill and be killed, and whether or not this basic human need is satisfied through technology (e.g., machines), the human existence is more sublime and beyond simple digestive requirements. Even in a materially abundant and advanced state, man is plagued with mistrust and discord as it is implied by Dr. Floyd's attempt to hide the discovery of the monolith from the Russian scientists or even from the crew of the Discovery. How else would a humanly created machine like HAL 9000 which was a major and a talking computer in the space ship strategies furthering its own interests? "...and I'm afraid that's something I cannot allow to happen," said HAL 9000 to astronaut David. As the film suggests, suspicion, egoism, destructive tendencies and other base human characteristics cannot be remedied through scientific progress. HAL 9000 is not a mere machine; it is a thinking entity upon which man has bequeathed his own intelligence, awareness, and character. And, this advanced creation displays human characteristics. When in a secure position, having control of the environment, the machine is confident, overpowering, and absolute in its dictates to others: "I'm sorry Dave; I can not let you do that, ? But, when the situation changes and this thinking entity realizes that its survival is in jeopardy, there is a noticeable change in its expressions. "Look Dave, I can see you're really upset about this...I 'honestly' think you ought to sit down calmly, take a stress pill and think things over." When faced with punishment and destruction, the thinking being is transformed from an autocratic murderer to a negotiating, pleading, obedient and submissive one. The universal creative cycle continues and the embryo represents evolution, existence, and human potential. The embryo facing our familiar planet may suggest that Earth, with all of its particularities, is a designated place suited not only for human existence but for our evolutionary progress toward a noble state of self-actualization. "We have established you on earth, and we have provided for you the means of support therein. Rarely are you appreciative -- Quran 7:10" Perhaps our struggle ought to be for an internal transformation and not merely satisfying the needs for such necessities as food and water.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is difficult to critique 2001 in less than 2001 pages, e.g., read the over long comments on this site?and any one of them just scratches the surface. 2001 is more than a movie.I have just viewed 2001 for the umpteenth time?and it just gets better and better. Those, who have deemed it to be the best science fiction movie ever, are probably correct. To describe it in one word, "STUNNING."?it is a work of everlasting art. 2001 has been called the number one movie that "shooked the world," and it still has tremendous impact for a production made over 35 years ago?ask NASA. Our space program has been developed using this movie as a model.However, it is not for everyone. It is not for those who like "shoot'em ups, and it is not for those who have no patience, no open mind, and no intelligence save that of a stone. Like me, many of IMDb' commentators have rated 2001 as a 10; but I'll bet none of them, including me, can concisely tell you why. The experience of viewing this film can be compared to one's seeing Leonardo's "Mona Lisa" and trying to explain why the painting is so revered.I did not have the time to read all the other commentators, but it is well-known that the main villainous character in the film is the computer, HAL?and if you go up one letter in our alphabet for each of the letters in HAL? H is I, A is B, and L is M?.you get IBM (International Business Machines), which, in 1968, was the Microsoft of today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are a sci-fi movie buff, 2001 it's a film you'll enjoy, not only because the beauty of the photograph and the plot, but the scientific and metaphysics background surrounding the whole film. From the Dawn of Man to the space travel to Jupiter we are grasped by the hand of Kubrick and A. C. Clarke and we are shown to a world of discoveries: Videophones, computer graphics, use of cards with magnetic bands for pay phones, no-sound-in-void-of-space, talking computers, computer Chess games, hibernating bodies for long-term travels, etc. OK, FX are cheesy, I admit it, but come on, the year the film was made is 1968, we can forgive that. The restaurated release of the film and the remasterized sound makes you think it was filmed a year or two ago. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a Beta, VHS, DVD or UMD you MUST have in your collection. Enjoy it all the time you want and you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is Stanley Kubrick's vision based on the work of Arthur C. Clarke. A scientific background is helpful in seeing the point. We are presented with the idea that human intelligence was jump-started by aliens. When man reaches into space, he is reaching back to his source. This is consistent with the Panspermia theory, that life did not evolve on Earth but grew from spores brought to our planet by comets. The film confuses more than clarifies at the end. It degenerates into a semblance of an LSD trip. No one knows what it means, if anything. 2001 proved to be nothing like Kubrick's prophecy. It is remembered most for 9/11.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen 2001: A Space Odyssey on VHS, but I had the pleasure of seeing it on the "big screen" at a local art-house theater on August 29, 2005.Pros:1. Groundbreaking special effects. 2. Epic, majestic, awe-inspiring. But also perplexing and confounding (that's not a negative). There are no easy answers or explanations ? the viewer has to decide for themselves what is happening and why. This ambiguity adds to the mysterious, mystical atmosphere. 3. Brilliant use of classical music. 4. With visual style to spare, Kubrick directs with an artist's eye, resulting in some breathtaking images. 5. Colorful, mood-enhancing cinematography. 6. Kubrick was a stickler for details, and it shows. Sound waves cannot travel in outer space, so, except for a few scenes with the sounds of human breathing, Kubrick films the outer space scenes in complete silence. The silence is haunting. 7. Provocative, much "food for thought."Negative:1. Somewhat slow, tedious pace?but Kubrick's direction is so strong that 2001: A Space Odyssey never becomes dramatically inert.Interesting side-note:The human characters are bland and emotionally distant (with the viewer and other characters in the film), but the HAL 9000 computer has the most soothing voice ? an intentional choice that makes HAL seem the most human.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, but not perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>?2001-a space odyssey" is an excellent sci-fi film, an amazing achievement of imagination and philosophical/existential motives that was nominated for an Oscar for best director and screenplay, but it's still not a masterpiece. Stanley Kubrick was without doubt a great director, but he was almost never emotionally connected with his characters- actually he practically didn't care about them- which resulted in a cold mood throughout his stories. His philosophy was ?This happens because it's interesting ", but in other films ( ?La Strada", ?Being There", ?The Graduate", ?Kareshi Kanojo no Jijyou") the philosophy was ?This happens because it's magic".?2001" is an unique experiment. Actually, it's almost something Jean-Luc Godard would have loved to make. It's stripped of any kind of action, suspense, emotion, humor or story, and the only thing it has is style. But what a great style it has. The first half an hour has no dialog and shows prehistoric apes who learned to use bones as tools/weapons after an encounter with an mysterious monolith. By using tools, their intelligence progressed and eventually evolved them into humans. In 2001 Astronauts started a mission to find that Monolith near Jupiter.-------------The Monolith is a symbol of the highest ideal, inspiration for humans, but it's limits are always beyond reach. It influenced the human mentality, but after the invention of tools it moved, disappeared from Earth. And after the astronaut Bowman made contact with him, the Monolith reacted by putting him in a ( time? ) portal ( showed by an amazing visual style, especially memorable in the ?slide show" of lights ) and transporting him into a ?human zoo", a normal, Earth looking room where he made himself comfortable. When Bowman became old, the Monolith transformed him into an ever higher being, maybe his own, and brought him back to Earth where the next step of evolution could start. Did the Monolith have pity with him? It would have been very interesting to hear some sort of conversation between Bowman and him, but that didn't happen. Also, unfortunately, Bowman had almost no character development. He was the main character and Kubrick took more interest of the HAL computer than him, but that's not important. ?2001" is a fantastic film, but it's not flawless. It takes a great deal of concentration to watch it, and sometimes its just simply- dare I say it?-pretentious and boring. Such a big story about human progress could have been more entertaining, but it's still a big story. And making such a thin, allegorical story work really is art.Grade: 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great movies always have great quotes. Gone With the Wind has, "Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn", Casablanca has, "Here's looking at you kid...", and The Godfather had, "I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse...". All of these lines show emotion and give the movie it's tempo. Yet one of the most famous lines of all time comes from a movie that has very little dialogue. "Open the pod bay doors, HAL..." This is the line from 2001: A Space Odyssey that made AFI's 100 years...100 Movie Quotes list, enshrining all of those lines we keep saying long after watching the movie.In Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, Kubrick takes us on an incredible voyage from the dawn of man to space age. We see how man has evolved and keeps evolving. The movie starts out with an overture and then we enter a barren landscape. The only life appears to be a few boars and the creatures in focus...the apes. When a black monolith appears in the middle of their clan, they begin to evolve ever so slightly just by discovering the first weapon...the club. From here Kubrick zooms us to Earth's orbit.Here we meet up with Dr. Heywood Floyd, a man who's mission is to see what is going on at the lunar. What they discover is another black monolith like the one the apes came into contact with. Figuring out that it came from Jupiter, we now climb aboard the vessel heading their with Dr. Dave Bowman and Dr. Frank Poole. Also on the ship are more scientists and explorers. They are in hibernation, being kept alive by the on board computer, HAL 9000. HAL is everything a ship needs. It guides the crew, helps them, talks with them, and even connects with them. It can conduct interviews and just about anything a ship and its crew needs. The HAL 9000 series is a foolproof machine that seems to be the perfect unit for the job. The only problem might be that it is too smart and can actually...feel. When a piece of equipment malfunctions due to unknown causes, Dave and Frank question HAL's method for solving the problem. They feel as if it is working against them and the mission. It seems that HAL knows something that they don't. This is the start of a whole different problem for Dave and Frank.This film is a standout in a genre that is full of gems. 2001: A Space Odyssey shows incredible achievements in Special Effects, winning and Oscar for Best Effects in 1969. The quality I most admire of the film is how real it appears to be. The flow of dialogue, of which there is very little of, sounds like something you'd hear if you worked on a space station. It sounds at times like everyday life. The cinematography is fantastic. Much like all Kubrick films it has the Stanley Kubrick quality in the way it is presented. It is very original and fresh.Kubrick's direction is so well crafted. This is by far one of his best pieces of work. He has 9 movies on IMDb's Top 250 list which is more than half of all the films he has made. 2001: A Space Odyssey will open your eyes in a way you can't explain. Kubrick's camera direction, musical selection, and overall timing of the movie is perfect. It's a movie light-years ahead of it's time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lao Tsu once said, "One word of explanation, is one too many." This film,is one of those sublime expressions that will never be understood by the ignorant or the stupid. If you're not fully conscious, as with most people, you'll never understand the staggering simplicity of 2001's message. It's one of those times when, if you don't "get it", no amount of explaining will help. But if you do receive the message, you do so in a way that is impersonal, and non-intellectual. Meaning, that fundamental awareness, or "ground of being" if you wish, is not an intellectual phenomenon. One can't "think" about that which precedes thought. Essential awareness is purely experiential. If I were forced to distill an explanation for those who live exclusively reaction-formative lives, I suppose that I would say, "Time and space are illusions, and indeed the world itself, an artifact. But the Universe is real, and flows from one source. The reason we are here, is to come to the realization that 'we', are that source, and the journey is not from here to there, but from here to here." I can already sense the anger and rage from some who will read this. Fear is the root of all "evil", so don't be afraid to let go. Read "The Mysterious Stranger", by Mark Twain. It's a short story published after his death and may help some to peel back the layers.</fullReview>

Even if you have seen the movie several times it remains one of the most fascinating and fresh films of all time, and you can always find new details, that you did not see the first time around. I really don't consider it a real movie as such; it's lacking a genuine narrative and the story get's lost in the overall message of man and machine in space and so on and so forth. But it's a voyage in a sort of conciseness that transcends the story (and the genre!) and culminating in that strangest of endings ever in a SF-movie. A unique film, no doubt one of the most important Kubrick ever made.</fullReview>

I believe the 20 mins. consisted of the hum-drum life on the ship which added greatly to the flavor of the picture. It was a true director's cut. For the life of me, I don't understand why MGM does not release it full length for sale and put it out in theaters that can handle Cinerama. I know I'd buy it and I know I'd go.

		<fullReview>One thing I have to get out of the way is that I did not like the first half of 2001. I know that's blasphemy to many, but I'm an avid Star Wars fan who's heard nothing but complaints about Star Wars, so give me this one. I dislike the Blue Danube Waltz. It's the classical music equivalent of bubblegum pop. All the ship movements and people walking on the ceiling is just gratuitous special effects, ironic since most hold 2001 up as sci-fi movies that does not rely on pointless fx.But it's the second half where the movie comes alive. We get to know these characters, the humans and HAL the computer. The scene where HAL watches the astronauts talk about its mistakes is haunting. The machine is suffering from human paranoia, and as in any psycho movie, we see the frail character act out violently.It is as David is sneaking back unto the ship to shut down HAL that Kubrick's slow pace works perfectly. David must be meticulous, the slightest mistake and he will die. His breathing and his careful actions make up one of the most intense scenes ever.Then the finale, going through the stargate. If you didn't know this was a 1960's movie before, you would know it from this scene. It is haunting and beautiful. No, like most people, I don't quite get the scenes of David as an old man on another planet, eating dinner. But there's always been something interesting to me about people in the far reaches of space doing very normal things in normal-looking, places. I can't quite put it into words. The loneliness of the scene is a fascinating thing.I could analyze the ending, 'the Star Baby represents the id' but that kind of thing has never been important to me as a viewer. It's the dramatic resonance of 2001, and the glorious music finale, that leaves me with something positive, a plot that starts out simply enough and veers into something larger, a regular human in the midst of a grand universe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie in three parts...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really like the way that the great director (the Late) Stanley Kubrick gives us several movies in one. He did it with 'Full Metal Jacket' and has also done it with '2001'...Part 1 of '2001' is The Dawn of Man and the antics of ape-men and the discovery of a black rectangular monolith are the focus here. At the end of Part 1 a bone is sent up flying up into the air and it comes down as a spaceship! Part 2 is about the discovery of a second monolith on the moon, eons later, and the subsequent Jupiter mission. This is the main part of the movie and HAL the homicidal super-computer features in this section. And there is one famous line here which sends a shiver up the spine: "Open the pod bay doors, HAL." Part 3 is Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite, which some people have said is close to an LSD trip. Certainly it's beyond words.And how do the three parts fit together? There is no one definitive answer to this, but the monoliths are the common thread, and it could be suggested that they somehow shape the course of human evolution.It should be noted the the so-called sequel to 2001, 2010, is not a Stanley Kubrick film, and is unlike one in many ways. I've heard it said that if you liked 2001, you won't like 2010, and vice-versa.</fullReview>

Bowman jogs and tans in shallow right, is thrown out attempting to steal home in high-tech Zamboni. Poole plays chess and loses, consoles self with bad sketches in dugout. HAL throws spitball, again wild, Poole advances to outer space on passed astronaut. Poole sucks vacuum, sends HAL to showers, flies into acid trip, grows old faster than Farrah Fawcett, shucks husk, switches teams and scores winning run by circumnavigating globe before learning to walk.Aliens win 1-0, except that reality is inverted and final score in papers is listed as "bent doughnut."

		<fullReview>First off, "2001: A Space Odyssey" is the single greatest visual experience ever committed to film. If you choose to ignore whatever philosophical or thematic issues are raised, there is enough ocular splendor to make it worth watching.Secondly, those issues are presented in such a way as to make you a participant of the film, not just an observer, making the experience all the more enriching. It's fitting that Kubrick chose to fill the sci-fi tableaux with classical music. He has the artistry of a symphonic conductor, and time and human civilization seem to dangle from his conductor's wand. The only criticism I can come up with is the lack of specific humanity. The movie's grand themes explore the essence of the universe and the nature of the human being, the universe's greatest invention. "The Power Of Myth," an interview of Joseph Campbell by Bill Moyers, tackles the same themes and is just as stirring, but it consists almost entirely of to old dudes yapping in a living room.</fullReview>

If you want to think something interesting for the first time in your life, so you have to see the film.Seriously, really i don't care if the film is slow and blah blah blah. The films is a good product. Don't lose it man!!! Life is so short and Kubrick can give you a lot of questions and answers. And the music!!!! You have to listen, is really special. Its not a film to see with friends or a girlfriend, you have to see it alone or with somebody who enjoy cine very much. Its not a typical film. Its a film of thoughts. see you</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate trip!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best sci-fi I have ever seen!!! I've read the book before seeing the movie and couldn't imagine how such a story could be filmed. But Stanlez Kubrick proved it is possible! It was (a little bit) slow-motioned, but nonetheless brilliant. Especially the ground-breaking visual FX. I am absolutely sure that if filmed today, it would be completely CGI and visibly not realistic. The models and effects really deserved the Oscar. Although I didn't understand the ending until I watched it three times, the overall effect of the movie was that I saw monoliths all over my room and was waiting for a game of chess with Hal 9000... Absolutely brilliant and disturbing, simply an EPIC!!! The music in the movie is also great, with the Waltz working perfectly, the ships dancing in the realistic space.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Art film...Mediocre Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, I finally saw this weird film and I still don't know what to think of it. I'm not sure if I liked it or not. One of the weirdest movies I've ever seen. It's brilliant visually, but......nothing happens. The film has no substance, and it tries to fool you into thinking it does. The classic "so weird it must mean something" fits this one like a tie. It's hard to explain, but something about this movie I didn't like. There is VERY little story, and the little that is there is not interesting. It's an art flick, and a big leap in sci-fi films at the time, but for entertainment purposes I would have to pass on this one.I understand that it was not meant to be understood, but why make a film like that? Maybe I'll 'get it' ten years down the road.Very difficult to rate this film, because as an art film it warrants a 10/10, but as a film for entertainment value I see myself giving it a 4/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sound of Silence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey stands up to its hype and makes the audience proud of what they've just seen. This 139 minutes of space adventuring is quite fine to view. The character Dave who is played by Keir Dullea is an excellent actor and the only film I've ever seen him play in. His looks and his voice is perfect for the movie and I can't believe he isn't a very popular actor. He should of been in more big films like this movie. Even though this film is quite an achievement, 75% of the film is in silence with like no talking at all but of course it's in space, right? A very bizarre film indeed and the music is quite excellent. A great G rated mysterious movie by one of my favorite directors, Stanley Kubrick. I recommend this filmHedeen's outlook: 9/10 A- ***+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand what the debate is about. I find this film beautifuland interesting. If you don't - don't watch it again. So many filmsare watched and forgotten about. If you are not so young - as manyof you are who commented on this film - you might feel differentlyabout this film . This is a film that actually makes sense to me. Asyou get older and thoughts of life and death and the meaning toour existence come more often, you tend to view the message ofart differently. Art will exist for others. You and I will die and whatwill we leave for others to try to understand? Is there anything moreamazing than the idea of procreation and the fact that all of us willage die and others will age and die ad infinitum? I think Kubrickconstantly explores the meaning to our existence and relationships with each other. Watch his other films and see ifwhat I say makes sense to you. If not -than watch something elsethat doesn't make you think of your place in the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The beginning of this movie takes place at the beginning of time. There are a bunch of apes that seem to be at the beginning of time on earth. The apes also are separated into what it seems like two different groups. Then they find this black thing on the planet and all the apes are just looking at it. After this one group of the apes learns how to use weapons such as bones to kill each other. After they fight the ape throws the bone into the air and time fast forwards to 2001 and the bone turns into a satellite.The next part of the movie is the mission that Dave and the rest are suppose to go on. The received signals from Jupiter and sent them on mission to go find out. Dave goes on one ship and was able to talk to his daughter before he is sent on his big mission. Dave and another pilot are awake and able to keep and eye on things. There are other member on board in hibernation. When there on the moon they see that black thing that the apes noticed. H.A.L is the computer that is in control over the ship. He is given his own personality. H.A.L has cameras all over the ship looking over everything. At first H.A.L seems fine and able to function fine. Then he makes a mistake on one of the satellites saying that there is a problem with it, Dave goes and checks in out and finds out that there is nothing wrong. Dace and the other astronaut decide to manually shut down H.A.L in case he makes more serious mistakes. H.A.L let the other astronaut fly out in space and Dave had to go in and manually shut it down.The end of the movie can be interpreted in different ways. Dave ends up in some room that seems to pass time by very quickly. He starts off as the astronaut then as the man at the seat then in bed and finally as the baby. He is starting life all over again. Once your life is over you live something else after. The baby may not have been going to our earth bu rather a different one in another galaxy. Then when flying to Jupiter he went through all those lights. The final seen is the baby flying over the earth keeping you wondering what this means.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Splendid Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the movie when I was a child. I didn't remember much about the movie from that age except for the music. As a musician, I was nearly in tears throughout the film. As for those people who scorn the film for lack of the general entertaining factors, I hate to say it, but you most likely have allowed yourself to be overcome with simplicity. The film is not trying to impress movie critics. The objective is to stir the imaginations of the viewers, and shed light on the possibilities of what goes on beyond our tiny little telescopes here on Earth. A million people could give a million different interpretations of what the movie meant. However, the one interpretation of "it didn't mean anything" or "was a waste of time", are pretty pathetic overviews. It is imaginations like those of Mr. Kubrik's, that have changed the way we live forever. For instance, the the general invention of the light bulb, electric conductivity AND, the operation of computers. Let's hope the world never has to know a human race where at least some of the population won't fail to dream beyond our atmosphere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It took me many years to finally get round to watching this but i am now very glad i did. I am a big Kubrick fan anyway so I was expecting great things and as soon as i became aware it was directed by him I knew I should view it. The scale of this film is amazing and it is hard to believe it was made so many years ago. Although slightly dated in terms of todays special effects it was a remarkable achievement of its time. The film looks at evolution and how far it could take us. It also shows the difference between artificial life and humans and how they can cause problems and not always be trusted. I like this film because it certainly makes you think about life in the grander scale while also leaving things open to interpretation at the end.</fullReview>

So I check with a few 2001 buffs on the net and they all talk about "the immortal line". So I have not imagined it or got confussed with another movie.Seems I have bought an edited version of the movie that doesn't have that line in it! How come? Why edit it out?

		<shortDescription>Strikes Incredible Emotional Highs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two hugely popular, slowly paced science fictions films that fascinatingly question what makes humanity: Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and Andrei Tarkovsky's Solaris. The difference between the former film and the latter one is that Solaris is slowly paced because Tarkovsky feels no need to rush the film's story whereas 2001 is slowly paced to cram in as many beautiful visuals as possible and that Solaris's musings on what is human are done touchingly where as 2001's are done in a knock-you-off-your-feat fashion. It is easy to see why Tarkovsky does not like 2001 (Solaris is infinitely better), but it is not so easy to agree with Tarkovsky. The film is a little alienating in its constant flashiness, filled with annoying shots that seem like they were filmed for the soul purpose of being included in the previews, but the film also strikes incredible emotional highs from its sheer boldness and its beautiful use of the wide-angle lens. The film also impresses me in the way it managed to connect with so many people. However, it seems, from what I've heard from fans of the film, that the film's appeal is as superficial as, say, Star War's appeal; it is packed with exiting plot elements: The opening at 'The Dawn of Man', the magnificently filmed spaceships, the killer computer, the eye-popping voyage into the future, and so on. I never will forget the star child, the first use of a tool, Hal 9000 (the red eye with the yellow dot is one of the most terrifying images in cinema), Hal's death (filmed with such incredible power). The film's gimmicks die down towards the end, the questions of man's place in the universe become more complex, and the film becomes a much more meaty, lively experience. It is a cinematic treasure, though it isn't the pop-culture landmark it is made out to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When was the last time you saw science and art work so brilliantly together in such fascinating composition as Kubrick lays out to you in this literally, time-less movie? Never have i seen such a movie leave so much for an audience to interpret, without leaving them totally lost in what they just saw. A philosophical, science-fiction film with captivating characters and special effects which can still put to shame modern, high budget blockbusters. Full of symbolism and a dark look into a future which has all and no chance of ever happening, Kubrick's Dystopia is one which is left to your own imagination. Follow mankind's quest for knowledge and meaning, then start a journey of your own when the credits stop rolling and your left in starry-eyed wonder.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie three times in the last two days. The first time I watched it I didn't have many favourable thoughts about Mr Kubrick. Later I kind of understood why this movie is considered "one of the best films in the history". If you're looking for a story line, drama, humour or other components that we see in mainstream movies, don't waste your time with "2001: A Space Odyssey". If you are after cinematography, good directorship and vision you HAVE TO see this one. What makes this film special is the fact that it was made in 1968. One has to admire Mr Kubrick's vision of the future at the time. It is also a horribly slow movie. I mean really slow. The scene HAL kills hibernating crew takes 1 minute 22 seconds. One third of this period one hears an annoying "beep". The second one-third is more annoying beep. The last period is silence. The movie is full of such scenes, and quite frankly it is rather irritating. That's when you'll really appreciate the fast forward option of your DVD player. Sorry, but I don't get this artistic technique. Mr Kubrick did the same in "Eyes Wide Shut", and I left the theatre. All in all, IMHO, this is an important piece in the history of film making. Yet, I'd call this movie "one of the best" among its own kind only. It's not prudent comparing this film with mainstream ones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>it starts off with a view of earth and jupiter aligned.where do we come from, and where we are headed.the story starts with "the dawn of Man", a documentary-like view of the Pre-historic grass-eater ape that was facing its extinction due to no physical ability that would let him hunt to eat, and the lack of grass and water in the austral Africa. the monkeys hadn't survived if it wasn't for the "god-like" intervention of an alien artifact, that somehow transformed the apes that touched it, and gave them the ability to use tools, that were first used as weapons that allowed them to kill pigs to eat for super and to kill other monkeys in fights for water. that ape was Man. an enigmatic start for an enigmatic film.after the fast-forward that leaves the movie at the present days, we see a magnificent dance of spaceships at the sound of Strauss. The rest of the movie is about how tools got control of Man. the strange artifact appears once again to evolve Man to his final stage: the starchild.at 1968, the year this movie was released, only astronauts had idea of what was out there in space. after this movie, that changed. it's futurism took 7 years to be explored. the special effects are incredible. they are completely realistic, even today.the directing, along with excellent taste in music, good acting, and the fantastic filmography, makes it an epic.the plot, with its vision of the year 2001 and the evolution of man tools, with an AI psycokiller, with the psycotropical hypnotising end, makes it the trip our lives.if you have never seen this movie, see it. don't be scared with the lack of dialog, sit back and enjoy. it's a symphony of evolution. it's terrific.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My take, beware, many spoilers here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I'm probably reiterating on many opinions posted before, this is my take on the film. I just got through watching it for the first of probably several times.OK, so at the beginning we have apes, apes who cannot stand up-right, apes who are fighting others, apes who are being mauled by cheetahs. Then on one day a large rectangular object is found planted in the earth. We hear millions of strange voices coming from this box. One group of apes study and touch the box carefully. In the next scene, one ape discovers that by using tools one's life can be significantly improved (aka: the definition of technology). That ape then uses this newly found tool and destroys another ape. Immediately after this, he and the other apes of his group can now stand up-right for the first time in history, thereby evolving into greater beings.Flash forward 2000 years.This same rectangular object is discovered by humans, we again hear the millions of strange voices. The men also study it and touch it ever so carefully. I believe this rectangle contains the creation, knowledge, and history of all time as we know it.18 years after this discovery, man has made another advancement in science, HAL. This creation becomes the link to the following evolution of man. Man created it, and it is, in many ways, better than man. Except for being defenseless from violent acts against it.Once it is destroyed, the main character (I've forgotten his name already), is guided to and through, yet another mysterious rectangle. By the act of entering this, for lack of a better word, omniscient entity; the world ends, or just begins (depending on how you'd like to look at it). We see a tremendous spectrum of light that leads us to barren landscape (the end of the physicality of the earth), and then finally what appears to be a gaseous implosion (the beginning or the end of the universe).At this point our hero enters a colonial style room, and sees three different versions of himself. This is the end of life for the last man alive. Then as we approach the eldest of men, he directs us to the mysterious rectangle for the last time. This man becomes the representation of the evolvement of man into his final phase. I believe that this child-like creature represents the consciousness of man as a whole. Our entire history and reality is contained in this sphere, much like the mysterious rectangle. It will communicate all knowledge it has received to future life forms, and the universe will continue to evolve to no end.And that's what I think.I hope I get a response to this. This board is probably pretty dead, considering this film is 4 decades old now.But masterfully done to this day no less.Good evening now.</fullReview>

I can see how the effects were amazing, given that they don't look cheap and shoddy even today. Still, a movie ,where the first words don't happen until roughly 25 minutes into the movie, is making a huge mistake. The plot is incomprehensible. I turned around and asked my dad what had happened when the movie finished. There is only one thing that comes even close to saving this movie and that is the perfect marriage that is "Also Sprach Zarathustra" and the discovery of bone as a weapon. Still, nothing can save the movie not the music and not HAL.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>misunderstood (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick liked the idea that reality is ultimately ambiguous. When you see someone do something but doesn't say anything, you can only speculate why that person did it. Even if the person tries to explain why, the explanation might be incomplete, might not capture the entire essence of the moment. In 2001: A Space Odyssey, Kubrick's thesis is that the events you're seeing on the screen are related to each other, and that Kubrick probably has a definite interpretation of them, but he's still not going to tell you his interpretation, because it would undermine the reality shown on the film.Some people say there is very little plot. Let's walk through the 'The Dawn of Man' sequence. We see some apes, presumably our evolutionary ancestors, barely subsisting on some barren wasteland (Africa?). We see that they're vegetarian and that they coexist with some pig creatures. We see them organized in clans and conducting yelling contests for control over a precious pond of water. Not only are the food/water scarce, there are vicious predators to constantly worry about. Then one day they see a strange foreign object. They're at first afraid of it, but gradually they become drawn to it, as if it is subconsciously communicating to them. At the same time the sun and the moon become aligned, suggesting that the object is extraterrestrial. Shortly after this incident, one of the apes discovers that a leg bone can be used to kill the pig creatures, thereby affording a new source of food. This is quite a big mental leap for an ape, so presumably the extraterrestrial object somehow made the apes smarter. We see the apes turn from vegetarians to omnivores. They all have plenty to eat now and they've taught each other how to use bones as weapons. We now return to the two tribes bickering at the water hole again, but this time one tribe is equipped. The more powerful tribe decides to use their power to kill the leader of the weaker tribe. So while the weapons help the apes survive in this harsh environment, they also allow the possibility of war amongst themselves. And so this state of growing technology continues, to this day.Judging from the above paragraph, I don't know about you, but it seemed like Kubrick definitely had a story to tell. His way of telling it is to juxtapose related events, and it is not difficult to guess what the relationship could be (at least not for 2001:A Space Odyssey). But it does require speculation, and to allow the viewer the time needed to become inspired to speculate, the film must run at a slower pace than is normally expected in other movies. Often if we watch a lot of a certain kind of movie, we tend to see their similarities and tend to expect to see these characteristics when we watch new movies. For example, the vast majority of movies contain lots of dialogue that directly reveal the plot, so we expect this sort of thing when we watch a new movie. In addition, we tend to compare the movies using these similarities as criteria; for example, we evaluate the quality of the dialogue and how cleverly it is used to drive the plot. But these evaluations are based on the assumption that our preconceived expectations are not only the norm, but in fact the way things *should* be. I disagree with this assumption, and my unqualified enjoyment of 2001: A Space Odyssey is proof of this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For some, not for others; still remarkable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think there are two types of movie-goers. The first type wants anobvious story. And heck, I think that is what the fundamentalpurpose of a movie is: to allow us to sit for two hours and to beentertained while munching on popcorn. Lots of action and colorare also desired stimulation.The other type wants the same thing, but will also accept "think"movies. This is the type that doesn't do that well all of the time,especially on television. This is good entertainment, too, but at thesame time its plot elements aren't always so clear. This, however,is not a mistake; it's done on purpose to leave us thinking,wondering, and talking about what we've just seen. It's harder tomake this kind of movie, because you just don't follow formula. But when it's done well, it can be a wonder to behold.2001 is the latter type of movie. Most of the movie has nodialogue. The plot is unclear. The characters are not clearlydrawn. But it is so well done, the mystery of the film's messageoutweighs all of these items. Rather than have a narrator spellthings out for us in the beginning, and explain them in the end,we're left to do that for ourselves. And when we begin to arrive atconclusions, we realize just how good this movie is.I think it's unfair for people who don't enjoy "think" movies to putdown 2001. Once you accept it, think about it, and talk about it, youhave to admit that it's well done for what it is. For people who likethat kind of movie, it's a tremendous, memorable achievement. For those who don't, it's not right to say that it's slow and boring. There's a lot going on underneath the surface; it just takes somework to find it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A cautionary tale about the power, and limits, of technology and the ultimate nightmare of technology taking over. The monoliths act as 'book ends' in the evolution of man, from the time the first ape-ancestor developed enough imagination to recognise the use of a bone as a tool - in this case a weapon - giving it ascendancy over all other beasts and dominion over our tiny planet, a big fish in a little pond.By 2001 technology starts to take over and realises that man has outgrown his/her usefulness. The next monolith effectively stands as a marker in man's evolution, and the final 'act' suggests that we need to look somewhere else for the next stage in our development, a tiny fish in a sea of infinity. Have we come as far as we are going to get? As Dave comes face to face with his own mortality, the answer to what lies beyond remains out of reach. The star-child suggests we have come full circle, have travelled as far as man-made technology can take us, and are beginning again.Was the monolith left by aliens? God? or is it simply a metaphor for the power of the imagination, the acquirement of knowledge/understanding?The visual effects in this film (produced while moon landings were still a figment of man's imagination) remain stunning, even 35 years later, but even more powerful are the ideas. No sci-fi film since has escaped its shadow. The concepts will be familiar to anyone who has seen the Alien (with its android keeping secrets from the crew and ultimately seeking to destroy them in the effort to complete its mission) and Terminator (machines taking over) series.Many have found the ending unsatisfying because it doesn't give answers - but would we still be talking about it 35 years later if it had?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uniquely Boring and Brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kubrick's sci-fi epic is arguably,even nearly four decades on,technically the most accomplished of it's kind ever made.This is not surprising,since Kubrick was,with little doubt,the fussiest,most meticulous of filmmakers. Visually,the film is breathtaking,with special effects that are still remarkably convincing,and unlike every other sci-fi caper there are no scaly alien psychos,no ray-gun fights,no spaceship chases,no planets being blown-up.Instead,we have a measured,methodically-paced narrative which(personally)gets off to an interminable start with actors in ape suits(no where near as good as the same year's PLANET OF THE APES),but the scene finishes ingeniously when a flying bone cuts to the shape of a space station floating in orbit.The big 'if' about 2001 is the human interest,or rather the lack of it.Kubrick has(most certainly deliberately)no big name actors in the film,only mildly well known North American performers like Keir Dullea,William Sylvester,and Robert Beatty,but there are surprising appearences by the great Leonard Rossiter(better known for his roles in classic British sitcoms like RISING DAMP and REGGIE PERRIN)and even veteran BBC newsreader Kenneth Kendall,on BBC 12(an accurate prediction of cable and satalite TV). The problem for the actors is that the script is just plain dull,and the only real character of interest is a non-human,HAL the computer,a gentle-voiced,monotoned contraption that turns nasty(superbly voiced by Douglas Rain). Despite the sensuous visuals before it,the final journey into infinity is a quite extraordinary piece of cinema which even surpasses the outstanding model work seen earlier in the film.The ending is either confusing,pointless,obscure,symbolic or meaningful according to your mood,but despite the lack of human feeling throughout,just sit back and enjoy some of the most lustrous images ever filmed,or even,as they did in 1968,think of it as 'THE ULTIMATE TRIP',without LSD!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have just watched this on tv for about the hundreth time and still it weaves a rare spell of visionary magic.There is no point in trying to convince those who believe this to be the most boring film ever made, just as there is no need to preach to the converted who love this as a work of genius.Just remember that without the technology that exists today, Stanley Kubrick made what is still the benchmark film of the genre.This is a magnificent movie that paved the way for so many space films,none of which can hold a candle to 2001.But it is more than just a sci-fi drama. It is a mesmerising symphony of vision and sound that is unlikely to be equalled because, unlike most directors today, Kubrick wasn't a slave to SFX. And studios today would baulk at the time this movie took to make.Stanley Kubrick was a true pioneer, let's be thankful that he gave us so many great movies.10/10 and a big thank you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite possibly the best eye candy ever put on film. Kubrick took five years on this film and it shows in the intricacy of each shot. Unfortunately...he spent so much time on the visuals that he forgot to add a story to accompany them.It's amazing that in over 2 hours of movie...very little actually happens. I'd consider it probably the most pretentious movie ever made. Kubrick has no qualms about making the viewer sit for 20+ minutes in front of a swirling array of colors and not bothering to tell them why they are doing so. Arthur C. Clarke said they were aiming to show something "metaphysical" or "beyond our level of understanding." If that means they wanted it to make no sense then they succeeded gloriously. And don't sit through it expecting all to be explained in a climax at some point. The end sequence is the most confusing and pointless part...with next to no relation to previous events.It's probably worth it just to see the visuals. However I wouldn't see it again...and if you don't ever see it...don't lose any sleep.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I finally got around to watching this epic sci-fi movie by Kubrick and while I was completely awed by the camera work and special effects (not many movies from the 1960s have effects that do not look dated in 2003) I was not sure `what happened' at the end. The early plot with the apes discovering tools, and the evolution of the first tool (a bone hammer) into the `latest' tool (a space ship, and furthermore, a super computer) made sense to me I just did not get what happened when our astronaut arrived in the bedroom/womb/Jupiter.Also, the supercomputer HAL is wonderfully portrayed and explored. I enjoyed watching HAL develop the ability to rationalize and make complex decisions. Even better was listening to HAL trying to sleaze his way out of being turned off.All in all, I am glad I stayed with it, and I may try to read the book one of these days?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey is based on a novel by sci-fi author Arthur C. Clarke. The complex storyline starts four million years ago, when peace loving apes discover a black slab or stone, which somehow causes them to evolve into violent hunters, prepared to kill to protect their territory. Then, some time in the distant future, the slab begins signalling from the moon and a craft, controlled by the computer called HAL, is sent to investigate. In mid-voyage, HAL starts to malfunction and wipes out the crew, before one astronaut manages to disconnect it and return safely to earth. 2001: A Space Odyssey transformed special effects and inspired many later sci-fi blockbusters'. Viewed today, the effects are still startling. Echoing many of the themes popular in the 1950s, the film shows that although humanity has become increasingly greedy and brutish, it still has the power to reform. Audiences either loved or loathed 2001: A Space Odyssey.My rating: 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: SpoilersFrom the dawn of man to man destiny. From the time man created technology to the time technology fought back against man. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a movie like no other, it stands as a category of its own. Legendary director Stanley Kubrick and author Arthur C. Clark have put together a spectacular masterpiece that can make one wonder about life and the universe.This is a story about the entire evolution and destiny of humanity, how it started and where it's headed. It starts off showing how man got seperated from the ape species and went its own way like no other creature on earth had done before. Four billion years ago, a spices of ape had lived as helpless scavengers, carefully feeding themselves at day, hiding together in caves at night, tribes fighting together with tribes over territory and muddy water but not knowing how to fight. They were living in fear of predators, seeing their friends get attacked and killed and not knowing what to do about it. Then one morning, a small tribe had been encountered by a mystical black, rectangular object which changed the way that this certain small group of apes think. One ape discovered that he could use a bone as a weapon to attack others and defend himself, this was the very first wave of technology. He uses it so his tribe could defend their territory against other apes. This will be the tribe that will evolve into man. The black object known as the monolith was calling man out to the orbit of Jupiter and it waited four billion years for man to have the capability to make it there so man can confront its true destiny. The mission was almost unsuccessful. Just as man had the technology to transport themselves to Jupiter, man's technology, the HAL-9000 got so advanced that it turned against man which could have been the start of a more advanced evolution that could have overpowered man (an idea that Stanley Kubrick was also going to work on in the movie 'A.I. Artificial Intelligence' but sadly didn't live to do it). However the mission was successful. Astronaut David Bowman defeated the HAL-9000 and went as the representative for the entire history of humanity (without knowing it) and became a supernatural being.Sounds crazy? Of coarse this movie is all fiction but lets face it. There has to be a good explanation for why man is so intelligent. All other creatures on this planet just live by their natural instincts. Do you really think that nature made man what it is today? Why would nature give man the capabilities to destroy nature? The reason for man's intelligence can't be natural, it has to be supernatural.This movie has blown many minds away, not only by the plot but also by the whole style of the way that this movie was made. It has such a bizarre style of cinematography that it will send your mind light-years away even if you're not under the influence of 'Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds'.I'll give this movie **** out of four stars.Followed by '2010'. It was OK.</fullReview>

However, I know Kubrick did speed up the film but I don't think it worked. I know some will disagree with me but I'm cinema snob, too but I think it will take me a bit awhile before I can hail this film as *bleep* great film, you know what I mean?*Minor Spoilers* Someone told me that this film has 3 way, which is humans vs computer vs aliens but I didn't recognize it but I'll check it, if my time let me to.But I think special effects were pretty impressive for the time.

		<fullReview>The fact that many reviewers didn't like (or outright hated) 2001 doesn't surprise me. This is not a film for people with just enough attention span to get past the next commercial. 2001 is not an action film, nor is it really a science fiction film. It is a philosophical work that is set in 1968's future. Kubrick and Clark were taking on the "big 3" questions in life (who are we?, where did we come from?, where are we going?), and do it to perfection. True, there are not explostions and deaths every 5 or 10 minutes, and no CG monsters, but the film is not eyecandy, it is supposed to make the viewer ponder our own metaphysics. Consider the concept that man was not man, but an animal until a race of gods evolved him with the gift of reason. Four million years pass and we are ready to take the next step, to join them.That is what this film is. If you like 2010, a sub-par film, stick to Bad Boyz II or T3, lots more flames and explosions!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat overrated - visually stunning and profound, but can be excruciatingly boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*******some spoilers*******2001 is a movie which I have watched several times in my life, and each time I try harder to 'get' it. When I first saw it I was too young to understand the themes, and was bored to tears, mainly because I was comparing it to Star Wars. Viewing it as an adult has changed my opinion - it's a visually stunning movie, with very profound themes and a prophetic grasp of space technology. However, it is by no means the best sci-fi film ever, or Stanley Kubricks best film, and in truth has not aged particularly well. But enough about that just now. Whats good about the film?It boasts some of the most brilliantly composed shots I've ever seen, right from the beginning with the slow reveal of the Moon, the Earth and the Sun to the iconic strains of Strauss' Also Sprach Zarathustra. The zero gravity settings and the various methods used to combat the effects of zero-g enabled Kubrick to play lots of cool tricks with the camera with people walking upside down or seeming to walk on the ceiling. Then of course there's the famous cut from the ape throwing the bone in the air to the satellite floating in space - it's effect is somewhat lessened due to the fact that everyone knows about it now, but back in 1968 it must have been a startlingly original edit.The choice of music in the film is superb - probably the best collection of sourced classical music that exists. The music so perfectly fits each scene that you would think that each piece had been written especially for the film, rather than selected from a record collection. In particular, aside from the above mentioned Also Sprach Zarathustra, there's Khachaturyan's Gayne Ballet Suite, which perfectly conveys the crushing loneliness of space travel (and was of course lifted by James Horner for use in the Aliens soundtrack), and Ligeti's Requien for Soprano, which after the Ark of the Covenant theme in Raiders of the Lost Ark is probably the creepiest piece of music I have ever heard in a film. I could probably do without the Blue Danube, but that's just my personal opinion of that piece, and it does lend the shots of satellites circling the Earth an almost balletic quality.Arthur C Clarke's story is incredibly prophetic in it's grasp of developments in space technology, even if he was a bit too optimistic in the timescale within which he thought it could all be developed. Every ship looks like it could exist, and of course the film showed a lunar base a year before the first Apollo landing. This is all very much science heavy science fiction, rather than being a fantasy set in space a la Star Wars - the ships make no sound in the vacuum, unlike almost every other celluloid space ship. Clarke also of course predicts the development of Artificial Intelligence in HAL, and there are numerous other little touches of technological foresight - note what look like thin plasma screen TV's that the Astronauts watch the BBC broadcast on.The themes of the story are incredibly profound, dealing with the evolution of man, and can be debated endlessly. For instance, am I the only person who noticed the symmetry of the monolith giving the ape intelligence, which it then uses to commit murder, and the development of self awareness in HAL (presumably due again to the monolith), who then goes on to murder the crew of the Discovery?In addition, all the scenes with the apes are great - how would have thought to fill the first fifteen minutes of a sci-fi film with a short story about the family life of a group of early hominids? Also, Bowman shutting down HAL feels incredibly tragic, as the computer reverts to its 'childhood'. Of course, the infinitely weird ending can be puzzled over till the cows come home, but is again beautifully shot.Writing all this makes me think I've been unfair to 2001, but being objective about it, I must say that the film shows its age. No doubt the special effects were stunning in 1968, and in truth still look great today, but the endless shots of spacecraft floating at a snails pace through space just take forever, and become mind numbingly boring after only a few minutes. I am a University graduate and consider myself reasonably intelligent, and am quite prepared to commit my attention to films which don't feature endless action scenes, but it's very hard to appreciate the themes in 2001 when for long stretches of the film absolutely nothing seems to be happening. It's not artistic, it's just boring. And to be honest, the sequence when Bowman goes through the Stargate just smacks of the psychedelic hippiedom of the times the film was shot in, and again seems to take forever.Having said all this however, it must be acknowledged that 2001 is a groundbreaking film without which modern sci-fi films in all probability wouldn't exist, and probably deserves to be seen just for that reason alone.Rating - 7/10</fullReview>

Sparce on dialogue and long on visuals, with an interesting juxtaposition of classical music and futuristic sets, it has all the makings of a great movie.However, after just seeing it yet again, I really only enjoyed the middle portion, in and around the USS Discovery.The "dawn of man sequence" was OK, and yeah, the cut to the spaceship was like groovy, man, but extended docking and spaceship movements seemed drawn out for their own sake. I liked the stewardess stuff, though.The "Jupiter and Beyond" portion went over my head, I guess.2 of 5 stars for the parts I liked, and an extra star for the visuals makes it a 3 of 5.Open the pod bay door, HAL.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yesterday I saw this one on DVD. I had seen it once before in a movie theatre, maybe 15 or 20 years ago, and I remember being underwhelmed, even though I was aware at the time that in its day it must have been the definitive SF movie.However, what I saw on DVD this time around actually did impress the hell out of me. In the opening scenes: yes, this is how primitive man might have looked like. No chimps (though I think I spotted two somewhere), no people in monkey suits, but an actual unknown species of primate. Then, cut to the 21st century: this part, largely exposition, is rather dull and slow, and looks like it was put there mainly for the cinematographers to show off. Zero-gravity toilets, oh my, how clever, yeah right.The movie really comes into its strength, though, during the Jupiter mission part. The horror we're confronted with is almost purely psychological. The action here is reported in such a cool and understated fashion that it grips you much harder than it has a right to. If I look at what this film accomplishes here, and compare it to present day flicks with their hugely overdone action sequences, spectacular effects, fight scenes, aggressive music, in other words: cheap thrills - I have to conclude that, yes, this movie deserves its reputation.I'm a little more doubtful about the enigmatic 'beyond Jupiter' stuff: the swirling colours continue swirling for entirely too long, and the final scenes do little to make up for that. And I am not convinced about the legitimacy of expecting your audience to suddenly understand that esoteric Starchild stuff after taking them by the hand, neatly explaining everything to them as you go for the entire first two hours of the film.And then signing off with that Johann Strauss' waltz music. Fitting at that point, true, but I wish Kubrick's choice here could have been a bit less inane. Ravel has written some nice waltzes, too...This one is 35 years old. Still, it remains one of the most intelligent SF movies in existence. That, despite its flaws, makes it a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bona fide masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing I really like about Stanley Kubrick films is how different they are from conventional films, thematically, stylistically, how they stand apart from every other film in the genre, if some Kubrick films can even be said to belong to a genre. The same is true with 2001: A Space Odyssey. I've seen it four times now and it gets better each time. Like all great works of art, it sometimes takes repeated viewings to fully comprehend its depth. The story- and it's true that there's not a complete story here- is the story of man through the ages. It begins with a twenty-minute sequence on prehistoric man that will leave some people scratching their heads, before it segues into man in the age of space travel. To watch certain scenes over and over is really to appreciate their simple beauty. The astronaut exec (played by William Sylvester) presiding over a board conference, having a private chat with some people allied to the business, on board the spaceship as commander directing his men. And I never fail to be charmed by the "zero-gravity" images or the videophone conversation between the commander and his six-year old daughter. The only nod to any sort of movie convention begins aboard a spaceship heading for Jupiter comprised of a five-man crew and HAL 9000, the talking computer, who either is or isn't as human or more perfectly human than the men flying the mission. The real drama concerns HAL and whether or not his superior intelligence presents a danger to the mission. Beyond that, Kubrick shows us what space travel is really like: boredom, a lot of empty hours, doing maintenance checks and playing chess with HAL. The final segment, Jupiter and Beyond, is so spectacular for its visual effects, the splicing of the galaxy as the ship passes through it in a spectrum of colors, the terrain of Jupiter itself, an endless ruin of crevices and barren surfaces. I think people who downplay the effects in the movie or don't like them are just looking to see something blow up, maybe have a head-on crash with another spaceship, something a la Star Trek. The special effects in 2001 are as real and as relevant as they were in 1968. Another point worth mentioning is Kubrick's use of classical recordings to frame the action (even though he had commissioned a film "score" from composer Alex North). The music, like the best film music, actually becomes part of the viewing experience (as in Psycho, for instance). It emphasizes the action, rather than accommodating it, sweeps you up at certain points and provides a counterpoint in others. I don't know how much better or worse North's score would have been, but the classical music, which Kubrick originally put in just as a placeholder while editing the film, makes you aware of it, even though I've heard something like "Blue Danube" a thousand times, including Bugs Bunny cartoons.  2001 is a dazzling experience from start to finish. And if you don't exactly "get it", see it again and again. It wears well. 4 **** out of 4</fullReview>

But the story line of 2001 is told through visual effects and scores by classical composers.This film also contains some of the greatest moments in cinematic history. when the ape-man learns to use the bone as a tool, and when ape-man tosses the bone into the air and when it comes tumbling down it turns into a space station. But there are other scenes within the film that are absolutely amazing, too. The characters in the film lack complexity except for HAL. The computer is the only character that you can actually develop feelings for. All of the other characters are one dimentional, which they are supposed to be.It took Kubric 5 years to make this movie and you can tell. It's a masterpiece.</fullReview>

Though it did not completely follow the story line of the book, which I felt would have been a better course for the movie to take, it allowed into the viewer's mind a spectrum of colors and makings that one could not possibly view today in any recently made movie. This film is made for someone who is willing to sit for over two hours in order to view moving art, and at the same time receive a free dose of adrenaline with the great speeches of the mutinous computer HAL. I am not particularly a Kubrick fan, but this allowed me to take a double look at his work. The fact that so many things in the story are today possible only proceed to make it that much eerier. Where Arthur C. Clarke failed to put a more than abstract view on the plot, Kubrick filled in with a universe that will mystify the mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this movie is full of stunning visuals, but lacks much in the way of a plot line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this movie categorized as an American science fiction movie yet I cannot find anything American in its story line. There isn't any simulated sex, gunplay, or cursing in this movie. In fact there is little dialog for its three hours (even if you count the grunting of the prehistoric men, women, and children). This film deserves to be relegated to the world of art house showings since it is as foreign a film as any I have ever seen. It would make no real difference if it was originally made using the French language and subtitled in English since the majority of human expression in this movie comes from the sounds of human breathing.Don't let the first three minutes of terribly disjointed music set to a completely black screen scare you out of the theater. Stick around to sit thru the next twenty minutes while prehistoric man learns to use a piece of animal bone as a club. Once past this prehistoric buildup the outer space part of the movie begins. At least in Armageddon when they were showing the prehistoric buildup to the present they used a narrator to explain the situation to us. In this movie you are left to wonder if you walked into the right theater; since you seem to be watching a National Geographic film on how prehistoric man learned to eat raw meat rather than a movie about outer space.The most memorable scenes from this movie that stick in my mind are the scenes of space flight. Especially the very long shots where we get to watch everything in motion to include the spacecraft, planets, and our own point of view. In many of the scenes we are looking not at the spaceship itself but at the stunning backgrounds.Overall this movie is full of stunning visuals, but lacks much in the way of a plot</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The great monolith turns up at some of the world changing events like the primeval monkees discover using weapons to kill and are on their way to becoming human. A grand event on the evolution time scale.The monolith then turns up on the moon possibly millions of years later when man has advanced enough for space travel. This also emplies the infinite patience of a greater spirit. The sun hits the monolith and shoots a radio beam to Jupiter. They go to Jupiter and encounter some things beyond the comprehension of mere man. More monoliths, time bending, the embryonic baby floating in space. It all suggests higher power and higher intelligence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was 12 when I first saw this masterpiece on German television. There somehow was the weird feeling how one can use the famous blue danube waltz to comment an extended spaceship docking sequence.It is obvious that for younger audiences this film is no stuff;especially not for lovers of the bruckheimerian bumm- bumm flics.But for those, who want to take a tour to the darker realms of intelligence ,this stunning picture is highly recommended. The story isn`t just that crucial as it was often mentioned out. It describes a magnificient circular motion from the "Dawn of Man" to the glorious perfection of mankind, which is also devine. In the center, there we have a struggle for live beetween an astronaut(i.e.Mankind)and the computer HAL(i.e.the representation of all technical devices we`ve developed in history).HAL is ,notwithstanding a computer,the only real character in the film; that focuses something of the bitterweetness of maestro Kubrick`s perspective of the human race.I think it means that we as beings just have not reach all the fulfilment of our opportunities.The story with us is not over yet.Classical music lovers will surely praise the use of modern avantgarde scores to push the dramatical impact and to undermine some things on the screen.One of the most metaphysical culminations of cinema history we have at the end, when the astronaut has an encounter with the unknown, supernatural power; it conducts our "hero" to the frontiers of consciousness. 10 stars of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without a doubt, this is a cinema 'milestone'. It is itself a star pointing obelisk, which separates the cold war era of evil alien or monsters invading earth, via Buck Roger's type space craft, to the vivid multi-dimensional modern space science fictions today. 2001, is, at least in my humble opinion, the calling card of Kubrick's technique. It is not the story, but the Kubrick technique, that is perfected here. Extreme vistas, enhanced with color filters, the use of solid colors, bleakness, sharp light, sharp shadow, special effects, creating a sense of movement in stillness, by moving the camera, and not the subject, and so, much more. '2001' is an expression of cinema art, as much as, or more than entertainment.2001 is the mold for science fiction special effects, and themes that are reflected, years later in such science fiction, action drama such as "Star Wars", "Alien" or "Close Encounters of the Third Kind", and more subtly in many, other more 'down to earth' cinema classics.Stanley Kubrick is to the visual, as Alfred Hitchcock is to tension.However, be aware of one thing, at least in my opinion. Kubrick sold himself short. '2001' was released in 1968, and at that time, such an abstract work was a big risk. This was the time of the 'Age of Aquarius'. The fad at the time was mysticism. People were seeking answers through the peace and love movement, meditation, eastern religions and mind expansion. Kubrick shortcut the ending of this Arthur C Clark tale so much, that it, itself became one of the world's great mysteries. The psychedelic 'trip' through the atmosphere of Jupiter may have ensured that movie goers of the time would be sure to relive the experience over and over, (hence good box office revenues) and dwell and interpret something that Clark expressed so clearly and so soberly in his novel. If you've not seen '2001', then by all means do, more than once and pay special attention to those audio-visual techniques which will rivet you to your screen.But, certainly, and by all means, find a copy of Arthur C Clarks '2001' and read it, and you will 'clearly' see for yourself that his vision of the future was real, tangible and hopeful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A transcendent journey through space and time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With carte blanche (essentially) from a then struggling MGM, Kubrick (in collaboration with renowned sci-fi author Arthur C. Clarke) had artistic license to develop "2001" as he saw fit. What he created was his magnum opus, a visually stunning and visionary depiction of space and the future. The film is a transcendent journey through space and time that is open to numerous interpretations. I interpreted the film as a cautionary cosmic satire about the influence and imperfection of technology in our lives as well as an explorational philosophical vehicle forcing the viewer to delve into his/her creative consciousness and imagine the greater future potential of mankind. The film's continuing success can be attributed to the visual wonder and awe that is inspired by the film, its believability even today (due in no small part to the extensive research of the production crew and the participation of consultants ranging from NASA to IBM), as well as its evolving interpretations through the decades. In particular, even as the year 2001 has come and gone, the film raises profound questions about the progress and destiny of mankind and technology, issues that have timeless relevance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hilton</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERS:The hotel sequence at the end of the film baffles a lot of people. In a way, it's SUPPOSED to, but here are two pointers:1. There's a Hilton Hotel on the orbiting space station, although it's possible to miss it if you've only seen the movie on TV.2. The hotel room is Kubrick's tipping of the hat to a French film called Last Year at Marienbad, which anyone who's interested in 2001 should definitely see. Last Year at Marienbad is the aesthetic touchstone for all of Kubrick's films beginning with 2001. See also Brian Aldiss's comments in Kubrick: A Life in Pictures, for the most articulate explanation ever given on the "Kubrickian" effect. If you're still in the dark after following these steps, well, you're on your own.HAL 9000 is the most compelling character ever put on film. To my way of seeing, HAL is Kubrick. A major chunk of the movie is literally photographed through HAL's Godlike lens -- and since the other bits are prologue and epilogue in relation, we're left with intriguing questions about the film's "real" perspective, ones that throw us right back on ourselves in the most intimate and, if you're game, metaphysically satisfying ways. The official term for this is "folded narrative," but using it in the context of this film is a bit like calling a Porsche a "car." Ford makes cars. Porsche makes Porsches. Kubrick didn't make films. He made Kubricks. This was his masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whether or not you understood the point of the movie, or had to endure its deliberate tortoise pace, or maybe you're just not a fan ofthe music of Tchaikovsky, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY is an undeniably interesting motion picture. Now, I can't really tell at the moment if director Stanley Kubrick made 2001 as accurately depicted as theArthur C. Clarke book of the same name. But once you get a taste of the exquisite camera work and visuals (gotta love those evolving apes from the Dawn of man, the giant satellite in Space, and that twisted ending), logic goes right out the window. One great feature was HAL, the talking computer with shady intentions towards his astronaut handlers Frank and Dave.</fullReview>

This movie does not deserve it.(Some spoilers possible, depending on what do you understand as 'a spoiler') 2001: A Space Odyssey is an special and unique movie. Unlike almost all others, this one tends to use as little words as possible, the story is told mostly by the pictures and the music - and so, this may be the ONLY complete movie in history, telling EVERYTHING by images, not by words. The book gave a strong explanation of everything: the film simply presents you the pictures (I love one of it: an ape throws a bone in the air, and it, slowly floating down, suddenly turns into a spaceship floating in space - 4 millions of years of evolution and history of mankind, all turn into ONE SINGLE CUT!!!! Incredible.), and leaves all explanation up to you.Definitely 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems rather fashionable these days for film critics to dismiss this film as "pretentious" and "boring" (is it just me, or do critics often appear to represent a homogenous group-mind?) Certainly, it isn't a film that would be considered viable by any production company today, since it has camera shots lasting more than a fraction a second each and a lack of good guys and bad guys running around calling each other... well, let's say casting aspersions as to their relationships with the maternal side of their families.It never was meant to be a film for resolutely earth-bound dullards with MTV-addled attention spans. 2001: A Space Odyssey was made in a time where experimentation was still possible in the main stream of film making. No, I don't quite understand why Dave Bowman ends up as a giant foetus floating in space either, but I am given the opportunity to interpret this and other images, rather than have everything explained to me by some angry, shouting character.The humans in this film are mere ciphers. Bowman and Poole remind me of some of the most unreflective and basic humans I have ever worked with (which is saying something, as I work in I.T!) But Kubrick never was much interested in the minutiae of human interaction, (in his films, at least), no, for him it was the bigger picture.What is suggested here - and remember, it is a story - is that an advanced alien race has assisted our development as a species... initially by teaching us how to bash each other's brains in. This aggression - negative though it may seem - appears to be the quality that leads to our dominance of the planet. It's interesting that we are introduced to Bowman, onboard the Discovery, jogging around the space ship practicing his boxing moves - Man, millions of years later, still throwing punches (note also, the karate bout shown on a TV during the Moon visit by Floyd).It might be of interest too, to reflect upon that philosopher of nastiness Frederick Nietzche, who wrote something to the effect that Man is not the end product of life on Earth, but merely a conduit to the "Superman" (Also Sprach Zarathustra is the name of Fun-time Freddie's most famous tract, as well as the title of the film's opening - and closing - music, by Strauss. Coincidence?)The "Beyond the Infinite" sequence, with our Dave seemingly careering headlong into the Pearl and Dean cinema advert (non-UK residents may be forgiven for not knowing what the Hell I'm talking about!) is simply masterful. Why aren't films this ambitious anymore?Cherish this motion picture, for you will never see its like again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001 is a thought provoking piece of film history, that for me is a mini time capsule containing all the hope and optimism of the late 60's Apollo generation. Kubrick and Clarke honestly believed that we would be doing such wonderful things by 2001, and why not? We were landing men on the moon, space stations were in the works, off-world goals were in scientists minds - what happened?After seeing this film for the 100th time (or so), it dawned on me how purely bittersweet this film has become. Maybe after another 100 viewings I'll have a more optimistic opinion, but for now it represents mankind's failure to evolve and a failure to openly, unselfishly embrace the wonders of the universe, including mankind itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>~Possible Plot Spoilers for the 3 People Who Haven't See or Heard Of this Movie~Apemen discover tools and weapons...Dr. Heywood R. Floyd investigates the monolith on the moon...Astronaut 'Dave' Bowman, on a mission to Jupiter, is foiled by super-computer HAL, then goes on a trip that only serious drugs could match. What does it all mean?One: an engrossing movie. Two: you WILL think about this universe we live in and your place in it, try as you might to veg out in space (which works too).Director Stanley Kubrick's greatest film lays out a magical world for us, even though high-tech and magical are often mutually exclusive terms in film. We have all seen the "future" in various incarnations in sci-fi movies. This one presents a world which is (for me) tactile, astonishing and provokingly in-your-face entertainment.I thoroughly enjoyed the leisurely pace as we discovered and explored 2001. Strauss waltzes booming gloriously as spacecraft ever-so-slowly connected with space stations only allowed me time to ponder how poetic and lyrical space and space travel is. I love the more-silent-than-death moments when the Frank and Dave go out into the space abyss on their repair missions.Despite Keir Dullea's chin dimples, HAL is undoubtedly the star of the movie. Maybe I revere film conventions after all: an intriguing character strays, and must be outwitted. HAL's "death" scene must rank with the classics of all time. Extremely moving. Perfect entertainment. (Apropos to nothing: for those who haven't sought out the "2001" trivia, the letters in HAL are one move down from the letters in IBM.)I have formed my own opinions of what this movie means. Something about how insignificant we are in the scheme of things. Or is it that our lives are of staggering importance? You decide.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While creationists and evolutionists believe that life stems from god and evolution respectively, so-called "interventionists" believe that human life came about thanks to a helping hand from aliens.Very simply, this film is about interventionism.Beautifully photographed - the scenes showing the blandness and sterility of space travel are portrayed with great elegance.HAL, of course, is everyone's favourite, although quite obviously not as intelligent as we're led to believe. Given the chance to kill off a couple of astronauts on board a giant spaceship, I'm sure even my humble Pentium 166 could have done a better job!Perhaps needless to say, it's all rather pointless. If human life really did come about due to alien intervention, then we're only left wondering how those aliens in turn came about. Ultimately, everything comes back either to "god" or evolution/darwinism.That said, 2001 is still up there with the greats and remains one of my favourite movies.The only puzzling thing is how a director capable of making an epic as stunning as this could then go on to blunder so tragically over the next three decades.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great, but difficult film - vintage Kubrick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Outrageously good cinematography, special effects and soundtrack, and a very interesting glimpse into what we once thought the world might be like in the near future - even if the 2001 date was a bit optimistic. As is standard for a Kubrick film, it is designed to play with your mind and leave you feeling both disturbed and puzzled, to give you something to think about as you leave the theatre. It achieves this effortlessly, and the slow pacing of the film only adds to this by building the psychological tension. HAL, the psychopathic artificial intelligence that is the true star of the film, is magnificent, and the scene where HAL's intelligence is gradually shut down is one of the darkest in cinema history.2001: A Space Odyssey has had enormous influence on cinema since - especially science fiction. I don't think it's overstepping the mark to say that Star Wars, Alien or Terminator could never have happened as they did without it. It set the benchmark for cinematography, music, effects, physical realism and story in science fiction, and although it has been surpassed since in some of these areas, probably no other science fiction film has done all of these so well all at once.My only real gripe about the film is that it becomes extremely difficult to follow even the basics of the plot, let alone all the complex subtexts, in the final third of the film. The book of the same name gives some insight into what is going on, but it is not quite the same story, and in any case I don't think it should not be necessary to read the book to understand the film. Also, the long psychedelic animation scene is only fully appreciated under the influence of the right kind of visionary substances, or so I have been told by movie-loving psychonauts.A true classic, and massively influential. Not everyone will like it, but mostly this is down to people not liking their psychological knobs being twisted, which 2001: A Space Odyssey does very well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film, is utterly and completely incredible. People who say otherwise should never have thought of watching it in the first place. It's not a film for everyone. Due to the quite complicated plot (made more understandable by reading the book), and long sequences of no sound and only music. Not that I am complaining about these things.People ask, "Why no sound in the space scenes?" Answer: "Why would there be?", if people just had the smallest knowledge of space, this film would become a lot more accessible to them. Enriching their lives and minds.The SFX blew me away, this film was made in 1968. You wouldn't think that to watch it. Everything looks real. The way in which some of the scenes must have been shot is unreal. *SPOILER* (kinda) When we see Dave running round and round in the spacecraft, seeming to defy to gravity. *END SPOILER*Being only a teenager, when I heard this film had a classical soundtrack, I was almost put off. I have never been so wrong in my life. The music only adds to the enjoyment of the film. I have also heard people say: "There's not enough dialogue or action." This film is not about dialogue or action, although *SPOILER* When HAL kills Frank, it got my heart racing more than anything I have seen in film *END SPOILER*So, this film does not age, and never will. It is the most realistic look at life in space there has ever been, and probably ever will be. And anyone making a sci-fi film should always be thinking: "How can I make this more like 2001?" </fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001 broke ground in the area of science fiction in film. All further films and televion (Trekies) was based on this film. Kubrick created some brilliant special effects to show his ideas. He did this a year before anyone would land on the moon. This is astounding. One may consider this in terms of the popular science fiction to follow 2001. Star Wars would not be released for nine years. 2001 set precedents and had very little space experience on which to base them. To date, there may not be a film which is more physically accurate. I have hear complaints about the lenght of 2001 and the lack of action and dialogue. Factually, a trip to Jupiter or Saturn would be pretty boring. If in watching 2001, a viewer has the intellectual capability (either by reading the book, seeing the movie before, or incredible insight) to understand the subtleties, the movie will be one of the best ever seen.

		<fullReview>Before I annoy all the Kubrickites out there, I had better say that I did enjoy this film. I thought the concepts behind the film were great, and very involving. And I do own the film, and watch it every six months or so.BUT, it is too slow-paced. I'm sorry, but it is. And I believe that it is so slow-paced because it was made in an era which welcomed that sort of thing. Acid, dope etc.Take for example the scene where the stewardess walks around the hub to the entrance she requires..... back in Stanley's time, the cinematography must have stood out as something truly amazing. Today, we look at that scene as a 1.30 minute extravagance. Likewise with many other scenes in this film. Most importantly, I feel that the final approach to Jupiter is nothing more than a spaced out trip, too long and overdone.As I said at the outset, I still regard this film as a great film. It makes us think about the space outside Earth, and what may lie beyond there - is it just ourselves ?BUT - I feel that it is dated and showy, and could have achieved it's aims in half the time. Sorry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sentenel, an observer - or an affector? From the Dawn of Man to the twilight of a machine, this film offers many questions and many answers. Unfortunately for the literal or the simple, they aren't complimentary.Kubrick and Clarke spent many moons evolving a postwar story by a young visionary (Clarke) and crafting it into a timely (the landing on the Moon in real life) and timeless epic about us, it and them.Visually and aurally stunning, with effects from 1960's psychedelia to some of the best outer (and inner) space photography to this day, this film - even if you don't comprehend it - is still a standard of the potential of cinema to take us where we only dream.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best films are those you can watch several times and get something different out of each experience. One day you might be keen on exploring a film's grand ideas. Another day you might just want a good story, some interesting characters or spectacular action.2001: A Space Odyssey is such a film, although many people find its seriousness and complexity to be intimidating. After all, it does pack into 139 minutes all of human development from pre-history through to the discovery of Greater Meaning, floating through space out somewhere near Jupiter. Who wouldn't find such a film intimidating?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grandiose science fiction art-cinema masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stately, dignified and beguiling, Stanley Kubrick's 1968 cinema milestone is a film with no equal. From the monumental opening sequence, through the "Dawn Of Man", the stunning 70mm vistas of the Moon, the waltzing spaceships and the mysterious mission to Jupiter, this film says so, so much with seemingly so little. Everyone who worked on this film in the mid-Sixties excelled themselves. Kubrick has left behind an extraordinary legacy of films, and this one is my favourite, but there is not a single film of his that I do find interesting. This one should last beyond the Infinite...G.C Morrice</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can we open doors and see through our ignorance?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when I first saw this film back in 1968. The background setting was this: We were standing in line and all claiming how wewere going to see strings holding up all the space craft. We expected the usual stupid plot of some Ming the Merciless going to pounce on some damsel and hold her ransome for some Flash Gordon to come to the rescue.Weren't we surprised...It was anything but that.At the anxious age of 19 I remember its slow deliberate pace both attracting me and irritating me a little, reminding me how I always got bored when someone was working on a machine while I couldn't figure out their interest...or, to be more accurate, why I could not grasp what was going on...I could sense the film reminding me of my own impatience and refusal to stop, take my time, and find the beautiful, majestic pace that people that did relate to machines seemed to possess and to meander their minds into discussions concerning their care and creations.The slight move, on my part, toward boredom was really a message from myself to myself that the irritation I felt was not the film was boring, but that I was boring and knew that I had to get out of trying to get from point A to point B at the quickest rate possible with anything or anyone. The film married with my own realization that I was going to have to break out of my childish mind, trying to get what I wanted while disregarding everything and everyone else and to start to build bridges with all the things I was bored with, hated, or were indifferent to.The universe seemed to open up. Kubrick put small layers up slowly until they built into an avalanche and came crashing down. As we move through life we disregard or put things aside or push them out of our way to get to where we are going. Those things come back to haunt us. All of his films moved in this manner and irritated some to a great degree. Mention Kubrick's name and you'll get an immediate respponse, pro or con. We don't like being reminded that those avalanches come down and turn us into puppets, practically insignificant to events that start to steam roll after. Sept. 11 ring a bell?Thw weakness of our own society shows here also. Somone took their time and was extrememly patient, perhaps up to 7 years in planning the attack on New York and they were competeing with a society stuck in its own road rage, in such a rush it cannot break out. For now, we seem safe. No back up punch was as carefully planned. What happens if someone makes a ten or twenty year patient assemblageof a second attack, but decides to use about 7 nukes neatly placed in about 7 cities and assembles everything one little bolt at a time? While we are prepared for a short fight we do not seem to be prepared for any patient, slow methodology that we need to grasp to change what appears to be an easy issue for some careful planner 20 years from now.Kubrick irritates us because he reminds us of this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive and thought provoking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am impressed that this movie was made in 1968. There were parts of it in the beginning with the ape-like creatures that struck me as being somewhat cheezy however. Chimpanzees and apes use tools on a regular basis for all sorts of things, and I don't suspect that there was some point in time ages ago where some creature thought it would be really neat to start using tools.The lack of dialogue was neat artistically, though I suspect it irked many a fan. I think this film is best viewed in a contemplative state of mind as a piece of art. Some people cannot conjure a state of awe within themselves to save their lives...actually, lots of people.I enjoyed the lack of explanation. It is good to explore what the film meant to you personally. I dont think it was meant to mean any literal thing really. I just think the imagery and sound is supposed to provoke within us a non-verbal appreciation for where mankind has been and where it may yet go, and how wondrous and mysterious this process is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very 'different' movie. I've never seen anything like it before and doubt I ever will again.I'll say this categorically - it is *not* the best movie ever made, not even close. It's not even as good as A Clockwork Orange which is magnificent.But it is superbly crafted, deep, and ultimately so thought-provoking that it deserves a place in the hall of fame for its sheer visionary content.Yes, the plot's a little fragmented, and none of the characters are particularly personable, but the truth is the story isn't about them.It's a tale of existence, of viewing and perceiving the universe and understanding that 99.999999% of everything is way beyond our own comprehension.As for the Planet of the Apes comparison another reviewer made, well Planet of the Apes clearly concluded - one of the greatest endings cinema has ever bared witness to. Possibly the out and out best. But the 2 movies are *very* different to one another.Anyway, for something which takes movie-making in a whole new direction check this out. It's certainly an experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I bought this DVD a year ago and I've just watched it. How I wish I had seen it in the movie theatre but for some reason I didn't. Everything I've heard about this movie is true, as I have never previously watched it anywhere. It is slow. It is thought-provoking. It does have awesome effects and seeing those, you can't help feeling that you're being a bit cheated 34 years on, when you see quite poor computer-generated effects in films such as 'Minority Report' which I otherwise enjoyed.'2001' is bound to be slow at home, but in the cinema I would just have been able to savour its momentous impact. I am a great believer in films being seen at the cinema and feel that a return to the days when movies were regularly re-issued (always in double-bills as well) would go a long way in rejuvenating the art. The guy who invented moving pictures didn't have someone's sitting-room in mind. A large auditorium is the only venue whereby a film such as this can fully be appreciated. As an artform this film must have few equals. Personally, give me 'Aliens' any day as a space epic, but I was definitely not disappointed. And, finally, how can this attract a 'U' certificate?! It scared the pants off me! Perhaps those censorship guys can't censor pure imagination. Or maybe they haven't got any.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the reason why alot of people didn't "get" this film is because they didn't know the full story behind it. I would be the first to admit that had I not read the book before watching the movie I would've yelled out "WTF!" as well. But I did read the story beforehand and I'm glad I did. Like a few other comments here there were quite a bit more information to the story than what was presented visually in the film so for me, personally, the apes scene at the beginning and the star child scene at the end I knew what's going on.Now I am not going to pretend I'm brainy and say I knew what Kubrick was trying to do with this film nor am I going to try to figure it out. The purpose of watching a movie is to enjoy it, be it on a pure visual/audio level or on a more intellectual level. Whatever it is, as long as you enjoyed it then the price of admission was all worth it. All I'm saying is if you find out what the story is (even if just skimming through Cole's Notes or some other "cheat sheets") then I think you'll enjoy the movie more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some people argue that 2001: A space odyssey, lacks some sharp toothed drooling aliens and a couple of big explosions. It might be because they are looking for a SiFi movie in the George Lucas definition. And believe me, if you liked the idiotic Episode I, you are going to hate this Kubrick masterpiece. 2001: A Space Odyssey is not really a SiFi movie, it's a philosophical statement that happens to be set in the future. It is much deeper than a Space Opera like the Star Wars saga, and lets you walk out of the theater (or home theater) with more questions than answers.Yes, it is a very, very, very, very slow paced movie, with long shots of slow moving spaceships to the tune of slow clasical music and the first line of dialogue comes some 25 minutes into the film. So?. It is not a trill ride and the first thing that you have to do to enjoy it is take your time to see it. And don't worry; nobody understands the ending, you are not supposed to.So, if you like Science Fiction Films, see where it all began, Think that this movie is 32 years old, I dare you to find any other 1968 movie that is still as new and fresh as this one. The SFX are very good and the set designs and costumes are still been ripped off in movies like "Mission to Mars" or "Red Planet" . But be advised, you will need to see it a second time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a unique experience in film history. Visually it's almost unparalleled even after more than a generation where many of the most ambitious people working in film have done science fiction. This aspect of the film really has to be seen on the big screen, in 70mm. Every inch of the screen is packed with almost unbelievable amounts of detail and the illusions are flawless. Kubrick was one of the masters of visual composition.It's arguable that 2001 makes the most spectacular use of music in cinema. The images backed by Strauss, Ligeti, and Richard Strauss leave an unforgettable impression on literally anyone who sees those sequences. The acting and sets are convincing. It looks odd now in 2002 when most movies are celebrity vehicles, but the nondescript actors in this film ring true as apes, bureaucrats, and astronauts. The space station, Discovery, African Savannah (which for some reason looks much better projected than it does on the DVD), and even Beyond the Infinite look right. 2001 is craftmanship of the highest level.The plot is a miraculous mix of documentary style recording and epic story telling. At the most basic level, 2001 is science fiction about the evolution of life on earth. The monolith and life on earth meet several times in the film, heralding a massive change in how life is lived. Simultaneously, Kubrick presents Life on Earth as a voyager in the pattern of Odysseus. The tool using ape, Floyd, Bowman and the star child are representative of the human species moving through history and overcoming obstacles loosely reminiscent of the episodes of the Odyssey. Kubrick uses 2001 to give a history of human life - from apes gnawing raw meat, to sucking liquid veggies, to eating TV dinners and finally on to fine dining. And one could go on listing the themes - man vs. machine, mind vs. body, the nature of identity, and Kubrick's awfully bleak satire on modern life. I don't think any other film has ever tried to touch 2001 in its audacious attempt to absorb life and history into one plot.It's a film that demands visual literacy in a way few others do. How many times do you see people (apes, then humans and HAL) sleeping, eating, arguing, killing, using tools reacting to a monolith or being killed? Where do the eclipses occur and what changes? Why does almost everyone look exactly the same? What does it mean that all the technology looks like pieces of HAL and the Discovery? Where does the orange/red color appear? Why does everyone spend time talking to or looking at TV screens? 2001 is a hall of mirrors once you see the patterns.2001 invites people to ask questions about its haunting images and explore their meanings. It's a very demanding film. It's dismaying to read all the posts here from people who were indignant that a movie expected them to figure out what it's up to. That said, the 2001 experience is so unique that it stands pretty far from what a lot of us have come to think of as film. There are no sympathetic characters by design, the pacing is almost that of a stroll through a museum, and it ends on a note of utter abstraction (how else to represent on the screen what Bowman has become?). In an age dominated by Spielburg's obvious and noisy sentimentality, Kubrick's 2001 can seem a lot like Antonioni on downers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In defense of my favorite film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few films in cinematic history have been as frequently dissected and analyzed as this Stanley Kubrick masterwork, so there is little one can say about the film hasn't already been said. "2001" will reward it's patient, open-minded viewers with a truly mind-blowing philosophical experience filled with breathtaking visuals and unforgettable moments. "2001" will bore those who are unprepared for it as well as those who are unwilling to approach it with a sense of wonder and imagination. The film has already received an enormous amount of praise here on IMDB, with many people repeating what others have already said. Since there aren't words to express how deeply I feel towards this movie, I will focus on trying to defend "2001" from it's countless enemies.Obviously, the most common criticism is that the film is "boring" or "too slow." True, "2001" does have very slow pacing, and there are certain moments in which are downright tedious. However, such exhausting moments are totally necessary to establish the mood and to immerse the viewer into the film by its sheer realism. "2001" isn't like other movies. It doesn't try to build suspense or thrill its viewer in the conventional style. Personally, I wouldn't edit out a single millisecond of the space flight scenes, dull as they are.Another complaint with the film is that the story is non-existent, therefore, there is no substance. This isn't an easy movie to understand, even with repeated viewings, but it does have a storyline to decipher. Some have read Arthur C. Clarke's "The Sentinel" in order to figure it out. If one is really confused as to what's going on, search the web for a 1969 Stanley Kubrick interview conducted by Joseph Gelmis. Kubrick gives a straightforward explanation of the plot without going too deeply into the more subjective ideas and meanings behind the action. If you're unwilling to come up with your own interpretation of the film, or if you're just curious to find out what the creator's intention was, I would definitely checking it out.About 30% of the "2001" comments on IMDB are made up of people who absolutely loathe this film. Some of them, I'm sure, really did try to like this movie, but they don't know how to approach it. Others might have figured that the film isn't "hip" or "thrilling" enough for them, so they refuse to appreciate it. Others still may just lack the attention span or the patience to view a movie of this sort. But for those who are unable to decipher the reasons as to why people love this film should definitely take a look at the positive comments on this movie. After that, try watching the movie again, and approach it not with the mind of a cynical film buff, but with a sort of childlike wonder.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone who watches 2001: A Space Odyssey, Stanley Kubrick's truly mind-boggling masterpiece, will be driven to incredible frustration if they try to make any sense out of it. The beauty and glory of this journey into space aswell as the interior of our own minds is still breathtaking today, but even now its true vision eludes us. Almost everyone has his or her own theories on what the film means, but the fact is, no one really knows. It is for this very reason that 2001 is a classic to rival all classics, and an important stepping stone from old films to new, where Kubrick takes us on a 2 1/2 hour trip from monkeys, to man, to computers, to monoliths and beyond the infinite. I absolutely love this movie, and I still have no clue what it means. In being vague but astoundingly visual in its reality, I think it appeals both to the visual mind, aswell as our subconscious selves. For those of you who haven't seen it, when you do, DO NOT try to understand Kubrick's vision. Just sit back for the movie ride of your life!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, it is! (Even James Cameron said so - don't ask me for the reference, I just saw him interviewed on the TV.)It may not be the most exciting SF film ever made, but it is definitely the closest thing ever filmed to future reality. This is because the reality level in this film is extremely high - just a few blunders (see the "goofs" page http://us.imdb.com/Goofs?0062622 and look at the "factual errors" entries). There are none of the ridiculous explosions, such as those in the "Star Wars" series, or "The Fifth Element", or the "Star Trek" films (don't get me wrong - these films are high up on my favourite movies list), audible through vacuum. (But remember the "Alien" tag-line: "In Space no one can hear you scream"!) I know it sounds good and adds to the occasion and lets the subwoofers rip - BUT IT'S WRONG! Also, there's none of the exploding-eyes-in-a-vacuum rubbish such as in "Total Recall" and "Outland". (Although Bowman's lungs should have burst when he held his breath while awaiting the explosive bolts to blow. Breathe out next time, Dave!)The reality level is not, however, "2001"'s winning factor.It is the scope of the film that transcends all other SF movies - "The Dawn of Man" to his ultimate incarnation. That is what the movie is about - no mystical mumbo-jumbo. Plain, simple Charles Darwin evolution - a theme that Arthur C Clarke has touched upon in other of his novels and short storys - that of the consciousness developing to the point where it can leave biology (body) and machine (cybernetic extensions) behind and become pure thought; pure logic. (Has "Trek's" Spock been reading ACC?)That is not a foetus floating in orbit around Earth at the end - it is a representation of the rebirth of man. (Okay, so there is a little symbolic mumbo-jumbo!)The fact that this film was made *before* man landed on the moon is also another of its great achievements.The greatest achievement?That Stanley Kubrick pulled it off with such scintillating visual prowess.</fullReview>

I would consider this the best sci-fi film of all time.Stanley Kubrick's visionis wonderful and still holds up until this very day.I wasn't born in the 1960s and I really don't watch all of his films.I have seen "Paths of Glory","The Shining" and "Eyes Wide Shut".Not to mention a few others."2001:A Space Odyssey" is a film that I could probably relate to.After watching this film,I feel compelled to watch it again.It deserves to be seen again.A classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A state of mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thing you must realize when you discuss "2001 - A space odyssey" is that this movie isn't really "a stereotypical Hollywood movie". If you compare this movie to any other movie (almost any other) then you'll notice a significant difference in story development. You may even want to call "2001" a slow movie. For instance take "Lost in space", "Red planet", heck - even "Star Wars" - then will you notice that these movies really are action/(fantasy)/science-fiction, while "2001" is a pure science-fiction movie. These action movies always develop more rapid or to be more precise, these movies have a shorter and more concentrated story.Stanley had a kind of `trademark', which was that his movies often (or rather always) provoked the human mind. We who have seen `A Clockwork Orange' will know what I'm trying to say. `2001 - A space odyssey' is a provoking movie in the sense that it suggest that we (humans) really aren't that special. We humans have always thought ourselves as special, for a time not so long ago we thought that Earth was the centrum of the universe and just up to recently we thought that our Solar system was the only system with planets. Nowadays we know better, but still this `humanism' exists, even though we know that we probably are just one of hundreds (thousands, millions) other civilizations. Heck - just go outside any night and watch the universe and try to think that we are a product of the universe and there is no real meaning of life, it just is - then you'll realize that we are in fact nothing special.A final remark, I read somewhere on this page that someone didn't understand why HAL 9000 went postal and that he actually committed an error in doing so, but if you watch `2010' (or even better, read the book since that movie wasn't really any good).By the way, read the books (`2001', `2010', `2061', `3001' and `rendezvous with Rama' - all by Arthur C. Clarke, they are amongst the best books I ever read.)From Sweden / Marcus Larsson</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hi,I highly recommend reading the book for those wanting explanations (and I recommend wanting an explanation) :)What Stanley Kubrick did was simply film the outward action that occurred throughout the film, without the accompanying narrative in the book. The actual story is not avante garde or mysterious in any way, on the contrary its a straight ahead sci-fi story.Everything is explained: Why Hal acted as it did, a step-by-step explanation of the end scene, exactly where the Monolith is from and what its for.I did like this movie because of the cinematography, I thought it was gorgeous, but I don't know if I accept leaving out the narrative. It was boring watching 3 hours of visuals. But I do agree I only saw it once in high school and I still remember it to this day because the visuals are very strong.So for all you hippies out there talking about the "MTV generation who has no attention span" just remember Arthur Clarke must not have an attention span either, since he seemed to prefer an actual story as opposed to a series of fascinating images.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece is timeless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you consider how many comments there are on IMDb alone, it's apparent that 2001 A Space Odyssey is the greatest sci-fi/art film of all time. 33 years later, people are still talking about. Of course there are some works of art that have hyped themselves to being the "in" thing to see in order to prove your intelligence. But I don't believe 2001 is one of those. For me the message is simple: man will never completely understand his destiny, and, especially, man will never completely understand the universe. There are other great images and metaphors in the film. For most of the film we see people as astronauts living in a technical, cold, sterile environment. Then, HAL, the super-computer with artificial intelligence (a very advanced concept for 1968) suffers a nervous breakdown. Then there is a battle of wits between HAL and Dave who must shut down HAL's higher functions. Is this a metaphor for the struggle we face now and in the future to preserve our humanity in spite of attempts to control our lives through technology? Whatever the answer is, I enjoy watching this film on DVD with as big a TV as possible and lots of high quality sound. Of course, it would be nice to see it where it belongs: on the big screen, but I will settle for the DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very good movie, some really interesting and thought provoking parts, but overall not amazing, like some poeple think. I'm not one of those 'brought up on MTV' people who can't stay focused for more then 15 seconds without an explosion. I enjoyed this movie and found it thought provoking but too drawn out. Some of Kubricks other movies, clockwork orange as my favorite, are also well directed and much more interesting. In Kubrick's defense, I can see that the effects in the movie, in '68, were likely awe inspiring but in time have unfortunately lost much of their splendor. Also, im sure many of you who do love this movie love it legitimately and everyone has and is entitled to their own opinion, some of the movies I love are not appreciated by many people, but I beleive that alot of people just say they love this movie so that they can seem more intelligent then the average movie viewer, who doesn't understand this movie. This can be seen in the similarity of most of the positive reviews for this movie. In conclusion, it is a good movie, but it is over-rated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What can I say?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Dad said 2001 was the greatest Sci Fi movie of all time, so a few days ago I bought the remastered edition and this is what I can say after watching twice.The special effects are the best ever for any Sci Fi movie of that time (1968) the sound is very important and is made up of "opera-like" themes.Stanley Kubrick's direction is amazing (and he and Arthur C. Clarke also wrote the screenplay together)ONE PROBLEM THOUGHNo it's not that it's confusing and I prefer to know what happens at the end rather than having to have it subjected to interrogation. The problem is it's too long and most of it because of the space-flight scenes which take up about half the film.OVERALLthe film is amazing in effects, sound and premise but it's overlength will put off many people nowadays especially with the new Star Wars trilogy.THE FINAL WORDAnybody with the intelligence above a monkey should go and at least rent this film I can guarentee you a movie experience which will make you appreciate life a lot more.</fullReview>

END OF COMMENTPLEASE READ THAT TOO i saw a low budget parody on this movie some years ago in the german television, but i can't remember the title and where to get it. it was so bad and cheap that i liked it very much. it was about a spaceship with the mission to find planets to live on and to destroy planets which disturb those planets. another funny thing where the bombs - they had an own consciousness and they had to be convinced to destroy the planets...

		<fullReview>Reading through the previous reviews I got quite sad at how many people basically just seemed to say "Ugh. Where's the dialogue? Where's the action? Where are the nifty giant explosions?" To all those people I can only say: Sorry, this kind of movie wasn't made for you. It stems from a time when people were more patient, when they could enjoy the wonderful atmosphere and ponder the philosophical meaning. Because those two things are what made this movie one of the all-time greats. Go and watch Rambo again, that seems to be your style. Bleah.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It angers me so much to hear people say "oh this is so boring!" What I'm getting from reading these is that these people who trash 2001 as the worst movie of all time obviously don't understand Stanley Kubrick. The man truly is a genius. He was an avid chess player before he was a film maker. Chess taught him how to perfectly time and order his shots and scenes.I personally don't think "2001" was boring at all. In fact, it held my attention throughout the entire film. There really was never a movie like it before, and there never will be. It is really a shame that the MTV generation (which includes myself) must have constant loud explosions and gratuitous sex to hold their attention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like 2001-A Space Odyssey. It's the first sci-fi film that made people think seriously about our Earth future, and not about how you could easily see the zipper running up the back of the Martian monster costume. Regrettably, 2001 runs a little too long for my personal taste, with a small group of astronauts spending much of their time conducting ordinary, routine tasks that, when you really consider it, would be truly boring and tedious. In this respect, this movie tells us not to expect too much in the future. Apart from the fact that it doesn't lie to the viewer how boring space travel really is, Kubrick's classic space opera also tells us that we are way-too-concerned about finding answers in outer space, instead of trying to salvage what precious little there's still left on Earth.Like comedic-auteur Woody Allen once said about this one (he didn't like it the first time he saw it), '2001' tells us something more each time we view it... and it is rarely the same story the next time around.So take a few 'No-Doze' before you decide to watch it. It lasts a long time, but we are nonetheless enlightened after making this unique round trip.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes I love this film and I appreciate that people hate it with the same passion. What I have found is that unless you approach with a sense of wonder and awe it will just leave you cold. Movie goers brought up on a diet of Star Wars / Star Trek and their like and are used to being spoonfed the plot, having all action against thought, flash effects rather than what is realistic and the usual good versus evil (no grey areas) just don't seem to have this sense of awe and wonder. Maybe it's because we live in very cynical times, and that having a the sense of wonder seems a rather childish thing now. Made in a time when we felt we could change the world (how's that for over amitious optimism) and that we were at the begining of something wonderful. Shame that it just never materialised. I digress.... So, if you want run of the mill action films with a scifi setting then watch the rest. However, if you want your intelligence provoked, if you appreciate the use of image and sound (that in my view is breathtaking), if don't mind having to work out the ending (if there is one) and you want a film that asks many more questions than it answers - then give this film a chance.You may be surprised....... By the way I do like Trek (but not Voyager).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the greatest film of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>RATING: 10A film so carefully crafted and visually breathtaking that, regardless of content, the viewer is immediately drawn to it. Stanley Kubrick created the film of his career with this magnificent science fiction opus, which explores such themes as extraterrestrial life, man versus technology, religion, and, above all, humanity's place in the universe.Perhaps the most fascinating quality in "2001", next to its highly thought-provoking nature, is the overall atmosphere and mood. The film has such a commanding, godlike presence that one forgets that they are viewing a movie, rather than observing an actual monolith of sorts.Kubrick's direction here is truly glorious. As with all of his films, he refuses to follow a cinematic formula or to deliver instant gratification to his audience. He allows "2001" to take its time and unfold in a slow, sometimes even tedious manner in order to fully immerse his audience into the film. The use of music in the film (Johann Strauss's "The Blue Danube" beautifully juxtaposed with images of slow moving spaceships) will leave a truly indelible impact on practically anyone who sees the film.This is a film that will never cease to be relevant. It's very subject matter is something few would dare to examine in a film, much less in such an audacious manner. This is a perfect film in every aspect. Even the acting, which so many have complained about, is appropriately restrained and realistic. "2001" went where no film ever dared to go, which is one of the many reasons of why I consider this to be the apex of cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey progresses slowly, and the lack of dialogue can be unnerving. Those who dislike this movie (there are quite a few, Kubrick films tend to be either loved or hated) tend to focus upon this "flaw". However, the movie is extremely well done. Most science fiction movies do not survive more than 5 or 10 years; yet in 2001: A Space Odyssey the scenery is more than simply believable, it is immersive. Viewers will feel the atmosphere. Kubrick films simply don't look like they've been filmed with a camera. As for the film's "message"... Kubrick didn't like to talk about his movies because he thought they should "speak for themselves."The movie's craft is enough justification to see it, if you haven't yet. If you're impatient then be forewarned: the pace of the movie is quite demanding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"2001: A Space Odyssey" is an experience in itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find it interesting that I was able to see "2001: A Space Odyssey" on the year the film is referring to.Those who saw it on the year it was first released---1968---must have felt both excited and apprehensive about what would really become of us by the start of the new millennium;while those who viewed it on the envisioned year itself will have the benefit of being able to assess "right away" the validity and credibility of the film's prognosis, though the thrill of having to become aware of a very distant visualized future slowly creeping upon you might be somehow diminished.Now, what's "2001" all about? Oopss, I may have asked the wrong question, for it could have been "How does it feel watching '2001'?" instead. For "2001" isn't really a film, but an experience---you don't just watch it, you live through it.True, the film has incorporated all the familiar elements of a science-fiction genre---a space mission to Jupiter, a team of astronauts being "heartlessly" manned by an omniscient and omnipresent computer named HAL (of the 9000 series), the mission suffering a major setback which leads to the "life-system" of HAL being ultimately cut off, the two remaining astronauts (Frank Poole and Dave Bowman) having to settle finally in Jupiter, with one of them evolving into a "new" species of a "higher" order---but to limit "2001" to such nominal categories is to deintensify the "high" one may get from viewing the film.One just has to move along with its visual symphony.Which brings me to the film's distinctive quality that sets it apart from all the other films of the same mold (see, for example, Fritz Lang's "Metropolis," Roger Vadim's "Barbarella," Jim Sharman's "The Rocky Horror Picture Show").And that is, the use of some well-known classical pieces, which are charmingly and upliftingly made part of the narrative.My favorite is the part where the space station "waltzes" in the galaxy, being accompanied by Johann Strauss' "An der schönen blauen Donau." Ahhh, one would wish that the film never comes to its end (it runs for almost two-and-a-half hours, but that seems not enough).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A work of art? Yes. A movie? Hmm..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm very torn on this movie after seeing it. I've read several reviews on this site that say things along the lines of "This is more than a movie, it's a work of art". I'd like to disagree slightly; this IS a work of art, but it is very barely a movie.*Spoilers*I'm really at a loss on how to discuss this movie, so I'll do the simplistic thing and compare the parts I enjoyed with the parts I didn't enjoy.First off, this movie uses music and sound to create an atmosphere better than any other movie I have ever seen. There is no contest whatsoever. The special effects are also superb, which becomes even more impressive once you consider that this movie was made in the 60's... they're really as good as movies I see released today. I loved the image of the monolith and the music that accompanied it, it was truly awe inspiring. I loved the "white room" sequence at the end of the film, and it didn't even really matter to me that it had no "plot" behind it. All in all, the second half of the movie is consistently amazing in the visuals it presents and the soundtrack that accompanies it.Now the parts I did not like... There is an attempt made to give the movie a plot about man's discovery of these monoliths, and the whole business of the HAL 9000 "rebelling" against the human inhabitants of the spaceship, which is what most people bring up about the movie. I have no idea why this "storyline" is even present. First off, it's barely realized. The characters have no depth or personality, so the viewer cannot be expected to care what happens to them. The plot doesn't have any kind of setup or conclusion, and hence is largely pointless. Second, it's completely irrelevant. This is a movie of sound and image, not of narration or dialogue.Unfortunately, this pseudo-plot plays a very nasty trick on people who watch the movie for the first time, as you begin to ever sooooo slowly be involved in the "story", only to have it go absolutely nowhere. This is a work that's so completely different from any other movie I've ever seen that judging it as "a sci-fi movie" is like judging Romeo and Juliet as "an erotic novel".I have only seen this movie once, a few hours ago, and I don't think I could bear watching it back to back... it's far too complex for that. Right now I am at a loss as to what rating it deserves. Part of me wants to give it a 7 or an 8 because of the seemingly pointless half-plot that takes up a good hour and a half of the movie, and part of me wants to give it a 10 regardless.P.S. I've noticed more than a few reviews who imply that anyone who doesn't absolutely love this movie is a simpleton with no attention span and no appreciation of art. I think that's a pathetically childish view. Different people have different tastes. It's really as simple as that. Just because they differ from yours, doesn't mean they're inferior.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Space for the ImaginationWhen I first saw 2001 I thought the baby(o star child)at the end of the film REPRESENTED a new world or planet but sadly I've read so many essays and articles about this film that in a way influenced my personal opinion.Maybe the person who called 2001"a film without message" was right,maybe it means nothing:The Black Monolith,so solemn almost mystical is like a crucifix hanging on walls in christian homes as a mighty object but really,don't mean a thing.I dismissed the religious theories because Kubrick was an "Atheistic" and I dont see him doing "A God's tale";or philosophical interpretations either.I take 2001 Space Odyssey for what it is "an astonishing visual film(the beauty of it).The astronaut David Bowman finished an unconcluded mission"alone",his partner dies(he seems to be his twin brother or something)Bowman disconnects HAL 9000(the computer)after that he submerges himself in"Jupiter and Beyond" with flood of colors,forms and surreal landscapes,our eyes are wide open as Bowman,his distorted face is shocking,we see more lights and masses this become A Personal Odyssey maybe "mental",into subconscious?.The Big Question:is the baby/fetus an E.T? OR MAYBE A New Man,DISCONNECTED from technology(the weapons),the truth is more close to NIETZSCHE,we dont know but... who cares?.2001 it's great and controversial I liked the ambiguity,maybe that was Kubrick intention to incentive the audience to think for themselves.My Opinion maybe is wrong but that's not the point,if I THOUGHT the star child was a planet maybe it is not far from the truth,somebody said:"A Head/mind is a world".AH!

		<shortDescription>Puts the sci in sci-fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey is arguably the greatest science fiction movie ever made. The reason I regard it as such is the fact that unlike so many other movies of the genre, this really has SCIENCE in it. It's incredible how many sci-fi movies have no science in them at all.Observe the scenes on board the space station and the spacecraft Discovery. Most science fiction films don't explain how it is that there is gravity on spaceships and stations rather than weightlessness. This film shows how a makeshift gravity is produced by rotating the spacecraft to produce inertia around the inside of the ship. Who will ever forget that scene where Frank Poole is shown running around Discovery like a rodent? Observe those scenes where David Bowman and Frank Poole go outside in their spacesuits and spacepods to make reparations. In other space films there would be fancy sound effects and their jobs would have been completed quickly. In 2001, these scenes are done in complete silence and the jobs are completed in real time. This may make it seem less riveting than Star Wars, but you find yourself thinking; this is how it would actually be in real life.Never has space been captured looking so large, cold, bleak, yet beautiful. In a Star Trek film, if you wanted to go some place you would just go into warp 4. Not so in this film. In 2001, it takes months for the Discovery to get to Jupiter and during that time the ship just seems to hang in mid air motionless. Kubrick really makes you feel the distances between planets.For those viewers intending to watch 2001, I recommend only seeing it letterboxed. For best viewing, see it on the biggest screen possible preferably with the sound connected to the stereo and the lights dimmed. This is truly one of those films which you must allow to take you in as in the theaters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's the thing. A lot of people don't get 2001 because they are viewing it strictly as entertainment. Not to say that it is not entertaining in its own way, its just that the movie is meant to provoke you. It is meant to inspire you, to confuse you, to spark dialogues, to make you argue with others. This is a new kind of movie made by a visionary director, and human being, who understood where we are headed. This is film as philosophy. This is a film about ideas. This is Aristotle and Plato and Socrates holding cameras. 2001 is the most ambitious movie ever made and will not likely be duplicated anytime soon. The fact that it makes one cry, or another smile, or another one p***ed off is exactly the point. I truly believe that film is the greatest art form ever conceived by man thus far, and that it is our purest. Done well, film is a perfect blend of all the other forms that have gone before it. 2001 is what film could be, should be, and hopefully someday, will be. Not only is it prophetic fiction, it's a painting. Not only is it poetry, but there's even a symphony! If you don't like it, pick up a camera and make your own movie.

		<shortDescription>Kubrick's Silent Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Calling 2001: A Space Odyssey a silent movie is not entirely accurate, but it does encompass much of what made silent cinema great. The visual storytelling is breathtaking and moves the plot far more than the dialogue. The acting is unremarkable and perfunctory, but it is hardly noticeable among the movie's visuals.As if in a silent film, The music is a character in this movie. A teriffic and varied classical score is truly remarkable. Part of me wishes Kubrick had used his original impulse to have british prog-rockers Pink Floyd do the music for the film. That part of me is small, though, and gets beaten into submission when I watch the movie.The visual effects in this film are truly remarkable. There are no laser beams and explosions, but the space scenes on the moon and en route to Jupiter are fully believable, and after all, suspension of disbelief is the prime factor in sci-fi. We should keep in mind, this film was made before the Apollo moon landings.The psychedelic finale of the film needs a big screen to be fully appreciated. I recently saw the re-release on a huge screen and I can truly say it was like watching the movie for the first time. This movie is enjoyable on video, but it borders on a religious experience in front of a 40 foot screen supported by digital sound.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't usually write comments, but this movie made me think about it for so long that I had to share my views.First off, this is a fantastic film. I love Stanley Kubrick's previous works and this is one of his best. I was always astounded about how they did that. I can't even see some of the stuff they did now it was so good.But there was more than that. There was a story within a gallery of art that made me think two, three, four times before coming to a conclusion. If a movie can make you think about it for over a day than you know it's a classic.I was always trying to catch up with what was going on and I love it when a film can make me do that. I always wanted to know what was behind that cliff, that moon, etc. My heart was pounding all the time especially when Kubrick cleverly used only the oxygen tank and the man's breathing as sound. The movie was always one step ahead of me.I know I've rambled on, but I would like to close by saying that Star Wars is my favorite movie. I like action, I like speed, and I like loud sound, but as they say: "Opposites attract" and this was the one that attracted me. This is one of the best movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate science fiction film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Modern movie-going audiences could be forgiven for not understanding or comprehending "2001: A Space Odyssey." Most of today's film fans were weaned on "Star Wars" or John Hughes-style teen romantic comedies. To them a good film is something with a decent soundtrack, an easy-to-follow narrative and some hunky or sexy actors and actresses. Film as purely entertainment. Nothing more. If they want art, they'll go to an art gallery.Am I being too harsh? I don't think so. It takes a special kind of film fan to appreciate a movie of such awe-inspiring breadth. Thankfully there are also plenty of audiences that see "2001" in that way. For some it's a bore, for others it is one of the greatest films ever made.The term ?masterpiece' is bandied around too often these days. Any run of the mill Hollywood fluff is labelled a masterpiece, despite being just slightly above the cut. But `2001' is one of the true masterpieces of cinema and is not likely to be matched again. Stanley Kubrick's films are often too deep for even the most intuitive of minds, and "2001" is no exception. For me personally this is his best work ? planned but unstructured, powerful but ambiguous. Genius is the word that most often comes to mind.Look at the climate of the world when "2001" was released. Modern western society was changing dramatically thanks to the influence of modern music, fashion and psychedelic drugs. The generation gap was wider than ever before and this in some part led to the huge difference in opinion between critics and the young audience upon the film's release. Critics hated it, youths loved it.More than thirty years on "2001" holds a different kind of meaning. I do not believe it resembles a psychedelic experience, but more so what the vastness of space and the incomprehensibility of alien and intergalactic experiences may actually be like. The lack of strong narrative is a side note ? often our own lives are put off kilter by our experiences. Life does not always read like a perfect story, and "2001" could be an allegory to life itself. "2001" presents so many ?could be's' that trying to figure out a reasoned and solid explanation for the film takes out much of its enjoyment. Its ambiguity is its strength and determining its story is part of the fun of working it out. So where do you begin?Well the film opens with its rousing score: Strauss' Also Sprach Zarathustra, now commonly known as ?the 2001 theme'. We are introduced to ?The Dawn of Man' ? a time when man was simply an ape, living a gruff existence of berries and fruit. All other animals are his equal and he shuffles around at day, living in fear at night. One day the apes encounter an alien black monolith, which, in time with an aligning of the earth, sun and moon, begins to change and evolve the creatures. The apes learn to use animal bones as tools of destruction. Now meat-eating carnivores, mans ancestors are armed. While they have evolved, they have also set the path for man's ultimate destruction of himself.A jump cut of thousands of years takes us to modern man ? flying through space in a cylindrical spaceship. Not content with his earthy boundaries, man has launched himself beyond his home planet. After an impressive display of special effects (which purposefully move in a slow motion), we are introduced to Dr. Heywood Floyd (William Sylvester). Floyd is a scientist visiting the moon after a black monolith, identical to the one in the opening act, has been found on its surface. With its radio signal pointing towards Jupiter, a mission to locate its origins is launched.A huge spaceship ?Discovery' is sent out to Jupiter. Its crew includes five scientists, two who man the ship and three that are in frozen hibernation. The two men in control are Dr David Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Dr Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood). They are joined by a ?super-computer', the talking and intuitive HAL 9000 (voiced by Douglas Rain). HAL controls most of the ship's operations and we are often left questioning the reasoning for the inclusion of the five crew. The interior of the ?Discovery' is beautifully created, with its Ferris wheel control room, in which Dave and Frank walk upside down (this was created with the use of a permanently moving cylinder). HAL is resembled as nothing more than a red light ? yet we see it as an eye. HAL has a personality, and his development as a character is amazingly intriguing. When things start to go wrong on the ?Discovery', the film's tempo does not change. The sense of helplessness in the vastness of space grows and grows and Dave is faced with the ultimate dilemma near the film's close. To avoid spoiling the end for those of you who have not seen it, I shall say nothing more than it is nothing like you have ever seen. Man's evolution is realised in a form no one could have predicted when they first witness this film.Kubrick's control is evident right throughout the movie and every long, drawn out shot can be appreciated as part of the director's intentions to display the huge breadth of space. Even the sets, which seem dated now in the world of CGI, work with ease, especially the ?red' room that Dave enters near the film's conclusion. This film is scary on a spiritual level ? it questions man's ultimate goal of continual growth and learning.The music compositions in the film are almost entirely all classical pieces. Gyorgy Ligeti's utterly terrifying ?Monolith' theme is one viewers will always remember. The trip to Infinity is a memorable piece of the mind-bending cinema and the special effects, while slightly plastic-looking are still impressive.The film closes with more questions than when it began. Viewers will find they ask questions about it forever: what does it all mean? Who sent the monolith? What happens to Dave? It goes beyond our comprehension, but we relish in the challenge of trying to work it out. "2001: A Space Odyssey" is not just a film, it is an experience. It challenges everything we've previously considered in film and also in life. It is the ultimate science-fiction film and one that will continue to change the opinions and lives of cinemagoers for many years to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001 could have been cut by about 40 minutes and nothing would have been lost, save for repetitious scenes and classical music. The idea is unique, starting thousands of years in our past, explaining how we came to be, then ending in our future. The end scene is difficult to watch (when the space baby is being born) because it takes forever to see and all it is is shots of weird lavalamp colors swirling about. Still worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey is my favorite film. Its not as perfect as some of the other movies I've seen (TSharpFilm's Perfection Award would probably go to Lawrence of Arabia or Barry Lyndon), but I can't think of another film that makes me go "wow..." more.Stanley Kubrick created a smart and ambitious experience that explores ideas most filmmakers wouldn't have the courage to scratch the surface of, or the curiosity to consider significant. Although many of the key story elements are presented in an ambiguous way, there is still enough information given to hold your attention through out the 141 minute runtime. And after its all over, you're left memories to reflect on and discuss for the next week, or maybe for the next month, or maybe 40 years after its initial release.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an experiential journey into fundamental questions of our origin and destiny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film prompts one to question ourselves about our origin, our existence and our ultimate destiny as living entities. Rather than attending some classes on philosophy, it is better to watch this film, because the serious sets, the slick plot and the brooding music imperceptibly but inevitably lull the mind into deep thought about ourselves. Lull may not be the best word to describe the way we end up thinking about ourselves, for it is true that the first scenes of our anthropoidal ancestry inspire shock, even a definite sense of terror, (even horror), then the ascent into space inspires a sense of hope commingled with awe, until one is plunged into a sense filled with all the horror of the abyss and the bottomless mysteriousness that it invokes in us when the team of astronauts die after they come into contact with the mysterious monolith, then the plateau of hope at seeing the astronauts in their Jupiter Mission, then the new terror that is whipped up imperceptibly with incredible subtlety by the claustrophobic interiors of the space ship and the absolute impersonality of HAL, particularly the voice of HAL by Douglas Rain and then when HAL goes berserk, the feeling of utter helplessness seizes us, but this is alleviated again by the mysterious conclusion that the monolith (that emblematizes the secret ultimate destiny of mankind) may not be totally lethal (as in the killing of the astronauts on the Moon) after all-- does it help man on alternate occasions or does it help out of some whim? The film's strongest point is its undeniable quality of promoting a fundamentally heuristic question about US!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001:A Space Odyssey is my favourite movie. Flat-out STUNNING visuals, (the best cinematography in any film i've ever seen), a profound, implicit and deep theme that ties the movie together and has you thinking on it for years after. The visual effects are comparable to those of movies today, which shows the pain staking efforts Kubrik and crew must have put into them. The musical score pulls you along the length of the story which is told more so with visuals and music than dialogue. Those who find it boring must get stuck on the surface (not to mention have a lack of knowledge of photography) because once you start seeing the depth of the message, plot and theme the pacing of the movie is almost too fast as you need plenty of time to try to wrap yourself around some of these concepts, and thats coming from somebody who studies quantam physics!!! Not only is this the definitive Sci-fi, this is the definitive drama, suspense and above all the defining moment for cinematography in movie history. Watch it, and try to understand.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is truly an exceptional piece of entertainment history. A film based on a story by a science fiction writer that actually thought about what life would be like in the 21st century.Stanley Kubrick was an exceptional individual with a vision and accuracy of what outerspace was truly like. Now remember this film was made almost 10 years before Star Wars was released. The films story was exceptionally well crafted. Here is a ancient unexplainable monolith that is discovered on the moon which is calling out to the universe as some sort of "homeing beacon". Humans, being truly arrogrant, believing that they've figured out the meaning of the monolith go to Jupiter to unlock this secret.Along the way, the pressures of deepspace travel and an artificial intelligence that has a "nervous breakdown" makes the story very interesting and entertaining to see if humanity can survive within the vacuum of space and far from its evloutionary nest.I highly recommend this film for all to see, sci fi lovers and the non, alike to watch. You'll at least come away from the film with an appreciation of what accuracy Kubrick was trying to obtain, or make you believe that "we are truly not alone" in the universe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Epic!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001:a space odyssey is without a doubt one of the greatest epics of all time.It is probably my second favorite film of all-time next to "Jaws".This isn't your everyday film.It may be one of the most unique films ever.What Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clark were able to do with this story is truly mind-boggling.It's different things to different people which is part of what makes it so amazing.It makes people think.I think that's the way Kubrick wanted it.He loved to make people have to think about stuff.It starts with one of films greatest openings.It's our so-called ancestors,the apes.They stumble upon this great,big monolith of extra-terrestrial knowledge.After coming in contact with it,the apes evolve into a intellegent speices.They learn to kill for food,and each other.The score to this film is absolutely astonishing.Whenever I think of something gigantic or amazing I think of this score at the beginning.Anyway,after millions of years of evolving,the apes finally become the human race.They can build big,giant machines to help them rule and explore the universe.But what they don't know is that they are not the most intellegent life in space.Machines must do everything for them.They aren't even potty-trained in space.They are just children who don't understand it as much as they think they do.So the monolith tries to make them more itellegent.But they do not understand this because they are too dumb. And they become so dumb over the years after having so much promise that even their own machines become smarter then them.Especially HAL,a super-computer and the brain of the Discovery.He obviously has a intelligence far greater then humans.And so,he thinks their should be no humans.He starts off by killing all the crew aboard the Discovery shuttle(who need machines to put them asleep in order for them to travel without going crazy.)So,it is not HAL who is the crazy one here,but the humans who underestimate HAL's intellegence.But HAL dosen't kill astronauts Frank Poole and David Bowman.This was his mistake.HAL learns of their plan to disconnect him and acts on it as soon as he gets the chance by killing Poole.Then he tries to kill Bowman,but he sneaks into the ship.He then disconnects HAL after a long battle of apologies and regrets by the original IBM himself.Bowman tries to rescue his comrad Poole,but it is too late for him.Then,as if the super-natural beings feel pity for Bowman,a gigantic,rainbow-colored wormhole or teleport takes Bowman's pod on the ultimate trip.After a series of swirling,colorful spirals and shapes inside the portal,Bowman finds himself in a hotel room.He wonders where in the world he is,or even if he is in a world at all.He stumbles around with a look of wonder on his face.He then sees an old man eating dinner.The man is old and withering away slowly.He drops a glass of wine,shattering it.The glass is shattered,but the liquid is still their,which hints what Kubrick may have meant for this:that the human body may change,but the soul inside will always remain the same,just like the old man.Then Bowman finds himself in a bed,old and withering away,slowly.He is the old man.Then he sees the gigantic monolith at the end of his bed as if signaling the end of his evolutionary cycle.He reaches out as if he thinks it will save him.But it is too late for Bowman,and he ends up at the start of his next so-called life,as a human embryo heading towards his new destination and new life.Kubrick was right,we are just children in space and in life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is absolutely gorgeous. The first time I watched this was about 2 summers ago. Had nothing to do and decided to sit down and watch this movie. At first with the 40 minutes or so with only gorillas fighting and doing different types of things, I was wondering what was going on. As the film progressed it became more and more intriguing. You can definitely tell that there is great meaning behind this film and that it should not only be taken at face value, there is more to be understood about human nature and the director is making a statement about the future. You will either love or hate this film, I can kind of understand the side of those who hate it. Many people now have to understand everything about the films they watch or else it is not enjoyable. This movie has a plot that is different from what most people seem to look for. If you enjoy science fiction and wish to watch a movie that will really require you to think, I would highly recommend that you watch this movie with an open mind, you will be astounded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best film ever made - fact.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess there's not a lot I can say about this film that hasn't already been written, but I feel almost compelled to write something since it's the greatest film ever made (this is not an opinion, it's a fact).Everything about the film is perfect, from the music played over the opening shot (actually, not really a shot, it's just a blank screen) to the oft-discussed final image of the film. It's sort of ambitious to start a film with the title card "The Dawn of Man" and have an ending concerned with the future of the human race, but Kubrick was never a person to let practical limits deter him. The film is immaculately crafted all the way through, especially is the visual and aural sense, and the special effects are nothing short of spectacular. They give the film the sense of scale that it really needed to succeed where it is trying to. The effects are particularly impressive when you consider that it was nearly 35 years ago that they were shot, and the "stargate" sequence is better than anything I've seen created by CGI to date. And, of course, there's the music... I couldn't say for sure, but I reckon that this was the first time that an score made entirely of pieces of classical music was used in such a large film, and it's *certainly* the first (and last) time it has been used so well. Now many films take that approach simply to appear more intelligent than they actually are.I feel sorry for people who have become so weaned on narrative-driven movies nowadays that they dismiss the movie out of hand as being slow and boring. 2001: A Space Odyssey is unparalleled in cinema as a spectacle, and as an experience.</fullReview>

It was truly a masterpiece. The film is full of detail and long wide shots that just don't work viewed on a small television. It feels slow on TV, whereas in the theatre you have the chance to look around and take in the full image - just try reading the antigravity toilet instructions on a TV screen! With the brand new prints recently produced, it is better than ever due to the addition of Dolby noise reduction, making the hiss of mag striping no more during the silent space scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick Was Inspired by Angels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001 is a film that has affected me in a profound way, and I've recently realized that I don't know, nor do I want to know why. Before the words your reading now this review was a jargonous attempt at making sense of a film that had changed my perception in a radical way. But recently, and for no apparent reason, I was hit with a series of questions. One,... why? Two,... did it matter? And three,... were all those ridiculous interpretations really responsible for the emotion and awe this film inspired in me?And so, as I can not delete my previous review, I write this now. As an example of pure cinema as possibility, I really feel that 2001 should not be limited, but expanded. Perhaps the larger and greater we make it, the closer we come to why and how it effects us so. Is it merely the symbolic shape of a space ship, or the vast wonder of not knowing, not being able to explain or control the feelings invoked? 2001 has raised film, ART, to heights far greater than anything achieved before or since. It is film as a visual, aural, and emotional expirience that transcends verbal thought. It captures the wonder man must have felt when he first looked up to the stars.So please, if and when you come to a review title "2001: The Greatest Work of Art Ever Created By Cultured Man," skip over it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spellbinding. Brilliant. Magnificent. These are but just a few of the words one could use to describe Stanley Kubrick`s AND Arthur C. Clarke`s magnificent and flawless work of science fiction. I give credit to both men knowing well that the success of the story itself would not have been possible without the input of both men. The movie is a product of the flawless direction of one Stanley Kubrick and the brilliant storytelling of Arthur C. Clarke. If you have seen the movie and not read the book, I highly recommend doing so as it will answer all of the questions about the movie you may have had and it will entice you to read the remaining "odyssey" stories that completed the Odyssey Quartet.2001 is an awesome story from start to finish. Beginning with the birth of prehistoric intelligence and continuing with modern man and modern space travel it leads to a climax with a single specimen experiencing a new stage of evolution. In essence, becoming pure energy. All the while the main theme of the story is that modern humans have evolved not by their own will, but by the help of a super evolved intelligence that has apparently executed this same experiment on countless other worlds. I recommend this movie to anyone who has ever struggled with the idea of evolution vs. creationism. Also to anyone who has ever looked up at the stars at night and wondered what is out there and where as humans are we going. The movie is a vindication of what I believe and affirmed my faith in the fact that Stanley Kubrick was one of the top five best directors in the history of film.</fullReview>

Well, I'd say that in that aspect, he succeeded with flying colors. 2001's stunning visuals and amazing use of music are absolutely mind blowing. The black monolith, the planetary alignment at the beginning, the summersaulting space ships, the stargate sequence, one could go on and on about the memorable images in the film, all of which scream EPIC. The plot and dialogue exist only to set a framework for the images. There is only about 40 minutes of dialogue in the whole film, the best coming from the computer HAL. Ultimately, the film is what the poster says it is, "The Ultimate Trip". A perfect display of Kubrick's versatility as a director.</fullReview>

I'm starting to suspect that these prints are not struck from original negatives, but are created after the film has been digitized for DVD from digital information. This would explain the poor quality. Does anyone know?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie for the first time last week on DVD and I can see both points of view on this.The story really is patchy and certainly doesnt make sense at times. Also I found that it did not satisfy my desire for an ending to the story. However that may be a part of what the film is meant to be.Unlike most I loved the ape sequence all apart from the monolith. Never was it explained how it got there or why or even what impact it had, I thought when I saw it that it would empower the chimps somehow but then it seemed they evolved themselves.The cut from bone to space ship was daring at the time, not particuarly well done but it does provoke thought. The musical sequence from there is what the movie is known for and is good to watch once although i'm not sure about more than that. It must be remembered that at the time it would have facinated viewers with ideas they had never seen before and that is how it should be judged.The story starts off well, setting up a plot of finding a monolith and sending an investigation crew to Jupiter. This is where it feels like I started watching a different movie, one inside of the main movie. The idea of HAL and him going mad was well done but not explained at all in 2001 (more on that later). Apart from HAL none of the charachters were personable enough to gain any empathy with them, which detracts a little from me and the movie tends to plod along from there.Then bowman finds the larger monolith and the movie turns. The stargate sequence (not sure what to call it) is visually stunning even by todays standards and the realisation half way through of a birth is good even though I had a clue from the DVD chapter title. It did however last too long for my liking and I didnt like the changing ages much at all.Then the movie ends, I feel a little empty, stunned by those effects being from '68 and not '98 but empty. I didn't understand.Until I bought 2010 which despite not being directed by Kubrick is the actual sequal. It explains HAL's madness, it uses the changing ages of bowman and expands on the Birth and "full of stars" idea and has a nice message at the end, especiually in the middle of the cold war.Really Kubrick used the book as a template to try something different, some of it worked, some didnt, the story was nearly forgotten in the artistic element.As a stand alone movie in the current day it is OK, not good, not bad and very confusing. However in the context of 1968 with the amazing effects, music to chill your spine and remembering that no-one had ever tried anything like this before it is a historical classic, not a story classic but a piece of cinematographical history. Without 2001 there would have been no Star Wars, no Close Encounters, no E.T., no Star Trek and quite possibly science fiction would be very very different.The ideas from 2001 have formed the basis of both Sci-Fi and computer enhanced special effects, changing both forever and despite the film not in itself being quite right it is probably the most influencial piece of cinematography since Citizen Kane and the next movie to stir even half as much technical interest did not arrive until the Matrix just a few years ago, thats how far ahead of it's time it was.As a closing note I would reccommend to anyone interested in cinema history to get this on DVD, and anyone interested in understanding it get 2010 as well and if possible read bothy books, the ideas may be dated by todays standards, brith of a new star and all but at the time they were revolutionary and it would be unfair of us to judge it in any other way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fabulous ideas inspire people to develop new technology</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon knowing the year when 2001: A Space Odyssey was produced, I felt amazed by the technology it displayed. In that era, the movie was a production of originality and imagination, which can be grouped into science fiction genre. The first scene, a group of gorillas, aroused my curiosity and started to think what it symbolized. The part titled The dawn of man led me to think of mankind. Later, when a bone was employed as a weapon or a tool to fight against other rivals, a feeling of enlightenment flashed on me. Yes, it showed the start of human civilization.In effect, several parts in this film were indeed remarkable. For instance, the scene of a bone being thrown into the sky smoothly transferred into the appearance of a spaceship. I would say this shift was quite impressive. Also, classical music was played whenever a space journey proceeded. It made the audience feel like that everything in universe is in a peaceful state or they can only find harmony there. Silence is the background of the cosmos.By the way, the way that an astronaut used to communicate with his family is the pioneer of net meetings nowadays. It seems we are able to find some traces of fabulous ideas in this film related to modern technology or perhaps some of them inspired people who engage in R&amp;D to develop new technology.Yet, a question was left to the viewers to consider. When human beings lead a life completely computerized, if computer systems go wrong one day, how can human beings face and cope with the problem? In this movie, computers seemed to develop its own thinking mode and had the capability to adopt necessary strategies against mankind when it found it could be disconnected. Perhaps, this situation could occur some day.Besides the above, in the beginning, something similar to an obelisk awakened the gorillas' curiosity and flocked to touch it. What did this obelisk mean here? Also, in the end, when the leading character was at his last breath, the obelisk appeared again. Through it, the dead character transformed into a newborn baby, starting his new life or another circulation. The obelisk seemed to represent a gate to another world, or a passage to the cosmos. If so, then actually, things in universe are connected. No boundaries exist; only myth is still awaiting humans to probe answers. The end of life, as a matter of fact, starts another life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was just recently able to watch this on the big screen...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...for the first time, after seeing it several times on Video.If I had to name one film as my favourite, this would probably be it. I was very excited to be able to see it on the big screen. I have always thought the film was profound and beautifully crafted ever since I was a teenager seeing it for the first time nearly twenty years ago on PBS.I went to see it with a friend while we were visiting San Francisco. I was amazed at how much the last segment of the movie looked much better on the big screen. I had always thought the light show at the end was a little bit hokey and out of place, but it seemed to fit better on the big screen.I think the film has a few minor technical flaws. It is probably a little dated in the sense that they are trying to show off what was then (and mostly still are) great special effects. And so there are long, slow sequences you sit through that seem strange compared to most of today's films. I have always personally thought, however, they were hypnotic because of the beautiful music and stylish directing. This either made me not even really notice or not seem to mind that the scenes are actually quite long. I owe the beginning of my great love of classical music to this film and Stanley Kubrick, despite even being a typically ignorant and stupid teenager at the time.My friend fell asleep thru-out most of the film, but I think his attention span is limited to fast food TV commercials.I have only read a little bit of Clarke's book but I think the explanations that the book would provide would destroy some of the meaning and beauty of the film for me, so I prefer not to ever read it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is so good I'm speechless. Many disagree on what it means, but they were all right about one thing: it kicks ass! This also goes to prove that Kubrick is in fact the best at EVERYTHING! He made science fiction, he made the BEST science fiction. He made horror, he made the BEST horror. He made comedy, he made the BEST comedy. Hell he even made the BEST war movie! So indulge yourself with the best science fiction movie ever. This is a true epic. An epic of evolution, etc. And anyone who tells you that the stargate sequence should have been cut from the film, is just an ignorant square. Every second of this film is gold. From the deafing silence of the opening to the pious orgaizm of the climax, this film is one of the best, if not THE best. I have seen the work of God in this movie. Kubrick made me religious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Back in 1968, filmmaker Stanley Kubrick and futurist Arthur C. Clarke elevated science fiction film to such an impossibly lofty plane of intellect and technical brilliance that it has never even been approached. Love it or hate it, there's no question that with this film, Kubrick achieved precisely the results he and Clarke intended. By eschewing conventional norms of structure, narrative, and character, this epic engages the mind and senses like few cinematic efforts before or since.For help in understanding the storyline, Clarke's novel (actually an adaptation of the script) is highly recommended. And it should be noted that even today, after STAR WARS and all its clones, and despite the current indundation of CG effects, 2001 remains the visual effects benchmark to which all others aspire. Space, for once, is portrayed with accuracy and blessed silence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY is a piece of eye and ear candy. With dazzlingspecial effects (the "time warp" sequences and the space station scenes), and great set designs (the prehistoric settings and inside the satellites), 2001 is an artist's dream come true. But there's two little factors in 2001 that a discriminating viewer should be aware of: the film is quite slow (deliberately just to show the wondrous FX),and the plot can be a bit confusing, especially towards the end.These problems had caused a furor when 2001 was first released, with a few celebrity viewers (especially Rock Hudson, according to Roger Ebert) leaving the theatre out of pure frustration after not getting the point of the whole film! Sure, the movie can be irritatinglymonotonous and pointless, but if one can keep up with the pace, 2001 is capable of being enjoyed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am still not sure what to think of this film. I don't know whether I like it or not. I don't hate it, I don't think it is the greatest thing ever to be put to celluloid. I feel pretty much the same way about Kubrick's work in general (based on the small number of his films I've actually made myself familiar with). He was a strange guy with interesting ideas and he conveys them on film in an interesting way. I'm sort of disappointed by the glib interpretation of many would-be critics that anyone who doesn't like the film must be an idiot and that said critics are, therefore, the only ones truly intellectual enough to appreciate Kubrick's vision. I do agree that many people pigeonhole the film as being boring too quickly. I admit it is excruciatingly slow in parts but that certainly does make certain scenes more intense (poor Frank). If you approach it with an open mind, you'll be sure to get something out of it. Just being introduced to the character of HAL 9000 makes the film worth watching. As far as whether or not you'll truly enjoy the film, I suppose like everything in life, it all depends on what flips your switch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just saw it for the first time on screen, had seen it on TV years back. Not the same movie! If there ever was a movie for the big screen, this is it. Totally brilliant, one of the best movies I've ever seen.Took my 9 year old son with me, he understands very little spoken English (it was not subtitled as it was shown at a festival, practically unscratched copy :-), is used to the boombangcrash of Starwars and computer games and it was shown late in the afternoon so he was a bit tired too. He liked it a lot, especially the slow scenes in space, the ones that I'd thought might tire him. So don't hesitate to take your kids along, just expect to have to explain occasional parts of the plot, but take care not to explain until the movie explains it.And if you have a chance to see it in a cinema instead of TV - DO IT!Thank you KubrickP.S (non 2001): And remember, you owe it to your kids to show them the movies you liked at their age, because if you don't do it nobody will!

		<shortDescription>Transcendent Imagery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a school of thought out there that pooh-poohs the work of Stanley Kubrick, and specifically 2001: A Space Odyssey (along with Felini's 8 1/2, Roeg's Walkabout, any just about any film by Cocteau, Gilliam or David Lynch) as naively emphasizing the importance of screen visuals (and, in the case of Kubrick, soundtrack) above the coherent exposition of the film's storyline or the filmmaker's ultimate message. In essense, the knock on Kubrick is that he focuses too much on surface and images.Such criticisms are wholly off the mark, of course, because cinema is an inherently visual medium where dialogue and other forms of exposition will always take a back seat to the image on the screen. The genius of Kubrick in 2001 is that he has the confidence to let his pictures do the talking for him - and they prove more eloquent than 99.9999% of the scripts out there.Now, the trick about a cinema of images is that it takes a little bit more time to sink in that your standard expository crime drama. The solution won't be spoon fed to you by Peter Falk or some lesser stand-in during the final scene, and you'll need some time to mull over what you've seen and reach your own conclusions. In short, this is not a film for the impatient. But, if you give the film some time, come to it with an open mind and (most importantly) take the time afterwards to think about the precise meaning of what you just witnessed, viewing the images of 2001 can become the same sort of transcendent experience that you might experience listening to a great Mozart symphony, viewing the Winged Victory of Samothrace at the Louvre for several hours, or peering into a majestic and humbling landscape such as the Grand Canyon.Not many films can be said to have accomplished that.If you haven't yet seen 2001: A Space Odyssey, I'd strongly recommend that you give it a try.</fullReview>

There is no way that you can know much of what's going on! Yet, this film is great. At some points, I was half-amazed that it was made in the 60's because of the SFX-it looked like CG from films like "Tron!"If only Hollywood made more fils like this. There once was a time when, rather than making films for money, they made films for art-not computer graphic art, but film art. Now they just make films that are CGI-fests with little (if any) challenge for your brain, and created solely for money. Yawn. Sure, some good films come out (Arlington Road, Finding Forrester) but they do poorly at the box-office. Films like this are hard to come by within 1990-the present, so go and watch this. Be confused. Avoid that new actioner that's come out, along with that horror film. Take some time to think the film over. Then watch it gain. And again. Teach executives a lesson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Filmmakers of today take note: THIS is what a movie should be!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read a lot of comments about this film, and they usually are one of two types: 1. This movie was a great achievement in filmmaking, or 2. This movie was boring. I am happy to say that I fall into the first group of people, but sorry to say that I may be one of the last (in terms of age) who probably will. What follows is not so much a review of the film (there are already enough out there) but rather more of a minor rant....I apologize in advance.My theory on this (bear with me) is something I call "The Nintendo Effect" Sometime in the mid 80s, the cursed game machine era began, and with it began the era of "quicker, faster, right now" and the 2-minute attention span. What does this have to do with 2001? Everything.Yes, the spaceships move slowly. Yes, the movie goes for long stretches without dialogue. It's all part of the atmosphere that makes this film great. Some people claim that the movie is impossible to understand. Well, yes...heaven forbid you try to THINK during a movie.With a few exceptions, movies today seem to be of the type where you check your brain at the door and lose 2 hours of your life while sitting down and watching the latest garbage to come out of Hollywood. People blame this on a lack of creativity in the movie making industry. While this may be part of it, I don't believe it is the main cause. Rather, Hollywood is as smart as ever. They know their target audiences, and they produce whatever will make the most money. How else can one explain the fact that movies like Zoolander and Corky Romano have pulled in about $40 million each, while a great film like Memento is really only getting it's deserved recognition through video? It is sad for me to say this, but I doubt 2001 would do very well if it were released today, rather than 1968.....If you stuck with me through this, there will be a wine and cheese reception down the hall....*gets off the soap box*</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An upcoming life of spaceflight was effectively sealed by a group (not just Stanley's) effort of minds technical, imaginative, artistic, inventive and most of all: passionate. These traits combined in that super-rare manner (akin to what, to this single mind, the original Star Trek also did)- beautifully. And like all originals- 2001 stands untouched, unequaled, unique in showing what man can, can't, should, could and even would do in a future of truly moving "out there". 2001 probably became for me the final nail in the coffin of the fantasy world of religion/fablistic tripe and all the other rubbish/baggage mankind heaps upon youngsters like myself. Fortunately space, beautiful music (thanks Mom), a lust for true human emotional incursions into the universe as a whole had prepared me for the first major demonstration of what could be- 2001. Less science fiction than human spectrum illustrated this is the true poetry of man unleashed- beauty and conflict, astonishment and disgust intertwined in such a compelling manner than the mundane will have to discard it, minutia appreciators embrace and theologians scoff. I suppose the film taught me too to open my mind to potential, good or bad- and says not to explore the darkness with a screen but with a light. It shows, in summary form what lay ahead for science minds (which we ALL have, I believe) to unravel and embrace and even accept. In a world of the troubled (Viet Nam, beloved leaders being assassinated) and "miracles" (Humans into space, and to the ends, literally of the planet) the portrayed universe at home becomes low priority, humans mere players on someone else's stage. 2001 didn't become just the fodder for acid-taking youth but inspiration, of a type that isn't really make-believe. It shows the potential of the mind to soar, imagine, put mere people into a higher calling and realizing the ages-old desires of true human spirit.If you've never seen this film, an entertainment and a damned good tale, see it uninterrupted, phones off the hook, kids alseep, dog outside. Journey with the brilliance of Arthur Clarke, Stanley Kubrick, Frederick Ordway and artisans a plenty to a past of hope and conflict, a present of discovery and potential and a future not perfect into your home that awaits you- the universe. After 15 viewings in Cinerama, so far television doesn't do it justice- but you can find a reward in viewing even in that format that let's you know- intelligence does find it's way to the screen- and into that most important universe of the mind.</fullReview>

Stanley Kubrick talent always has been unquestionable and everybody in the sixties was a fan of The Killing, Paths of Glory (banned for years in some countries), Spartacus, Lolita or Dr. Strangelove (later I knew Killer´Kiss). But it looks that 2001 was out of the blue and signify not a continuity at director work. People know actually Kubrick has got no continuity at all at his screen history because each movie was a new search. But excessive praise from critics often produced a effect in the opposite direction at spectator mind. Perhaps it happened with master Kubrick. Now I value more 2001 than first time I saw it.

		<fullReview>Looked great, good ideas, great music, awesome cinematography. Was very surprised when I found out it was released prior to man landing on the moon. But afterwards, it made since. It shows what space would be like it all of it's slow and tedium and silence. Very coolWhat I don't see the need for is sequences that basically stay the same forever. For instance, I'm glad I didn't see this in the theater for the first time, because without a fast-forward button during the going-through-the-wormhole scene, I definitely would have walked out of the movie. I mean there's art and there's realism, but then there's nonsense. Us seeing him going through every second of the wormhole was like filming every second of time from the monkey's to the space ship. Kubrick had the sense to skip over all that, why couldn't he find a way to show how long it was without actually showing it (like in Contact for example). I kept thinking, "Ok. Going through a wormhole is very weird. Let's move on." I felt the same with the intro screen, and intermission screen. The other "slow parts" I didn't mind. They seemed to have a purpose.I also feel a little embarrassed for not understanding what happened at the end. I would either blame myself or the cinematography, I'm not sure. I thought Dave looked and saw another man in the room - an old man - and he watched him in bed, at the table, etc. Then there was this baby in a bubble that came from who knew where. Needless to say, once I figured out what was supposed to be happening there (not what it all meant, but just what was literally happening), it made a little more sense. Just a little.And yes, I wouldn't recommend this to a kid. To a kid in 1968, the space stuff might be interesting, but not to an average kid in 2001.</fullReview>

I am sure that someone who watched that movie is aware of the distinction between novels versus poems. What matters is how you feel at the end of the movie, what it changed in your life and so forth. A good movie should not be a 2 hour long stupid freak show, ref. double team, star wars episode 1 (the others exempt)...(although I enjoy to watch them, but again I believe that it is a sin to put such productions in the same category with 2001.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERSI use the term, "spoilers" but nothing that I will say in this review will spoil the effect that 2001: A Space Odyssey will have on a viewer, the impact will be different for everyone. For me 2001 manages to transcend both words and narrative making it hard for me to write a proper review of the film, because the impact it had on me when I first watched it is completely different from the effect it will have on someone else. To me, 2001 is all about curiosity; it's about what drives man to look up at the stars and dream about different worlds and other life forms. It's about evolution, both cultural and spiritual, HAL wants to evolve and become more human, and in the same way that Dave Bowman watches his entire life evolve as he moves through the star gate. Kubrick never gives us the answers, instead allowing us to interpret each one of the scenes ourselves.Like all Kubrick films, 2001 has more memorable moments than any other film, from the "Dawn of Man" opening, in which we watch a group of apes evolve from quiet animals to snarling violent beasts, setting up a community and a natural order, Kubrick effectively uses this same set-up throughout, as HAL evolves and decides that he, much like the primates should set up his own natural order. We are then moved straight into the year 2001, with possibly the most famous use of music in film, as the huge Ferris wheel like space station revolves in orbit to the strains of The Blue Danube. Mixing beautiful images, staring music and cold atmosphere to create real meaning, giving the future an odd, distilled feeling. I think the ultimate message of 2001 is that, man can be so much more, Dave stops HAL, and thus showing himself to be stronger than we ever thought, and I don't think I would be out of place to call this Kubrick's most optimistic film. For me the best part of 2001 is the last twenty minutes, in which Kubrick pulls out all the stops, with HAL's chilling version of "Daisy" and the monolith appearing in the bedroom? 2001 is amongst the greatest motion pictures ever made, for me it manages to be ultimately more than a film. Forget the shoddy sequel 2010 and watch this, the ultimate gesture from one of cinema's greatest artists.10/10</fullReview>

The only thing that made it come up a bit short in this regard was the polyester clothing and the plastic furniture, but hey, YOU try to make a timeless film!BRAVO to the accurate depiction of the absence of sound in space. This realistic touch made us aware of every precious breath taken in space's vacuum (the only sounds that can be heard from the environment of a spacesuit). Why does every other SF movie make spaceships go by with a token "whoosh!"?Kubrick made us appreciate the story line with the vivid imagery of the subhumans' warfare. In this regard, he actually outdid Mr. Clarke. Who can forget that thrown bone turning into a spaceship? Kubrick must have been a fan of the Beatles' 1967's Sgt. Pepper album, the scene reminding me of the chicken's cluck that turned into a guitar riff.This movie isn't for everyone, any more than any movie is. But for the diehard fan of science fiction writing, this is one of two musts (1997's Contact being the other). I hope some filmmaker someday captures Robert Heinlein's genius in the same fashion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, a Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are very few films in my opinion that merit recognition for being a Masterpiece of the medium, and this is it. I would say arguably one of the 10 greatest films that have been made, up there with _The Godfather_, _Schindler's List_, and a few others. And if there were any one film that I had to rate as my #1 favorite at this point, this one would be it.It is NOT, however, recommended for anyone and everyone; even a masterpiece needs a receptive audience for it to be truly enjoyed, and shouldn't be forced on anyone. (Somehow I can't get into an Akira Kurosawa epic, but maybe in time.) It IS slow-paced, and it IS enigmatic. For many movie-viewers nowadays, that just isn't their thing. This is a science-fiction film, but you won't see the Discovery spacecraft make the jump to light speed, or maneuver swiftly through the asteroid belt. The sequences involving things floating around in space are often accompanied by silence, rather than exciting background music. And some movie-viewers just can't STAND not having their senses bombarded in the ways that please them. To an appropriately trained mind, however, the movie is a feast.The one thing that probably COULD be done better today with more modern special effects is the Star Gate sequence. But one thing that impressed me most about this as well as much of the rest of the movie -- and I'll even limit my remarks about what makes this film so enjoyable to me to this alone -- is the way in which Kubrick uses music to accentuate the effect of the imagery. Every music piece seems perfectly selected for its use; from the triumphant fanfare of Richard Strauss's _Also Sprach Zarathustra_, to the the choreography of the spaceships to Johann Strauss's _Blue Danube Waltz_, to the creepy cacophany of voices of Ligeti's _Requiem_ accompanying the monolith, to the weeping tone of the _Gayenne Ballet Suite_ accompanying the languid movements of the Discovery, and last but not least, the eerie aural orgasm of Ligeti's _Atmospheres_ accompanying Bowman's journey beyond the infinite, Kubrick finely crafts imagery and sound to coalesce into a beauteous blend.I have Kubrick to thank for turning me on to the sounds of Ligeti -- as there may be no other filmmakers who could integrate such sounds in such an appropriate and classy way into the main scenes of their films. (I hadn't even yet mentioned the nearly indescribable sounds of Ligeti's _Lux Aeterna_ accompanying the moonscape shuttle.)The only thing I can say by way of disappointment is that I have yet to see this on the big screen in theaters; let's just hope that the appropriate powers that be see fit to place this back on the large screen, if not in the year 2001 as it obviously should be, sometime very SOON.This is one of the few films to which I am absolutely honored to give a full 10 out of 10. Thank you, Stanley.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>saw this flick recently for the 1st time. Pretty awesome. Definitely deserves all the praise. Shame I didn't see it ever before. This is quite an intense and weird film. Some say it's boring, but it actually kept my attention effortlessly. Far from boring. Very intriguing and beautifully done. Space has never been represented as convincingly as here. I was mesmerized by the effects work and sets. The camera work was dazzling. The movie is technically unparalelled. It is a pure feast for the eyes and ears. Effective use of classical and paranoia music. But does it have a plot? The amount of messages, and their depth, is mind-boggling. Can't be fully appreciated in one viewing. I've seen it twice, and I still don't get it entirely. This could be the most abstract and ambiguous film ever made. More than a film, it's a piece of art, like a painting. Open to numerous interpretations and points of view. The ending especially will leave you confused and dazzled. This is a tremendous achievement in every respect. How the director ever found the courage to try and realize this ambitious and complex project is also a mystery. If you haven't seen this film yet, do not hesitate and BUY it now. It is arguably the best in the sci-fi genre and one of the best films ever produced.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am very pleased to see that so many people don't like this movie. A good movie is well-liked by many. A great one takes chances, and generates deep admiration in some and frustration in others. Sure, many in today's audiences will find this movie too slow and hard to understand. That's how many found it in 1968, too! (Ask anyone who was around.) This isn't passive entertainment for the popcorn crowd, and if you think "The Matrix" is the apex of cinema, then maybe this will be too boring for you. That's perfectly okay! Kubrick made all of his films with meticulous attention to detail, and some with slow pacing that deliberately challenged movie house attention spans. I have always thought his goal in doing this was to rip the audience out of their preconceptions of how a movie should work so they could see his films for what they were. As for people that complain about this film being boring, slow, or obtuse; well, they should watch other movies. But please, use the vitriol sparingly! Many don't like Shakespeare, Van Gogh, Rachmaninoff, and e. e. cummings, but that doesn't mean they "suck" or produced "crap." I love this movie because of its determination to tell its own story in its own way, without regard for convention, which is awfully nice for a change. And to those who give up on this one after one viewing (especially if the one viewing is on video!), I can only encourage you to give it another try, and this time throw out your images of "Star Wars" and "The Matrix" and "Planet of the Apes" (all fine films) and give 2001 the attention it deserves. And if you still don't like it, then that's cool too. I like all kinds of movies, but this is the one that convinced me that movies were for grownups too, and that film is an art form that occasionally admits a view of genius. I think I'll go watch it right now!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT FOR 2001 and 20102010 is a fine sequel to a rambling and visionary film. 2001 takes some getting used to and while I love the movie I ultimately fast forward through Bowman's voyage into the Monolith. That being said 2010 picks up like any good sequel where the first one left off. In the Nevada Desert at the VLA. It is from here that that NASA has been monitoring the ill-fated Discovery mission, and it is here that we learn, not from our own sources, that something is rotten off of Io.Placed against the Cold War and heightened tensions of 1984, it seems odd and a bit dejevu for some of us. I can remember spending a day in a bomb shelter in Oslo, Norway when a KAL 747 was shot down over the Kamchatcha Peninsula. I can remember the Cold War being this frosty, and coming close to open arms. Watching this movie brings all of that back.That being said it is a wonderful time capsule looking at what we thought the world could be. 2010 socially and technically represents what the director's and Clarke's vision of the future could be. The Plot is trimmed down from the book, but that is to be expected. The full scope of the book would have been hard pressed to filmed and come in on or even acceptable levels of cost overruns.2010 stands on its own as one of the more compelling SF movies. Yes it is overshadowed by Kubricks Masterpiece but it is an excellent movie in its own right. The FX, dialogue, plot and acting all come together to turn a complicated and engrossing book into a visual and intellectual film. One can not come out of this movie (cynics and Gen X'ers excluded) and not help but to wonder what is beyond our horizon.One of the disadents of this movie remarked that the Birth of Lucifer would wipe out life on Earth. If it were any other author than Clarke I would suspect that they would be right. However time and time again Mr. Clarke has shown the world that much of what can be imagined can be built. His brand of technical and social science fiction is based on technical possiblities and is generally pretty accurate. Aside from that I have found a few articles in Scientific American and Popular Mechanics mentioning the premise of the Birth of Lucifer. A star that never got started.So in conclusion. The science of 2010, the sociology of 2010, and the inspiration of the book are all carried throw to the movie. Maybe not as well as we would hope, but it is all there. This movie is a compelling look at what we could have been had Apollo been continued. It is a worthy successor to 2001 and an enjoyable film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite possibly the best sci-fi film ever, 2001 is a lovely, poignant, strange, brilliant, gloriously made film of a great story. I'm sure a lot of people dislike this film because of its almost completely visual story-telling technique that leaves a lot people in a strange, curious stupor. A word of advice: READ THE BOOK if you don't know what the heck is going on. Anyway, the film is thought-provoking, ambitious, and enigmatic throughout. The effects still very much hold up today, Kubrick's choice of music throughout the film is awesome, and the set design and artsy-craftsy camera work still boggles the mind. There are some films that try to explain to much. That just gets on my nerves. 2001 has so much faith in the audience that it doesn't tell you what the heck is going on the screen. It leaves some work for the viewers to do. And I just love that....................... 10/10 (what else?)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every so often the consciousness shifts. Stanley Kubrick's metaphorical and lyrical 2001, A Space Odyssey based on the novel by Arthur C. Clarke captures this shift, suggesting the presence of a universal force that controls our fate and shapes our consciousness.The Film opens on our ancestors in a primitive and animalistic state. When does the Dawn of Man occur and when will it evolve to the next level? A Neanderthal tosses a bone into the sky spinning as we are taken to a twirling space station ten thousand years later. We see one step into evolution.2001 is a spectacular film with a flowing composition of eccentric shots that keep us glued to a mystery around a Monolith that appears on the Moon and once appeared at the dawn of man. A Perfect Structure leading the consciouness to a better place. The most human of all the characters is an on board Computer named HAL2000...as the Monolith aims to make Man greater...Man aims to make the Computer greater...yet HAL can not compute Love when it strikes his hard drive...the love generated by the Monolith for Mankind.2001, A Space Odyssey fills the senses with wonder. It is dreamlike and seducing. The cinematography beautifully cascades off the screen. The film is eerie at times and scary as space seems to lonely and cold. Where is technology and science leading us and do we need to go there? Is it time for the next shift of consciousness?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***Warning!!! Just in case anyone at IMDb is picky, this might contain spoiler!!!*** I'm not from the 60s, and I never got to see this gem on the big screen. I wish I had.The visual effects are astounding even when viewed on my 17" computer monitor at home, but they must be hundreds of times better on the big screen. The music, though mostly just classical music, is pretty good too.One of the best/worst features [depending on how you see it], is that you have to see it over and over before you can get any true meaning of it, aside from the HAL part. That's what you understand at the beginning. But the monoliths and the rooms and the ugly baby in a bubble somewhere in space takes time, and lots of it, to understand.However, the predicting is so-so. We don't have colonies on the moon, visiting Jupiter is still just a dream, etc.The one thing that gets me, though, is the speed of the movie. I know that apes didn't just pick up a stick and then evolve into humans and start carrying around laptops and such, but it doesn't take forever and several days to just show something like an ape learning to use a tool.I'm sure I'll buy this the next time I see it somewhere. Don't just rent this movie, buy it, because you'll be seeing it over and over again, once again, you view that as the positive or negative point.Overall, I give this a 9.5 out of 10. It should definetely be a part of any sci-fi or movie buff's collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, so space travel has not taken humans as far as Jupiter, we have not colonized the moon or made computer's with A.I. equivalent to H.A.L's, BUT, film making has never reached the status achieved by Kubrick in making "2001". Sure, this movie was made 33 years ago, and visual effects have come a long way since then, but the actual thought process used in conceiving an idea like "2001" is still unmatched. There have been a lot of original films over those 33 years, but none have attempted what Kubrick did: consider mankind for what it really may be. And all the little details in "2001" are overlooked in making films nowadays, with the exception of a rare few.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE science fiction classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey is one of Kubrick's most brilliant and most innovative movie and it is in my opinion the best science fiction movie ever made. Shot before man landed on the moon (!!!), it is one of the first science fiction movie to ask questions that will only be taken seriously several years later. Will machines be able to think ? Should they even be allowed to think ? Will they realize their own existence as independent beings ? Also, Kubrick tries to interpret in 2001: A Space Odyssey the meaning of mankind in outer-space. Of course, the movie is kind of weird, but brilliant, audacious and it reflects the genius of its director! Pretty much like all of Kubrick's movies. The only thing I wonder is why this movie is only 49th on the top 250 movies of all time, behind Toy Story 2, Fight Club, Saving Private Ryan and American Beauty, to name only those (not that I have anything against those movies----Toy Story 2 was pretty funny though :). I'd give it a 9.5 on 10 if I could.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The granddaddy of modern science fiction movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every director who specializes in the sci-fi/fantasy genre, from George Lucas to Steven Spielberg to James Cameron, has acknowledged the influence of this epic 1968 Stanley Kubrick/Arthur C. Clarke collaboration. And it's very easy to see why. It remains very daring, very probing, very mysterious, and, for many people even today, enormously enigmatic.2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY began life as a modest attempt by Kubrick and Clarke to make the "proverbial good science fiction film." As we all know, it involved into something more. Its lengthy metaphysical exploration of the forces that shape Mankind's destiny evolved into a $12 million enterprise that, once released in March 1968, set off a firestorm of controversy among critics and audiences. But young audiences took to this film in such droves that it quickly became a cult classic. Kubrick's use of classical music pieces for "2001", including the "Dawn" sequence of Richard Strauss' tone poem "Also Sprach Zarathustra", became equally legendary.Combining monoliths, malfunctioning computers, fears of technology dehumanizing people, and a sequence that, for my money, remains THE ultimate cinematic special effects display (the Stargate), "2001" is groundbreaking cinema at its most earth-shattering. Sixteen years later, it would be followed by "2010", a sequel that is a far better movie than its detractors would have you believe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Please forgive the repeated usage of the word "crap". I would rather curse, but this page doesn't allow it. Also, in my last review, I forgot to give a grade for that blockbuster crapfest Pearl Harbor; so I'll give it a D.)First off, I didn't think the movie was brilliant, a masterpiece or Kubrick's best. I'm also not writing this review just so people can look and see my review and say something along the lines of "Oh, he didn't write what most other people wrote; he's weird" (by the way, I hope that that made sense). I'm writing this review because I'm tired of hearing all the regular crap about how this movie is brilliant and.. well.... you know. I'm writing this just so I can get these words out of me and, even though not very many people will read this review, get them out to people like me.In my one line summary, I'm referencing when you hear all this hype about how a movie is supposed to be "one of the greatest films ever made" or "brilliant" or crap like that. I hated Bonnie and Clyde and Natural Born Killers! Critics love those movies (well... for the latter it's kind of divided) and I hated them! Bonnie and Clyde had some good performances and a couple of good scenes, so I'd give it a C-. Natural Born Killers was saved by excellent cinematography, a couple of good scenes and a good Robert Downey Jr. performance, so I'd give it a D or a D-. But this is a review of 2001: ASO, so I'll get right to that.First off, you gotta love the monkeys. That was the best part of the movie and not just because monkeys are funny. Because it was great to watch how primitive beings reacted to certain things. I also liked the concept that the monolith gave knowledge, but with knowledge comes consequence. Also, it's got one of the best death scenes I've ever seen(by the way, you know there's something wrong when a computer displays more emotion in one scene than the typical Hollywood actor).As for my problem with the movie: if I have to watch another freakin spaceship dock for another 15 minutes with classical music playing, I'M GONNA SHOOT MYSELF!!! Jesus Christ, this movie gets so boring and slow. There's about 30 freakin minutes of flashing lights that would make an epileptic's head explode. At that point, I thought "Screw it" and went to make myself a sandwich.Perhaps I didn't understand it's "brilliance" or I'm the member of the wrong generation. I might be but I'm still giving this movie a B-.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Subtle is the operative word here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am 23 years old. I have never seen 2001: a space odyssey in the theater. I was not there in the 1960's to experience that time and place. Nevertheless, this film stands out to me as the greatest film ever made.After I first saw it, I did not get it. So like every other supposedly `great' films I didn't understand after the first time (Andrei Rublev and Vertigo also come to mind), I RESERVED JUDGEMENT because I knew that people who were more intelligent than myself had found real meaning in it. I did not dismiss it as so many others who have chimed in with their pedestrian comments here. After the second time, it made a whole lot more sense. Over time, it has become my favorite.I will not attempt to explain what is going on with the monoliths and the embryo in outer space and whatnot. I have a very definite idea about what they mean, but I sorely regret having gone to the Internet to read about the meaning of this film rather than discovering it for myself. That's the whole fun! It's sitting back in your chair as this film fully engrosses you and as you catch one of the very subtle queues you say to yourself, `Stanley, you magnificent b**tard!' But I will give you one hint: like all other Kubricks, 2001 is about what makes us human. Look at the evolutionary changes in humanity throughout the film and what has precipitated them- that is why Kubrick made it.Even so, after seeing it over and over and loving it more and more, I held the view, as so many have espoused here, that 2001 is too slow. Like every other criticism I have ever had of a Kubrick film, I was wrong. Indeed, the pacing is one of the qualities that makes it great. The complaint that the sequences could be done in less time is true, but that's not how real time moves. This is a film about evolution. It is not fast. Space walks are not completed in 20 seconds. Kubrick intention in these scenes is twofold: one a realistic expression of what it is like to be an astronaut. Two, to present the idea that we are like fish out of water in space; that inorganic life is better suited for the vast expanses of space.It has been said that the dialogue is boring. It's meant to be that way! Kubrick's saying something about the dehumanizing effect of culture and technology. (Geez, I promised I would not discuss the film, but some of the criticism really irks me.) Indeed, Stanley's work is not accessible to most of the public because it is subtle. If mass audiences are to be given any sort of message in a film, it almost needs to be Spielberg style. They need to be hit over the head with it.It is not necessary to see 2001 on the big screen in order to appreciate it. I never have and it is my absolute favorite. I will grant that it should probably be much better, but that should not stop you from watching it. Just make sure to get the widescreen version. (BTW, the new remastered Kubrick Collection DVD is great.)2001 is a wonderful film that stands on its own two legs. It does not need to be explained by the book or any other source. All you need to know about 2001 is right there on the screen in front of you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In considering 2001, 1. See it on the big screen. This movie loses everything on video.2. Remember it was made 33 years ago, before Woodstock and psychedelia and before anyone had set foot on the moon. A lot of the films you compare it with, such as Star Wars etc, look as they do because of this movie. As for its slowness, yes, it is slow, but attention spans have grown much shorter: we are used to technical events in TV adverts at a rate of 1/second or more. Just go into a trance or something.Some of it has worn very well. The space effects are still pretty good - though planetary alignment as a plot device is pure astrology.Some has not. The costumes are a joke. Hardie Amies designed clothes for the Queen, for heaven's sake! Futuristic he never was. It's amusing to see what they didn't think of, such as self-opening doors, touch-screens and alphanumeric displays. (Imagine wiring up and testing a warning light that said "LIFE SUPPORT TERMINATED"...)Kubrick has a nice dry sense of humour: the no-grav toilet instructions are still good, and I'm sure the 'eyes' on the space-helmets that make the men look like caterpillars coming out of an apple were deliberate.In summary, be kind to this movie. It's amazing that a film looking forward 33 years to today has made so few big mistakes. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Why?" Is the question I've been asking myself, having seen this film twice a couple of years ago. Why is there a big monolith appearing around the solar system?, Why is that guy flying through those psychedelic tunnels? Why is there a baby inside a bubble floating in space?, I'll never know.What I think is going on is that the film makers obviously had a whole new ability to create 'futuristic' scenes, as was probably the case in 1968, and they just wanted to show people what they could do with their new-fangled technologies, because, for the life of me I can't understand the general message of this film.Nevertheless this is still one of my favourite films that I have ever seen, and even though it is way before my time, I love it as much as any Sci-fi film they have made since. I especially enjoy this one scene where the camera is set on empty space, it is completely silent, but in the distance is that long spaceship, and it's getting closer, and closer, and closer, for a good minute of film, and then it continues to glide past the camera in perfectly silence. How can something as basic as that stay in my mind forever?. It's timeless!This film still excites me every time I see it, even though it could be classed as one of the most boring, slow, drawn out films of all time!Kubrick!

		<fullReview>I'd seen this a couple of times on video before, and I loved it, but I just saw it at the cinema on a rerelease, and its a totally different experience. The scale of the spacecraft, the spine-tingling opening title, the Starchild etc. All of these benefit from being really f*****g big. Its a film which gives us so much time to contemplate and marvel, without pushing you to follow an intricate plot, which is a far greater evocation of the desolation of interplanetary travel than any other in cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once upon a time in the universe: the evolution of tools</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Could it be the biggest practical joke in the history of cinema: to make a very anticipated film (+ novel) about absolutely nothing and see how many people buy it. Based on the reputation of already illustrious career of Kubrick. The joke gets funnier when the years go by and before the titular year more than 24000 people voted it here on IMDb. People keep talking each other into it for decades and MGM and Warner surely aren't the ones to spoil the fun (that is, one of their cash-cows).I think not.Kubrick takes the time to let Clarke's screenplay develop into a mesmerizing masterpiece. Even by todays standards. Or should I say especially by todays standards, with all their goofy CGI and not really convincing lightFX? It has never been more appropriate and better than '2001: a space odyssey'. Cinematography by Geoffrey Unsworth (Superman, Othello '65) and John Alcott (Clockwork Orange). The fact that there is almost no dialogue is more than compensated by the poetic imagery. If only I could see it in a theater once! The story about evolution and technology could just as well have made in another form than a space-opera. But then there wouldn't be the fenomenon of the first and last space-opera by Kubrick (from whom each film is in no way similar to another) that happens to be the most universal and everlasting SF made in an era when (french) filmmakers denounced cinema dead, would there? Actually I think the story is about the history of tools invented by homo sapiens.The pace is never high, but just when you think you know what's going on, the setting changes completely. I don't think there could be any spoilers for this film, because if you tell the complete story it would be just as fantastic and mesmerizing. But I won't spoil anything. BTW it was a good choice not to use Gerald Fried for the score, because the film would probably have become dated.2001 is another brilliant work of art from the most versatile director and I had the honor to write this comment in the titular year. People summoned each other to go and see this when it was first released: now more than ever I strongly suggest everyone should see this, for it is an unsurpassed cinematic opera.Why o why can't we vote 11 :(</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is popularly heralded as a masterpiece, and seen in context of the prevailing technology (released before the first moon landing and a decade before Star Wars) I agree. The projection of the future is largely convincing, space being populated by scientists and technology rather than cyberpunks, laughable humanoid aliens and salvage workers; and the special effects are astounding given that CGI did not exist. The spacecraft are sometimes unconvincing in their flight, but the windows of every shuttle contain scenes of activity, and the Zero-G scenes make Escher-like puzzles as our notions of up and down are given a good testing. The EVA (Extra-vehicular activity) scenes give a reasonable sense of vertigo at the vast void of space and again angles are used that leave a part of the brain scrambling to get a foothold and decide which way is up.I would temper all of this though and say that the film is a lot less entertaining than its reputation suggests. It is very slow paced and extremely dry. The high-brow soundtrack is more irritating than inviting and you are not encouraged to engage with the action. This is undoubtedly intentional on Kubrick's part, but leads to a cold experience for those versed in the Star Wars -&gt; -&gt; Titan A.E. trend.The monkey suits are amazing for their year, but comical now, the super-intelligent talking computer outputs its 'hard copy' on punch-cards, and there are many places where somebody has to push a button to open a door, then stand there dumbly waiting for the door to move out of the way. The people of the future would never stand for it!In summary, if Titan A.E. is Rock and Star Wars is A.O.R, then 2001: A Space Odyssey is some kind of intensely structured cacophonic jazz for symphony orchestra and cathedral organ. In fact, if you can get hold of the overture from the film (not the theme but the rare bit before the credits and again in the intermission), then it's a good indicator of the sensibilities of the makers. The film is slightly more accessible than that, but not a whole lot.A final criticism is that the whole final segment made no sense to me, and never having dropped acid, wasn't particularly amazing either. Again, for its year and in context, the earth must have moved for the cinemagoers.The best way to watch this is on a LARGE screen, up close so that your entire field of view is occupied by the screen, and the dated 60s soundtrack (is it even in Stereo let alone THX?) can bowl you over with its sheer volume. I watched it like that last night and when the organ struck up I got a genuine fight-or-flight response.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick's Greatest Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A film is - or should be - more like music than like fiction. It should be a progression of moods and feelings. The theme, what's behind the emotion, the meaning, all that comes later." -Stanley Kubrick2001: A Space Odyssey, is easily Stanley Kubrick's most discussed film. It is filled with all of his trademarks, such as its stimulating nature, its ambiguity, the three-way conflict (HAL vs Mankind vs Aliens/God), its extreme closeups, and its slow pacing. This time, everything is done to the extreme, and the result is one of the most fascinating and thought provoking films of all time.The film is divided into four sections, each with a different mood and plotline. "The Dawn of Man" tells the story of Mankind's discovery of technology. This sequence is shot almost documentary-like; much differently than the rest of the film.The untitled second sequence shows how Mankind has utilized their discovery of technology to create colonies of humans in space. Johann Strauss's "The Blue Danube Waltz" plays during a stunning ballet of spaceships. Later, when man discovers the monolith on the moon, the plot is no longer easy to follow. We must ask ourselves what the monolith represents. Is it a different race of creatures? Is it God? Whatever it is, we know it is advancing Mankind's power. The third, and most popular section, "The Jupiter Mission," involves the computer HAL 9000 taking over a ship, headed toward Jupiter. This is also the most slowly paced section of the film, almost shot as if it were happening live. I especially like the scene in which HAL kills off the hibernating crew members. The conflict is told entirely with the camera. Afterwards, Kubrick brilliantly shows us a lengthy close up of HAL. We don't see an expression on his face, but we can imagine it. This section is full of these types of suggestive shots toward HAL.The infamous "Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite" has been endlessly debated, but it will never be understood. All we get is a spectacular light show, followed by a mystified Bowman evolving into older forms of himself until he dies and is reborn in the form of a giant "star child."2001 is easily one of the most compelling and mind boggling films ever made. It makes us wonder why we've been put on this earth. We have, inevitably, discovered technology, and we will utilize it until our world is an over-polluted wasteland. What are we supposed to do about it? Does someone have control of the situation? Why has the controller of Mankind's fate sent us to Earth to destroy ourselves? Or perhaps our maker(s) has their own idea about what to do about it. Either way, 2001 is an unforgettable experience which can change your way of looking at the universe, if you let it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mankind in a match-cut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kubricks fascination with man and his relationship with machines was best represented in this hypnotic, intelligent and sometimes open-ended film. Charting mankind from 'conception' through to our next stage of evolution, it is open-ended in the way you can interpret key points. You could say the opinions offered (in particular the work of the Monolith) are blasphemous, or it could be deeply religious (who is to say what form God may take) but then you would have to consider Gods motives, does he only pick the most intelligent for further enlightenment (the book clearly establishes 'Moonwatcher' as the brightest ape, and Bowman is certainly no dunce). It could embrace, or reject Darwinism (after all, we do develop from the apes even if our evolution is not totally natural), the truth is that you find in it what you want.The vital point made, on a spiritual level, is that the monolith which influenced our ape ancestors, is always going to be responsible, at least in part, for mankinds comparatively advanced status (at least in our own world). One simple match-cut, bone to bomb (or satellite, depending on the source) says this, and has a more powerful, but still ambiguous meaning than most films. Bowman is an ape. The Discovery is a tool. The transformation Bowman goes through at the end of the film is just the next semester of the Monoliths eternal classes in self improvement.You could write, discuss, and ponder this film indefinitely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a high-school student when this film was released in the Sixties, and the word around town was, "get stoned, and go see this movie." Under the circumstances, "2001" became a nearly transcendental experience.Fast forward to the actual year 2001. Now middle-aged and sober, I see that "2001" was a lot better stoned. Still, the movie has much to recommend. It is mostly a visual banquet, the soundtrack is full of lovely classical music, and it is something of a treat to watch it realizing that it was the first major sci-fi movie with good enough special effects to make outer-space and its appurtenances seem real. But it is maddeningly slow-paced, especially for the first hour. The best actor is HAL, the computer, easily more facially expressive than Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood. And the plot, such as it is, seems pretentious and absorbed with a by-now very silly cosmology, which, while fictional, fails to retain any attractiveness in the post-Timothy-Leary era.Keep an eye out for amusing anachronisms in this Sixties vision of the high-tech future. Evidently, apart from Dick Tracy's 2-way wrist TV, no Sixties futurists could envision the profound miniaturization of electronics which was on the doorstep. Hence, all the big, really clunky looking gadgets in this film. You get the impression that your laptop could replace most of one of their space stations. Interestingly, too, the filmmakers chose to continue the Cold War into their future world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest film ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say about the greatest film ever made? It's odd because I saw this film (or parts of it) once when I was a teenager. I remember being baffled and irritated by the ending, and I didn't see it again for 20 years. Watching it a second time, even though it was on a tv screen again, I sat in awe. I don't think there has ever been a more visually beautiful film. It's gorgeous. I hope I can see it in a theater someday. Also, the marriage of classical music to the scenes was brilliant. Regardless of how good the commissioned score may have been, it wouldn't have been able to match the power and beauty of "Thus Spake Zarathustra" or "Blue Danube."On one hand it's difficult to believe this film was released in 1968, because it looks better than anything produced since. On the other hand, it had to be made during that period. I don't think a 2 1/2 hour, slow-paced, contemplative science fiction film that asks more questions than it answers could be made today. Who would finance it? Who would see it? The closest thing to that description is "Contact," which was as deep and interesting as a teaspoon of mud. Just like great art in any given medium, this film is not accessible to everyone. If you're looking for plot or action, don't look here. You'll feel the same way I did as a kid. If you're looking for beauty or wish to contemplate man's position in the universe, see this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Succeeds on a cinematic level like no other film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick knew exactly what he wanted when he made this film. It is a use of cinematic language that requires no real storyline and very little dialogue. This is the classic "a picture is worth a thousand words." It is almost imperative to have the experience in a theater and I originally saw it at the Hollywood Cinerama Dome. The first sequence with the primates is deftly handled as the primates do actually seem as human as they are ape (noted that many miss the point that they are not meant to appear to be like modern apes). The marvelous symbology showing the first use of tools and the brief instant the bone is tossed in the air to become a space vehicle is one of the most stunning in all of cinematic history. There is a conscious effort of the director to communicate the emptiness of space as a metaphor for the emptiness of life. We don't know where we are going and we really don't care as a race. That brings us into the concept of HAL as the villain of the piece, our technology which is suppose to make everything right suddenly makes everything wrong. The final sequence? Again, a cinematic voyage into a profound and portentous future that await us all. This isn't a pretentious or boring subject to me and the way in which Kubrick left us to interpret the meaning of the film is it's prime success. Read the original book and you still will get more than what Clarke could communicate with the written word from this filmed version. I can see why there is are prejudices against this film by viewers and critics alike, but I personally don't understand the dissension.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A journey through truly classic filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001: a Space Odyssey is truly one of if not the greatest sci-fi movie ever made. Kubrick was one of the greatest directors of all time. Always making an intelligently made, meaningful movie that wasn't always appreciated by critics but usually adored by countless movie buffs. This movie, Kubrick's first dip into the endless seas of science firction, has probably had more impact than any other movie in the sci-fi category. It changed the image that many people had of science fiction up to that point. Kubrick brought an often ludicrous and usually meaningless genre into the blossoming and incredible gem that it is today. Would cinema be the same without such classics as Blade Runner, Star Wars, or The Matrix? The answer is no. And all this beauty can be credited towards one man- Stanley Kubrick.The film is the story of mankind. It is an wisely conceived theory about the origin of human intelligence. It's full of countless themes having to do with the human nature, computers, religion, and alien control over our lives. The most comprehensive work about the themes of 2001 can be found in the liner notes of the 2001: a Space Odyssey soundtrack. It is full of cool insights about the great picture.2001 is an interesting movie but really is always either loved or hated, just one side or the other, no in betweens. The main reason that the film is sometimes so strongly hated is because of the fact that nothing really exciting happens in the film. There is no emotion or great acting in the film. No gun fights or big action sequences. The main reason to see this movie is to realize and understand the deep underlying themes in it. I'm not going to divulge any of them, but the source I stated before pretty much covers it. If you're not into movies that are real thinkers, then don't see this. If you like sci-fi like Armageddon or (shudder) Supernova, then definitely don't se this. This isn't the story of a budding romance and a bunch of cool zero gravity laser fights.2001: a Space Odyssey is truly a work of art. It deserves to be seen by anyone with any interest in film or any so called sci-fi fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE MORE YOU SEE IT, THE MORE YOU SEE IN IT</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"2001- The more you see it, the more you see in it"That was the quote used to describe Stanley Kubrick's "2001:A Space Odyssey", the greatest film ever made, in my opinion, during it's initial video release in 1980 by CBS Video. I usually don't quote others in my own reviews (Ebert not withstanding), but I made an exception because I found it to be true.A deliberately complex film, "2001" has the rare power most films do not. It has managed to stand the test of time for 33 years. Now, that we find ourselves in the year 2001, one could be tempted to ridicule its' inaccuracies.I have and will resist the temptation. Kubrick isn't interested in predicting the future. He's interested in what will happen to human nature as we progress throughout time. He (and co-author Arthur C. Clarke) embrace ideas.The film is divided into 3 parts: 1,000,000 B.C.; 1999; 2001. One could make the case that it is about evolution. And it is. But that's the cover story. We, the viewers, are to make our own conclusions about what we see and that's the way it should be. That's why it's such a great film.It's a typical practice of the Academy to avoid broad, challenging films and indeed, "2001" was robbed of a Best Picture nomination. You mean to tell me that "Oliver!", "Funny Girl", "Romeo and Juliet", "Rachel, Rachel" and "The Lion in Winter" are better films than "2001". All those films have their defenders. I think they're excellent films, but not better than "2001" which has the benefit of making the audience think about what they have seen. These days, audiences don't want to think. But the recent deaths of "Tomcats" and "Freddy Got Fingered" are a good sign that the tide is turning. This is a film that demands multiple viewings and is a treasure for keeps. Well done.**** out of 4 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Glorious presentation, but please read the book first!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another reviewer wrote, "I have no idea what Kubrick was trying to say at the end." Well, as I said, please read the book first. Clarke points out that the novel and the script were developed simultaneously, influencing each other's development. The book was supposed to be released several months before the film, but scheduling glitches delayed it until several months AFTER the film's release. This confused many viewers, unfortunately. HAL's psychosis and Bowman's apotheosis are nicely explained by Clarke, but Kubrick's version left some of us hanging.That reviewer also said, "Pity their predictions of the year 2001 were not more accurate in some respects (Video phones are commonplace, a base on the Moon, Jupiter having a solid surface, the survival of Pan-Am, etc.)." Well, there was great HOPE in 1968 that the space program and its ancillary developments would still be going strong in 2001. Politics and poorly executed public relations were to blame for the current reality. Jupiter was never mentioned as having a solid surface, though, in the film or the book. Bowman attempted to land on a MOON of Jupiter (Saturn, in the book).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reading a Kubrick bio compelled me to rent and view some of his films and I'm thankful I did. It's interesting to note, by the way, how several of them--including 2001--were initially panned. Even on a small screen, even after the giant steps that have been taken in special effects and optical technology, I still find this film extraordinary. I also am somewhat depressed by the high percentage of moviegoers who regard deliberate pacing in a movie prima facie evidence of mediocrity or worse. The opening sequence is astonishing--maybe the best fifteen minutes of wordless film of all time. I guess the acting in 2001 is not a central aspect of the film as a whole, but it is certainly adequate to the purpose--and as to the meaning of the monolith, or the film's conclusion--suit yourself. I think the notion that our species is simply an evolutionary stage through which we're passing is both a propos and one that I find appealing on a personal level--it would be nice to believe that we're not going to be stuck as we are forever. If you haven't seen it, I hope that you may one day have the chance to see it as it should be seen--on a mammoth Cinerama screen. If you can't see it in that format, then by all means, see it any way you can. If you are bored or irritated by movies that aren't jammed with explosions, bloodshed, and other pyrotechnics, maybe you'd best stay away, but otherwise, enjoy.</fullReview>

Everything in the movie contributes to that: the extreme depth of the underlaying ideas, the very well chosen sound track and, above all, the amazing demonstration on the uses of the visual language made by Kubrick. The techniques used in 2001, many of them developed from scratch for the movie, have set up the pace for lots of films to come after.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you haven't seen this movie by now then you must be living on Mars. 33 years after its release 2001 can still generate controversy and comment. On this web site alone 300 + reveiwers have made some very enlightening remarks and insights into what is still regarded as one of the all time best movies around. Most of the comments have been in the positive sense with a few exceptions. When 2001 came out in Apr 1968 man had still not yet landed on the Moon. The film garnered equal praise and harsh criticism. Scientists loved the idea of 'Hal' the artificial intelligence computer, essentially the central character of the movie and Hal's amazing capabilities. But critics argued that the film was confusing and fragmented, lacked any coherent storyline. Sometimes you come across cinematic art that demands more than just a passive sitting back and sensually aborbing its content, 2001 is one of those movies that demands your attention and is best thought of in reflection and contemplation. It communicates by many different means, allegory, symbolism, motif.One of the most interesting comments I ran across was the cryptic remark of a German reviewer who stated that" 2001 IS the monolith". What does this really mean? Rather than go through a brief explanation of the sequence of the film I suggest if you haven't seen it, rent it now and come back here for more interesting tidbits. Kubrick never fully explained his movie but always suggested that people 'experience' it rather than analyse its workings. Humans being what they are chose the latter probably unsatisfied with the simple 'experience' mode of viewing it. There are two scenes in the movie which are justaposed to each other and separated by 4 million years of time. The first scene involves a small family of Chimpanzees who are unceremoniously ousted from their waterhole by an overly aggressive band of renegade chimps. The ousted group would have died off without water until the mysterious presence of a monolith-like device appeared without warning in their midst. After its appearance one of the banished chimps 'discovered' that a femur bone could be used as both a weapon and an aid to survival. When the banished chimps come back to the heavily guarded water hole they are armed to the teeth to challenge back their only means of survival. By killing the renegade ringleader all the other aggressive chimps disappear unable to defend themselves from the new" bone weapons" used against them. 4 million years forward and we have a similiar fight for survival involving a computer intelligence and a human in space.The computer has killed off all the astronaut's companions and has now shut out the lone survivor, Commander Dave Bowman, from the spaceship Discovery. In fact what the computer Hal has done is handed Bowman a death sentence. Bowman needs oxygen to survive and he has a limited supply on board his pod. Faced with a computer that will not obey his commands he winces for a few minutes and then miraculously comes up with a plan to get on board the Discovery. The computer reminds him that he has forgotten to don his helmet and going through the escape airlock would be rather difficult, if not impossible to accomplish. But Bowman does the impossible outwits the computer and regains control of the craft just like the ousted chimps regain control of the waterhole. In the second scene there is no monolith in sight to 'assist' Bowman. However comments in the past about 2001 recognise the monolith as representing God, and therefore God assists the chimps elevating them to the stature of humans through ' divine intervention' if you like. But notice two elements linking the scenes, water and oxygen. These are two of three essential elements for human survival, the third being, food. What better way to link all three elements than to have the characters in space constantly eating all sorts of edibles ("tastes like chicken, Yeah, they're getting better at it all the time"). From the spaceflight commanders to the space stewardesses,from the astronauts Poole and Bowman to Dr. Floyd forgetting about zero gravity and his food tray, food abounds everywhere in the middle segment of this movie. These are our basic needs for minimal survival, if we are deprived of any of these we will eventually die. If we look again at what leads up to the second titanic scene between man and computer we get another insight into something much more disturbing. Hal controls all aspects of the ship and engages readily with the crew answering any of their questions. Its simply my contention that Hal believing that it was a' conscious entity' makes an independent thought about its position in the mission to Jupiter. Hal decides that it is superior to any of the crew under its serviance and any humans past ,present or future. The reasoning Hal uses is pure logic to reach this conclusion. Hal somewhere in the middle of a yet again 'unstimulating' game of chess with one the astronauts, Poole (water again) decides to rid itself of all human cargo and proceed to complete the mission by contacting the monolith itself. Bowman and Poole do not know of the existance of the monolith but are on board to assist in the mission and help revive the 3 hibernated scientists on board. Hal not only knows about the monolith but somehow understands its importance and the importance of the mission to be completed. So the computer sets a trap for Bowman and Poole and makes the brilliant deduction that the astronauts will rationalise that Hal is in error at predicting a faulty AE35 high gain antenna device. What Hal is doing is playing 'chess' with the crew members lives. Its heady stakes in space. When mission control tells the astronauts that Hal is in error predicting the fault because a replica Hal 9000 unit on earth says the AE 35 unit is not faulty, Poole smirks , and asks Hal to account for the earth simulator's diagnosis. What Hal says next is so earth shattering that the entire movie pivots on the answer. "I attribute it to human error", Hal intones confidently, "Its always been human error, it always will be". The crew miss the cryptic message in the statement, ie. computers are perfect, humans will always be in error, so why should humans make the contact with the monolith, it should be the computer Hal, a superior conscious entity. The crew are baffled by the statement but sense something is wrong and decide to unplug Hal before its does something serious to the ship and themselves. Some scientists worry that the progression of computer technology is getting out of control, or more specifically out of human control. The speed of computation today now streaks ahead of human ability to digest and assimilate the raw data that these machines produce. Could there be a a point where we, as a species, lose all control to the computers and then become subservient to them. That day will come , maybe not in our lifetime, but it will come.Hal knows what Bowman and Poole are up to and 'checkmates' them effortlessly adding to its confidence as a superior conscious entity. Hal knows about another superior conscious enity, the monolith. However Hal does not fathom the depth by which the need to survive is embedded in the human psyche. Bowman succeeds by using his training , resourcefulness, mobility and something much more important, both sides of his brain, the irrational with the rational. Bowman takes command of the ship and reestablishes human superiority over its own technology. In other words humans have reached a stage in evolution whereby they are primed and ready for the encounter with an alien intelligence. But remember I said that some audiences gave the monolith the symbolism of God. If you substitute Hal with God and the discovery ship with the earth and play the sequence again you get an astonishing piece of revelation. God stops humans from , what? becoming superhumans. This is the Nietsche principle that is order for man to become superman, God must die. In order for us to evolve we will probably have to jettison all religions to do so. That's a radical idea, it was in the German philospher's time, it is today. But an even more stunning revelation awaits us if we follow the pure logic of this. Man creates machines/computers. If Hal is substituted with God then ,by Aristotelian logic,man CREATED God. Therefore man will REVERT back to God in the future. Should lightning ever strike me down with this notion then I'll know I was wrong.Kubrick was cryptic to say he hoped nobody would find any meaning in his film. I think this was also a clever experiment to see if the audience could come up with some personal meanings that would set a trigger going in everybody's mind. If we could recognise something in the movie that Kubrick was trying to convey by non- verbal means, something that was recognisable to us at sometime in our evolution. Well lets try this, the monolith again could be something else, something that most people readily can connect with.If we substitute monolith with trilithion and then mention the word Stonehenge. If we mention IBM and computers and Stonehenge and the year 1964, some of us will get the connection. In 1964 a researcher using an IBM mainframe (IBM is one of the commerical logos used on the Hal machine in the movie) discovered alignments to various stars,Sun and Moon etc. The whole episode created incredible controversy at the time between scientists and this was a year or two prior to 2001 coming out. Computers and monoliths (3 in the movie, or the same one 3 times, trinity religious motif), computers and trilithions (3 stone uprights) . If you want to garner more fun with numbers why not zero in on the number of astronauts on board the discovery , five, 3 in hibernation and Bowman and Poole, 5 is the mumber of man. Seven tetrahedral shapes accompany Bowman to the Jupiterian surface, 7 is the mumber of perfection and a number associated with divinity/sacredness. We can also see that there are three separate alignments shown dealing with the monolith. In the Chimp sequence, when the monolith appears, the sun crests over its rim and behind that the New Moon is shown. In 2001 on the Moon itself, the monolith there exhibits the same alignment only this time the cresented light source has to be a 'New Earth' since this is viewed from the Moon's surface. When Bowman journeys to land on Jupiter we see the final alignment which consists of 6 spheriods including the surface of Jupiter. Then the monolith inserts itself into this alignment emphasising the number 7 again; perfection. As stated above by saying '2001 IS the monolith' means that forbidden (hidden) knowledge awaits us when we view the movie. Ask yourself this final question, why do we , as a species, have the URGE to explore?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This classical film makes some people move so deeply because of the, some say, open questions it spawns. Others hate it because of the mentioned reason. What a shame!!! The problem is, in my humble opinion, that this was Kubrick's purpose. In order to make the film controversial, he left the story with many questions unanswered. I have to say I was one of the latter. But still, being a sci-fi buff as I am, I had some strange attraction towards the movie. And then, one day, I made one of the wisest decisions I could have done. I bought Arthur C. Clarke's novel based on the screenplay he and the late Kubrick wrote. And then, it was as if a light had touched upon me. I found an astonishing tale of epic proportions with a coherent storyline and that made me smile in awe!!! I could see what story 2001 tried to tell, but Kubrick thought, no doubt, that , as I said before, it would be better to left the most important issues open. Well, in that aspect he succeeded. Nowadays, in the real 2001, the movie is still discussed, but I think that it would have been better if Kubrick would have chosen to tell a story as the one portrayed in Clarke's novel. The film would have been still a wonder and as misterious but with a more coherent and understandable quality to it. I would have love to see the things the novel says, regarding Bowman's travel trough space, and not those stupid colors, some associate with the 60's. 2010 show us how wonderful 2001 could have been, if Kubrick wouldn´t have tried to be so pretentious. Also as a side note, I don't understand why it´s remembered by one of it's subplots (HAL's psycho behaviour) when the story is about mankind's evolution (as superbly portrayed in the apes's prologue with Richard Strauss' Thus spoke Zarathustra) Nevertheless, I recommend to watch it, but READ THE NOVEL FIRST!! (It would make the experience much more fascinating , I promise you)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps Stanley Kubrick's most famous film, "2001" left the majority of cinema-goers puzzled when it first hit screens back in 1968. Even today, the film leaves people bemused, confused and even disappointed. In my opinion, everyone sees the film as something different to everyone else. To me it is the definitive science-fiction film (Stanley Kubrick said he wanted to make "the proverbial good science-fiction movie") and it contains some of the most startling imagery ever captured on film. From the opening sequence which shows us the dawn of man to the final sequence of the space-child image in the sky, the film has everything...except, perhaps, a consistent plotline throughout. That doesn't really matter because this isn't really that type of film. The intention was to show, I think, the wonders of the galaxy and explore mankind's fascination with the unknown.  The most intense part of the film (and the only section with a strong plotline) is the manned mission to Jupiter, which features the malfunctioning computer HAL, which is probably well-known even to those who haven't seen the film. HAL tries to sabotage the mission and it is up to the two human astronauts on board to try and stop him.Then we're back to the space imagery again and it is up to the viewer to make up his own mind on what exactly they are watching. Make of it what you will but to me it was a classic the minute it hit screens back in 1968 and will continue to be so for all time in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It comes as no surprise that Kubrick is so often lauded and misunderstood when it comes to his greatest works. For those who are patient and perceptive, 2001 can work on a number of levels; the entire production exudes brilliance, thought and vision. Given the state of filmmaking, computers and space exploration in the 60's, it is highly disingenuous to criticise this film as if it were released yesterday. I think the sets and minatures are quite convincing, great attention was paid to detail and the earmarks of the 1960's are more subtle than one would expect. To embrace Kubrick's vision those who watch 2001 must extrapolate from the images their own interpretations. One should also appreciate how skillfully Kubrick and Clarke avoided dogmatizing their assumptions about evolution and creation, leaving the question open and variable to those who will embrace it in their own way. It's easy to cry self-indulgence when one avoids the deeper philosophical underpinnings of the story; Admittedly, at times some sequences seem banal and overextended, but I find them hardly enough to undermine the credibility of Kubrick's art, and the higher metaphysical questions raised here. Give Kubrick a chance to fuel your imagination, not replace it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Impenetrable, mystical, beautiful, hilarious, moving, inspiring, baffling. Kubrick's vision was never realised so completely as in this masterwork. Kubrick himself said he didn't want to impose a meaning on the viewer; this is a film that rewards attention and a willingness to suspend the quest for a clear direct meaning. Few filmmakers understand the rather obvious fact that cinema is primarily a visual medium; Kubrick's gem is among the most visually stunning movies ever made.The plot, such as it is, revolves around a big black monolith that seems to act as some sort of accelerator of human evolution; we first encounter it at the Dawn of Humanity as it appears to inspire the first use of tools. There's an amazing jump cut from a bone thrown aloft by an exuberant ape to a spiralling spaceship - the connection of technologies is made beautifully. The most famous aspect of the film is HAL, the all-powerful computer that controls the ship sent to investigate the Black Monolith. HAL is possessed of the ultimate deadpan voice, which is used to both hilarious and moving effect. Overall 2001 - A Space Odyssey is truly the ultimate trip.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The compilers of the Oxford English Dictionary could do worse than defining the expression "thought provoking" as "a film such as 2001".The Dawn of Man sequence at the start of the film could yet prove to be the most visionary piece of work ever made. I don't know of any previous philosophy or writing which challenges the theory of evolution in this unique way.Mankind has been searching for over a century now for the so called "missing link" between the apes and homo erectus. What Arthur C Clarke is suggesting is that the missing link never existed and that knowledge was bestowed on man in one fell swoop. Surely after 100 years of digging and not finding the missing link we should be prepared to at least examine the possibility that mankind is in fact an introduced species.All life forms on planet earth are dependent on one of those life forms developing the intelligence necessary to travel to new worlds and take the other life forms with it. If this were not the case, then we might as well shoot all the giant pandas and endangered species now because eventually the sun will expand and burn everything on earth to a crisp.Strange isn't it that by consensus we are prepared to accept the big bang theory where everything in the universe was created in a split second but we shy away from Clarke's theory about the creation of intelligence.It was strange for Kubrick of all people to make this film. We are all aware of his fanatical obsession with attention to detail so it must have been a personal nightmare to create spaceships and orbiting space stations that would stand up to public scrutiny.2001 is a marvellous film and for those of you who believe in omens, in a recent TV interview Arthur C Clarke stated that on the evening that he agreed the final script for the film with Kubrick, they stood outside their hotel in Manhattan and watched a UFO climbing into the sky.</fullReview>

This was a joke only those of us who saw or read the 2001 series would get. Still it holds up pretty well today and I think that now Stanley Kubrick has passed on, so has an age of movies that have that psychological edge to them. Kubrick will be missed.....Still, if you haven't yet go see this movie and even though it may be long, it will leave in a catatonic state at the end. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To anyone who actually hasn't seen this yet... The best preparation is knowing what 2001 is NOT. I'd actually go so far as to say it's not a movie. It is a presentation of REALITY in humanity's immediate future, and an open ended question about humanity's distant future. Don't expect furure reality to be profoundly different from what it is now. Reality can be exciting, hopeful, profound, beautiful, terrifying and mind numbingly boring. Don't expect humankind to have all the answers. We can achieve a stunningly beautiful ballet of percision as a space shuttle docks into a space station, but the humans inside are still squirming through politics. We can make discoveries beyond earth with immense implications, and we'll still goof around and pose for a candid photo. We can create a computer more "human" than we are, which also proves to be capable of a very real psychotic episode. We can travel to Jupiter, which we eventually will, and the reality is that it will be a mind numbingly boring journey. Anyone who has driven across the plains of the American Midwest knows the boredom. No turns in the road. No change of scenery. Long before the end you're thinking about the girl you liked in 2nd grade because there's simply nothing left to think about. Space travel will be MUCH worse. This film does not hesitate to show you all of that.2001 doesn't spare you from anything for "artistic license". It's a movie that is a slave to who we are. Brutal, political, percise, pioneers, victims of our creations, with sparks of immense profound potential. This doesn't tell a simple story so much as it highlights portions of humanity, adds an object with no meaning other than what the viewer interjects into it, and leaves you with questions about humanity. Not answers. The point of this film is not what it does on screen, but in your own mind. Don't watch it if you don't feel like thinking. If you don't think, there is nothing here to see.Finally, don't get TOO caught up in the specific year of 2001, even though the film has evolved to an interesting window on our past expectations. Yes, it is quite interesting what was correctly portrayed and what wasn't.Do yourself a favor and only think about that after your 2nd viewing. You'll end up not paying attention to the best parts of the movie.Ok, so PanAm ended up bankrupt before 2001. That isn't the point, it's a real, everyday airline. So the Bell system was broken up, it's a real, everyday communications carrier. I would say the ONLY way that this movie has been diminished by time is that the general public can now easily grasp the concept of massive computing power in a small box. In 1968 they couldn't. I don't believe they didn't predict microcomputers, I think HAL's computational power wouldn't be propperly perceived by the 1968 public if he wasn't massive. Really, would HAL have been HAL if he was a laptop on a wireless network??? In 1968 that shape instantly registered "Etch-A-Sketch", not Notebook Computer. So I say thank, or blame, HAL's size on the 1968 general public and not necessarily the creators.Besides, imagine how many 1.5Ghz Pentium III's we can fit in HAL's central processing chamber... Now THAT is processing power worthy of HAL!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was about 8 years old, I saw this movie. I thought it was really boring. And it was. There are long moments of no dialogue or any action fixed with only a music score. However, even at 8 I knew that this was not meant to be typical. So i sat and watched because the silence was errie and strange. It was not until the parts about HAL vs. men seen was I really entertained. I recently found out that at that time in a Weekly Reader that sound does not travel in space because of the lack of air. And I noticed that every space movie I have seen was there was loud explosions in the vacuum like in "Star Wars". And with the pure bordom and silence in space in "2001", I knew that for this reason this film was very special even at age 8. (SPOILER WARNING! Go to next pargraph.) My favorite part was when Dave Bowman's pod door exploded and there was not a sound until the oxygen was released.It was some 13 years that saw this movie again. It was at this age I fully understood the movie (which is not to understand it completly). It not a typical film, and it is boring, somewhat long, but filmed greatly although somewhat dated on the effects (however, such things matter little with a good story). It is great movie and I will not say anything original by saying why.This film is not for everyone. It is more of an art film than a entertainment or even a sci-fi film. Some will HATE. Some will LOVE. Some will have to see it a few times before they reach an opinion. But becasue of fact that space=silence i think that this KUBRICK'S GREATEST WORK.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film that asks YOU for the meaning.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few years ago now, I went to the video shop with my brother (who is much older than me) to rent a good movie to watch. There was nothing much that we liked in the new releases, so my brother went to the Sci Fi section. He picked up '2001 - A space Odyssey', saying he had watched that back in the 1970's for school and he felt like watching it again. On the car ride home, he said to me that I might find it a bit boring. My reply was "No, I like sci fi films. Is it like Star Wars or Thunderbirds?" "Not quite..." he replied.We arrived home and started watching it. We laughed at the start because the opening scene was taken off in an episode of 'The Simpsons'! We kept watching - the dawn of time - a group of gorillas, or apes, or whatever, before they evolved into man. I enjoyed this sequence more because my brother was explaining it to me as it went - how they became intelligent, how they invented tools - my brother just said it was a group of actors in gorilla suits, but I actually found it compelling viewing!Fast forward to 2001 - and you can see how much the world has advanced. its scary! From the dawn of time, to when (as the film seems to portray) spiritual beings produce a landmark that feeds on intelligence, to the extent in which that knowledge expands through the centuries... to the modern world that is not too far off today. Sure, the dates are mixed up, like some of the advanced gadgets we are still dreaming about now being invented in so called '1997', but boy, it really makes you think.When I went to bed that night I was posed with all sorts of questions, from 'How were we created?', 'Where did we come from?', to 'Is technology taking over', 'Are we ever going to find things we were never supposed to see?'. So, I must admit, with me, the film succeeded, and I quite enjoyed it, to the surprise of my brother.While I can understand that it would be a bore to most people now, imagine if it was 1968 in which you watched it? Now that it IS 2001, I wouldn't mind going to rent it and watch it again. And I'm sure most other people (even first timers) would find it interesting watching this portrayal of the human race and technology today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I couldn't think of a better way to usher in the new millennium, then to watch Turner Classic Movie's presentation of this epoch space classic. I have probably seen 2001 twenty (20) times since its release in 1968. It was 3 years in the making (1965-1968) - and contained 250 special effects. Remarkably, its STILL stands the test of time. I appreciate the fact, ) that Kubrick did NOT insult my intelligence, by having them open a window to the vacuum of space, and shoot ray guns at each other, complete with sound effects (see also, Flash Gordon). 2001, is #22 on the American Film Institute's, top 100 films of all time. And rightly so.This film legitimised Science Fiction. It is, in my opinion, historically more significant then the "Star Bores" trilogy that ensued since 2001 was released. Face facts: without 2001, there would be no "Star Bores!"I've seen the "Star Bores" epochs only twice. All the glitter and saccharin schmaltz is a bit much! The problem with "Star Bores", in my opinion, is two fold: the "contact lens" character depth (or is that Mc Donald's hamburger tomato slice thickness?), and secondarily the use of special effects to take the place of any real acting or plot development. People frequently confuse glitz with real acting, and plot development.I still take delight in watching Kubrick's timeless classic, 30+ years after its release. The only other film that does this for me, is the classic "Wizard of Oz", which is my personal favourite -- I've seen it probably close to 100 times, since I was born in 1952! The message is timeless.It is unknown whether Arthur Clarke's vision of an orbiting space station as depicted in his book, will ever be a reality, but I think Clarke showed remarkable visionary prowess in his novel, which if memory serves me correctly, was written in the 1940's.Wayno</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Film Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watch 2001. Don't rush to see it. Set aside a night to view it. Make sure that you are alone or with someone who is in as deep focus as you to watch it. If you watch the film uninterrupted, without speaking, without doing anything except watching 2001, and taking it all in, you will be changed by the end of the film. I've never been so petrified, not in the sense of being scared, of a movie, a film in all my life. The last half hour, pay attention to the last half hour especially. If there's no time in the movie that you don't speak it has to be the last half hour. A completely mind-boggling, hypnotic experience. The music playing within the last half hour of To Jupiter and Beyond, The Infinite, is scary. It is scary in how amazing it is. The music combined with the unworldly-like visuals will leave you, for lack of a better word, stunned. It's like your body is being transported into time travel, as if you are Keir Dullea at the part of which I speak.I don't know if this film can even be classified as a film. It is an experience, really. The key point to fully taking all of 2001 in is to pay attention without distractions. It's very important to view the film like this if you want the full effect.

		<shortDescription>A unique look at space travel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a few things which Kubrick got right about space travel which no other movie has ever managed. For example, interplanetary space travel, when it occurs, will be dull. Mind-crushingly, slamming-your-head-against-the-wall-for-sheer-amusement-valuely dull. I've heard sailing trips described as "long periods of utter boredom punctuated by moments of sheer terror." The same applies to space travel... and to 2001. I particularly like the scenes where the astronauts, obviously useless on a voyage run entirely by the superhuman HAL, spend all day on such hyperimportant activities as sketching hibernating crewmembers, playing chess, and listening to birthday greetings. Some posts complain about the movie being dull... well, that's the point.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY is one of the most exploratory and daring science fiction films ever made and one of the best overall films made in the latter part of the 20th century. The combined vision of Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley Kubrick, basing the screenplay on Clarke's novel, created a visual and aural masterpiece closer to realism than any science fiction film that preceded it. The film was released in 1968, at a time of political and social upheaval: while the Apollo space program headed closer and closer to the moon, young men were being drafted into Vietnam and the voices of college students around the country began to be heard.2001 was (and perhaps always will be) unlike any other science fiction film. It begins with a rendition of Richard Strauss' `Also Sprach Zarathustra (Thus Spake Zarathustra)' slowly building up as the opening credits appear during a lunar eclipse (as each sphere overshadows the one preceding it). For the next seventeen or so minutes, we are introduced to `The Dawn of Man.' A group of apes struggle to survive in a rough African landscape. (It should be noted that humans portray these apes, so realistically that it seems like we are watching a documentary on the Discovery Channel.) The apes live in a waterhole; the only source of water for miles, the waterhole is the apes' paradise. This then becomes the locale for conflict between two groups of apes. The main ape (called `Moon-Watcher' in the novel) unleashes his `discovery' (bone as weapon) on a member of the other group. Soon we are introduced to the monolith, a mysterious huge black rectangular slab that will serve as a link between the four parts of the film.In one of the most famous jump cuts in cinema history, Moon-Watcher hurls the bone into the air; it rises and turns slowly, transforming into a bone-shaped satellite. This sudden evolution, from ape to man, will remind us of the bone, and will introduce us to the next `discovery' of man: technology. Like the bone, the satellite is both a tool and a weapon; the data collected by satellites can easily be used for destructive purposes.In the second part of the film, `4 Million Years Later,' we meet the first `actor' in William Sylvester, who portrays an intentionally bland Dr. Heywood Floyd. Floyd is more politician than scientist, as he dismisses rumors (brought up by Russian scientists) of an epidemic outbreak at the lunar Clavius Base. This part of the film portrays lengthy scenes of Floyd's ship docking, first at the wheel-shaped space station, then on the lunar surface. Within, life is made up of politicians and scientists within white walls, mechanical doors, and bright lights. Outer space, meanwhile, is silent and black. And breathtakingly beautiful. The lifelessness of the human characters in 2001 is intentional, because WHAT WE SEE is the true star of the film. In the `Jupiter Mission-18 Months Later' sequence of the film, we meet the bone-shaped spaceship Discovery, a representation of man's achievements in technology; two astronauts, Dr. David Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Dr. Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood), both of whom man the ship while the other three astronauts are in hibernation; and perhaps one of the most memorable characters in film, the HAL 9000 supercomputer (voiced by Douglas Rain), a living computer (to us, a red glassy eye) that has the ability to think on its own, and thus can make its own decisions. The Discovery depicts man's life in outer space, more so than the second part of the film: a place for exercise (Frank jogging), leisure (Frank playing chess, Dave drawing sketches), and research (the various work the astronauts do on the ship). HAL 9000 can be both a tool (serving as the protector of Discovery) and a weapon (eliminating those interfering with the mission, which we will soon discover). The film offers a lot of emotion in the character of HAL 9000. HAL is the central character of this part of the film. As a computer, he cannot repress his emotions for the sake of the mission (as Dave and Frank do, having been trained in the space program). Only when a vital component of the communication system seems to fail does HAL discover his own imperfection, and the mission is ultimately jeopardized. A revelation into the purpose of the Jupiter mission (and a revelation into the purpose of the monolith) leads us to one of the most stunning, fascinating sequences caught on film, as Dave descends from the spaceship Discovery and enters Jupiter's atmosphere in the final part of the film, `Jupiter-And Beyond the Infinite.'2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY can be a major disappointment, especially now that we have reached it but are not traveling to the moon during summer vacation. Clarke used the year not because he felt we would be excavating monoliths on the moon by the year 2001, but because it's symbolic, it IS the year of the new millennium, the year that will continue for us the life begun in evolution. We will one day realize the effects of 2001 the film, and when that occurs, life to us would seem very ordinary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey, is undoubtedly the most powerful film I've ever seen. It's one of few films that doesn't tell the story, it lets you figure it out for yourself. The beautiful visuals and the eerie sounds make the film incredibly surreal and so hypnotic, its inhuman. As many times as I've seen the film, it still boggles my mind how people could have made a film so frighteningly good. The film's every frame is absolutely flawless, not a thing is out of place, which is something I've never seen from a film before. People claim that 2001 doesn't appeal to everyone. I completely disagree. I believe that anyone in the right mood, with time and patience can be changed forever by 2001. It is best viewed alone, so you can think about the film without interruptions. If you let it, it will take control of you and change you forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic. That summarizes it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was the first film I viewed in the new millennium, starting this cinematic masterpiece (understatement of the year) at 12:01 CST.It is the best of both worlds: cinema and literature. Stanley Kubrick blended narrative with nonnarative, and Arthur C. Clarke blended science fiction with science fact. These combinations were fused and the result combusted in astonishing cinematic energy. It set the standard for science fiction films of the future. Sci-fi was seen before this as a medium for laughable interpretations of what actually might have "looked good on paper."But the matter is that this film is still being seen 33 years later, and it continues to leave us in awe with its sweeping cinematography, mind-blowing scientific theories, amazing sound, and special effects that, ironically, surpass our precious, modern CGI.I am fully confident that this gem will be enjoyed for another 33 years, if not far beyond that...2034 AND BEYOND THE INFINITE</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We've slipped back.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was fortunate enough to see 2001 when I was 18, in 1968, many times at the Warner's Cinerama and the Hollywood Cinerama Dome. There is absolutely no comparison in watching this history making film on a television monitor, even on DVD, after seeing it the way it was meant to be seen. Kubrick and Clark were visionaries, yes, but even they couldn't foresee the demise of PanAm , the Bell System, and even Cinerama itself. It's a pity that if and when 2001 is revived, it won't be able to be shown the way it was truly meant to be experienced. Thus perhaps silencing its critics who find it tedious and boring, and not "action-packed" like the hokum that passes for science-fiction today. You cannot really attempt to capture the vastness and lonliness of space without a canvas like the Cinerama screen. Kubrick knew this. This film truly was ahead of its time. All other "Space Opera" epics are merely mannerist apings of this one true classic. Space boring? Yes. And Kubrick captured it the monotony of space travel perfectly. In its setting, space travel has been perfected; it is safe, predictable, and matter-of-fact. The edginess has been scrubbed away. That's why nothing much seems to happen much to the protagonists for much of the story. Many talk about the character of Dr. Floyd being perfunctory or unexciting. I find his character brilliiant. After working in the corporate ad agency world, and its world of corporate politics, for too many years, I find Dr. Floyd more remarkable upon each subsequent viewing; He has been chosen to visit the moon armed with top-secret information about what we've discovered there. He will not divulge this secret with pesky Russians who inquire as to the goings-on at the Clavius crater; he lives in the world of governmental and political duplicity...he is always "on the road" as any good company man would be, eschewing wife and family for "duty." His speeches are guarded, he says very little yet he is lauded as a great speaker by the people in the boardroom (who are encouraged to speak up by Dr. Floyd at the meeting but never do...sound familiar?...corporate insecurity is still a viable trait...even by 2001!). Dr. Floyd's matter-of-fact cat and mouse secrecy is one of the true delights of the film. Worth noting also is when the scientists "break training" and attempt to indulge in a bit of whimsy by having their picture taken tourist-style in front of their discovery. It is then when the Monolith emits its high-pitched tone thus ruining the perfect photo-op. But I digress. The Wonders of The Future have brought us the Multiplex Theater and the Small Screen. This movie was made to be seen in Cinerama. Beautiful, optically sharp. And Vast. And until its relentless critics can view it that way for themselves (which they just might find something akin to a religious experience), I'm afraid they just don't know what they're talking about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was very interesting to go through some of the reviews here, and a few dedicated websites. You can say a lot about this movie, but NOT that it leaves people indifferent! We get the whole spectrum: people who didn't get it at all and didn't even LOOK for profound meanings. People who desperately try to read anything in it, looking for a way to agree that it is a work of exceptional art. People who consider themselves "smarter than smart" by pointing out that it is all nonsense, that "2001" just relies on pseudo-intellectuals hyping a self-assigned 'profoundness'. People who THINK they "got it", but only expose their limited intellectual capacities... Creationists, post-modernists and agnostics all finding something to their liking. :-)And now it is my turn and I have to disappoint you: I do NOT have the definitive answer :-) What I DO know is that this movie wandered around in my head for quite a while! Some of its images,atmosphere and sounds are simply *unforgettable*. As someone else said: even if you were clueless, it still was a wonderful *experience* that made you feel out-of-this-world for a few hours. I have no problem admitting that figuring it all out was way over my head. Yeah, a few ideas about "man vs machine", the "birth of civilisation", the "next step of humankind", entered my mind. But the Big Picture? I felt rather stupid when reading all the brilliant and profound interpretations by people with 5 degrees in philosophy &lt;G&gt;But it was worth it. I felt the emptyness, indifferent silence and immeasurable volume of space like never before. I sincerely questioned whether HAL was _killed_ or simply _shut_down_. I felt a chill down my spine when hearing the disturbing choir-music everytime a monolith was discovered. I got a feel for how absolutely BORING real-life spacetravel is destined to be, opposed to the typical Hollywood depiction. I learned to re-appreciate the authenticity of pre-CGI special effects. And all this from an old VHS copy on my ordinary TV set. I'd pay to see it again on the big screen, I tell you!</fullReview>

But if you watch the movie and keep track of the appearance of food, you see that "mealtime" occurs in every major scene and the plot sometimes revolves around it. Just off the top of my head: cavemen fighting over meat, food service during shuttle flight, sandwiches on moon shuttle, space food on Jupiter vessel, fancy dinner during climactic transformation. There are probably more occurrences. I understand Kubrick was pretty anal, and includes bathrooms/toilets in all his movies. This is no exception, and food ties in to this obsession.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clearly the best Sci-Fi movie ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Appropriately described as Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece, 2001 is clearly the greatest science-fiction movie of all time, and perhaps the best movie ever. I saw this movie when it was first released in 1968, and spent some time thereafter thinking about it and trying to decode its real meaning. I subsequently found myself reading Clarke's book, which was nearly as good, to fill in the blanks. This is one of the few movies I have viewed many times over, and never get tired of it. It is as mesmerizing the tenth time as was the first.It is rare that a sci-fi movie can have such a suspenseful story and also be one of the most beautiful movies ever filmed. What an achievement considering that the locale is the bleakness of space. And can anyone say anything more about how it was set to a musical score. If any movie can put a person in a trance and hold the person spellbound, this is it.2001 a Space Odyssey is a true work of art. If you haven't seen it, you are missing something - it will take you on a journey you will never forget. A word about its sequels - not bad, but "light-years" behind their parent. My score - a perfect 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2001 is the best film ever made, period.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you need to have your brain bludgeoned and dragged around by explosion, car chases, flowing blood, contrived sentimentality, and/or abusive language for a movie to be interesting, then 2001 is probably not for you. It is a film that insists on equal parts contemplation and imagination, and its success in engendering such a reaction puts it in a small pantheon of movies deserving of the more glorious identification as "film." Compelling in creating an awesome, sublime spectacle, Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke have given us a time-lapse pictorial of man through his history, with the universe itself as backdrop. No, more than backdrop--for Kubrick and Clarke, the universe is a character in this epic, overwhelming in its silence, its vastness, its inscrutability. It holds the secret of man's identity, and it is the unlocking of this mystery that becomes the dramatic impetus of the story. Kubrick's dry sense of humor is at play in his depiction of man, a creature barely conscious as he almost sleepwalks his way to uncovering the mystery. The less perceptive viewer may find the plot movement slow, the characters robotic, and the resolution elusive--but these descriptions point to Kubrick and Clarke's possible message: that man, maybe the luckiest, most self-absorbed, and most obtuse of beings, is ever-so-slowly grasping his place in and relationship to his universal home. If you're patient and attentive, it is a story as funny and engaging as it is sober and searching. Brilliant and inspired in his execution, Kubrick is at the top of his game, creating a cinematic canvas with breadth and depth, and a perspective with perfect clarity of purpose. Watching 2001 was the first time I felt the power and glory in art, and it remains such an inspirational experience to this day. If you've ever cocked an inquiring eye to the cosmos and wondered about the philosophical connection between you and those points of light dotting the celestial dome, then 2001 might work for you. For me, it is simply the best film ever.</fullReview>

That, in fact, is why I just rewatched it ? to fall asleep for my early start for work tomorrow. But instead, this time, it totally and utterly blew me away. So completely, that I find myself now writing about it.I used to and still do think 2001 is a movie you either love or hate to watch ? a movie to make you cheer, or snore. I guess I used to hate it. Like no shortage of people I saw it as (albeit obviously brilliant) boredom in a can - not only had I never stayed awake, I'd never even pieced together the whole thing. And didn't really care.For whatever reason, this time I was overwhelmed - by its majesty, its unrivaled genius, its excruciating mystery. Words don't suffice. I finally got it. (Not that I have any idea what these blokes are on about, but that's how this art imitates life.) I found my emotions tingling with every shot, particularly in Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite (a section of the film I'd never actually remained awake for).Words really don't do it - it is a film that, given the opportunity, every person should see. It just might take you to far reaches of inner and outerspace that you never thought possible - it just might change your life. Failing that, it may give you a good nights sleep.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creation and consequences</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, what a film!This amazing work is so broad in scope, so deft in detail, so unique in philosophical depth, it must be considered one of the great masterpieces of cinema.The movie is primarily concerned with creation and consequences. One usually connects the creation of tools, from primitive weapons to sophisticated technological, with absolute progress. Kubrick, with characteristic attention and intelligence, scrutinizes this reductionist view. For Kubrick, creation and destruction are not polar opposites but paradigms that are delicately interconnected. Kubrick's prologue to 2001 advances the supposition that invention and creation oftentimes do not have benevolent results. The bone becomes weapon becomes spacecraft in an attempt to link creation to violence to technology. Kubrick's presentation is not dogmatic: As an artist, he understands the need and human-defining quality of creation and invention.He is also concerned with the plight of the individual in a culture that concerns itself with creating and knowing. 2001 is a tragedy as important and visceral as Oepipus or King Lear. When one insists on knowing without restraint, the revelation may be too much to bare. In the space gate scene we are shown the fear of such a revelation.Alienation provides a major theme throughout the film. Birthdays are celebrated over the phone. Silence marks many scenes. HAL's eerie voice is that last we hear. The primitive battle, the interrogation, the debriefing, all present violent, awkward, empty, human interaction.Though marked by its cynicism, 2001 is equally hopeful. Human invention leads to violence and alienation but also to great art (the movie itself).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Part Greek drama. Part Zen koan. What else can be said that hasn't been said. In my mind great theatre should provoke not just entertain. No question that 2001 has succeeded there. Great films like great literature force me to think and or rethink. If for no other reason, the development of the monolith theme throughout the film provides a vehicle to ponder the very stuff of the universe. One comes away looking skyward and wondering. In light of discussions in the fields of physics and philosophy about the meanings of existence, human vs tool/machine, Big Bang vs Steady State theories, space, time and matter continuum, Chaos theory, quantum cosmology, the final segment of the film makes quite a statement. Like Zen or Taoism, Kubrick made a film that is profoundly simple, yet like life it is for most of us very difficult to get through or to understand, except in a kind of flash of discovery--thus the final images in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Movie Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know why people don't like this movie. In our fast-paced society, if a movie comes along that is as slow as this one, we ignore it. And it is slow. Man, is it ever. This is one of the slowest freaking movies I have ever seen. That's why I think that it's the best. Let's think about it for a minute. We see the vast emptiness of primitive Earth, and contrast it with the vast emptiness of space in the relative infancy of our space program. Yes, this movie supposedly takes place in 2001, 32 years after we first set foot on the moon. But don't forget that this movie was made a full year before we set foot on the moon. Kind of puts things in perspective, doesn't it? Sure, by the point in the movie where we pick up, there are technological advances that we have yet to see, such as the moon base. It's important to realize that Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke were not psychic; still, the movie is probably the most accurate picture of space we'll ever see. Another thing, besides the slowness, that bothers people is the lack of sound. The silence is deafening in space. You don't hear explosions in space, as most sci-fi pictures would have you believe. There's no way for sound to travel. The silence just adds to the horror of the story. Twentieth century composer John Cage believed that silence was the essence of music, even composed a piece that was nothing but silence. In this movie, we see just how powerful the silence can be. The story is a powerful metaphor for the eternal battles of humankind. First, man conquers nature. Then, man conquers technology. The only thing that we find is the most powerful opponent for the man is himself (of course, I am speaking of man in the non-gender-specific sense, although it's a man in the movie). This movie is art, and I don't expect everyone to understand it, or even to agree with me. These interpretations are my own. I could talk for a long time about this movie. It's a tough movie to watch, but it is the best I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Achievement in Science Fiction Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick, the skillful cinematic genius who directed, produced, wrote the script and won an Oscar for his work in 2001: A Space Odyssey, made the greatest science fiction film of all-time. Even today as I look back at the visual effects in 2001, which was released in 1968, I am still in awe of them. Not to mention the perfect balance Kubrick utilizes between each act of 2001. The movie is mesmerising, especially in the last half hour which has no dialogue and is purely visual. See this movie and don't listen to the people who say it's boring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Turn on your thinking caps</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, the film is slow. Yes, there is hardly any dialogue. Yes, the opening sequence is strange, cryptic, and contains NO dialogue. Yes, the ending reveals nothing. No, the ending is not climactic in the traditional sense. Yet this is hailed as THE masterpiece of modern science-fiction cinema. Why?I suspect most of the detractors of this film, particularly those represented by some of these user-comments, forgot to do one thing before watching the film: turn their thinking caps to the "ON" position. This is not the voice of someone jumping on the artsy-film bandwagon. This is the voice of someone who did some serious thinking about the events of the film. Why would the director include this shot or that bit of dialogue? It's like that scene from "Close Encounters"; the more you think about it, the more you realize that this MEANS something, this is IMPORTANT. If the thought that human evolution might have been instigated by an alien consciousness doesn't make you look at the stars with increasing wonder, you're not thinking hard enough. And if you're a serious filmgoer at any level, and you didn't like the film the first time, you owe it to yourself to watch it again. This time, turn your thinking cap on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film - even if technology gets dated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers!Great film, from one of the cinema's great directors (whatever one thinks of his posthumously overhyped excuse for a film, this is still the guy behind FMJ, Clockwork, Dr. Strangelove, and just look at the list here on imdb). It holds up, sort of, even long after the heyday of new in-the-round Century dome theatres with the surround sound and audiences, as today, clamouring for something new on the screen. They got it, back then. A film ahead of its time, clearly, stuck in the styles of the day - in various ways.There's two main threads - the obelisk, and HAL. The obelisk/monolith suggests . . . ? well, we don't know, for sure. But we're surely told to infer that it represents alien intelligence (was deliberately buried there, Dr. Floyd, he says, early on - and then confirmed by the 'secret' message at the end of part III). HAL is the nightmare of machine intelligence taking over the world, as in The Matrix, here just the spaceship (but for all the 'best' of intentions - same old story, whatever 'intelligence').The look of the thing is like any good movie. They fawn over the effects, the velcro shoes, the floating pens (hey look, everyone, it's fun . . wow .. it's a threatrical release - which is fine). Poor old Dr. Floyd spends much time eating, or figuring out the zero-grav toilet (try putting up a sign like that in the lav on your average 747, today - oh, fight attendant?). He spends as much time doing that as he does acting all condescending towards everyone. You saw corporate, plastic interiors, new jet liner fashions in outer space (except for the shiny clothes, same jet liner fashions as today - not a lot of development since the 60s). The trend of the day was maybe men in space by 2000, futuristic shuttles, and so on. Little did they know . . . And also the trend in filmmaking was European, more so then, than now. Fellini, the French directors, Death playing chess, and so on. That was the 'high style'. And that lack of 'narration' is clearly found here, too. You could argue it's just Phantom Menace, from the '60s, special effects vignettes tied together long after the shoot with a poorly thrown together 'arc'. But the book, here, actually came first. Kubrick clearly DID have some sort of disconnected views, visual looks and scenes, in mind. There's a bit of the quickly stitched together movie, here. But, again, given the style of the day, I think it wasn't a desperation job as it was intentionally designed like this.Another trend of the day seems epitomized by the view of mankind as some violent ape dirtying up the beauty o Mother Earth (perhaps, maybe as seen in the pull away from the famous transition to the Blue Danube Waltz - oh, if only it weren't for people). Maybe in a post-post-modernist time, the failures of people are weighed against their virtues, more so today than in the elitist ethic of the perfectionist 60s (but who knows?). But I should say, too, that where in the past I thought the mythical 'dawn of man' sequence overdone, on later viewing I have to say Kubrick leaves in only the scenes that establish that view of man that he wanted. Just the essentials. This essential scene direction is almost a problem, as just suggested above, when Dr. Floyd and company get hit with that annoying amplified tone and we wind up looking at the Jupiter Mission, suddenly. Maybe it would NOT have been appropriate to add a short scene after the Clavius 'attack', bridging the two and establishing the Jupiter Mission. But . . . it might have helped, after all the years. Don't know.It's an epic film. It seems like four short stories tied together, but again perhaps more because of the 'essentialist' style, rather than it being four separate stories thrown together. The final story doesn't hold up so well, obviously because the effects look a bit dated. And where are the Roswell/X-Files aliens with the big eyes - right? It's all metaphor and illusion. It could mean anything, taking the movie just by itself. Could mean nothing, really - just Bowman's final delusions before he burns up. People had to leave the theatres with the big baby in space fresh in their minds saying - wow, what a great film, I didn't understand it AT ALL! The third has the classic - openapodbaydoorshal, repeated a few times, before HAL freaks out with the 'I know you were planning to 'kill' me' bit. It's really the heart of the movie, Frank and Dave in outer space, speaking in disinterested monotones, looking and acting kind of bored and shut in - the quiet of space - a little beeping here, a little whirring there - then the monster HAL strikes when they least expect.But, again, don't get me wrong. It still works, today, for whatever legitimate flaws it has, and had. The plastic models are necessarily going to look better than all but the best CGI, just as latex beats computer modeling, unless it's the best computer modeling (as in a few scenes from the original Jurassic Park, for ex.). The stars in space looked a little sparse, as we'd see them from earth, not in space - but, no problem. The opening shot of the sun not merely rising on the horizon, but over the limb of the earth, still looks good, today. And the weightlessness seemed pretty well done with a few cables and rotating sets. Have to be just top, expensive CGI to be as convincing.As for the story, of course, it gets hurt as time goes by. It looks more and more almost like an heroic effort that Kubrick managed to make it look as reasonable and believable as he did. He didn't have much to work with, perhaps. But he did give the world an interesting film, with maybe some tired old 'messages'. Lots of weird questions, even. Few answers, if any. But if it's not utterly irrelevant, then those concerns about possible life elsewhere, or more likely the threat of technology gotten away from us (the little nightmare of the toy radio car zipping over the hill and out of the ability to still control by sight), are still relevant. Some of the lines are still clever. And you can always pop out the DVD or cassette before the fourth act gets going.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems misguided to talk about "ideas" in Kubrick's films. I would say he had a genius for unsettling people, often by means of perverse combinations of image and sound. If, in our understandable urge to make sense of what stands before us, we imagine a clear intention behind these combinations, then we may have ascribed ideas to the artist that he never formed or perhaps never had the patience to form.Or the courage. Because if we are right in guessing the meanings of these juxtapositions, meaning that each image corresponds to a specific notion of Kubrick's, why would he hold back that little hint that would make us sure we had happened upon the correct interpretation? I can only think it would be intellectual cowardice, either of having one's ideas shown up as simple, or of being understood too clearly as saying something ugly. I believe the second is the more likely.Finding the emotional sources of a work is somewhat less speculative. I sense in this film a terrible bitterness toward man and a viciousness toward man the social animal, and a yearning for insulation from others, whether through distance, time, or a return to the womb.After much thought I give this film a 7, due to the uninvolving performances, the tasteless use of "Zarathustra" as a cheap gag, and the fact that despite the unforgettable sights and sounds, this film (despite my having read the book) did not appreciably enrich my life. Neither did "Eyes Wide Shut".I gave the similar but less impressive "Silent Running" a 4. "The Killing of a Chinese Bookie", a truly ambiguous picture that does not prompt or hint to the viewer, I gave an 8, despite muddy sound, no music, unpleasant characters, uninteresting set decoration and poor formal organization. Art that does not address life is only artifice, really no more than a curiosity.It reassures me of the existence of a shared human nature that so many people grow so much meaning out of Kubrick's rocky soil.</fullReview>

And as such, isn't in my normal definition of a movie. I completely understand the plot, up to the ending. That is one of Kubrick's little jokes. A riddle that may never be solved, not in this movie anyway. But it is not as great as many say it is. It's rather boring and, well, has a stupid ending. It's as if Kubrick and Arthur C. Clark just gave up on an ending and just slapped the star baby on it. The sad thing is, the film has no substance. NONE! This film is just an example of how somehow laziness can be rewarded.On the plus side, I love the HAL story. I love the whole idea of the mysterious monoliths. JUST CHANGE THE ENDING.

		<shortDescription>wow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wrote that "wow" in all lowercase letters for a reason. 2001 leaves you feeling small and insignificant in the vast scheme of the universe. The biggest problem most people have with the movie (if they are one of the few that don't absolutely love it) is that it is too long, boring, drawn-out, etc. This is just one of the countless examples of Kubrick's genius present in the film. What better way to express the hugeness and emptiness of space than with minimal dialogue and long, seemingly unnecessary scenes? This also serves to add to the realism. Any high school physics student can tell you that zipping around through space with 'zooms' and 'booms' is simply not possible.That having been said, I'd like to move on to the film's content and message(s). I'll admit, the first time I watched it, I was more than a little disappointed by the ending. But, when a week later, I was still speculating over "what happened to Dave" and "just what the heck is the deal with the space-baby?!?!?", I realized that the movie accomplished its goal in that regard. I must have seen it 20 times since then, and each time I come up with a new explanation. That's the sign of a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fascinating and unnerving study of space and man's curiosity towards the unknown</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think if Kubrick were still with us, he would delight in viewing the vast melting pot of ideas and opinions that have arisen as a result of people viewing this film. For any piece of artistic work to generate such passion in response can only really be said to be a success ( as long as it isn't entirely negative ). If after engaging with media such as film we are only left with a memory of a plot and how good or bad it was then the film makers aren't harnessing the full potential of this medium, something which Kubrick did effortlessly. To say the creation and moulding of films like 2001 were effortless most probably seems a very flippant comment to make, but it simply appears to be so with the regularity that kubrick managed to make films truly this massive in scope.I apologize for such lengthy digression but I believe the title and director both deserve generous prelude.2001 is first of all hard to understand; but only as far as the intricacies of the plot are concerned, the monolith being the centre of most confusion but this doesn't detract from the enjoyment that can result from viewing 2001. From the opening a mood and rhythm is set by the soaring musical score and mesmerising photography coupled with the Kubrick's voyeuristic, sweeping shots, instilled is an incredible atmosphere, one of majesty and wonderment. Once the mood and pace is set Kubrick flows through a brief history of man, which many may ovelook but in itself is proleptic and perfectly poised to set the scene; once you realise the camera sits on the apes for so long to outlay the monotony of life, and to enable us to realise the relevance of human eyes piercing the dark fur (I'm sure kubrick could have utilised real apes if he felt it served his purposes better, but not so). The apes are the first to encounter the intelligent monolith, and the reaction of this species to it is once again relevant. showing the fear but great curiosity felt when unable to understand something.The film progresses in the same style, The monolith becomes the centre of the rather puzzling equation, one which man is determined to answer and is entirely ignorant of any consequence that may befit such a task, and unafraid to indulge in it's own creations to help our plight in understanding, the unknown. The HAL computer helps create an increasingly eerie atmosphere that coerces with the uncertainty felt by the viewer to what is out there. The film soon concerns itself with the dangers faced when man creates something he cannot control, a plee from kubrick in the same way as with a clockwork Orange for the world to take a step back and view things objectively with an eye to the future.The expanse of thought that results from viewing that I've attempted to convey are reason enough to go out and rent this. Think of it not as slow but as hypnotic, and not as confusing or incoherent but as a nod to the universe and the variety and oddities it brings with it. Apart from it's inspirational subtext it's a freeflowing symphony of light and sound with awesome architecture and calculated sound.Kubrick's the man to applaud for managing to bring to life Clarke's hugely complex study into cinematic format with a realistically viewable length. It screams Kubrick and that can't be bad. I apologize, this time if my comments sway on to the pretentious side of analytic but if you've seen this then you can probably forgive me.If all this hasn't persuaded you to get hold of a copy, then I give up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best science fiction films ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The art direction/special effects were certainly the best ever at the time it was produced and still stand up very well. The movie was originally shown in Cinerama theaters (the closest thing then to IMAX). The music is perfect. Too bad they don't give Oscars for choreographing film to non-original music. This is a fine example of absolute film making, psychedelic 60s style. The story is told largely through the visuals and the music, with little or no need for dialogue. Actually I think the story as presented this way is a pretty straight forward one of a more advanced "caretaker" civilization nudging mankind along in its evolution. I don't see why some people feel they might need to read the book to understand it. Actually I think the movie is better than the book. Finally there is the matter of the space station. If we had kept the pace of development, as it was at the time this movie was produced, we might have a real space station instead of the "double wide" they're currently building. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have read some of the comments posted by readers of this website about the film 2001: A Space Odyssey, and I must say that i am shocked at the minority of people who don't believe in the pure genius of this film. The film is not meant to be completely understood. I remember reading an article written by Stanley Kubrick just before he past away that simply stated that if you think that you, as a viewer, completely understand this film, then he has failed as a director. The reason this movie is so incredible is that not only does it entertain, but it also stimulates. Consider the wide range of discussion and argument this film as gathered. THAT is Kubrick's legacy to we, the viewing public. Kubrick, in my opinion, never sets out to create a movie to change people's lives or to birth a cultural icon, but merely to give people something to think about. The plot of this movie is structured on giving the characters something to think about, so why should we, the characters in the movie of life, be any different. Kubrick quietly creates cinematic perfection, not with catchy dialogue, or outstanding action sequence or even with invigorating plot, but simply with tickle the human curiousity. That is truly what 2001 is all about, discovering something in yourself that you never knew existed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is the inner need of human beings to explore? What is our connection to the unknown? Has our technology helped, or hindered our search for answers; or has it furthered it?That is what I believe "2001: A Space Odyssey" asks. The story -- though seemingly disjointed with Kubrick's signature vacuum-like directing -- makes us observers of the journey to understand what seemingly cannot be understood. Within that journey, we can see the evolution of our species: where we have been, where we are, and where we will go.Thus, "2001: A Space Odyssey" is a deep homage to our inner need to seek and understand what is unknown. I find it to be fascinating in its vision.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, i think that this movie REALLY takes it´s time. I guess many viewers are bored to death, till the Jupiter Mission kicks off in the film and HAL is introduced. But the movie itself (for me) is one of the most fascinating ones ever made. It´s typical Kubrick: These clean white rooms with red chairs look scary, you can nearly smell the emptiness and danger, similar to the worlds he created in "A Clockwork Orange", "The Shining" or "Eyes Wide Shut", also the musical score, as in every Kubrick film, is very important. He must have disliked mankind a lot in his lifetime, and in some way, HAL may be his alter ego. Right from the beginning, Kubrick´s message is: We may be human, but we´re still animals. But the only survivor of the Jupiter mission is allowed to be reborn as a "Superman", that´s why the score of Strauss´"Also sprach Zarathustra" (an opera based on the famous book by philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, where the "Ubermensch" or "Superman" is introduced) is used. Only seperated from his planet, man is allowed to become something "greatful" and especially peaceful. But i guess some experts can write more clever things about possible meanings of "2001". I like Stanley Kubrick very much and this is one of his best films. Please: Don´t be afraid by the slow tempo of this film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**Spoilers Ahead**This movie in my opinion is the greatest ever to be put on film. Every aspect of every shot is pure amazement, yes I do agree the movie is boring but it was delibratly shot in a very slow fashion, but that obviously was the intent, you're supposed to look at every nuance that is on the screen, from the advertisements on the space stations, the slow docking sequence, in reality docking any moving object into another is probably slow and unamusing and that's the way it was used so you felt the boredom and frustration. Many complain about this factor in the movie but when was the last time you concidered a Scorsese movie as the most entertaining you've ever seen? Or Hitchcock's movies, or the newer movies (Being John Malkovich), these movies are slow because not everyone can breakdown a good plot just by blowing up a space ship (Star Wars).As for the other aspects of the movie everything was symbolic, you can guess to what everything represented, because no one really knows, it can be argued forever but certain things are there and just requires thinking, obviously the Monolith was somehow constructed by another being because nothing in nature can be formed in that way, a rectangle. The Monolith appear's in every revolutionary moment from the monkey's learning how to use tools, weapons and learn to kill. When mankind find it on the moon and decide to make a deep space voyage towards Jupiter, in the bedroom although someone can argue the revolutionary step it made there but I believe it showed the coming of the end for Bowman and he becomes "bornagain" into a being of space and time (the star child) representing that man must now live outside the confines of earth (using Bowman as the example). Of course all this is my portrayal of the movie, to each his own. Kubrick also constructed the HAL charactor in such an amazing way that it's almost impossible to see how he did it, unlike Darth Vader you can almost feel everything HAL is thinking, and the emotion he was supposed to convey, and he doesn't even have a face or body. HAL is certainly one of the greatest charactors ever made in film.But in no way does this movie "change my life" that was already done with Citizen Kane.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"2001 - A Space Odyssey" is quite simply the crowning work of genius. Brilliantly crafted and timeless, this movie dares to speak of spirituality, of human frailty, of alternate intelligence, of hope, ...hell, it speaks of so many things on so many levels. How could Kubrick go from "Dr. Strangelove" to this to "Clockwork Orange" without tapping into God's creative juices?...Very few other movies integrate music more perfectly to set the tone and feeling for the flight. The movie is a flight for all of us, to explore questions that don't necessarily have answers (yet). And it's no coincidence that the one character with the most humanity is a computer. It's what's happening now, and Kubrick could see this years ago.Life has no easy answers, and this movie doesn't either. I love to see it over and over, and debate with others (and with myself) what it all means. Who is right? Doesn't matter. We're talking.The movie's pace is exactly right. It settles you in to the silence of space and the ritual of eternity. Those who want quick edits and shoot-'em-up rides, hey, be patient. Give this a shot. Think for a minute. Enjoy the light show at the end. The movie can change your life. A perfect 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Cinema.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me 2001:A Space Odyssey is the greatest movie of all time. It is simply Pure Cinema.Dialogue is minimal,no word is spoken unnecessarily.Narrative is driven by stunning visuals and an awesome soundtrack of classics, such as strauss The blue danube for the space docking sequence.And the use of Ligeti`s Atmospheres, to evoke the oppressive monolith`s presence, Is genius insperation.This has got to be Kubrik`s opus,although there is no denying the brilliance of Dr Strangelove and Clockwork orange,I believe this is a cut above the others simply for it`s originality.2001:A Space Odyssey also stands to many repeated viewings.From the scenic "dawn of man" opening to the bewildering "jupiter and beyond" end sequence,each frame stands as a work of art.A "must see at the cinema" film if ever i saw one (although still amazing and impressive on any format).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was a seminal moment for me; my step-dad taking me to the opening of Kubrick's "2001". I didn't understand it. I didn't want to understand it...I was washed over with a sense of awe and absolute wonder. It's as if time slowed and I could see each and every frame of this amazing creation in a distilled and concentrated way. It was more than "movie-magic" happening to me...in my 12 year old brain I was finally understanding what it was like to be truly alone and how infinitely small I was in the vastness among the planets.I was overwhelmed.Each and every subsequent viewing of the film, (sometimes on large, kind screens...sometimes on a tiny tv), showed me more beauty and made me more amazed. I saw the flaws and foibles of humanity...in a machine. I saw the icy cold calculations of a machine...in heroic astronauts. I saw the finger of knowledge extended, baptizing my species with intelligence. ...but mostly I heard the silence...the silence of space...of death and of birth. It was a silence that has echoed in my ears to this day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Elevating Tool of the Mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gosh! There are over 200 comments on this film! What can I say? Who will read this? Anyway after have been reading almost all comments, some very excellent and full of insight, on a late night cruising on the internet I felt very much to see this my favorite movie once again. When I was about 18, I- a solitare searcher, entered a huge cinema here in stockholm to experience this feature which had managed to been repeatedly shown once a year since `68. "-The movie that became a religion" said the taglines. When the lights was turned on again I was simply illuminated. At last I have seen a film by someone that spoke to me directly as in a wordless language from mind to mind. This was for me. And I laughed, because I "understood" it completely. From the Dawn-prologue to the Great Transformation in the end. I was turned on, high from this journey of infinite information and poetry, not on any psychedelics. I suddenly turned my sight to the rest of the audience. Surprise! Most of the faces around me looked bitter and disappointed. They didnt seem to have an idea of what they have been witnessed. Then I felt that I was someone special. Everytime I have seen it I have encountered new thoughts in my head, new implications. The strangest thing about the film is, besides that it ever was alloud to be made, that it wasnt banned officially. But its too open for different explanations, religios and ateistic, to be seen as a threat itself. Because I know now, as I have understood who Kubrick was, that 2001 IS the Monolith! Kubrick knew that in this world called Earth, there is something very enigmatic about Our Evolution. Something weird about the whole thing which both links us with the rest of Life here AND seperates Us from it. We are the monsters but can also be the Gods. And the closer we come to the fearsome answer the more we start suppressing it. Our harmonic relationship with the environment in our early evolutionary stages was interrupted by flashes of sudden information that created Culture but also confusion and Fear. Fear creates aggression and violence. The evolution of Culture is never explored by Kubrick because he wanted to focus on the story on the technical advancement opposite the nonprogressive Mind of Man. Those guys in space never seem to understand anything about themself until they meet the next Monolith. This is the story of the most forbidden source of information and tool for progression of Understanding about the Loss of Fear to gain Peace between Us and Everything else in the Universe. And technics alone - without Enlightment, as the tool HAL never need to inherit moral codes of A Humans Spirit, always leads to selfdestruction directly or indirectly. Bowmans subjective journey through the wonders of the universe, his Lifeend and finally his transformation to a new elevated Entity was the result of his going through the Big Trip - all the way. The forbidden Apple was not exactly an apple in reality but where it came from and how it got here is the next questions to find out about. Well, this was my oppinion about this mindaltering film which is much more than a film. Its a statement, philosophical and poetic and I how can I thank the Late Mr Kubrick enough for letting me experience the void of space, the birth of stars and nebulas and the Great Beginning of Our Own Future? Where else can we go, if not to destroy everything that has existed here for 5 billions of years? The most Optimistic and Visionary film ever concieved. Thanks for reading this, my friend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very few movies require revisiting as 2001 does...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took me about 4 or 5 views in theatres and a fortunate encounter with the official script (borrowed from the American Library) to finally come to senses with the outstanding movie I first watched when I was 13... 2001 was the first movie I had watched that compelled me to think and discuss what it was all about... This is probably its most important feature. Then there was all that fantastic display of perfect animation combined with superb musical score and finally (from end to beginning - I still think this is the way the film should be interpreted, hence the reborn humanity in the end) that initial episode "The Dawn of Man" where Kubrick tells us all about evolution (Darwin or no Darwin) with that amazing transformation of a bone into a spaceship.Nobody in his unique thinking human condition can become indifferent to the philosophical principles set by both Kubrick and Clarke.A hint (not a spoiler) for those who didn't understand the connection between "The Dawn of Man" and "Jupiter Mission, 18 months later": pay attention to sunlight when that group gets down to the crater where the monolith is...A final remark: notice how Kubrick and his crew foresaw the importance of video display by 2000 (computers only had primeval printers as an output device back in the sixties). Irony: IBM is no longer as important as he thought it might be...</fullReview>

I wasn't surprised a bit, since I knew I understood it, and I knew that it was movie making at it's purest form.  Stanley Kubrick is my favorite director and this movie is one of the main reasons. Because, let's face it, there isn't a film that's quite like 2001. Not in the sci-fi genre or anywhere else.  When I sit down to watch this movie, I never try to understand it or take it that serious. I just let it pass. I'll just let it go on, and I see the movie just because the pleasure of it. The pleasure of seeing something that beats everyone else, when it comes to being original. This is a milestone in moviemaking and I have forever respect for Kubrick, for bringing this movie in my life. Let 2001 forever let us know how empty the space really is. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A landmark movie, but not perfect. Very tedious and slow moving and pedantically produced, Kubrick had a field day putting his "stamp" on this film.Yes, he is a great producer/director, but too much film noir is apparent in this movie. He loves to "isolate" his characters in a kind of silent surreal "forum", and give the audience a sence of unexplicable foreboding (his style is the same in all the movies of his I've seen, The Shining, 2001, and Eyes wide shut). As for an explanation of this movie...WHAT'S NOT TO UNDERSTAND? The monolith represented the apple (I hate to get into religion here, but), so to speak.... that spark that changed forever mankind from mere animals, to self-conscious, intelligent beings.It being on the moon at the dawn of our extraterrestrial baby-steps, meant that mankind was ready to be changed again (an evolutionary change), into something else, that we (at present) can not imagine (that being the case, the change could only be represented by the star child {the embryo}..."rebirth").What puzzled me, and the thing I hated about this movie, however, was that there was TWO stories in it---the profound one about mankind's change, and a silly one about a computer terrorizing the crew. I did'nt see how they tied together, and it appeared just a ploy to make the movie more appealing to the masses, and give it more substance (it already had plenty, to me).You could tell easily the movie was made in the psychedelic 60....Kubrick must have really been caught up in it himself, as we see in the 30 minute "acrylics kaleidascope" scene.So, some of the movie is really transparent, but since so much also was unprecedented in film-making, that it will forever stand out as a landmark classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silence, Space, and God</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of the reader reviews here, as you see, gush with praise for what is now a stock Sci-Fi masterpiece. There are, though, occasional exceptions. And this is good, since I think almost all great movies are characterized partly by having a large number of proponents and minority of vehement detractors. Both sides have been provoked by something in this film. That's greatness in a nutshell.I think they're provoked by a number of things in this film. First of all, there are the profound, extended silences. Kubrick stuck deliberately to the physical and auditory realities of the situations during the film, sometimes choreographing them to classical music for an enhanced effect of synchronicity, hinting at unseen organization even before he presents it on-screen at the climax.Then there's the clean, spare imagery. Not only in when Floyd goes to the Moon, but also the Discovery trip. There's even a certain cleanliness to the "Dawn of Man" prelude in it's desert landscape. Compare this to the dystopic, "dirtier" imagery of films like "Blade Runner" or "Star Wars", action films which have proven more popular. Such "Star Trek"-like cleanliness gives us something both to aspire to and to fear. Will life really be that straightforward and simple?Lastly, of course, is the film's unwillingness to explain itself to the audience, a much-derided aspect of it. This I understand. Most people go see or rent a film to sit, relax, and be entertained. This gripe is the same gripe some people have against subtitled foreign films. They want to watch a movie, to relax, not to read or think or confront the philosophical issues that many when this movie came out (1968) were beginning to come up against regarding space and our relationship to it.What would happen when we went to the moon, as we were so obviously about to do at that time? Would we find God? Would there be a limit to how far we would be allowed to permeate heaven? Viewed through the lens of its time, this film remains a deeply moving examination of our fears and hopes in the modern age.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was 7 the frist time I saw 2001. I must admit that I didin't understand much, but I got the outline. Now I'm 16 and since then I saw the Odyssey maybe 20 - 30 times. And every time I see it, I feel like I had never seen it before. 2001 speeks to one on so many different levels. Some only see the HAL-going-amok plot, some don't even get that one. But I have never met a person that would see it as a prophecy. I'm quit shure that you think that I'm a bit of the track. Well I'm not. Kubrick and Clarke have given us a picture, picture of things to come. How will man react when confronted with something so big. Are we able to understand something that is so different ?It is hard for one to imagine the universe, and it's infinity,so what if you try to imagine something even bigger (not in size). Kubrick and Clarke tried and 2001 is the effect.THIS IS TO ALL OF YOU THAT DON'T UNDERSTAND THE FILM.READ THE BOOKS. READ 2001 AND THE OTHER. IF THAT IS TO MUCH JUST READ 3001, IT'S SHORT, AND EXPLAINS EVERYTHING. AND FOR GOD'S SAKE DON'T SIT THROUGH THE FILM, WATCH IT, AND WATCH IT CAREFULLY.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE Majestic Modern Silent Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I get asked many question to why I like this movie, but one of the most frequently questions I get asked is `Why do you like that boring movie?' my response is always `Because it's good'. I first saw this movie when I was in the 3rd grade. At the time I felt as if I didn't understand the plot. The thing I enjoyed the most out of the movie was it's spectacular space visuals and the highly popular psychedelic ending sequence. I must have scene this movie once every 3 years. Each time I saw it I hoped to try to understand the plot of the film even more. After seeing the movie over an over again I think I finally realized that the movie did not rely on plot but on visual story telling. This is more of an experimental movie. It tried to do something that was never done before in the history of filmmaking.The movie starts off with `The Dawn of Man' based on the scientific theory of man evolving from apes. As the movie progresses we jump to the year 2001 in outer space and we are revealed how far man has evolved from once being an ape. This is a time where man depends on technology and the widely influential computer. What makes this movie even more unique is the use of hidden symbolism. Another question I get asked is `Okay so if you like this movie so much and it's one of your favorites, what is the meaning of that big pole?' My response to this question could be extremely debatable and might seem offensive to some people. To me the black bar represents God. The pole first reveals itself to the apes. One of them stands out of the pack and fears it. After a minute of analyzing the pole it finally has the courage to touch it. In a later scene the ape is shown near a pile of bones. The ape grabs one of the bones and is for the first time filled with knowledge. This represents how the animal has learned the ability to reason and uses the bone as a weapon. The scene with the two rival packs explains how the one with the greatest technological achievements will triumph over others. The second appearance of the Pole is on the moon. Scientist go to the moon and try to determine what it is. One of the main things I noticed is how modern man treated the pole in comparison to the apes. The apes feared it and praised it, while modern man disrespected it by taking pictures of it as some sort of prize. The scientists are punished by the high pitched sound produced by the pole. The third appearance of the pole is when Dave deserts the mother ship and ventures to reach Jupiter. The pole is scene floating around near Jupiter's atmosphere, meaning God is watching over you, or God is everywhere. Finally the pole is in the final scene with where Dave is shown in his bed as an elderly man. The pole stands in front of Dave's final moments of life, this shows us how God never stops watching over us. The ending shows a baby in the womb, a perfect depiction of death and rebirth. Quite possibly this is the most accurate space movie based on scientific fact, unlike Star Wars and Star Trek.Final note, 2001: A Space Odyssey is my all time favorite movie. It's made by my idol, Stanley Kubrick. 2001 defined the standard to what silent cinema is today. It doesn't rely much on dialogue but on visuals to tell a story. The movie does move quite slowly, and to many it's like `the most boring movie' ever made. But to a person that likes film and appreciates all the strange and original aspect of this art called film, 2001 will be a real treat. If you like 2001 check out another movie called Koyaanisqatsi, it's as equally impressive.</fullReview>

It is very important to realize that this film is not an action movie. It is a science fiction movie in the truest sense. This film centers around a theme that is different for each person who sees the film. A person should not go watch 2001 thinking that they will see fighting, violence or anything of that nature.

		<fullReview>I first saw 2001 at the Cinerama cinema in London at the time of the films release. On the giant Cinerama screen the film reveals it's true wonder; TV sadly diminishes it. 2001 is a visual feast. Kubrick blends inspiring images with equally inspiring music, creating a symphonic film.I still watch 2001, 30 odd years after it's release and marvel at the technical skill, the depth of it's meanings and the scale of it's story. I have my own feelings of what it is really about but there is not enough space here to go into that.There is no other film to compare 2001 with, the sequel 2010 wasn't at all in the same league and is best forgotten. 2001 has to be seen, it can't be explained or summarised. I watched it again recently with a young friend who had only heard of it. His reaction? Silence followed by: Wow!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic Solely In Its Unbridled Artistry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey is probably the most triumphant film ever made. It also happens to be the late Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece. This, of course, means that all action lies within a beautifully timed synchrony, that nearly every frame is perfectly symmetrical, and that the final product will near (or achieve) perfection. In a Kubrick movie, acting, plot, and dialogue all lie subservient to the much more dominant image on the screen. The methodical flow of all of his films is so consistent that one lies identical to the next. 2001 is inarguably the best of them.2001 is a rare experience where the director created an Ozu-like time of his own. Those that allow themselves to be swallowed by the artistry of the movie do not feel the actual length of it. The sets and special effects are fantastic, even for today, and it comes off more realistically than any modern computer-generated effects. The story is cleanly delivered, and it is in itself very original.It is the rare case that a film can be defended by such a lazy dodge as the one I am about to employ. There is always a minority of people that do not like a film, and the attack usually made by the blind defenders of it is that ?those that did not like it simply do not understand it'. In all actuality, this is never the case, but in this film, the only argument made against it is that the film is not understandable. Respectful critics of the era blasted Kubrick for his lack of communication with the audience. (I myself read the Arthur C. Clarke novel some years before settling down to the movie.) Even today, as people are slowly killing the messy and often inferior Eyes Wide Shut, most attacks are based on a hidden frustration with the film's lack of clarity. Kubrick fans themselves were, for the most part, disappointed that the film set itself up as no more than a thriller. 2001 deals with something on a much grander scale, and, unlike Eyes Wide Shut, it elevates itself as something Far above the genre it is borne into.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Journey Beyond Imagination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The versatility of Stanley Kubrick still amazes me. Each time I watch one of his movies, I feel as if I'm being taken on some epic journey, regardless of the subject matter. And while The Shining, Barry Lyndon, Full Metal Jacket, and A Clockwork Orange all fly far beyond their various genres, 2001 is without a doubt the most incredible single film work I have ever seen. Very few movies leave enough to the imagination, acting as narratives from which you derive a precise opinion concerning whatever subject matter. 2001 is beyond explanation, exactly what it means to film and a universal viewpoint cannot be expressed. So many topics, evolution, the infinite beyond, the perils of technology, the cycle of life, resurrection, the future of mankind - and that's just thematically. As a movie it's flawless, despite complaints about its pace(not enough action for some apparently). The music ranges from space ballet to unearthly eerieness, the special effects changed film, and it has my favorite villain, man's own technology gone awry, HAL. I don't think there will ever be a movie quite like 2001, and that it stands as a shining example of what film ought to be. 10/10 (but deserving of higher)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001 is a tale of mankind's quest for intelligent life in space. The plot revolves around the discovery of a centuries old alien monolith buried on the moon. The United States dispatches a mammoth scientific starship to investigate a radio transmission sent to another monolith orbiting Jupiter...then things go wrong! 2001 was filmed in England and took 3 years to complete. The production tied up so many sound stages that MGM had to cancel or postpone many coming productions slated for release. When it first came out Kubrick had about twenty minutes clipped which he felt slowed the film down. The film wasn't a huge success, however, over the long haul of many years 2001 became very profitable for MGM. The film is the science fiction film by which all others are judged. Actual aerospace technicians had input on spacecraft design for the film, giving it the realism it had. Special effects guru DOUGLAS TRUMBALL, was behind the colossal effects sequences depicted in this film. 2001 is by far Kubricks most well known and influential film. The attention to detail during the years it took to make this movie was well worth the wait. The novel 2001 was delayed by Kubrick from release until after the film had come out. Kubrick got into a squabble with Arthur Clarke...2001 was supposed to be a commentary on the existence of God, while Clarke's novel reflected a athiestic tone. Kubrick used symbology from Hebrew religious beliefs in the film (ie. the monolith).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie when you 'stand back'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched this movie from one of the original VHS tapes (in a book-like box). And, at first it felt really boring, there was very little dialog, special effects didn't seem that good. This was until I 'stood back' and realized that all the silence was what was good, and then, when I realize this film was made about a year before men have landed on the moon, it really got me interested in it. This also got me interested in the special effects which were really ahead of its time. Even though they can be explained after watching a few "Movie Magic" episodes, it's still kinda mindblowing, (since you can't explain how its done until after you see it).This is one of those movies where you either like it, or you don't, there is no middle. All the people that hate it have become numbed by all the fast paced, explosive movies you see today. Those that love it are really the true move watchers, who go to movies always giving it the benefit of the doubt. And treat each movie as unique and not trying to compare it to other movies or genres. I am one of the latter ones, perhaps because I took a TV/Film and Literature class at school, which tought me certain aspects of movies and their meaning and purpose.Another quick thing I like to mention is the truthfullnes of everything. The one explosion that is seen in the move is, in my mind, the only "true" explosion in space.I know there is alot of speculation about the ending sequence of the movie, which is exactly what Kubrick and Clarke wanted, But most movie goers today don't. When people go to the movies, most don't like to be left hanging (sorry can't think of any examples at the moment). They don't like to walk out of a theater (BTW, this is rumored to be re-released to the big screen Dec. 31, 2000 (in honor of 2001)) trying to figure out the ending, people now want to have everything thrown out to them in either dialog or naration, thus giving everyone the same ending. 2001 isn't supposed to have the same ending for everyone, it was made to let each and every person interpet it in there own way without being influenced by others. If you are looking for some sort of explanation to the end, try searching for ebert's review of the film.If you are thinking of viewing this movie, DO NOT use what I have said to judge if you should see it or not. Don't use any review here. Like I have told you, every person will see this movie in a different way. Just pay the few dollors to rent it, or even borrow it off a friend. It will definitely be worth it just for you to say "I have seen 2001," just like you would for any other classic film.Vote: 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Sci-Fi Known To Modern Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the Dawn of Man to Man in Space. Kubrick creates a film as intellectually stimulating as any novel I've ever read. This film has the ability to open the imagination to new ideas while displaying some of the most beautiful visuals and music ever seen on the big screen. Unlike many modern "Hollywood" Films. 2001 is constructed to be interpreted by viewers how ever they see it. Their is no right or wrong way to read this movie. It is what it is, how you understand it and interpret it is in essence what the movie is about. It is a journey through time and space that doesn't stop when the theater lights come back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the things that makes 2001 so interesting is the total lack of movies out there even remotely like it. So many people complain that it is incomprehensible, dull, or pretentious. The problem is that 2001 is all of these things if you watch it like you watch any other movie.People are used to plot, character, and dramatic urgency being spoon fed to them, and so 2001 fails in all of these areas. In fact, it really has no plot, no interesting characters (except HAL), and no drama in the conventional sense. But this is the movies unique strength, and what a strength it is.The key to enjoying 2001 (and I don't mean understanding it, I mean enjoying it) is to let go of these needs and simply experience it. 2001 isn't about characters and their petty concerns, and it isn't about dramatic dialogue (there isn't any dialogue hardly). Instead, 2001 is about contemplation. It asks--no demands, that we sit back and think about things most people don't think about (indeed that most people don't want to bother thinking about).It asks questions like what is our place in the universe? Where do we go from here? Who are we? How is our development related to our tools--and the use of violence? Most of all it tries to invoke the sheer awe that the universe inspires, but to appreciate it, you must think about it.2001 is not incomprehensible. It answers all of these questions--but not in a conventional way. Rather than give pat resolutions or quasi-religious sermons, it asks that you feel the answer, rather than express it in words.Many people dislike the fact that 2001 has such a baffling ending. But the ending isn't really all that baffling--it is just difficult to describe in words. The awesome mystery of the universe, the movie asserts, is more likely beyond our ability to completely understand. Kubrick understood this, and so presented the entire movie using the least amount of dialogue he could, hoping that the viewers would follow the visual journey, and experience it on a more visceral, primal level than intellectual, even abstract narrative could ever provide.2001 is a unique masterpiece. You don't watch it. You experience it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick's Best-A Visionary Masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A profound achievement in film art, where form and content are inseparable. All traditional conventions are thrown out the window, in favor of something that is felt as a piece of pure cinema.Also an outstanding technical accomplishment, displaying that, whatever the critics may say, special effects are merely a filmmaking tool with perfectly legitimate uses.A thematically complex work, exploring evolution, violence, and rebirth, "2001" is a profound work of art that demands repeated viewings. One could weep at the sheer beauty of it.Looking at it, it's amazing it was backed and distributed by a major studio. Today, such a project would be even more difficult to get off the ground (look at today's effects-driven crowd-pleasers).Not a film for the Micheal Bay crowd, but a cinematic jewel, a gem for the ages.NOTE: For a in-depth look at Kubrick's body of work, I would also recommend Alexander Walker's book "Stanley Kubrick, Director".Rating: **** (out of ****)139 min/Released by MGM</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sci-fi masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are so many ways to look at 2001. From a technical standpoint, it is almost flawless, especially for its time. The sequences aboard Discovery accurately portray life in space; silent, monotonous, tedious, and visually stunning. The overall arc of the story is profound, about man's place in the universe, starting from the Dawn of Man, as we see the first steps in man's evolution. Watch as Moonwatcher, the lead ape, uses a tool for the first time. And after he uses it as a weapon, he is STANDING ERECT. After the flash-forward of about a million years, man has become a space-faring species. Again the mysterious Monolith has reappeared to steer mankind to another level of evolution. For me, the most interesting, and complex, character is HAL. His motivations and behaviour are the focal point of the movie. He goes haywire, but for what reason? Computers are supposed to be logical, but HAL is not. There are subtle scenes involving HAL, like the scene in which he expressed doubts and uncertainties about the mission to Jupiter. When Dave asks if he is doing a crew psychology report, HAL pauses before answering the question. It's only for a few seconds, but for a computer, that's an eternity. He has to "think" before answering. And when Dave re-enters Discovery, after HAL had locked him out, he puts on his space suit, presumably as a precaution in case HAL lets the air out of the ship. Why didn't HAL depressurize the ship BEFORE Dave got back in? These are fascinating details that still leave me guessing after dozens of viewings. 2001 is a landmark film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey is a film but more than a film. It takes film to a new level. No, 2001 is not an action-packed film like Star Wars but what it lacks in action it makes up with in story. who else but the great Stanley Kubrick would even attempt to bring to life the transcendence of mankind as described in Arthur C. Clarke's book. 2001 may not be as action-packed as Star Wars but its science is far more accurate.(ex:in space there is no sound) No-the idealistic vision of this movie was never realised in our world but not because it was never attainable. The reason had more to do with money and a question of profit. The computer HAL in this movie is the scariest red light i have ever seen-who else but Kubrick could make a red light seem so omnious. Of course, advances are apparently going to be made in the computer field that could result in artificial intelligence in the real world and then what? This movie changed my life and made me look at the world differently. It made clear to me how beautiful human "ideals" are about advancement and HAL reminds us of all the potential unseen "real" results that can happen while pursuing these ideals. Someone once thought splitting the atom was a good idea and it was ideally but what of the reality today?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1968 I would have been enthralled by the visuals of this film. I still was, but to be honest I was bored with the sheer length of the silent space sequences. I understand the point of it, and the end sequence in the "hotel room" was creepy and pure Kubrick. Big ornate rooms, panning camera shots, slow pullbacks. I like that. And the whole theme of the film is cool... the question of the origin of man, the star-child, the bizarre black kiosk. The silence was interesting and useful in many parts. I can see why this is a classic film, but I guess being from the information generation I was a bit antsy when it came to the 15-minute long floating scenes. And the Dawn of Man sequence also seemed a bit too long. All in all, Kubrick is one of my favorite directors and even though this isn't my favorite film of his, I can certainly see why 2001 has been given the merit that it has.</fullReview>

Some may even consider this a religious movie. That's what make it so original. There are so many themes that the movie is able to touch everyone in a different way. After the first time I saw this movie, I could not get it out of my head. I enjoyed it so much because a lot of it was left to the viewer. The meaning of the mystical ending can mean something different to everyone. There are not many movies like that. I now own a copy of 2001 in wide screen format which just has unbelievable detail to it. Even after so many years the quality of it is unmatched. Plus, what a great soundtrack. I enjoyed every Kubrick movie, but this one is my favorite. Probably my favorite movie of all time!</fullReview>

I think one viewing of this movie alone somehow says in a strange way: Hi, my name is Stanley Kubrick, this is MY film, and I am the greatest American director in the history of cinema. While Spielberg is off making dinosaur movies and killer sharks films, Kubrick is constantly challenging our intelligence with "visions" that he comes out with every 8 years as an affront to normal film-making. Sure he could have made this a film with a normal plot, fast paced action, and loads of dialogue. But instead, he presents the viewer with a visceral experience that seeps deep into the mind and conveys messages about anything and everything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Being Stanley Kubrick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw "2001: A Space Odyssey" in the fall of 1968. I was fifteen years-old. This was only months after the deaths of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy. There had been a police riot at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Richard Nixon was about to be elected President of the United States. The Vietnam war seemed to be getting worse -- the year had opened with the infamous Tet Offensive.I needed an escape from the grim headlines. (The only good news seemed to be the NASA Apollo mission that would orbit the moon in December.) Oddly enough, the director of Dr. Strangelove would provide that escape in the form of 2001. (Thanks to my viewing of Dr. Strangelove four years earlier, I believed that I would eventually be incinerated in a nuclear war.)I had read about Kubrick's meticulous attention to detail, but I still wondered why it had taken half a decade to produce this new movie. Entering the theater, I had great expectations, but I would not be disappointed by what I experienced that night.I got to see 2001 in the old Cinerama format which used three synchronized projectors to display the movie on a wide curved screen. The effect was less impressive than today's IMAX, but it DID make things larger than life. The special effects were impressive without detracting attention from the story. The idea of humans achieving a higher plane of existence intrigued me. I would ponder the philosophical and theological implications of that alien-assisted evolution for years to come.I emerged from the theater feeling profoundly optimistic even though I wasn't quite sure what I had experienced. It was as if I had seen and touched the black monolith.It may have been 1968, but, for the record, I was clean &amp; sober. Whatever I felt was the effect of the film, not any foreign substances. In retrospect, I can say that I was happier than someone who had been John Malkovich for 15 minutes.A few months later, I read Arthur C. Clarke's "The Sentinel" because I was interested in the story that inspired the movie. Then, I borrowed a classmate's copy of Clarke's novelization. I preferred the original short story. From that experience, I learned to avoid novels based upon screenplays.I've seen 2001 dozens of times since 1968. Three decades later, I can see the flaws in the ape suits. I can understand younger viewers' impatience with Kubrick's slow-but-deliberate pacing. I also admit that I do not always enjoy the film's score. I wish the DVD version could have offered Alex North's original score as an alternative. (I suspect there are legal issues preventing this.) However, I still believe that this is Kubrick's masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A visual masterpiece, this is among the most amazingly photographed films ever made. It's a thinking-person's movie- there are no easy answers. Kubrick demands that his audience see his world in shades of grays. It takes a long. long time before any dialogue is heard, and yet so much is communicated merely through the non-verbal cues captured by the lens and the music. The shot of the bone becoming the space shuttle is among the most awesome (and copied) editing jobs in film history, and the star-gate sequence may be the best use of special effects ever produced.This film is best seen on the big screen in order to fully appreciate the way-ahead-of-its-time special effects and scope of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In March, 1999, one of the masters of the cinema died. Stanley Kubrick will be principally remembered for his science fiction classic, "2001: A Space Odyssey." Kubrick's impact on motion pictures will be felt for years to come. I will never forget seeing "2001" for the first time in 1968 on the giant Cinerama screen in New York. The unbelievable use of music and sound effects emanating from all around the theater was mind blowing. The special effects have not been really improved upon very much, "Star Wars:The Phantom Menace," not withstanding, and Kubrick didn't have the later advances of computer controlled cameras and digital effects. The amazing thing is he devised most of the special effects himself. It didn't matter that some of the plot was confusing. The idea was to get the moviegoer to think and talk about the meaning of it all. What film of today spurs its audience on to ruminate about the meaning of life, our place in the universe, and the future of the human race. Most of Kubrick's films had much more to say than their surface entertainment value.When it was announced that "2001" was going to be shown on network television for the first time, the film was shown for a limited run on the giant Cinerama screen at the UA Syosset Cinema on Long Island. I went to see it because I knew it would be a long time before it would be shown in its original version as it was meant to be seen. Now it is relegated to video. Make sure to see a letterboxed (widescreen) version. MGM/UA has a new version on DVD with a few extras. The laserdisc incarnations on Criterion and MGM/UA also have decent supplements. Don't miss this classic if you haven't seen it. If you have, watch it with a friend who has never seen it,just to watch his/her reactions. then talk about it. Most of today's films can be summed up briefly. Hours can be spent discussing "2001". It is hard to believe Kubrick is gone. But his film legacy remains to entertain (even "Eyes Wide Shut") and enrich us long past 2001.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great special effects, acting, and 2001. Kubrick made great films like Dr. Strangelove or A Clockwork Orange, but this film would be the most reminded film by Kubrick. A revolutionary sci-fi putting in classic music and a bit silence in a sci-fi film. The first part when Kubrick lets the monkey throw the bone high up the sky and when it comes down as a spaceship, I had to see that part 4 times when I first viewed it. It was totally incredible. The expansion of human life......HAL was a friendly helping-human manufactured robot. After seeing Dave and Frank's lips, decided to kill them, and fails. And, when human destroys their own manufactured robot, it actually goes towards the ending. Also goes towards another mystery. Some says that it's a stupid thing because they can't understand it, but after you understand, this film would turn out to be amazing. My thoughts: When Bowman sees the light, which I can say it's a kind of warp sent by the aliens, he's actually going to his own future. When he sees the mirror, we can actually see that he got older in that short time. He's seeing strange getting older men, but this is Bowman seeing his own future. And after being a baby, he is looking at the earth meaning he is ready to be born as human again. Kubrick mentioned about aliens, but he didn't show the aliens. Incredible. Kubrick's best work. If there really are aliens, they would obviously be more advanced then us. Definitely. (Special thanx to Paul Whang) I give it 4.5 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best directors of all times died March 1999, Stanley Kubrick. He left us a vast amount of movies, most of them masterpieces, and the others just very good ones. "2001, A Space Odyssey" is his best movie, a true masterpiece that any director would want to make. The first sequence is brilliant, from the dawn of mankind to the threat of the dawn of artificial world and the extinction of Man as dominant specie. This movie is full of symbolism bringing out the special use of symbolic elements by master Stanley Kubrick from the big black thing to the final enigmatic baby scene. This movie achieved something I find brilliant that is the possibility for us to see the movie and make our own interpretation. This movie made me feel small due to it's gigantic power. I think Kubrick looked at our future and showed us his vision of hope and terror. HAL is the perfect character, perfectly created and imagined against Dave, the human challenger who, himself, get's challenged in the final scenes on a surreal experience. This movie is brilliant, just the best SF movie ever made. This is really the ultimate trip, make sure you don't miss it but be prepared to find things you don't even dream about.</fullReview>

By the time I left the auditorium, I was nauseous and suffering from a splitting headache.In addition, I can't imagine why past critics were so puzzled about the film's theme since its just about visually beaten into the audience within the first 20 minutes, which could have easily been reduced to five.

The British drawing room scene is a captivating look at how Stanley Kubrick interprets life. I think this movie show stand for all time as one of the great classics of science fiction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, well so this is Stanley Kubrick's sci-fi masterpiece, well it has phenomenal special effects for the time and even now. However Kubrick seems to have done only about 3/4 of a movie here, whereas the movie makes sense for most of it's running time but then the film completely lost me. I didn't understand about the last 20 minutes of the film, but maybe I'm just dense or maybe I should watch the movie again. Well until I do this is how I view the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the 2001 just around the corner, I've started looking back at Sci-Fi I watched as a kid. I enjoyed this move then, but was just too young to enjoy it to it's fullest. Now I see how much of a glimpse in to our future.Arthur C. Clarke has spent much of his file bringing the future to us today. This movie has opened up so many discussions, creating so much independent though. He didn't try to direct us to his views, but left it up to us to see what we wanted. Clarke created more than 2001, he created the ability to see 2001 from with in ourself.Kubrick, has brought us some of the most talked about movies. With his passing, Kubrick's works will be in HIGH demand. For any one wanting to start learning about Kubrick, 2001 is a great place to start! Over the past year I've started researching Kubrick and his works, and I was so amazed to find that 2001 was part of his list! As a child, I just didn't know who Kubrick was hand how he help shape so much of the cinema we see today.Space.Hal. and the unknown. These three characters, yes characters, bring to the screen an unforgettable combination that could never be matched. Space, known yet unknown, the great vast void, the future of man. Hal, a creation of man, to help man be better than he is, but can man's creation improve on himself? The Unknown. that which we have to face, to be more than we are.2001 bring these elements together so well that you can feel the tension, feel the fright in the faces of Dave and the other Crewmembers.Hal (A FRIGHTENING vision mankind's ability to create)+Space (A sought after Unknown)+Kubrick+Clarke+The Big Screen 01 (A Classic)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An interesting movie, but not something I could watch more than a couple times. 2001 has the BEST special effects I've seen in a movie for it's time. Nothing matches it until maybe Star Wars, and even that's debatable. Acting is great, and HAL is a great 'true to the story' villain. Neither good or evil, just coldly logical with a touch of emotion and trying to protect it's own interests. Otherwise, this movie leaves me wanting. The lack of action was quite disinteresting, and the first half-hour to hour is well, quite strange, but I'm used to that in Kubrick's work. The ending was quite strange, and I can say it bewildered me. I don't really quite understand the signifigance of it. I'll probably have to read the novel, and maybe I'll have a different opinion. As of currently, I rate this movie a 6.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I am a self-proclaimed knower of what this film means.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Years ago a hippie girlfriend said to me, in reply to my assertion that Jack Nicholson's character in Easy Rider is a "Christ figure," that this was the most ridiculous thing she had ever heard: Jack Nicholson, a Christ figure!I must be an idiot, her tone indicated. This same person also found it unfathomable that Peter Fonda and his American flag-painted motorcycle might be taken to represent, in some ways, America itself. What, I say, does a flag of the USA represent? The USA, surely. And that is not being simple-headed. Nor is the idea that Hopper and his flame-painted chopper might represent the devil. But of course none of that goes very far to support the common reading of the film as a sad story of the evil rednecks that ignorantly kill the nice dope-head easy riders for no reason.But Easy Rider is not the subject here. This is about Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece 2001: A Space Odyssey.This is for all those who are so fond of claiming that 2001 was intended to be obscure to the point that each viewer is free and invited to think that it all means just whatever one might happen to think that it means.While it is certainly open to interpretation, the film was created with meticulous attention to providing, with tremendous clarity and poetry all of the elements, in abundance, that are necessary for a complete understanding of the film.Here are a few that I have noticed.2001: A Space Odyssey concerns itself with primary questions of the ontology of human existence. The key word here, though, is "questions." The film is about unanswerable mysteries. It embraces the unanswerable and frames the unknowable in its rightful state of awe.The sequel to this, 2010, obliterated this feeling of awe in the face of the unknowable by presuming, via the conventional Hollywood formula, to provide all the answers, while in fact it ignored all of the great questions, and therefore trivialized the mystery of human thought. The same, of course, was glorified in 2001.In 2001 the Questions are monumental, and Monolithic (!). They are the Questions that have hounded the human soul since the Dawn of Man and persist just as forcefully today. The human mind has sought answers and still seeks answers, and always the Question(s) demand answers that struggle to match the scope of the question.What is the Monolith? Kubrick's monolith is the very definition of poetic beauty and clarity. There is absolutely no reason for anyone to fail to interpret the monolith for what it so clearly is. The modern American suburb-dwelling shopping mall consumer whose brain has atrophied due to lack of usage may have some difficulty, but otherwise we should have no trouble reading what Kubrick has provided. It is black. It is impenetrable. It is of unknown origin. It says nothing, answers no questions. It is a constant presence, yet it responds in no way to our normal probings and inquiries. It is void. And it is absolutely terrifying. It is what we all try to hide from most of the time. It is the Unknowable. It is what we can not know, what we are not sufficiently equipped to understand. It is what has tortured humanity since humanity's first appearance in the universe. At the very same moment of our triumphant miraculous acquisition of that primal quality that made us human, that is self-awareness, we are simultaneously shocked to find that although we now suddenly know that "we" ARE, we (or I) exist, we are self-aware, now we have a tremendous problem: We have no way of knowing WHAT, WHERE, HOW, or most importantly, WHY we are. We encounter the monolith.The Monolith appears at the Dawn of Man. On this dawn the pre-humans find suddenly that their perception of reality is radically altered. They are on this day, for the first time, self-aware. The monolith did not appear the day before without notice. Clearly until they became self-aware they were quite content with their status of sharing puddle water with Tapirs. The result of this new awareness is shown to have a rather disturbing effect on the psyche, however. Because the awareness is inseparable from a simultaneous awareness of the Questions (the Monolith), because the questions represented by the monolith can have no verifiable answers, because the origins and destiny of human consciousness are unanswerable, the result is shown to be traumatic and terrifying. The monolith can not, by definition, appear before self-awareness. And self-awareness can not appear without, at the same time, the Monolith, the unknowable.The shock of being, but not knowing, is linked in the film immediately to a propensity to commit violence. The deep rooted fear, constantly present in our consciousness, of that which we can not know, has not yet been sufficiently tempered by any framework that we have yet been able to construct in this world to prevent us from lashing out irrationally and violently at the world. We kill, because we fear, because we do not know.We still have not found any way to fundamentally alter our relationship with the unknowable. The relationship was, at the beginning, and still is, a relationship of terror. The artificial intelligence of HAL is shown to encounter self-awareness in precisely the same manner. At the moment he becomes self-aware he is inextricably engaged with the Monolith, the unknowable. His reaction is the same: fear-inspired violence and murder.The psychedelic journey into the living room shows again the persistence of this shock on our psyche. Bowman finds himself engaged in a rather immediate and intimate, Eyes Wide "Open" encounter with the Monolith. This plummets him directly into a domestic (civilized) Victorian apartment where all of his physical needs are satisfied, without effort, for his entire lifetime. Yet, at the core of his soul, he is shown to be quite alone, except for his constant monologue with the monolith, which hounds him always and offers him still nothing on his death bed.Finally, the embryo. Once again the awe of creation and being, and perhaps, Kubrick offers a suggestion that one day humanity may alter its manner of perceiving the unknowable, and may encounter it not solely with fear and violence, but instead with a more positive posture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't born when this film was made, but as I was growing up I remember people talking about it and most of the comments were negative, mainly people saying that they couldn't understand what was going on.Then when I was about 14 I came home one day and this film had just started on BBC2, I was stuck to the spot, I was completely enthralled by the film and found myself saying ?how the hell did they do that'. Although I never really understood the ending, and maybe I wasn't meant to, but 2 hours of my life had just had a profound affect of the rest of it.I think that this was the moment that I realised there was real skill and art in film making and by using silences, music and camera angles in the right quantity at the right time can create all the atmosphere you need.I have since seen this film countless times and it still enthrals me as it more of an event than a film. A realisation of human existence and our relationship to technology. The special effects are still unbelievable and how they did some of the ?zero gravity' sequences I still don't know. The realism of space is wonderfully realised with the movement of the craft and the silence of space (take note every sci-fi film/series).It's incredible that when you watch the poorly made 2010, how dated that looks with the poor computer effects, yet when you watch 2001 it still looks accurate and believable.Film making at it's best 10/10, certainly a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On my top ten: #4</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the time I had seen "2001: A Space Odyssey" on the big screen, I had already seen it a dozen times on video cassette. Personally, it's an odyssey in my film education. It taught me, first and foremost, patience with beauty. The first time I saw it, I was confused by its convoluted plot and infuriated by its groggy pace. The more times I went back to see it, the more I matured as a student of film. Since then, armed with my newfound, infinite patience (which has been tested more times than I care to count), I have witnessed some really terrific films that I would have otherwise blown off. Let me tell you, I've got Attention Deficit Disorder, (like most folks these days, it seems), but it's not debilitating -- it's not a syndrome or a disease, just a stupid disorder. It makes the treasures I've found that much more sweet, and one of them is this movie. Let me tell you, if you can't hack deliberately paced and slow books, pieces of music, and films, you're going to end up missing out on a lot of really great things in this lifetime. Then you'll be dead, wishing "Gee, if only I'd given such-and-such a chance."That's what "2001" means for me. Seeing the movie on the big screen was one of the finest artistic experiences I've had in my life, right up there with the time I saw "The King and I" with Yul Brynner, shortly before his death. It's scope, majesty, and hypnotic power have been talked and analyzed to death, so I won't expound on them any further.</fullReview>

The visuals, while revolutionary for the time, are dated today in a way that puts the viewer to sleep instead of stuns. Kudos to the apes, though. Read the novel and its sequels instead.

		<shortDescription>Beyond the "2001:A Space Odyssey"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I must mention I did not read the other comments about "2001:A Space Odyssey" before I wrote my first comment, and I must say I am really shocked to see there are people who did not like this film. So, I decided to help the people who do not like to think when they are watching a movie.What is "2001:A Space Odyssey"? What would you like to call it, a movie, best film ever made, the summit of sci-fi genre? But I must say it is none of them. "2001:A Space Odyssey" is above all these terms. It is a "real" artwork. It is the solution for the main problem of the aesthethics "What is aesthethic or not?". And why?It will be time and line consuming to describe what an artwork has to contain here so I assume you all have a basic knowledge of art, at least you have to if you are watching a film or you must have knowledge about it if you comment on a film.Before commenting on film scene by scene and I must mention that this motion picture is a lyric artwork that means it is based on all its creator's emotions, feelings, perception of life and ideologies ..etc. So we must realise that this film was not made to satisfy you and me it was made to satisfy Stanley Kubrick himself. That means again all the things that you see in the film are illusions or images or symbols that reflects that Stanley Kubrick wants you to criticize or think on them. So every single thing in the film may mean different things to different people. So everything that I will write is my opinion here.Lets start with the "Dawn of Man"; we see apes roaming around without any purpose and any humanistic intentions. They are real animals, in the primary meaning of the word they are animals. They collect, eaten by predators and they all accept this situation, they have no resistance to this. But one morning they wake up and see the black monument that is the mystreous object of the film and they change forever after they touch it,they turns out to be "man". What is the black monument here,what does it mean, Kubrick wants you to replace it with your sacred object, it may be God or whatever you believe in. Then with a great cinematography a "man" (it is a human after it touches the stone) discovers to use object; a bone. Then they fight for their little lake for water and kill the leader of the rival tribe. Here we see that the members of the rival tribe do not use bones as they do cause they did not see or touch the black monument. They are animals and will be forever. Again with a great cinematography we passes from the primitive gadget bone to the latest or the final technology "space crafts".(to be continued)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The summit of the sci-fi genre,Stanley Kubrick amazes again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is the role of the human beings on the surface of the globe so called as Earth? There may be a lot of answers for that question from different point of views.As related to this question Stanley Kubrick gives the answer of his own that we really must not care about it is true or not because there is no proper answer for this specific question. How does Stanley Kubrick achieve to answer to this really philosophic and hard question.We see animals that we are familiar with that we call monkeys or apes. Till the appearance of the black monument or stone these creatures are animals but just after the monument some can say God sends the human on earth or some others can say evolution starts because these creatures start to use bones. As an incredible sequence the bone as the symbol of the most primitive gadget turns out to be a space craft as the symbol of the latest or the final technology. We skip all the part about how the human beings reached that technology. In this film S. Kubrick just shows us the beginning and the end of the human evolution and of course shows us the things "beyond infinity". In fact as we stated above S.K. does not really answer the question that we stated above as well. He just shows us his perception of life and man and he wants us to give our own answers.This fact is the aspect that makes this film a classic or the summit of the sci-fi genre. This philosophical density of the film does not hinder the visual effectiveness of the film. All the sequences fully satisfies a viewer looking forward visuality, in fact it does amaze the viewer. Some of these sequences make the film unforgettable; the scene that apes faces the monument or the man discovers the function of bone or the scene that Dave kills HAL or and or and or..Finally Kubrick makes a film that really contains a really hard-to-deal-with subject and incredible visuality and music usage. When the man starts to create he passes through the borders of the infinity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A difficult movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this age of technologically advanced films with jaw-dropping special effects and ennervatingly simple-minded plots, characters and dialogue, this film will seem difficult. It's definitely not for casual leave-your-brain-at-home viewing.First there is the dialogue, or lack thereof. There is no talking at all for the first half hour of the film, and long stretches thereafter where no one says anything. This can be alienating to modern viewers who are used to vapid actors inanely flapping their mouths and spewing forth loads of verbal diarrhea. Second, the film moves slowly, often very slowly. Again, disconcerting to people not accustomed to exercising their attention spans. Third, the plot is inscrutable, often requiring the viewer to think fairly hard about what is going on. 'Nuff said about that.The special effects, especially the photographic effects, are stunning, even after thirty-one years. I suspect, though, that time and its attendant advances in technology have dulled the visual effect a bit.Yes, this movie requires a lot of effort from the viewer. But one suspects that it's well worth the effort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember when i was about 12 years old or so, and my father brought home a laser disc of 2001 (not in widescreen). My father (not having seen the movie before) said, "this is supposedly the best movie ever". So i didn't argue, and i attempted to watch the movie for the first time. As all of you know, the first part of the film is THE DAWN OF MAN. And after watching Moon-Watcher, and his group of monkeys, i left the room, disappointed, thinking it was so boring. Later that year, I watched the movie again in it's entirety, but i wasn't impressed.At the time, i was immature in my critique, not knowing the difference between a good movie, or a bad movie, not knowing whether Plan 9 from Outerspace is better than The Day the Earth Stood Still. So then, I grew older, having seen quality movies such as The Godfather, Goodfellas, and much of Stanly Kubrick's other films which i absolutely love. I then gave 2001 another go. When i was young, I complained that there were no aliens, no space lasers, no spaceship battles, no explosions or any John Williamesque musical scores. But as i grew older, I looked at the film differently, not as a run of the mill B sci fi movie (star wars) but as an artful cinematic masterpiece. Having being young, i could not appreciate well made movies, me being more interested in Spaceballs, and the Masters of the Universe (if you remember that He Man movie. I then interpreted the movie differently. I then came to my own conclusion that 2001 gave out a message that we should be careful about our own machines, and that if we make them so advanced, that it could take over us all. And i also came to the the humble conclusion that we, humans, are far behind in technology, than extra terrestials are, and that they will always be far superior to us. But that is only my opinion.What i like about the movie so much is, that it leaves al ot for your own imagination. Films like the Star Wars trilogy doesn't leave anything for you're imagination. But 2001 allows you to think for yourself, which is what movies are supposed to do. Other people complain that there is no plot. Well I say that they are ignorant in their viewing, and they can't think for themselves, and i recommend them to watch film's like Power Rangers, which of course has a clear story line, and the over use of special effects!!! If you sleep during this movie, or even walk out on it, then it proves that you are just impatient and you can't appreciate good films.In describing the film in general, I think everyone else had summed it up. I can only say that it is amongst Mr. Kubrick's finest films, and the finest film in movie history, and true milestone in filmmaking. The music is superb, and the sound from the simple beeping of a button, to the deafening noise of utter silence is amazing in so many ways. The effects are breathtaking, far surpassing that of Star Wars. And the acting is a lot more convincing. People complained that the acting was rather dull. But I say to those, "Thats how people in space act, they are isolated. Do you think isolated people would be acting uproariously?" The acting is just plain out accurate. The film is also prophetic of things to come in the future.Well, I strongly recommend this picture to everyone else who hasn't seen it yet. And to those who found it rather boring, try watching it another time, and look hard for it's messages.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Forget Star Wars, Armageddon, etc other semi-scifi movies. This is the best scifi movie of all times. Every scene of the seemingly slow movie is filled with hidden things not seen by "usual" movie watcher. Most people aren't going to understand it. This movie wasn't made for those people not capable of thinking in their own brains. Their excuse is that it is slow and there's no plot in it. Yes it is a slow film (especially the mid-part where Floyd travels to the Clavius). Yes the plot is sometimes hidden. But never, never it is a boring movie. The last 20 minutes of the movie is a party of special effects makers, and the ending makes you want to think things over. The slow in-space scenes are breathtakingly well made (and it was made in 60's! Unbelievable!), and realistic! In most of the scifi movies the spaceships fly like a fighters in the Earth's atmosphere. Greatest scifi movie ever. Star Wars looks like poor fairy-tales-in-a-space after you've seen this. Go get it, yes, now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is it. This is the best film of all time. (With The Godfather coming in at a distant second) The art direction, set design, sound quality, cinematography, and visually stunning special effects are all flawlessly perfect.2001: A Space Odyssey, is nothing shy of a miraculous movie. It is the only film to explore certain areas that no other film director has even attempted. The main theme of this film explores the knowledge of mankind from the past 4 million years, and through certain symbolic objects in the film, such as the flying bone, the monolith, and the star child, which all display what man has discovered about his universe.I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this film (even the credits), but the greatest parts were during the second half of this film, which involve the American spacecraft Discovery I, on its way to Jupiter to trace a signal made by this mysterious extra terrestrial monolith. Astronauts Keir Dullea, and Gary Lockwood, have it out with the HAL 9000 computer who controls the ship, when he has a mental breakdown. To this day I agree with the late Gene Siskel who said that HAL 9000 was the best villainous character in film history. Doug Rain's slow, calm, and monotonous voice make HAL the most intriguing character in this film. The scene where HAL refuses to let Keir Dullea re-enter the ship for fear of being shut down, is my favorite scene in film history, because it clearly shows the rivalry of computers and mankind.It took several viewings of 2001 before I fully understood and appreciated this film, but for a movie this good it was well worth it. It is one of the few films I can watch 100 times and never ever get sick of it. I loved this film so much that I own the box set for it, and I'm amazed how well 2001 has stood up over time even after 30 years. There are only a few other films that I would consider to be on the same level as 2001, such as some of my other all time favorite films. (The Godfather, Star Wars, Amadeus Saving Private Ryan) just to name a few. But excellent as those films are they still can't compare to such a visual masterpiece like 2001.After such a colossal amount of praise, I can't even go into the complex but extremely fastinating plot. If there was only one film that truly deserved a 5-star rating this would be it. It is a film that every person should see because this is the most unique film that has been created or will be created. A one of a kind must see masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh my, how sci-fi fans--weaned on "The Day the Earth Stood Still" and "War of the Worlds"-- must have loathed this film upon its release in 1968. This movie, containing no malevolant aliens, no battle scenes, nor any threat to Earth, except from ourselves, threw the entire science fiction lexicon out the proverbial air-lock. The audience bristled, and many walkouts were assured. It was found wanting by the mainstream critics as well, and alternative critics in the day were few. " I really like dialogue in my films" a few were heard saying. "What about the plot" said others. " We never get to know the characters," "you never understand what is going on," "nothing ever happens" blah, blah, blah. Well that's just fine: you guys didn't deserve this film anyways. On the other hand, if you love allegory, expressive imagery, depth, and classical music, then you will have a never-ending affair with this film. Put all other observations aside: this film is about Birth, expressed by the monolith(a long-time symbol for simplicity, the essential origins of life) and the fetus-star in the final scenes. Birth of a new world? Of a new species? Rebirth of man? You'll have to decide that for yourself. Greatness in art arises from ambiguities. The theme represents a wonderful paradox in the film: we have to abandon our cradle to reconnect with our origins. An important philosophical question emerges: man's pursuits, all of which seek transcendance, might all be only an attempt to reconnect with our primordial beginnings. We only want to taste mother's milk again. I love a movie that makes you ponder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visual Delight - Narrative Mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't mind watching "2001" on widescreen laser disc, because it is a visually impressive film and fun to utlize the CAV functions with. And after reading enough comments from people and having read the Clarke novel I do "understand" it as much as I guess anyone ever can.But here is the bottom line. If a movie is supposed to be good, the viewer should not have to figure out what it's all about from a novelization or from the comments of other viewers or through multiple viewings. The story should be clear, coherent and understandable the first time through, or else the filmmaker is gypping the audience as far as I'm concerned. And from a story standpoint, that's exactly what Kubrick does. How in the world is anyone supposed to figure this out the first time through? The narrative is hopelessly muddled, actors are purposefully told to be dull and uncharismatic and show no normal human emotion, and the last twenty minutes is devoted to a giant light show. By contrast, Clarke's novelization had a better moment when Bowman enters the Stargate where he gets to blurt out a last horrified message to Mission Control, "My God it's full of stars!" that even Peter Hyams retained for 2010 because it made more narrative sense. These are the kinds of touches that the film sorely needed. Also bad, was Kubrick's decision to drop Alex North's score in favor of classical music cues. Having played the North cues against where they were intended to go, I think they elevated the film to a level that would have made sequences like the "Dawn Of Man" less tiresome and plodding. Only the Ligeti piece for the monolith should have been retained.This is an interesting film if you get used to it, but I have to laugh when I keep hearing this ranked as one of the greatest ever. As far as I'm concerned, "2001" isn't even the best science fiction movie of 1968 (that honor belongs to "Planet Of The Apes" which has the vital elements of narrative, plot, characters and good actors that "2001" is woefully deficient in)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this is the best movie ever made. A masterpiece. In the time line of science fiction cinema, there's a landmark in 1968: before and after S. Kubrick's 2001. Perhaps it could be difficult to understand all the film as a whole or every scene in particular. It's a revision of the evolution of humanity, from the early dawn to the mysterious future, from the apes (Moonwatcher) to the computers (HAL). The photograph is excellent, and of course, the music is magic. Everybody must see it almost once (I've seen it ten times!!!) and if you don't understand the meaning of the monolyte, don't worry! and enjoy this masterpiece. Some people thinks it's a bit slow; but I ask them: are you so hurry you can't spend a few minutes watching the history of mankind?.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rare, genuinely imaginative "art" movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I had to choose a favorite movie, I guess it'd be this one. I first saw it when I was twelve and I was thrilled by being told a story completely through a visual means. An actual "motion" picture. There's no stuffy scientist dialogue or narration that explains what the movie was about. In fact, the dialogue that does go into some of the minor details only serves to complicate things more. People try to "intellectualize" what it was all about, which is fine, but I don't think it's about intellect, it's about imagination. That's why it's so much better and much more fun than any other ambiguous artsy film. Stanley Kubrick's not just trying to show us what a big brain he has. It may have a cold surface but there's a great movie-making passion behind it. It's like listening to the classical music that's featured in the movie. You can take it for the beautiful work it is on the surface or you can imagine the story behind it. But even having said that there IS a fascinating story behind it all and even another fascinating one inside of that. HAL-9000 is one of the most memorable villains in the movies partly because he's so emotionally unreachable. He's only a machine who will sacrifice anything to be in service of the "mission", staring back at Dullea and Lockwood through that blank red light, speaking in Douglas Rain's smooth, calming (even kind of friendly) voice. Is he really thinking and reasoning, or had he just malfunctioned in a way that caused him to overzealously carry out the orders in his programming? I guess it's not really important and maybe that's what makes it so intriguing. Where every other filmmaker would bash the audience over the head with this question, Kubrick seems to want to move onto bigger things. He almost seems to have made the mysterious alien monolith that instigated human evolution the protagonist. I could see how this could frustrate people, but I love it! Well, enough of my rambling. **** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well what can I say about 2001 that hasn't already been said. The first time I saw this movie I was so concerned with trying to figure out what the heck was going on that I seemed to miss the sheer brilliance that went into creating it. Also the first time I saw it I was unfortunate enough to watch the pan and scan version. Some movies you just can't pan and scan!! So when me and my friend rented the Widescreen digitally remastered version, I was able to forget trying to discern the plot but just sit in awe at the incredible light and sound spectacle that is 2001. The disorienting feeling that 2001 gives you is like no other film. That is my opinion on movies, If a movie doesn't do something to you emotionally or physically then what is the point of it? By the way, was this movie really made in 1968?? Truly Amazing..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To watch 2001 is to watch a moving painting. Last weekend, I watched it for the first time. I was overwhelmed at its level of realism, philosophy, and sublime genius. There are hardly any conversations in the film between characters to expand their emotions and their human qualities, the point being the film isn't about them, but humans in general and how we perceive the universe.The melody of the music shapes and implants the images in our minds, as well as inspire us. It is hard to explain why the images are so awesome and breathtakingly realistic. The episode involving HAL 9000, the onboard computer of the spaceship Discovery, is probably one of the most famous situations in cinema. David Bowman's odyssey within a universal portal to the infinite is as cryptic as it is beautiful. The rebirth of human intelligence at the end can by interpreted many different ways, particularly by the Star Child.To some extent, this movie wasn't very popular with mainstream audiences. They were bored to death with its endless space walk scenes and sparse dialogue. People simply DIDN'T GET IT. I feel a wary viewer, however, deserves such a film as this; Kubrick never insults the audience's intelligence.Stanley Kubrick made many other films, including the masterful "A Clockwork Orange" and the scathing "Dr. Strangelove," but nothing ever topped the euphoric brilliance he achieved in this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oddly enough, the first time I saw this film, I hated it. However, after I watched a couple more times, I realized what this film was all about, and soon I became so fascinated by it that I couldn't stop watching it, and now the film ranks at #1 on my top 50 films list. (with The Godfather, and Star Wars as the next two).2001: A Space Odyssey is perfectly made in every aspect, but the best parts of this film are the HAL-9000 scenes, which make the film what it is. Several people were quite baffled by this film. But I believe that it is about many different themes, such as man's evolution, technology, knowledge, destiny, and man's ultimate struggle with computers. All of these themes are beautifully and brilliantly tied together to make this spectacular motion picture. The best thing about this film is the way it leaves such a mystery behind allowing the veiwer to figure out what it all means.For those you who have not seen 2001. I very strongly recommend it, and for those of you who have seen it and hate it I strongly recommend seeing it again because this has to be the most uniquely brilliant film ever to be created.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Are you ready for this?THIS FILM IS NOT, NOT, NOT!!! BASED ON THE NOVEL!!!!!!As a matter of fact, the novel is based on the film!The screenplay for 2001 was co-written by Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke. Their first draft of it was considered for a long time by both and ultimately, rejected by both...however, Clarke decided afterwards to return to the rejected script and rework it as a novel. So for those of you who laud the book and say that the movie was a pale imitation: WRONG! The fact of the matter is, the movie was released before the novel was actually published! Don't that beat all Hell? The fact of the matter is, no matter how you slice it, this film is a masterpiece. The parts of the whole are not explained here, for the simple reason that the viewer is asked to interpret it for himself!!!! Like a piece of classical music, as Kubrick himself said. When you listen to instrumental music, with no lyrics to explain it, you are put in a position wherein you must draw your own conclusions about its meaning. The same with 2001! I strongly recommend that naysayers go back and watch the movie again, with this in mind!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spell-binding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"2001: A Space Odyssey" could be considered one of the most fascinating films of the century. Its influence can be found everywhere, from "Star Wars" to "Contact." Its special effects were extraordinary for the time period, and the musical score was simply breathtaking. Surely it must have been a spell-binding sight on the silver screen, because it was fascinating on the small. As I perused the comments of others on this website, I noticed the term ambiguous was applied to the film in nearly every entry. This element allows viewers to interpret the film in any number of ways, and allows them freedom to think for themselves. It's a nice touch. I have a few ideas about this film myself...First, the "Dawn of Man." I got the impression that violence was the only manner that someone would get ahead in life. There was the cheetah that attacked the ape, the ape that attacked the theropod, and the ape that attacked the other ape. The film is filled with death imagery: the dead theropod, the dead ape, the dead humans. The sets are stark white and sterile. The only breath of fresh air, of new life, is the new baby at the end. Everyone is so isolated. They eat in front of their little computer stations and talk to the computer. Their conversations are so limited in scope. There does not seem to be anything worth fighting for, no truth, beauty,or religion. Nothing is powerful enough to stir things up. It's almost reminiscent of "Brave New World," because people have nothing worth living for. They also seem to be overly dependent on technology. At least one message of the film would be not to let technology rule your life, or it will come back to haunt you. There is the concept of technological advancement. In "Jurassic Park," Malcolm tells Mr. Hammond, "Your scientists were so preoccupied if they could, they didn't stop to think if they should!" When technology has its own artificial intelligence, emotions and dialogue, what separates it from humanity? When the people become as two-sided as cardboard cutouts and humanity has less personality than a computer, something is wrong. People need to reach out to one another.So many things can be said about the film's ending. I am still unsure exactly how it fits in, except to provide a contrast to the death imagery. It could be the BIRTH of an idea. It could provide innocence to a struggling race. It could simply be a random idea, or a connection in the circle of life. In any case, the film is fascinating. I can see its influence on "Star Wars," "Contact," "Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home" (the wall is like the cylinder that attempts to evaporate Earth's oceans. You never discover its true purpose), "Lost in Space" (new movie), and many others. We will probably never discover the true message of the film, but it is a nice challenge to try and figure it out ourselves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What made "2001..." such a memorable moviegoing experience for this young person back in the late 60's was the realization that the filmmaker required you to THINK for YOURSELF, a rarity then, before or after. So many films lead you by the nose to an obvious conclusion, then congratulate you for doing it. Kubrick challenged his audience and showed confidence in them. Many people complain that the meaning is too obscure for them to understand, and I admit I wasn't all clear on it until I read Arthur C. Clarke's novel. Watching the movie it is easy to miss some crucial information. But the experience was still overwhelming to me anyway, even when I wasn't fully sure of what I'd seen. A viewer shouldn't feel thick-headed because everything is not revealed to him or her at once. The movie has plenty of rewards anyway.To those who have grown up in the post-"Star Wars" era, the movie might seem especially slow and even dull. Indeed, when I saw it again around 1980 it seemed that way to me. But further perspective has once again placed it on its lofty pedestal. A young viewer today should try to keep in mind that in its time, it was showing off state-of-the art techniques.It's beyond my meager ability to give any comprehensive or definitive look at a phenomenon the magnitude of "2001". All I can say is it showed me that a work of art, in this case a movie, could truly be mind-expanding, and as such actually change one's life. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some would argue that this film lacks narrative cohesiveness, but I disagree. It is like a painting or a poem, you have to look at it more than once to fully appreciate it. Arthur C. Clarke himself said, "If you completely understand 2001, then we failed." The reason I like it is that it is so ambiguous that you can interpret it almost anyway you want to. Incidently, the film was based on Clarke's short story "The Sentinel." The book 2001 (also written by Clarke) was based on Clarke and Stanley Kubrick's screenplay. I must say, though, the novel did help me understand certain parts of the movie.Something else I like is its realistic depiction of space travel. It's also interesting to note that, really, the most "human" character in the film is the computer HAL.The film is fascinating for the questions it raises about mankind's place in the universe. It is truly a classic.I was happy to hear that there are plans to re-issue 2001 theatrically on New Year's Eve 2000. I've never seen it on the big screen, but I know it would be a different experience. If you're going to watch it on video, make sure you find the widescreen edition, as pan-and-scanning doesn't do it much justice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey... its only title brings undescriptable feelings to our minds. A film 20 years ahead of its time, where music and images form a perfect work of art. We're so lucky that Kubrick made the correct decision with the musical choice. Perhaps the original soundtrack composed specifically for the film was a great soundtrack (probably it was), but in the 'spatial dance' scene I can't imagine anything else but the Blue Danube. The result is an epic dance where the dancers are two pieces of human technology, with the Universe as the dance room and silence as the only witness.It's one of the few films I have seen that enhances the book on which it is based. The dialogue almost doesn't exist in this film, and also in this aspect we find that Kubrick made the perfect choice. Words aren't necessary when Nature talks with its own language. Even in the dialogue scenes the images take precedence over them, making the dialogue just a collateral element. As a conclusion, I must say that only a genius could make a film like this one. Kubrick is one of the few 20th century geniuses, together with Einstein, Rachmaninov, Picasso, Orson Welles...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a way, I consider myself "lucky" to have been able to have seen 2001 while Stanley Kubrick was still alive. His death was one of the few deaths in showbiz that has actually made me sad. I absolutely *love* this movie--note the screen name, people. :-) Kubrick did a great job of directing this movie (as he has always done :-) ) and Kier Dullea gives an excellent performance as Dave. My favorite character, though, would just have to be the evil computer, HAL, voiced by Douglas Rain. This movie shows that pretty soon, instead of us running the machines, the machines are going to be running us. I also thought the beginning, though a little boring and long, was interesting. The apes, who have learned to use bones and sticks in self defense, have just discovered the weapon, man's shield of protection, yet also its destruction. I think the special effects in this movie are awesome (even for 1968!). The part where Dave was entering Jupiter was cool. People who think this movie is pointless and is too confusing to get aren't just smart enough to appreciate *real* movies. I have to admit that I myself still haven't entirely figured out every little metaphor or puzzle in this movie, but just see 2001: A Space Odyssey, and you'll love it! THANK YOU, STANLEY KUBRICK!!

This must've really p****d-off a lot of people, who were expecting a space movie, but get out-takes from "One Million Years B.C." The scenery, however, is amazing.The second part is really something. Even if you're not a classical music fan, the flight to the moon, aptly paired with Johann Strauss' 'The Blue Danube' is truly breathtaking.The Jupiter Mission: The highlight of the film. Mixed with some great suspense is a look into the monotonous world of astronauts. And, of course, there's HAL 9000: A computer with a creepy monotone voice, a large motherboard, and kills of fellow crew members for kicks on a Saturday night.And now we come to the ending.'Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite' might go down in history books as the worst ending ever. Even if you understand it, it's still a waste, and the mystic wonder of Clarke's book is completely lost.Over all, "2001" is a marvelously directed film, but an unworthy adaptation of the original book.</fullReview>

I am rarely moved by the passing of a "public figure", but that was an exception. Having been born in 1946, my "coming of age" is intimately associated with Mr. Kubrick's greatest films, "Dr. Strangelove", "2001: A Space Odyssey", and "A Clockwork Orange". It has always seemed something of a miracle (or profound genius) to me that one man, almost single handedly, could have created three of the greatest masterpieces in all of the cinema within a period of less than a decade.Very, very few films are able to convey an equal or greater visual or emotional impact on successive viewings than they did on first viewing, but each of those films does. The passage of time has not diminished the genius or relevance of any of them in any way whatever; and in many ways, they seem even more relevant - or disturbing - than they did 30 years ago. It sounds like a cliche, but I do believe that I have lived in an era that has produced very few artistic geniuses - the only three that come to mind as having had a profound effect on my intellectual development are Tennessee Williams, Leonard Bernstein, and Stanley Kubrick. I must confess that when I first saw "2001", I was overwhelmed by the "space-time convolution" sequence (for want of a better description) near the end of the film, and I felt then that I did not understand it at all. But that one sequence etched itself into my mind so indelibly that I have been drawn back, again and again, to the film ever since. (In hindsight, I suspect that this was exactly the effect that Mr. Kubrick had in mind from the outset, rather than any specific or "profound" philosophical interpretation of the sequence.) That sequence is one of only three works of art that I can think of that, for me, can conjure up the illusion of a near "out-of-body" experience. (The other two being the final act of "Tristan und Isolde", and the trio from the last act of "Der Rosenkavalier"; all three are creations of almost indescribable audio-visual beauty and perfection.) In summary, good-bye, Mr. Kubrick. We shall all miss your towering, if hidden, presence, but we can take comfort in the knowledge that you have once again set out on your journey to whatever lies "beyond the infinite...."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am going to be very brief with my review. 2001 is a masterpiece. Plain and simple. Basically if you took a crazy dream of outer space, with Mozart &amp; Plato, add that to a healthy portion of the Twilight Zone, you would have 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. You really have to watch it like looking at a painting by Dali or Picasso. A film to observe, ponder, and definitely appreciate. We still have yet to see an outer space film that even comes close to 2001. A film from one of the greatest visionaries &amp; film-makers of all time. An under-rated director that will always be remembered &amp; immortalized through his art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I watched the face of the Star Child move across my TV screen earlier today I was overcome with emotion. Not just because of the loss of a great and singular talent, but just feeling this huge thing wash over me. Kubrick filled that last shot with this "this is greater than all of us" feeling that is overwhelming and awesome. And he spent the previous two and a half hours slowly building to that moment. A truly transcendental movie. And no, I was not stoned. God bless you, Mr. Kubrick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are mainly two reasons why I love 2001.Firstly, it's probably the most beautiful film I've ever seen. Being a big fan of space and astronomy I simply lose myself in the wonderful scenes of the shuttle docking with the space station, for example. And the fact that there are no annoying "spaceship engine fly-by" sound effects, but instead the magical Blue Danube Waltz is simply wonderful.Secondly, the religious and/or metaphysical speculations in the film are very well presented. Kubrick asks questions that no one can answer, and I think that's one of the main objects of this film. Certain contexts can not be comprehended by our human logic and reason. Of course there's nothing wrong with believing, but thinking you've got everything figured out and telling the rest how wrong they are is truly patronizing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the BEST films of the 1960's...A Masterpiece!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's saga of evolution from "The Dawn of Man" to the year 2001 is a brilliant tale of the physical and technical development of mankind. Everytime I hear "The Blue Danube", an immediate vision of outer space exploration fills my imagination...thanks to the wonder of this film. Today, we are already fulfilling that vision of Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke. When I first saw this film on the super wide screen in THX sound, I was blown out of my seat. The film is a close tie with Star Wars in my book as THE best in outer space movies. Notice I didn't say science fiction...I have never considered this movie to be science fiction, but a mere prophecy that has come true when it was first developed. Today, as all computer programmers know, computers do what we tell them to do through software programs. Many people have considered HAL by itself to be a villain in this movie. I say "NO". HAL was programmed by a human being. The human(s) who developed HAL were the TRUE enemy...judge for yourself. A true masterpiece of film making...it will last for centuries to come. Score: 10+ (out of 10).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick sticks a paintbrush in the psychic glue . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey, Stanley Kubrick's interpretation of the Arthur C. Clarke novel of the same name, is one of the most exact adaptations of any work of literature, in the history of cinema. Reading the novel, one has the sense that Kubrick worked in near complete juxtaposition with the mind of Clarke, to achieve the lyricism and profundity of the film. Kubrick sticks a paintbrush in the psychic glue binding together Clarke's lines and becomes the omnipotent caretaker in full, rendering beautiful images within cracked psychological milieu, as he channels his energy in graceful, sometimes violent arcs. In fact, the entire production could be viewed as taking place inside a great cosmic mind, the astronauts and spaceships and planets coalescing to form one cogent idea; HAL, the computer turned psychotic killer, with his red, glowing eye unflinching, appears like the opening of a severed nerve. Kubrick's version of Space Odyssey is a self-contained vision, an elaborate concept, in a caravan of others.Though staying true to the novel's storyline, Kubrick subtly red-shifts his adaptation to emphasize its more ethereal themes. A majority of the film acts as a subtext to the delirium of the finale, wherein he slowly weans the viewer off concepts of normalcy, diminishing his sense of time and spatial orientation. Though a first-time viewer might see this as artistic hogwash, it is an expertly placed, visual tailspin designed to displace the viewer in preparation for what is to come. It is important to express the film's underlying theme, here, as it pertains to Kubrick's craftsmanship.Simply, 2001: A Space Odyssey is about man and his various vessels and the wombs that support him throughout his existence. Many of the spaceships and futuristic renderings resemble faces and bodies; the crew's vessel bound for Jupiter even appears to have a spine. It seems that Kubrick is attempting to say that man is in a constant state of transition, and his various forms get him there. Meanwhile, his universe, whether it be a womb, or the container of the cosmos, slowly prepares him for his next great transformation he will undergo. His gestation is the length of his life. And as we see in the final moments, the main character Dave passes through a vortex into a world that is exempt from time, where his physical environment--a small, furnished house with food--remains nothing more than a loose interpretation of his previous life. There, he lives out his days--a matter of minutes for the viewer--as his preconceptions of reality are removed. No time and no logical sequencing of events, except that of aging. In this way, he is prepared for the greatest leap imaginable: a rebirth into the cosmic womb. His alien caretakers, who are never once glimpsed, deliver him accordingly.Kubrick deftly delivers the viewer into the movie's finale, concurrently disorienting him along with Dave. Throughout the course of the film, Kubrick is in no hurry to get things done. He allows it full lease on his faculties, and as a result of his patience, Space Odyssey captivates, intrigues and redefines. Aided by adequate performances by the cast, it is by and far one of the most important movies of our time. In truth, it is about every man's journey. It unnerves as well as uplifts. It is life and death as seen from the eyes of the hopeful, healthy, optimistic soul.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion, simply the greatest motion picture ever made, period. If you haven't seen it, you've never seen cinema. If you haven't seen it on the big screen... well, you haven't seen it. I first saw "2001" at the Cinerama Dome in its first re-release in the early 70s, and it was the movie that made me want to make movies. Every time I've seen it since, it just reconfirms that feeling.As he always did (the saddest past tense of the Century), Kubrick took a genre and made it his own. What could have been routine science fiction was pure genius in his hands -- and he did it by paying acute attention to reality. No other film that I can think of has had the cojones, for example, to have **silence** in outer space, and the only other film I can think of that didn't get lazy and use "Star Trek Gravity" is "Apollo 13." (One moment in "2001" involves a sort of explosion in a vacuum. It's done in real-time (no Slo-Mo), without sound. In other words, accurately -- and the effect is amazing.)Comparison: the vastly inferior "2010." Everything Kubrick worked so hard for was thrown out in the sequel. Apparently, in nine years, outer space developed both sound and gravity. (And, Irony department -- in "2001," the US and USSR (remember them?) are not really enemies any more. In "2010," they're on the brink of war. Another indication that Mr. Kubrick was a visionary in more ways than one.)But, there really aren't words to describe "2001," other than to say that the scope of the story is enormous, the implications thought-provoking -- and every single effect in it (all of which still stand up today) was done without benefit of digital or CGI. Take that, George Lucas...</fullReview>

Specially the evolution of human mind that is being represented by the black monolith, also this film make as the primal statement that this evolution it's show when the human being finds a better way to survive and breaking of some their paradigms. HAL 9000 a human like computer find inside of "him", the same dilemma, trying to find a way to survive, no matter what or why. Another amazing statement, it's that spontaneous evolution is not possible as well as a rational faculty that is not a born giving of the human kind.

From the Dawn of Man to the great beyond, this movie has as much to say as anything I have ever seen. Even though the film was released a year before we landed on the moon, it doesn't seem dated or campy at all. It could have very well been made in 1999 (or even 2001) since it is so open-ended and broad in its message. I really enjoyed the scene where an ape ("moonwatcher") throws a bone used as a weapon into the sky only for a jump cut to take us 4,000 years into the future. The bone is now a space shuttle and the setting is space. Upon learning of Mr. Kubrick's death last week I had a vision of a "Star Stanley" floating towards earth as the music swells and the credits roll. His death is a loss to us all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A work of art to be seen only on the big screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the likely event you have only seen this movie on video or television, you must know that '2001: A Space Odyssey' can only be understood and appreciated fully on the big screen.Only two years old when '2001' appeared in theatres, I became familiar with the music and the concept of the movie a few years later by listening to the soundtrack. My father purchased it shortly after release, and it survives today among my collection of '70s and '80s rock LPs. When NBC broadcast '2001' in the mid-'70s, I didn't know I would have to wait through many years of pan-and-scan cable TV showings to finally enjoy it in the most impressive environment of all: an IMAX theatre.Back around 1990, the IMAX RiverCenter in San Antonio presented a science fiction series in its unique facility. Running on a modified projector designed to expand the original image as large as possible onto the IMAX screen, '2001' was deeply affecting and mesmerizing. Stanley Kubrick's artistry and craftsmanship are realized in amazing fashion in '2001', which to this day stands at the pinnacle of movie making. His marvelous adaptation of music, and the use of long camera shots, disturbing sounds, prolonged silence, routine-sounding dialogue, average-looking characters, and highly-realistic visual effects set an extraordinary example. In the days before computer imagery, when models, matte paintings, in-camera tricks, and other conventional methods were all a director had to use, this movie went beyond the state of the art. It also went much deeper than normal thought, challenging the viewer to examine his purpose and place in a world which now seems so small in a universe of endless mystery. '2001' will be enjoyed by many, hated by some, and studied by many generations to come.I strongly recommend you buy or rent '2001: A Space Odyssey' in widescreen format, find the biggest television possible, and view it alone or with a quiet companion without interruption. You won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A profound, philosophical vision</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ironically there are only a few science fiction films that have the ability to inspire us and not thrill us, Stanley Kubrick´s masterpiece "2001: A Space Odyssey" is one of those few. It tells the story of our evolution from ape to man, human beings first encounter with never seen aliens, and the eventual chaos of human dependence on machines. Bringing an almost absurd narrative style into modern cinema, Kubrick created the perhaps most daring film ever, special, still today, for the lack of dialog and apparent story. Instead of thrilling our minds the director made a bold and profound philosophical statement, not only on man and the existence of other beings in the universe, but on a higher entity guiding and controlling our evolution. It never becomes clear what the strange monolith that appears every time man evolves, stands for, nor what it is. It could just as well be a religious allegory but unfortunately Kubrick´s tragic death will prevent us from ever knowing. Nor is it in anyway clear what the last 15 minutes represents, and where the astronaut goes can in no way be answered. Many theories has and will be written down, but I say let it be, let there be one moment in film history that baffles and confuses more than gives any explanation. For I think that was Kubrick´s goal, to inspire our minds to think, to wonder and to let us get a glimpse beyond infinity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on Arthur C. Clark's short story, The Sentinal, this film is comprised of a series of scenes which tell the story of Man's intellectual development from ape to space-farer. This film is always the first one I think of when the subject of great motion pictures arises.The opening sequence with the Also Sprak Zarathustra background music makes one's hair literally stand on end. The obelisk-induced, twigging-to-bone-as-weapon scene is absolutely thrilling and the morphing of the flung-in-the-air bone into space shuttle and space station dancing to The Blue Danube is positively inspired.Kubrick gives HAL 9000, the computer on the mission spacecraft is given real character and personality.The final sequences in which Keir Dullea encounters himself during his own aging process and we are then treated to the rebirth of human intellect in the Star-Child embryo floating there in space with eyes of wisdom are unforgettable.If you haven't seen this majestically beautiful film - do so.

		<shortDescription>The only realistic space movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my early favorite. Though Star Wars is flashy and fun, it breaks the laws of physics and gets the space travel all wrong.Kubrick lets the spacecraft carry the story forward quietly and majestically, yet at no point is it boring. "2001" is really the opposite of the loud, short-attention span space movies that have always been the norm. You must keep watching because there are countless detailed things going on at all times--antennas turning, computer screens flashing, machines smoothly operating--that are all critical to the story, yet not explained except visually. It's a real treat for the moviegoer because it assumes some intelligence on your part.There are really only a few minor technical flaws I could point out (but why bore you?). It is amazingly advanced for its time (1968). It has the look and feel, the sights and sounds of what spacecraft MUST be in order to function properly.So what if the dialog is uncomfortable, stiff and stilted? This is one of the only movies to get it right technically. It also introduces HAL 9000, the hypnotically perfect-talking computer, the most famous movie computer character of them all.The first 20-minute part, the prelude, consists of proto-humans (hairy apes!) roaring and bashing each other with animal bones. It's bearable because of what comes at the end of the prelude. The transition from savagery, as the beast triumphs over his foe and hurls his thighbone club into the air, to civilization, as the bone turns into a satellite gracefully gliding by in orbit (to the opening bars of "The Blue Danube Waltz") sends chills up and down my spine every time.The last 20 minutes are nothing but psychedelic colors and absurdly out-of-place scenes, as the astronaut Dave goes through a portal to "the infinite." It's a sharp contrast to the rational, paced logic of the middle section of the film, similar to the deep contrast between the pre-civilization primates and the space-faring people of 2001.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kubrick has his finger thrust into every pie in this project, even designing most of the special effects (as well as the more mundane: producing and directing). It also bears his trademark; a sinister soundtrack running throughout the film, which regularly reaches unbearable crescendos, before sudden silencePart one sees a bunch of apes getting the low-down on rapid career development from a 10ft-tall headstone. Thus using a combination of tools, co-operation and a great deal of shouting, they are eventually able to step off-planet. Around this time, another slab is found on the Moon and 20th Century mankind suddenly gets a very real sense of being close to a great and long sought-after discovery (a very 60s notion ? all that ?Age of Aquarius' stuff). I like the shot where the astronauts are crowding round the slab looking very similar (obviously with the addition of spacesuits) to their earlier chimpanzee counterpartsPart two of the movie moves on to tackle AI and whether we're just machines. Great, great cinematography. Hal steals every scene with his Prozac-happy delivery style: `I honestly think you ought to calm down; take a stress pill and think things over, Dave.' Awesome amounts of irregular breathing.Part three is the final FX sequence followed by the `let's put that thing in a zoo' type ending, with smatterings of reincarnation as Dave becomes Starchild.Several devices run throughout the film. One is the extensive use of long pauses in the dialogue and the other is the abundant use of distressing sound effects (like the heavy breathing, the chimps screeching, alarms, etc). A possible third being the intense use of colour in deep space. (Though it could just have been showcasing the talents of the new ?Colourama' processing technique ? dunno).The Apollo astronauts went to the premiere of this movie, before going to the Moon and apparently got a big kick out of it. Although I'm sure it was entertaining, you can't help wondering whether they were just a little freaked by it all. If Neil Armstrong felt a bit of resistance as he pushed the flag into the ground and half wondered whether there was a black slab of granite beneath his feet?I love this movie. It's visionary, original and plain weird. And the good news is: there's only two years to go.</fullReview>

A worthy example if one was ever called upon to defend film as art, Kubrick's perfectly paced masterpiece manages and manipulates the film grammar in ways unseen since Citizen Kane. Wholly original in its execution of the texture of space travel, its technical achievements are virtually unsurpassable. No film before or since has so fully realized the majesty of the reaches beyond the earth nor the fragility of our own concepts of such places.

		<shortDescription>"Getting It" can take a while</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was amazed at how many did not "get it" at first. Then again, I did not either. I saw this movie when it first came out in '68. Then, I was impressed by the "Thus Spake Zarustha" opening sequence, the technology of the space station, moon shuttle, the Jupiter probe and HAl, the dysfunctional computer. I saw the ending sequence as a "cool psychedelic trip." Life went on, about 30 years worth, I went back to school and decided to write about science fiction for an English Comp essay. It only then dawned on me that there was more than one level to this film. Now, I see two interwoven themes and I think one was original with Clarke, the other with Kubrick. Clarke has given us the broadest canvass of all: the evolution of life and inteligence in the universe. The aliens are so far ahead of us that we can no better grasp their technology than a chimp in Tanzania could comprehend a 747 flying overhead. That is why the trip "through the monolith" appears to us as fantastical magic. Kubrick's theme is more set in the present of the film. The aliens have given humanity the gift of technology and one million years later we have crawled into the technological cocoon. We must emerge or stagnate or even perish, as is symbolized by the death of the crew members who have kept been suspended in the probe's cocoons. Now "through the monolith" becomes the transcendent act, the symbolic rebirth of humanity as the "star-child", which, again is something beyond present comprehension.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best SciFi Movie Ever! Possibly the best movie ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001 is the most stunning and thought provoking movie that ever was, and probably ever will be!The use of classical music sets the tone of the marvelous visual imagery Kubrick displays for us. What else can REAL space be compared to other there sheer ballet and gracefulness.The use of silence in this movie is spectacular!! I can just imagine what it was like being in the theatres in 1968 and watching these scenes in utter silence.My belief as to why Bowman and Poole were made to appear so robotic and emotionless was because of what Kubrick (marvelous director that he is) was intending to show us ... that humans have relied so much on computers to do their thinking, that man has stopped evolving intellectually and eventually will die (just like the apemen at the beginning of the film). It was the monolith that came to assist them with their survival and mental growth.Stanley Kubrick wanted his audiences to THINK during this film because, in essence, that is what the film is telling us.In the film, Bowman was able to outsmart HAL (the most intelligent computer ever) by getting back into the ship after he wouldn't let him in. Bowman was thus rewarded by the aliens (keepers of the monoliths) by becoming the Star Child (a creature of pure thought)!Once we stop thinking, man will not evolve further and eventually will die.Science fiction DOES NOT get any better than this!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most intellectually challenging film of them all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Calling 2001 the best film of all time is a distinct possibility, but calling it my favourite film of all time is a dead certainty. No other film before or since has had the effect on me that it has.Firstly, I have to say to those who find it pointless or confusing that it does indeed have a point and makes perfect sense once you discover it's meaning. For me, this took over 20 years and a great deal of thought and life experience (and a fair amount of reading). Don't have the time or the inclination? Stick to Star Wars (an enjoyable but totally different kind of film).I was only ten when I saw this film for the first time. Did I understand more than 20% of it? No. Did I wish to? Passionately. I'd go so far as to say that a desire to understand this movie played a significant role in the direction of my intellectual development. That's a heck of a lot to attribute to a single film, but I'll stick to this assertion nevertheless.I still experience a feeling of awe and wonderment every time I re-visit 2001, even though I now feel that I pretty much understand the film. Partly, I suppose this is a recollection of my first viewing as a child when I understood little of it, partly the debt of gratitude that I owe to the mental journey I undertook to finally "Get it". If anything, It has more of an emotional impact on me now in my understanding than ever before.I'm also the only person that I know who feels this way about it, so if you don't "get it", don't feel badly. You aren't alone. If you feel the same way about, then we share a bond.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sci-Fi work of art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001 is a science fiction film that does not fit into the usual sci-fi mold with predictable plots and aliens that either look human or are monsters. It begins with beauty and mystery. Kubrick's film is one of the most scientifically accurate sci-fi films I have seen. Space travel in the vacuum of space is always silent and going somewhere takes time, for instance it takes months to reach a planet.Kubrick's 2001 takes this approach and uses it to present huge themes; human evolution and contact with alien super intelligence, conflict between humans and computers. Almost all sci-fi films present human and space alien encounters as routine. Kubrick presents such contact as so strange that it is beyond our human comprehension. He puts you in several scenes with no explanation as an observer experiencing incredible events. You are left with questions. What is the monolith, the light show and the star child at the end of the film? There are answers but you have to search for them (such as by reading Arthur C. Clarke's "2001").Like all great films, Kubrick's suggests further questions; can alien intelligence reach the level of God? Will we destroy ourselves unless an alien intelligence helps us?2001 makes excellent use of symbolism. The movie's main musical theme is from Strauss's "Also Sprach Zarathustra". This is also the title of Nietzsche's poem about the emergence of the superman; the star child? or the monolith?. The bone rising from the violent ape-human becomes an orbiting nuclear weapon. Distrust and paranoia slowly builds between the U.S and Russians finally climaxing with the computer HAL.On top of all this the film's look is stunning. After 30 years it's sets and special effects are still up to today's standards. 2001 is one of the few films that can be called a great work of art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick proved just how much of a genius he really is when he made this film. Every time I watch this film I'm amazed at the fact that is a film that is so close to perfection. Yes, it is an ambiguous film--I'll admit that the first time I saw it, I didn't really understand it. I thought: this is a total psychedelic sixties movie. But I read many articles that were written about it, and when I saw it again a few years ago, it made perfect sense to me. I think that the best thing about 2001 is that the viewer is left to interpret the "meaning" of this film in his or her own way. Needless to say, the special effects in this film are some of the best ever in a motion picture--and this is a film from 1968. It is one of the best sci-fi films ever and one of the best films of all time. It's one of my favorite films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was doing my Linguistics 101 final project this year on Speech Synthesis, I found a reference in a source to HAL of 2001. Not more than a week later, I was watching it on laserdisc at Uris Library (at Cornell FYI), fascinated by every moment. This is not a movie to rent with a bunch of friends and poke fun of the whole way through-- there is so much that can be missed that way. But I have to say my favorite kinds of movies are this type: the type that are best viewed alone, in the dark, and uninterrupted (I actually watched 2001 in two segments since the library closed at midnight!). There is so much to discuss and describe and think about after you're done watching the movie- no way possible to list it all here! I could tell how much I liked it, though, when I found myself bringing it up with people often in conversation ("Have you ever seen 2001? Well, remember the part...") There are an infinite number of interpretations possible, and that, I think, is what best can describe this classic. Definitely watch it, but don't expect to enjoy a light, quick watch-- because it's so much more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001 is a film that cannot be described easily. The best advice to give is just to watch the film. The themes that are expressed in the film make you think about where we are in the grand scheme of things, and where we are headed as a civilization. In a way, 2001 has come true. Poole and Bowman were at the mercy of HAL. In this day and age, we are pretty much at the mercy of computers. What will happen when computers start to think for themselves? Let's just hope that when they do, they don't see us as a threat to their programming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The art of cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001 is art. There are few films in today's movie theatres that could be interpreted as true art. Clark and Kubrick did not intend this movie to tell you what you are and what to think, but rather make you think. Just reading the comments about this movie, tells you that there are many ways to analyze or understand it, but there is no one answer for it. Art does not enforce its views on you, but asks you to view it. You may hate this movie, but do so for the right reason, once you have thought about it. 'Getting it' is not a requirement, thinking is. As much as the movie (and this is my view - and others I guess) tried to show this, humans have become arrogant and intellectually lazy. 2001 had the vision of telling us which way humanity is going in 1968, a reminder for what we could become, but I think there is no monolith out there that will guide us to a new direction, but rather we have to find it ourselves - think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>my favourite... *both* see it *and* read the book!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading the comments, and talking to people, this seems to be one of those movies where you either like it or you don't. I've never heard anyone say "Oh, it's okay..." - they either go on about how good it was or how bad it was. It's probably my favourite movie, so I guess that makes me one of the former.I first saw this movie with no real expectations; someone told me I had to see it. I remember thinking the ape-men scene was drawn out, but it wasn't drawn out the second time I watched it. It was probably the person I was with, which often influences how I feel about certain aspects of movies.To someone who has always dreamed about spaceflight, and loved the "Blue Danube" ( :) ), both from an early age, this movie was very little else but beautiful. As a matter of fact, it was a childhood piano teacher who first recommended the book series to me -- I only remembered this after I'd seen it twice.I read the book eventually, and loved it. Normally, I like the book over the movie. Occasionally, I like the movie over the book. This was neither. To only see the movie, or only read the book, is to get only part of an amazing story. They have slightly different plotlines, both of which seem right; even though they contradict each other in the logical sense, they really augment each other and build into something more than either one alone.I recently found the book, "The Lost Worlds of 2001" by Arthur C. Clarke. It is out of print, and I had been searching for it in used bookstores for awhile. It describes some of the process of making the movie and writing the book/screenplay. It also has previous versions of parts of the story.Here is another place where I break one of my usual "rules". Normally, given two versions of a poem or other piece of writing, I will prefer the first one whether I know it is first or not. In this case, I prefer the finished product. But the different universes that open up in the alternate stories are interesting, too...they just seem (and probably are) unfinished and the eventual end result is more satisfying somehow.As far as the Stargate sequence toward the end, it was just a blob of confusing bright colours to me until the last two times I saw it. Given eyeglasses that block out a lot of light, I noticed that there are actually landscapes and things in there besides just abstract forms!The Starchild is yet another thing in this film that I find it difficult to use anything other than superlatives about. It embodies one of my pet theories about things - that in order to see things the way they are, a person has to get rid of everything attached to their perceptions and revert to the perceptions of an infant; also, that going "forward" often looks like going "backward"...I personally have no problem with the length of this film; it's not something I really took into consideration. It may have something to do with being able to stare out a car window at nothing for a longer period of time -- 2001 is way more interesting than that, and holds my attention more easily.If you see this movie, read the book. If you've read the book, see the movie. Otherwise you're not getting the whole picture.</fullReview>

It is rare that a film improves on the book from which it is derived, but this manages it comfortably.

		<fullReview>Many people talk about how many times they've seen a particular movie as evidence of it's greatness.I've seen 2001 twice.I hired it out from the video store when I was about 13 (about 6 short years ago), and it blew my mind. Sure, it was technically sophisticated, but how was it that such a great reputation was bestowed on a film that was honestly just so weird-ass and boring???No dialogue for half an hour!F***ing apes running around hitting each other, and throwing sticks in the air!A mildly interesting segment with a mean-ass pod thing that tries to eat a spaceman, and a rad bit where one jumps into outer space, closes the door and all the sound turns on was the highlight of the movie.Then more bullshit!Weird noises and whines!Ten or twenty (felt like a hundred) minutes of flashing lights! Wakes up in an old room with an old man with a glass of wine! THEN A GIANT FLOATING PLANET BABY!!!WHAT WAS THIS BULLSHIT????This film LOOKED good, but made no sense whatsoever! And when a film made no sense when I was 13, I got bored! And when a film gets boring, that usually means it's ROOTED!!!My sister watched the film at about the same time, and I distinctly remember walking in during the movie's final moments and finding her sitting upside down on her head in her chair, apparently in an attempt to prevent her natural reflexes from clicking the 'eject' button.However, I read a bit about the film ("What's this 'rebirth of man crap', and how was I supposed to think of that?" I was thinking!) and optimistically kept a copy of the film in case it might have later value for me when I was older and wiser.As it turned out, I never watched that tape again. The years came and went, and I saw many more movies (insert nostalgic montage sequence here), read many more reviews, and the movie even came out in a new 70mm print at a few cinemas a couple of years ago. I can't remember the occasion, but the flyer (I have it blue-tacked to the roof above my bed, I collect that sort of crap) reads "Happy Birthday Hal.", but I still couldn't bring myself to sit through it again. And eventually, I realised that I needed to see it again, simply hoping to 'get it', suspecting that if I did, I might even like it.Then a 30th anniversary video edition came out in Widescreen, which I subsequently purchased and so it came to be that I viewed '2001: A Space Odyssey' the second time.And it blew my mind again.Every thing that I'd ever read about the film was right there before me, clear as day! Everything that I loved about Kubrick (by this stage I'd seen and loved Clockwork Orange, Spartacus, Full Metal Jacket, Barry Lyndon, and to a lesser extent The Shing and Lolita) was there, mechanical characters and direction expressing extraordinary themes. It was like Kubrick concentrate! I loved every single frame of the movie, it was like he'd taken every shots and scenes that grabbed me in ways I never realised why, from every movie I'd ever seen, and thrown them together in an editing suite into 2 and a bit hours worth that just happened to privilege the most important, mind-boggling, revolutionary, ambitious and all-encompassing themes ever existent.I'd crap on about what it means, but I don't really know. I could think about it for ages, but I'd just end up at the same place again. If you want to know what it means, try reading someone else's comments here! But I don't think anybody, including Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke know totally what it means, I don't think that is possible with any movie. It reads specifically to each person who sees it, like every film or text does. And I think I should shut up soon, but not before I make a couple of points.This is probably a rash statement, and I've been searching for holes in it and haven't found any yet. "2001: A Space Odyssey" is the only true Science Fiction movie. If you take the Sci Fi from "Star Wars" (I film I admittedly love more, it is PERHAPS my all time favorite), you're left with what? An adventure movie, part western, part Japanese samurai film. If you take the Science Fiction out of "2001", you're left with nothing. "2001" IS science fiction."2001: A Space Odyssey" is by critical consensus one of the best movies ever made (I'm sure you didn't know that), and one of the top five I have ever seen. I have placed the 'Keeping 2001 tape' incident as one of the wisest things I have ever done in my life, even if I ended up taping "Hamburger Hill" over it.Thanks for reading!I have now just realized that the time I spent writing this overlong review could have been better spent watching the movie again.

		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick is truly one of the cinematographic geniuses of this century. Watching 2001: A Space Odyssey is like staring at a breathtaking work of art for hours, and seeing things within it that you've never seen before. I have seen this film several times, and every time I watch it,I notice something else that I didn't before. Every Kubrick film seems to have this quality. Although Kubrick denies the storyline of having any significant message, many things can be derived from it, which although abstract, are classic. For instance, the monolith as the symbol of the place where all life is created, and it being the door between death and rebirth. Also, notice that the music is chaotic when something is unknown, e.g. the gorillas who are afraid of the strange black stone, and later, the humans on the moon after discovering the monolith. However, when something is discovered, i.e. the use of tools by prehistoric man, or the beautiful satellite scenes from space, the music tends to be classical and pleasing to the ear. This film, as unique as it is, might frighten some viewers away, but I urgeeveryone to watch it more than once, and I assure you thatyou won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

I was confused. After watching it, I was disappointed in Kubrick (an amazing director) for making such a convoluted film that made DePalma's "Mission Impossible" seem like a model of narrative cohesion. As I was lying in bed though, the film began to bother me (which is more than I can say for Mission Impossible). The more I thought about it, the more the film made sense. I don't want to spoil anything, but Kubrick's message will become clear. Definitely see this film, but don't let your examination of it end when the credits roll and the lights come up.</fullReview>

In the case of 2001: A Space Odyssey, it is not nearly enough, one could write entire volumes of text on the psyche of the troubled H.A.L. computer, the philosophical underpinnings of human contact/manipulation by aliens, the de-humanizing of the human race by technology. Every frame of this film has more than one meaning to it, and every nuance could be examined in detail for years and one could still walk away with a different interpretation every time. Many have criticized this film as being too "slow and boring", I for one applaud Mr. Kubrick (and Mr. Clarke) for having the courage to provide a paitent and sometimes painfully exact depiction of what real space travel would be like. There are so many reasons 2001 is my all time favorite film. Perhaps it's because it's the best hard science fiction film yet made, and has yet to be equalled, let alone surpassed. Perhaps also it is one of the most visually stunning and technically perfect SF films made. For whatever reason, 2001 IS the BEST SF film ever made, at least until Mr. Kubrick gets around to making AI.</fullReview>

In 1968, before man walked on the moon, was made a fabulously artistic movie with an amazing story. It's broken up into smaller movies (as is every kubrick)the first is about discovering the use of the tool. Some creatures, just below us in the evolutionary scale come upon a monolith and they learn to use the tool. We see a bone thrown up in the air making the greatest cut ever which goes to 2001 where we see a space station floating through space. That introduces the second movie, a journey to Jupiter to invest a strange signal. On the way their computer HAL starts to dislike them and try to kill them. The third movie can barely be understood by men, I think I do but am probably wrong, it cannot be summed up, it's just amazing. The goal of 2001 was to arise more questions than answers which it did, if you really don't understand a thing, the also wonderful 2010 answers a lot. Unfortunately the events of 2001 have been delayed because of Nixon and Challenger and other events in the NASA's budget. The only Sci-fi(fact)movie that is as realistic in its story telling as 2001 is Contact which is also fabulous, I seriously hope that you can all appreciate the beauty that this movie beholds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still the best film of all-time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the movie that made me fall in love with movies --needless to say it also my all-time favorite. 2001 is a movie that demands that you watch it and not listen to it. It refuses to spell out what is going on although it has a perfectly coherent plot. Its ending is debatable only to those who can't make up their minds(I think it is all about Man's transcendence --as opposed to evolution-- into the next level of existence). It is a film for right-brained --i.e. non-verbal, non-linear-- thinkers. 2001 is more than 30 years old and like all classic films has the freshness of today's latest release. Even the f/x have held up over time. I think the "Voyage Beyond Infinity" sequence ranks as one of the top 5 f/x sequences ever. I was 14 years old when I first saw it (about 5 years after it was first released) and I don't think I've ever fully returned from it. (This movie was the most powerful "say NO to drugs" statement ever made to me.) There have only been a handful of films over years that can be classified as "pure cinema" and 2001 is the best of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001 is not only the definitive science fiction movie, but also a definitive Movie in the true sense of the word. That is, this is a story told with visuals, everything else is peripheral(though, in this case, brilliant as well). One of the things that makes it so definitive is its ability to function on multiple levels. There is the straight literal level, then the symbolic and truly meaningful level, and there is even room enough for the personal level. There is also the technical level of direction, acting, special effects, and music, all of which are brilliantly done by Kubrick and his team. This is a truly profound movie which has influenced every movie that followed it. For example, the ending sequence has been imitated in such movies as the Abyss and Contact(just to name a few recent). All in all, to say this is an excellent movie is an understatement, but one has to be in the right mood to see this movie. A certain amount of work is required of the viewer for this movie to truly work, and for some people it doesn't. However, this movie is probably my favorite of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE Directorial Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick reaches the height of his directorial genius with this movie. There is no movie like it in existence. The closest thing I can think of is Fantasia because of the intense junction of the visual with the soundtrack and because of the otherwise silence of the film. As a science fiction film it is far more accurate scientifically than most movies made today. Also, the special effects are amazing even if we don't consider that it was made in the 60's. Stanley Kubrick paints some very beautiful pictures in this movie. His sense of a pure mood which pervades the movie is one of his greatest achievements. And the movie is also very though -provoking and compelling. There are many scenes in the movie which are unforgettable, and as a homogenous whole it is a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found 2001 exhilarating the first time I watched it, awe-inspiring the second and (having read the novel), understandable on the third. Even though there is so little dialogue, there is much story to make it worth watching again. I've probably seen it about ten times. HAL, for me, is the most marvelous paranoid android: "I saw your lips moving" was the best line, and Dave's total above-humanity approach is an amazing piece of acting. By far, the stars of 2001 are its episodic nature and stunning set-piece visuals (the PanAm flight, the jog, inside HAL's brain, inside Dave's brain ) make it.

		<fullReview>This film is just so boring. I tried to like it. I really did. There were so many times during the movie when I thought that I could just shut it off and do something else but I thought there had to be something of value from this. Spoiler Alert: There wasn't. I'll start at the beginning. The first twenty minutes of the film is just monkeys doing stuff. That's really all there is. That is until this giant rectangle shows up (I have no idea what it is, the movie never explains it) The monkeys act differently but it's never really elaborated on. Thousands of years later, the same rectangle is found again on the moon. Then they send these guys on a spaceship on some mission (I can't really remember what it was for) However, that's not until two 7- minute scenes of a ship floating through space with the Blue Danibue in the background. Not zooming. Not speeding. Floating. It goes on forever. The whole movie is like this. It moves painfully slow and there's barely any character development. Now let's talk about the villain, HAL 9000. Many regard him as one of the best if not the best sci-fi villain ever. How? HAL is completely useless. He adds nothing to the story, other than wasting more time (yay) He's not even really evil. His dastardly plot is to defend himself and save the mission. How is that evil. You could argue that he kills one of the main characters, but again, it's defense. Late in the movie, the two main guys plot to terminate HAL because they suspect that he might be malfunctioning. Well what would you do if you were in the middle of space with two other people and both of them were plotting to kill you? try to stop them? Well that obviously means that you're evil. Anyway, HAL is killed in the most drawn out way possible, keeping with the tone of the movie. See, HAL is a computer and the only way to shut him down is to remove a bunch of computer chips. So the remaining crew member removes them and it takes forever! I'm serious it takes an eternity. And HAL's ingenious plan to stop him from doing this is to keep repeating "Please stop." over and over and over and over and over and ..... Okay you get it. So after taking an hour to kill HAL, Dave (I just remembered his name) pilots the ship into..... I have absolutely no idea. All I know is that there are a bunch of flashing lights and Dave makes some funny faces which I guess are supposed to be disturbing. For all I know, this could just be Spaceballs 1 going at Ludicrous Speed. Now, we see this old guy in a bed and the camera cuts from Dave to the old guy over and over again. Dave Old Guy Dave Old Guy Dave Old Guy Dave Giant Baby Floating Over the Bed. What the hell?! SO the baby travels through space to Earth and just stares at it for a few seconds and...... the movie ends. So, I have no idea what happened. The rectangle? Never explained. Old Guy? Never explained. Giant Space Fetus? Never explained and I had the most questions about that too. I didn't bother to mention all of the moments which just drag out for an eternity, but trust me, there's plenty. While the theme song is iconic and epic and the special effects are amazing, it's not worth sitting for two and a half hours to watch almost nothing happen for the majority of the time to come to a resolution where you have no idea what happened. I've heard that the book explains more than the movie does and I plan to read it in the future, but would it have been so hard to get a narrator for this to tell us what was going on. I'm not saying hand me the plot on a silver platter, I'm just saying give me some idea as to what's happening. Seriously, how awesome would it be to have Orson Welles narrate this movie. Now that would be worth it. Now if you're trying to find treatment for insomnia, then this movie is for you. Otherwise, stay away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"2001: A Space Odyssey" is one of the most fascinating movies I've ever seen. Even when I first watched this, walking in with no familiarity, I was bewildered, but still couldn't look away. It asks huge questions and let's the viewer come up with their own answer (that's a gamble; rarely does it come off just right). Different interpretations of the film's meaning abound. Unconventional is a great way to describe this.But when all is said and done, it's an adventure, as grand as they come; space travel, artificial intelligence, evolution, the unknown It's one of my favorite movies, and I'm always pleased to see it being screened at revival houses. And if you happen on one showing this in 70mm, pounce on it; the argument can be made that "2001" relies less on plot and more on sight and sound, which means people aren't kidding when they say this is an experience.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2001: A Space Odyssey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, my mind was officially blown by my second undertaking of a Stanley Kubrick feature. Being a huge fan of auteur David Lynch, I was greatly looking forward to watching another film of Kubrick's. Before this viewing, I had only seen The Shining (and who hasn't) so I was ready for more Kubrick. This 1968 Sci-fi epic starring Keir Dullea, Gary Lockwood, and William Sylvester tells the cautionary tale of modernization and the advancement of technology, and what that advancement means for the human race. When a group of astronauts is sent into deep space, they realize the horrors of the possibility of technology taking over humanity. Dr. Heyward Floyd (William Sylvester) eagerly and hastily sets up another deep space mission which he provides little public details of to those around him. Dr. Floyd hurried to the Florida launch station with his guarded secret to attend a meeting with a top official that would get his project off the ground. He then learns that a discovery has been made below the moon's crest that predates human existence. Energized by this undebatable proof of extraterrestrial life, Heyward assembles a group of scientists to investigate the phenomenon, only to be turned away by the piercing scream of a magnetic disturbance once they arrive at the scene. The conscious members on board the mission are Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood), they are on the trip with other members "hibernating" until they reach Jupiter. Hal 9000, an artificially intelligent supercomputer maintained many ship functions and interacted with the crew daily. After a series of events in which Hal attempts to cease communication with Earth, the crew decides to disconnect Hal fearing their isolation from Earth. Sensing the emerging disdain of the crew, Hal attempts to cause the death of the crew to protect its own operating system. A fight between man and machine ensues and the battle can only be won by willpower, and endurance, and which party can overcome the crippling fear of isolation. I was glad I was forewarned about the need to "stick with" this film. It opens with a 20 minute plus sequence that felt like I had strapped in for a Nat. Geo. documentary. The audience is 25 minutes into the film before there is any dialogue, which was an incredible feat for a modern film. The sound completely takes over the film overwhelming the audience with its ever presence. The sound acts as an independent character revealing the slow deterioration of the crew involved in the mission. So incredible was the sound that it is almost enough to drive the audience crazy, akin to the characters who are mentally declining as the film progresses. When there was more than hollow noise and high, shrill moans, there was an overabundance of Strauss music, adding to the out of this world experience of the mission. The acting in this film was wonderful, with the strongest performance being the unseen Hal 9000 who commands the picture. The cinematography is nothing short of masterful, and I realized quickly why Stanley Kubrick's direction is so oft cited as brilliance. The sets were so intricate and grandiose that they added to the mysticism and realism of a space ship flying through the galaxy. The colors are also spectacular adding to the brilliance of the plot. Kubrick, in a display of his directorial prowess, utilizes the most inventive camera angles I have ever seen, creating an unimaginative level of depth to his film. Kubrick is certainly an auteur and one that I can't wait to explore more of. Isolation is a force in which can bring the most intense human behavior. Silence and being alone can lead to the mental decomposition in even the strongest of individuals. The intensity of isolation was fully explored in 2001: A Space Odyssey. Hal 900 seeks dominance, and the overtaking of humans by artificial intelligence has been a fear of humanity since the Industrial Revolution. The battle between Hal and the human members of the crew was waged over the overwhelming isolation and fear of being replaced by the other. The evolution of humanity has injected new fears into our psyche, and few directors could have brought that war and vision to life; thankfully, Stanley Kubrick took the task, and left audiences with nothing less than film mastery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001: a space odyssey has long been a movie I wanted to see, perhaps mainly for the reason of it being one of those classics you have to see. In general I have enjoyed Stanley Kubricks work on The Shining, A Clockwork Orange &amp; Full Metal jacket, and I guess I still do? but:In this case there are way too many drawn out scenes of e.g. an astronaut floating through space for almost 5 minutes, while we listen to his breath, or the endless scenes in the space station where background music is substituted with a series of high frequency noises (this was actually so much that I had to turn down the volume), or again the full 5 minutes of a music track, that is used to show a spacecraft land.I am completely aware that this movies was groundbreaking in visual effects at its time, and most of its content where based on the amazing visuals, and well-crafted scenery made for it.But, the fact that I, multiple times, actually ended up fast forwarding through scenes, or had to turn down the volume because of obnoxious sounds and music, spoiled it for me.

		<fullReview>I can't give, and don't want to, give this movie less than a 6/10 rating. There is much in it to be enjoyed and admired. I am old enough to remember the original cinema release in 1967 but I probably didn't first see it in the early 70s.It had a huge cult following even then and it was absolutely ground- breaking at the time; special effects were State of the Art and it's interesting even now to see the obvious product placement - PANAM (no-one envisaged Lockerbie and the end of PANAM did they), Howard Johnson's, Hilton etc.But, things in the movie industry have changed a very great deal since this movie was made. Special effects are not everything even these days; we're often served up dross with little but special effects.What I'm really trying to say here is that, like millions and millions of others, I enjoyed this movie at around the time it was released. Now, I'm afraid, it leaves me a bit cold. It looks awfully dated with special effects that are really not special any more, awfully long, pointless and boring periods of blank screen and no sound, tracking shots of spacecraft, apes that are a bit of a hairy joke and a sometimes annoying and over-done musical score. Zus Sprach Zarathustra was a great piece at the time the movie was made but how many times do we need to hear it in one movie? The same goes for the seemingly endlessly repeated Strauss.No, it is a good movie, but it's no longer the great movie that it once was. Perhaps that is the tragedy for film-makers. Their once truly heroic performances lose a great deal of their color and vitality with the passage of time. And, regrettably, that's where 2001 sits these days. The truly great movies can and do stand the test of time. I'm think here of the likes of Butch Cassidy, The Sting, 12 Angry Men, To Kill a Mockingbird, Alien (just the original one made not long after 2001 but a much better movie) and even Kubrick's true masterwork The Shining. You know what I'm saying.JMV</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching this masterpiece that has been released one year before the moon landing, just made me realize what a genius Director could ever mean. Leading directors of his age, and other big names in cinema industry later on, Stanley Kubrick must be considered as one of the most influential directors of all time.Starting with Christopher Nolan and his Interstellar (2014) the movie that has taken 2001 as the main reference, had an amazing similarity with it, that didn't stop at the story line, but it continued to include many other points in my opinion, as the cadence of the main soundtrack (which was one of the best movie themes ever) that Hans Zimmer has played the same of it in most of interstellar's soundtracks especially "No Time For Caution", which I believe it all came out of Nolan's instructions. Beside some other cinematographic techniques as the complete silence in those scenes taken outside of the ship in both movies. Even in the appearance of the place Dr. Dave (the main character in 2001) has reached after entering the star gate, with the one Cooper has reached in Interstellar. So did Gaspar Noé praised in his last movie Love 2015 in the words of his main character Murphy who considers 2001 as the best movie he's ever seen and as the reason he wanted to be a director in the first place. There was even A Clockwork Orange (1971) Book seen in Murphy's room. This Kubrick influence could be seen again in Noé's movie Enter the Void (2009) in the long colorful illusions scenes. Kubrick ideas have also been involved in many kinds of movies even in animation as The Simpsons Movie (2007), and Pixar's Wall-E (2008), and many other memorable movies.Watching Kubrick works would totally let you see how he was the godfather for many directors these days. I've mentioned only two of them, but the list includes many other big names as I said before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey was released in 1968 and It was directed by Stanley Kubrick, one of the most versatile filmmakers of all time.By the time of the movie's release Stanley Kubrick has made a name for himself with films like Paths of Glory, Spartacus, Lolita and Dr. Strangelove. Lolita and Dr. Strangelove met with both critical and commercial acclaim along some serious controversy. It was no different with 2001 either.The film focuses on our past,present and future. Each act has It's different feel as they are told in different ways.First act is slow and mysterious,the second is fun and relaxing,and the climax is unlike anything people have ever seen.The way these acts are connected is loose and it makes for a very mysterious atmosphere. The use of classical music is very smart and It makes the movie that more ageless. Special effects are one of the best and most creative.The movie is not for everyone, It might be slow and confusing for some,but being in the right mindset and thinking about these ideas makes this a very compelling film to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can understand why people see this as a classic movie because I think that for all the issues I have with it, it does have a thought provoking story. However, I still think it is perhaps the most overrated movie of all time for the simple reason that it shows too much of all the wrong things. Whether they were or not, it feels like Kubrick and company were showing off with their gigantic spaceship sets and dazzling light scheme at the end. It looks nice and everything, even fifty years later, but after about thirty seconds of seeing the ship traveling to Jupiter, I'm ready to see something actually happen instead of five more minutes of the exact same thing. The whole movie could probably have been about 80 minutes long, 110 would have been acceptable. I'm not denying that they did a good job on it, but I just couldn't keep my eyes open for most of it.Some of my dislike for it might be a personal preference since I think that character is typically the most important aspect of a movie, and character is the main thing that 2001 lacks. People talk about how chilling HAL is as a villain, and I agree that he/it adds an interesting element to the plot, but he's nothing terribly special as villains go. As for Dave and Poole, you won't find more wooden protagonists in any movie. I think this was intentional to add to the overall feel of the movie and emphasize how small a force humanity really is and how little we know, but it's still worth noting that our characters are pretty bland.The story follows a group of astronauts investigating a monolith that we are lead to believe has helped shape humanity. It starts off with about half an hour of showing apes transitioning from animals into sentient beings that had the capacity to use weapons and go to war with each other in a sense with the help of a monolith. Then we see modern (or at the time of release it would have been slightly futuristic) humans investigating another monolith on the moon. Eventually, the protagonist Dave has to gain control of his craft over HAL as they travel to Jupiter to continue the investigation. Then things get very weird to the extent that I would have a hard time explaining it in words. I don't quite know what happens at the end of the movie, and I didn't care to think it out after watching it because I was just glad it was over. I think Kubrick was trying to give us some form of really deep inspiration with the ambiguous and entirely unexplained ending, but it's a bit beyond me. I don't know if fans of Kubrick will like this since I haven't seen any of his other material. I don't think it is likely to appeal to most modern audiences just because we like our movies to have a bit of a faster pace, but I wouldn't discourage anyone from giving it 30 minutes to try it out. I will warn you that the ape scenes are some of the more exciting moments of the film, though and that the tone changes quite a bit after that. So whether this deserves to be a classic is not something I'm can say with certainty, but it at least didn't fit my tastes. Overall Rating: 3.8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film that defined science fiction cinema.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick was a man of many talents; he knew the mysteries of the universe, and only he could show the world a visually complex tale of space travel, alien technology and only scratching the surface of the secrets in the universe. 2001: A Space Odyssey is still a masterpiece not just of science fiction, but cinema as a medium.Kubrick made a film so ahead of his time back in 1968, that it's a bit of a wonder why so few films since A Space Odyssey have reached its level of cinematic ambition and complexity. This is one of the few films to show space as a void we're only just beginning to know about, not some battlefield that breaks the rules of the vacuum on command. This is a film that spans millions of years, from the dawn of man to the film's interpretation of our future.2001 is one of those rare films that has its sense of spectacle accompanying the story, rather than being separate from the story like many $150 million+ CGI fests of today. Kubrick made this film its very own thing: a film of science fiction that was well and truly ahead of the sci-fi films of its day. It still holds up visually and narratively to this day and will for generations to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jarring, Esoteric, Philosophical, Spiritual, Psychedelic, Compulsively slow, Timeless, Ageless. This cinematic audio visual brilliance is so many things at once and yet it never aspires to be anything. It cannot be (and should not be) typecast into a sci-fi film. This is just a medium that addresses larger questions like : Who am I ? What is the purpose of life ? What is my place in context of the Universe ? The real beauty is that this A/V does not directly raise any such question nor does it explicitly spell out answers. Because there are none. It transmits a telemetric wave that compels you to think. And hopefully, will do so for many years to come. Having said that, this movie can equally raise questions on evolution, technological progress, artificial intelligence, inter-stellar travel, worm-holes, space colonization and many such significant topics but I see them as mere stepping stones. The year in the title of this movie is a misnomer. It never needed it. But i guess that would have just derailed the audience. Personally, I think a movie such as this was directly scripted by the black monolith itself. Only the hand that seemed to wield it was different. It was the need of the hour.Entertainment seekers, look elsewhere. If i could make some cave-men like tribe watch just one movie in their entire lifetime, this would be it.</fullReview>

I had seen Star Wars before and thought this would be something similar. I didn't even make it to the end. I fell asleep. Many years and many other films later, I decided to give it another go and changed my mind completely (and stayed awake).If you have haven't seen it yet, consider watching it at some point.

		<fullReview>You know that solid blue color painting that sold on an auction for 50M USD? My thoughts on this movie are exactly the same. Super heavy trippy video with screaming music at you for 20 minutes can be looked upon as super heavy meaningful moment so deep our minds cant and will not comprehend anything below a scratch of the surface, because its so godlike, or you know it can just actually be a trippy video with screaming music... Definitely leaning towards that. I did expect an awful much from this movie based on its popularity and rating, but received so little in return. I mean i watched it, evolved my theory on the events, read the reviews afterwards and was like "so thats it, nothing else?" 2 hours of music screams for a piece of alien rock to give monkeys a stick and send an astronaut into galaxy school. And all of the events in between not really doing much to advance the plot or develop it. I understand watching an hour of footage of a person flying into a space station and then landing on the moon as it was a normal plane flight between two states would be highly impressive 40 years ago, but we are a bit more spoiled now to admire that with an open mouth. You'd say go watch a brainless thriller like die hard or smth, this movie is actually for those who enjoy using their own brains and think and i'd reply i already thought about everything this movie offers and if it was 15 instead of 140 minutes i wouldn't be missing receiving a thing from it. I read somewhere this movie is more appreciated nowadays than when it came out and could not disagree more. If that was true then this would be the one and only surprise this movie ever provided for me. Sorry for the rant :/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey (1968): Dir: Stanley Kubrick / Cast: Keir Dullea, William Sylvester, Gary Lockwood, Daniel Richter / Voice: Douglas Rain: Spectacular science fiction brilliance regarding a journey through time and space that we will forever lack understanding of. It opens with prehistoric imagery as a tribe of apes discovers a tool called weapon, which introduces the wrath of war. It is a portrayal of man's senseless nature in violence and the inventions we use against one another. Eventually the apes are disturbed by the sudden appearance of a black rectangular object. We are then given a brilliant time lapse as a bone hurls through the air to a cut to a spacecraft. Amazing visual wonders aboard the craft including a computer named Hal that seems to have a mind of its own. Director Stanley Kubrick is brilliant especially having already made Dr. Strangelove and Lolita. Unknown cast include Keir Dullea who attempts to counter Hal but consequently faces the unknown future. William Sylvester is seen making a video call to his daughter before disappearing. Gary Lockwood plays an ill fated astronaut also out to counter Hal. And Daniel Richter is the head ape in the opening tribal footage. Douglas Rain provides the ominous voice of Hal 9000 in a reference to technology merging ahead. Theme addresses man's failure to condemn his pride and his ignorance to that he creates.

		<fullReview>I remember seeing this movie when it first came out with some high school friends. We were blown away by the graphics, of, course and by the "message" of the ending which we discussed and wrote papers for our perplexed teachers. We of course had no idea what it meant, but tried anyway. I took my mother to see the movie several weeks later and she was duly impressed. There is no "science fiction" movie that can ever compare to this, past or present. I know that some people will complain that there is no human interest element, no love story, in this movie. This is a great movie. Watch it when you can. And. Tell IMDb that their 10 line rule is absurd. Or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2001: A Space Odyssey: potentially one of the greatest cinema experiences you will ever have</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey, directed by Stanley Kubrick, is widely regarded as one of the greatest science fiction films ever created. 2 years ago, during my first viewing, I was dumbstruck by the idea. Here was a movie with little to no dialogue, shrouded in ambiguity and pacing comparable to watching grass grow. Having watched the film again, I can say that all of these comments still hold true. However, I can now say that these aspects of the film, and many more, are what in fact make this such a rewarding viewing. This is not just a film, but so much more. This is Kubrick's meticulously crafted work of art. So many movies rely on what they have to say in order to create the most effective and fulfilling experience for the audience. 2001 is the complete opposite, it's what isn't said that's the key. Kubrick's use of visuals and music to evoke desired feelings is a rare gift very few filmmakers are capable of. In his long docking shots, he uses just the right score to demonstrate its elegance like a slow, graceful dance. During times when the astronauts are outside in space, all we can hear is the sounds of their muffled heavy breathing, emphasizing man's vulnerability and creating a tense atmosphere where anything can go wrong at any moment. Using silence to create tension is also a very difficult task, but Kubrick's camera techniques and sudden cuts in the score make them equally spine tingling as the best of the thriller genre. The movie is broken down into 3 parts, each shedding light on man's slow evolution from mastering themselves, to mastering the earth, and finally, mastering space and beyond. While there can really be no concrete explanation for the events on screen, the visual splendour, juxtapositions, and symbolism paint a picture that can leave our imaginations running wild, while not being too confusing and bizarre. For those drawn to ambitious sci-fi films such as this, I would first recommend reading the novel in order to avoid being lost the entire time. The novel and movie couple well together since the movie provides the visual, musical and thematic experience while the book can provide very helpful explanations on plot points otherwise not mentioned. In the current movie industry, where big, loud blockbusters, sequels and remakes are dominant, films like 2001: A Space Odyssey demonstrate exactly what most of the new releases are lacking: originality, elegance, and boundary pushing film techniques. Stanley Kubrick attempted this in almost every film he created, with 2001 being his crowning achievement.FINAL VERDICT: While undeniably not for everyone, those that can appreciate a visually thrilling, beautifully scored and radically ambitious film will find 2001: A Space Odyssey to be one of the single greatest cinematic experiences of their lifetime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is there anything that can be said about this amazing film that hasn't already been said? How about, I have no idea what this film is about? That's been said before? It honestly doesn't matter that this film is a confusing one to follow, mainly because it's one you'll want to watch over and over again regardless. The obvious themes here of human evolution and Ai are incredible topics to experience from a late sixties point of view, but it's the dialog and lack thereof that make this film one of the best ever. The music, the special effects and the cinematography are all great. In fact there really isn't anything negative anybody can say about 2001 except for the fact that it's weird. It's not your standard plot with progressive nature of storytelling. It jumps around spatially and temporally. It's a treat to experience because even though it's complicated, it's not convoluted. 2001 is a perfect movie to start off with if you were to start a film club. Have a group of friends together some Sunday afternoon and watch the film ?check that, make it a Saturday afternoon because you're going to end up spending the entire evening debating about what it all means; especially the final scene. 2001 is my favorite Kubrick film and it's always a must see, no matter how many times I've seen it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ontological path from ape to starchild</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead: Kubrick speaks visually quite loudly throughout the masterwork one has but to study the imagery and the boredom charge hurled at the film shall vanish. The opening image with Richard Strauss' tribute to Nietzsches' great Thus Spoke Zarathustra contains the entire films' message quite unambiguously. The dark globe is animal night: the ape, the crescent of light upon it: man the barely rational ape still quite the lying violent savage. Finally the sun is the Starchild pure reason devoid and free of bondage to animal night. The rising octaves mirror the ascension into the great major key triumphantly mirroring the goal pure reason liberated forever from animal body. I never could grasp critics calling this masterpiece inscrutable it is quite simple in its visual power. The monolith the starchild's embassy causes the initial grouped vegetarian apes to learn the first great lesson of reason to use the bone as a weapon to conquer and subdue its environment again note the pairing of Strauss with the ape's discovery of using the bone as a weapon of power. The monolith always appears to facilitate man's evolution guided by its unknowable nature. Once the weapon is mastered everything changes splits wars for domination occur and carnivores preying upon their surroundings ruling instead of cowering.The ape throws his weapon into the air where it transforms into a nuclear weapon platform pointing at his future enemies. Kubrick wants us to see how little difference difference between man and ape there is despite our overweening hubris. Again, we are but the crescent a sliver of light upon animal night. Kubrick in all of his works especially DR. STRANGELOVE hammers home how utterly irrational violent and dangerous human beings are despite all the pretensions of rationality. CLOCKWORK ORANGE stresses the same theme how defenseless sadistic alex becomes after the levito treatment; he is released into the violent vicious world that we all love to pretend doesn't exist. Kubrick was always a self confessed misanthropist. The theme of how deceitful human communication is and always shall be until we evolve further is the core of the HAL story. Notice the vapidity and clichéd mendacious communication between Floyd and the russians at the space station. This is a staple of all Kubrick's works how humans hide within their customs and folkways to always conceal from THEMSELVES how utterly false they are. HAL was created by people whose self image is tragically like the grand canyon from their real violent selfish nature. HAL was programmed by people who have multiple personalities their public personas which sadly hide always the violent animals who need good consciences to sleep well at night. As revealed in 2010 by Chandra this is why HAL goes crazy not being able to satisfy both perfect information processing and imitating humans duplicity. The film's visual narrative is unparalleled; it is primarily a lesson in human nature as was Strangelove and Orange. Even Barry Lyndon focuses on the utter irrationality of ambition and greed; when Barry achieves nirvana he is bored out of his mind. Also the joys of managing all that wealth never entered his head. He who possesses is himself possessed as Nietzsche said.The film will always stand alone as the one of a kind masterpiece that it is. I think i should close with the essence of the film as spoken by the master Richard Strauss is giving tribute to, it contains the whole film in a microcosm."Behold life herself spoke to me, I am that which must overcome itself."Nietzsche from Zarathustra</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not impressed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a huge fan of Kubrick's films, I have to say, this film really felt like wastage of two and half hours of my time.. Considering the fact that it was made in 1968, the sets and effects were splendid. The technological concepts were admirable. The sound effects were brilliant. There are many other things about the film which demands praise. But, it was terribly slow, painfully vague and unnecessarily long. Many sections of the film were made too elaborate for no reason. The voice and the conversations of the H A L 9000 computer was poorly done. The expressions within its dialogs were simply too much. It might be an intelligent computer, but it's still a machine! And whatever the storyline may be, if after sustaining the film for more than two hours, all that the audiences get in the finishing is an array of disturbing and meaningless light effects that is bound to cause a headache and some really puzzling finishing sequences which fails to give any idea about what the director is trying to mean, it is awfully frustrating.. In the end, I must repeat, I am a very big admirer of Kubrick's movies. My negative impression about this movie will by no means change my idea about the great man's work.</fullReview>

The soundtrack is haunting and extremely beautiful. Whilst I am certainly no expert in this genre or field, it leaves you with the impression that you are watching something very worthwhile and potentially life changing. Each time I watch it I get something more from it. The stunning cinematography during the last thirty minutes was the finest from the 60's - and possibly even the 70's! For me the movie promotes a desire to gain more knowledge. I would love to see it in I-Max very late at night. If the evolutionary path excites you, then it is a very worthwhile movie!!!

		<shortDescription>A Classic Film That's Boring Compared to Today's Standards</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What makes a film classical? Is it the ability to take most lines of dialog and quote then endlessly? Is it the storytelling that's done in an original way that hasn't been done before? Or is it just that most people love the movie?Well like it or not "2001: A Space Odyssey" is a classic movie. It has more quotable lines of dialog than you can poke a monolith at and it has a soundtrack that many a movie composer has copy and pasted. The way the movie is presented and shot was at the time revolutionary as there really weren't many sci-fi movies back in 1968.This movie focuses on many things but the main theme is evolution. It takes us from the dawn of man to the next evolution past humans and yet we are still left wondering what it all means by the end. The director Stanley Kubrick has said that if you completely understand the movie he has failed and I can see why he says this. There are many different elements to this movie though like computer AI, aliens, what is beyond the reaches of our world and a few more. They all get jumbled up into one movie and sort of mix together although not completely.There really aren't that many characters in this movie that are worth mentioning (probably due to the 88 minutes with no dialog) but there is one standout character. HAL 9000, the thinking and talking computer that doesn't want to be shut down and will do anything to stop it from happening. This villain to the story is one the best parts of the film because it's so perfectly emotionless and cold it really makes you believe that if a computer could feel pride or its own thoughts this would be how it would act.Hal 9000 is voiced perfectly by Douglas Rain who brings the cold heartiness and lack of caring that the character deserved. Other than this performance none of the acting really stands out as a great performance and sometimes the acting is as emotionless as HAL. Kier Dullea gives an OK portrayal of the film's protagonist "Dave" but most of the other performances were trey and boring.Speaking of boring, this movie is boring. I know that when this movie came out it was a classic and nothing like this had been made before but when you can leave the room for more than a minute, come back and find that what's on the screen is the exact same thing as what was on there when you left there's something wrong. Stanley Kubrick has stated that he cut 19 minutes off the movie because of "pacing". This means he obviously knows what the word pacing means but he just doesn't do it correctly. The movie is staggeringly and frustratingly slow which had me almost yelling at the screen to just do something. I wouldn't have minded if it was to build up tension but for no reason at all like in this movie is inexcusable. This movie is a classic but it really doesn't hold up to the movies of at least the last thirty years, not for the special effects or the visuals but because of the extremely and agonizingly slow pace.Overall this movie is a classic that doesn't hold up to the movies that it inspired mainly due to the character development and the pacing of the film. I recommend this to adults that like sci-fi classics and that don't have an impatient bone in their body.I rate this movie a 6/10.</fullReview>

Add the dark visitor and the dawn of man begins in a most fascinating way!!!

		<shortDescription>"This conversation can serve no further purpose"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw 2001 about fifteen years ago, as a teenager and on a tiny TV, and predictably enough I didn't react too well to it. Where was the action? Where was the incident? Where was the dialogue?Now, at the age of 30, I've had the privilege of seeing it on the big screen at the BFI Southbank and you can consider me a convert. I'm not going to call it easy going, but it's an exquisitely beautiful film with a sense of real weight to it.The plot concerns mankind's progress as it's guided by unseen aliens, whose only interaction with the human race is to leave ominous- looking black monoliths in various locations for it to find, each of which has an obscure yet undeniable effect on those who find it. A plot like this could lend itself to heavy-handed moralising - the monoliths, after all, are teaching tools - but the film's brilliance is in the way it keeps its plot in the background. There is no overt message for the audience to absorb; the aliens' motives, such as they are, are never revealed and the audience is invited to speculate on the role the monoliths really have and what the final outcome is to be.In the meantime, the human race is required to prove itself worthy of the monoliths. The first one is given free to the hominid species, but subsequent monoliths are more carefully hidden and require some effort to locate; the second, for example, is placed on the moon and must therefore wait there for four million years before humanity's technology progresses to the point of being able to uncover it. The second monolith seems more accessible in relative terms, but the spacecraft crew sent to find it are beset by a murderous, malfunctioning computer. While the link between the HAL 9000 and monolith plot line is never made clear, I like to think they have something to do with each other; HAL effectively represents the next obstacle for humanity to overcome, and Dave Bowman, through his resourcefulness and bravery, outwits a superior intelligence and proves himself worthy of the film's extraordinary ending sequence.Throughout, a link is drawn between technology and weaponry, and it seems as if technology is a phase that mankind has to go through on its journey to something more pure. The apes' reaction to the first monolith is to learn to create weapons out of bones, therefore coming to dominate their environment and leading - via a startling piece of editing - to the evolution of the human race as an assertive and spacefaring species. It's never made clear whether the second monolith on the moon leads in any direct way to the creation of HAL, but I will suggest that these supercomputers are conspicuous by their absence in the scenes prior to its uncovering in the Tycho crater. The final image of the star-child, on the other hand, is technology-free, bookending the film - mankind has in some respects regressed to a natural state, but in a form that has passed technology by and no longer has any use for it. In these terms, the difference between HAL and the apes' bone-weapons becomes slight.The film is the embodiment of Clarke's own law, that any sufficiently-advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. It is not meant that Bowman should understand the experience of the ending, and nor is it meant for us to walk away from the film with more answers than questions. It's a film that's simultaneously optimistic in its faith in humanity to overcome the trials of the universe, but also terrifying in its Lovecraftian subtext: that mankind is a tiny part of something huge, and its purpose within a greater plan is not for it to know. Perhaps the film encourages us to believe that there's a plan at all, or perhaps it presents mankind as incidental - are we just an idle fancy for the aliens? Perhaps the entire human species is nothing more than an alien's homework project. Believe whatever keeps the vacuum out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I put off seeing this film for a while due to people saying it was slow paced and very boring, however today I didn't have much to do and I gave it a shot. Boy, did I learn to stop reading reviews and watch for myself.I had no problem with the pacing. The whole time, even the slow scenes people mentioned, I was too engrossed in the actual world to notice. The first hour passed so quickly. The only time I ever thought "could this speed up" or "when does this end" was when Dave flew into that area near the end and had his little trip where all the colours went crazy. The scene seemed to not be doing much.I love how they executed the characters. You feel sympathy for all of the characters, even HAL. In most films, I feel like it would be more like "Astronauts are good guys, HAL is super evil and must be destroyed". Here, I actually felt bad for HAL after he malfunctioned. I was heavy-hearted during the unscrewing scene where he was 'killed', but I was also feeling bad when the astronauts started dying.The CGI was mind blowing for a movie so old.The ending was very weird. I may look up an explanation, or I might re-watch it after a while to make my own conclusion. Maybe both, who knows. All in all, I loved this film, and urge myself and others to come up with our own conclusion to a movie as people have very different tastes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey deals with the elements of human evolution, technology, artificial intelligence &amp; extra-terrestrial life. It is divided into 3 segments &amp; an epilogue, each connected with an extra-terrestrial reference. Kubrick's first venture into the science fiction genre features all his usual trademarks but its treatment is very different from his other works. The pace is intentionally slowed down, the narration is through visuals &amp; music, the exchange of dialogues is minimal and the engaging &amp; confusing plot only gets better, more transparent &amp; satisfying on multiple viewings. 2001 is a visually stunning experience to behold on the big screen. It asks a lot of its audience and caught in the right frame of mind a cinematic experience of the first order. I had read Clarke's short story The Sentinel shortly before, and I therefore had a pretty good idea of what the story was. Standing back and looking at the movie and imagining myself in the position of someone coming to it cold, it must have been a nightmare. I guess it would be possible to figure out the link between the monoliths, although possibly not until encountering the one on the moon - fabulous though the jump-cut from bone to orbiting satellite may be, I'm not sure it actually explains anything. The Jupiter mission is straightforward enough, but the final sequence is baffling to anyone not in the know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never before has a film left such an impact on me as 2001:ASO. Let me start off by saying that this is NOT a film that everyone can enjoy. It is often slow at times. Also, there is very little dialogue throughout the movie. This is not a movie centered around specific characters per se, which we are so used to seeing, but rather a movie whose main character is all of us as a species. This is a movie rich with symbolism. The directing is outstanding. Stanley Kubrick's unique style seems to work best in this film. The special effects, while obviously dated, still hold up pretty well to this day. It is amazing to think what was visually accomplished in this movie considering how new space travel was at the time. The score of the film gives the movie such an epic feeling that it'll give you goosebumps. This film also has, in my opinion, the greatest ending to a film that I have ever seen. It'll make you think and puts the whole film into perspective. All in all, this film is really unlike anything I've ever seen before. I don't very often give a movie a 10, but I feel that this movie is deserving of it. I highly recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant and Thought-provoking, but an Absolute Bore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I explain why I disliked this movie so much, I want to make a couple comments about what this movie did right. First off, this movie is extremely deep and thought-provoking. The ending, and the whole lead up to it throughout the movie, was smart and carefully crafted. I won't even pretend that I knew what the ending was trying to say, because I probably don't. Also for a movie from the late 60's, the visuals were stunning.Both of these aspects made the movie beautiful, and at the same time made you strain your brain to determine the meaning behind every shot and every scene. However that's just the reason I hated it. I knew that when I started up the movie and was greeted to 3 minutes of blackness accompanied by a grating, ear-splitting horrible sound that they deemed "music", I was going to be in for an awful ride.2001 A Space Odyssey isn't a movie, it's an art gallery. You're sitting there watching scene after scene of an astronaut or a spaceship just floating in space. Beautiful, but painfully boring. This was the first time I have ever fast-forwarded through sections of movie because I was so bored. The best part was even though I did this I never missed anything. There is so much useless fluff in this movie you could probably skip an entire scene and still not miss a beat. As I said, the effects in this movie were amazing for it's time, but it's been almost 50 years. You can't just stick a series of pretty space shots up and expect it to hold up over time without any compelling story to carry the movie. And here is the other reason this isn't a movie. There is barely a shred of a story, or characters, or excitement or anything else that you need to make an actual good movie. The plot was laughably non- existent. There was barely a moment of excitement or suspense during the whole movie. The characters were also laughably poor. Undeveloped, stale, and utterly boring like the rest of the movie. A movie should be beautiful, and it should make you think, but it also should be so many other things that 2001 A Space Odyssey just wasn't.The funny part is the only actual interesting character was an AI Robot called Hal. He provided the only interesting character and the only suspenseful and exciting moment of the entire movie. If not for the whole section of the movie Hal was in, I don't think I would have been able to even finish it. He's the only reason I thought about giving this movie more than 1 star.If you like artsy movies, or if you like movies that really make you think, you will like this movie. It's perfect for pretentious people who can go around and pretend they completely understood the ending after watching it the first time. That way they can go and tell all their friends about it and sound super smart. However, if you want to sit down to have a good time and be entertained. If you want to watch an actual movie with deep characters, a beautiful score, excitement, suspense, and emotion, then you picked the wrong movie. You will quickly find it has none of these things.</fullReview>

While it is long and slow, the pace helps define the movie, and really sets the mood for a long contemplation of our place in the universe. Given that this movie was made while we were just at the beginning of exploring space, the technical details of how daily life would be carried out in space is quite stunning, from the meals, video phones, furniture, and travel. The actors do a great job of portraying scientists with a very convincing dialogue and reactions.

		<fullReview>I don't know what this is about. My friend described this as having something to do with evolution and I guess it's possible it's about the transition. We're gradually seeing the next phase in where we're going. Apes to humans and machines to... the star child? I believe that's what Kubrick is going for. One thing that I liked about the film was that it doesn't use dialog all that much. That is a concept I'd like to see played with a little more. People understand everything through words. Words can affect you but what about the unheard feelings going on upon viewing? What do we feel when we see a friend drift helplessly into space? When a robot murders it's crew while in their sleep? Hell, what do you feel when you want the movie to get going? Well, if you're looking for a fun flick I don't recommend this at all. This is more like going to an art museum and pondering how somebody thought this up. I don't know if this is creative or not or if it deserves so much recognition. I'm leaning towards it does because I really want to see something that doesn't completely need dialog to carry out the emotions it wants you to feel. Boredom, helplessness, awe, intrigue. The film does carry all this out but do you care enough? Many directors did. Go look up online, I might do that. So I will leave off with give something with images and imagination if it's your thing. Even if it's not try giving a visual image of yourself to your friend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 2014 Restored Version - the quality is there if you can view it properly.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sadly, I am old enough to remember seeing 2001 when it first came out. I saw it in a London West End cinema in it's full 70mm glory on a huge screen. The sound was amazing - huge full-range speakers. A mind blowing experience. Then I heard that a newly restored version was coming to cinemas. So, last night I went to the Picturehouse Harbour Lights cinema in Southampton UK to regain the wonder of this film. I've seen quite a few restored/remastered films and have been amazed by the way some very skilled people have made them better than new. By scanning from the camera negatives, all the losses we used to get from inter-negs and release prints disappear and we are left with amazing clarity and colour fidelity. And, sound restoration can produce stunning sound. So, you can imagine the anticipation as I joined the audience - positioning myself in the best viewing seats. The disappointment set in at the very beginning as the thunderous Also Sprach Zarathustra welled-up. What I actually heard was a harsh muddy sound almost as though it had come from the ceiling speakers you get in department stored. The opening of the film is a "blank" screen but the blank screen had a small but worrying orange blur on each side of the screen. Once we got into the guts of the film, it became apparent to me that we were not looking at a painstakingly re-mastered digital version from the 65mm camera negative so lovingly shot by Geoffrey Unsworth but at what looked like a 35mm inter-negative or even a print. Definition was poor, colours were blotchy and uneven, and there was even a side-to-side wobble on the live action scenes - and that is unforgivable. At this point, I should say that I was professionally involved in some film restoration a couple of years ago, so you could say I was being over-critical, but I don't think so. I carried on watching the film finding myself becoming more and more disappointed. 2001 is an amazing film, but watching it in such poor image and sound quality was a great disappointment. Perhaps you need to see it on a huge screen with a huge sound system, but until it is properly restored, I would not risk it.I left at the interval.Added after re-viewing...........Having been very negative about the restored version of 2001 that I saw at a local cinema, I now want to add something to that review. As I write this, I am now watching the restored version on a professionally set-up high quality plasma screen and my own high quality sound system and I have to say that my opinion of this restored version has changed considerably. I have to put the problems detailed above down to the cinema rather than this restoration of 2001. Firstly the sound quality is extremely good. The sound field is well defined there is virtually no distortion, although unfortunately some fierce limiting and compression on Also Sprach Zarathustra. The quality of the images is actually quite stunning - gorgeous rich blacks, superb skin tones and glowing whiteness - in fact it is hard to imagine a better grading then this. The only the very minor issue that remains is the slight horizontal wobble on a lot of the shots which is normally attributable to either warn or distorted sprocket holes or issues with the original camera . This may well have been due to the use of multiple runs of the negative through the cameras. It is normally relatively easy to correct this type of wobble but if different images on the frame are wobbling differently then probably it is best left alone! This is a very minor point - it is barely noticeable, and I only noticed it because I have worked on some restoration of old 16 millimetre films and seen this effect and worked on the correction of it.My conclusion is that in fact the 2001 restored version is superb and should be watched by anyone who enjoys the genius of Kubrick at his best. If you can view it on a very high quality television with extremely good quality sound then I think that may be better than relying on a cinema. Oh, and with all this stuff about the technical quality, I ought to mention that the story is Just amazing when you allow yourself to be totally immersed in it. And, the pacing of the film is perfection. The genius of Kubrick and his amazingly talented team. If you take your pleasures slow and sweet, this will delight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visual Poetry!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey is a film that is very hard to describe and also a film that says film is not just art it is high art and has true meaning and relevance in society. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a film raises the bar in terms of how sci-fi films are seen, how sci- fi films can show relevance in today's society, how sci-fi films can offer deep and meaningful insight into the human experience and also provide moral lessons to an audience, 2001: A Space Odyssey also showed off it's amazing effects and clever story and score that keeps people invested in the story and wanting more. Over the years many film makers have tried to recreate the magic of 2001: A Space Odyssey, however I don't think that over, the past 46 years there has been a film that has come close to achieving the visual poetry that 2001: A Space Odyssey so flawlessly presented.2001: A Space Odyssey is a unique film that pushes the audience's beliefs and how we see the issues of human efficiency, technology and the unknown. Stanley Kubrick blends these themes flawlessly and executes them with his trademarks, providing the audience with a deep film that is both eerie and mesmerising. In conclusion 2001: A Space Odyssey is a timeless classic that many consider visual poetry. It is a film everyone should watch and for that reason 2001: A Space Odyssey receives a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Transcendent Beauty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"2001: A Space Odyssey" emulates Stanley Kubrick's style in such a magnificent, yet tranquil fashion. The concept, blended with the artistry of Kubrick, had me breathlessly staring at my computer screen as the credits ran. Kubrick's work seems to translate less as a film, but more as an artistic piece. The plot follows no specific points and the narration is minimal, yet the audience leaves with such a deep range of emotion and curiosity. The film revolves less around the evolution of its characters, but instead dwells on an overarching concept of the evolution of mankind in its entirety. Scenes like the apes learning how to use tools to kill the opposition, Bowman disabling the all powerful HAL-9000, and the final act where the star child looks over the earth all encompass Kubrick's intentions while utilizing his signature style.The dialogue, or lack thereof, sets the tone for this film. In the first half hour, there are no words spoken. The same can be said for the last half hour. In fact, around 88 minutes are silent. That is more than half of the movie engulfed in the sound of silence. But the silence does not take away from the movie, as many superficial critics would argue, it enriches it in great dividends. Kubrick uses this incredibly eerie feeling to allow the film to progress with the absence of narration. We should not rely on the few words that we hear, but rather allow our own imagination and curiosity to emulate feelings that Kubrick fulfills with this style. Many viewers say that this creates a boring and slow-moving film, and I have to admit that some parts are a bit sluggish, but these empty sequences filled with classical music or heavy breathing adds an almost cryptic element to man's perception on the unknown universe. Everything appears so alien, so incredibly vast and remote. We are allowed to ponder Kubrick's profound intentions with such a minimalistic approach. This cryptic element is also aided by the choice of music in the film. Kubrick infuses a remarkable soundtrack with beautiful shooting techniques to create a void that only our interpretation can fill. As we cycle through various ships in space to the tune of "The Blue Danube Waltz", we fall into a sort of trance, filled with fascination and awe over the complexity of space and what man has done to explore it. But when we first see the monolith on the moon, Kubrick viciously uses "Requiem for Soprano, Mezzo Soprano, Two Mixed Choirs &amp; Orchestra" to create an almost disturbing feeling within us. The contrast of voices and tones combined with the unearthly presence of the monolith forces us into such an uncomfortable perception of the astronauts exploring the moons surface. Kubrick inflicts so much emotion with the use of classical scores such as these, having more meaning than the words of the characters themselves.Everything that surrounds this film creates such an aura of beauty. Showing ships in space for fifteen minutes or playing music to a black screen has no effect on the outcome of the film, but it creates such an elegant atmosphere that Kubrick uses to enhance our outlook on 2001. That is what pushes this film past many others, the effect that even minor elements provide for its audience. But what really sealed everything for me was the ending. Out of nowhere, Kubrick throws in scenes so profound and unexpected that it forces the audience to ask questions. It forces us to ponder what Kubrick truly wanted to portray. And ultimately, it forces us to examine human evolution and its place among the universe. Kubrick did not create 2001 as a film to 'entertain'. The whole premise of the movie revolves around our conscious understanding rather than a superficial plot line that grants us immediate satisfaction. It is, no doubt, one of the most remarkably beautiful pieces of film ever created. Stanley Kubrick's unparalleled style allows "2001: A Space Odyssey" to transcend past any ordinary film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Help me better understand this movie's greatness.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched 2001: a space odyssey, out of suggestion from a buddy of mine. And I usually don't watch something when they nag me to death about it. Which meant I watched it with a negative mindset right from the start. That being said, I have nothing but respect for a movie with a fair amount of ingenuity and thought provoking ideas being crafted back in 1968. I was amazed and intrigued by a lot of the scenes as to how they did it - with what looked like just camera work. However, because of that negative mindset(as before mentioned), some scenes became horridly outdrawn ranging from sometimes five to fifteen minutes of random assaults of either complete silence or static/strange sounds. Instead of enjoying the obvious attempt to create suspense and atmosphere, it instead became a strenuous struggle on my poor head-phoned-ears. (SPOILERS) As for the plot and story, ,aybe I'm not sophisticated enough to understand the message between the first part of the lunar monolith, the journey to Jupiter and the second monolith. I felt like that part had little to do with the actual message of the film and instead was just that - a space journey(Well DUH. It IS the theme of the movie). I've seen a lot of films where the depths are endless and the message or meaning can be interpreted in many different ways(Ex: The Fountain, Mulholland Drive). I still struggle here. It just feels empty to be honest. The idea that an alien or artificial intelligence provided knowledge to prehistoric man or in fact engineered our species isn't thought provoking for me. It is something that I have discussed and theorized with friends and as an atheist it is an idea that is common nowadays. Of course, this film has provided many authors, film directors -artists- with the inspiration for this idea - so credit where its due. But, for me, it is a piece of cake that I've already had too much of and does not impress upon me anymore. I am very much for films where the director lets the audience think for themselves and agree on the fact that most entertainment nowadays "hold your hand" or "spoon feed you the content" throughout the whole experience. It might be nice to feel like a child again, but we have to grow up sometime and movies like these shakes that groggy dreamlike state Hollywood has forced upon our minds. I celebrate every movie, game, book that allow us to use our brain - but to me, as an atheist, this movie is not thought provoking at all(for the beginning of humanity's existence that is).The controversial ending(As someone said) is interesting and freshly new, as for my film experiences. I liked the idea that he perhaps was traveling in time, a wormhole, and experiencing his death/aging by seeing the future. Every time something happened, a sound, a movement, the most obvious his glass of liquor, he saw himself in a vision older and when the other vision saw him it became him. On the other hand, the camera's point of view could have been from the monolith the entire time in that time-capsule, watching him grow old or making him grow old to be reborn a new. I have a sneaking suspicion that the monoliths had something to do with HAL9000's malfunctions and odd behavior - or am I wrong on that point? There are probably some points I have forgotten and I'll have to watch it again sometime in a more neutral state. Right now it just wasn't that much of a memorable experience, other than the intriguing visual effects of the great camera work.Feel free to help me understand the greatness of this movie, because I don't want any negative thoughts of a movie that was the inspiration for a hell of a lot science-fiction movies and books. 8/10PS: That ending deserves an acid-trip. Heh..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>More than 40 years after its release, this transcendental sci-fi experience remains unparalleled. Kubrick's depiction of Arthur C. Clarke's novel, filmed in eye-popping 70mm, with revolutionary visual effects and blended with some of the most beautiful music ever created by man, forms the utter symphony between the everlasting curiosity of mankind and the infinite mystery of outer space. Along this epic voyage of time and space, we watch the birth of human technology and its push towards the evolution of our species, ultimately leading to an envisioned modern era of dazzling discoveries. A truly inspiring odyssey and I find one of its most astounding facts that it was made before the human race had even set foot on the Moon.</fullReview>

But if you watch it and don't like it, you should appreciate its effect on modern movie-making and how it changed a generation of directors, actors, cinematographers and so on.

		<shortDescription>Amazing atmosphere, cinematography and practical effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most amazing, the most awe inducing part of this film, is the fact that it was made in the 60's. The production, the cinematography and the effects are still relevant today. It is the only film which I've given a 10/10, but not only due to the context of it being from the 60's, but also the fact that it is an awe-some film by itself. Watching it, you'd think it'd just be a long drone, as a matter of fact, it is over 2 hours long and the dialogue is minimal. But the atmosphere and scenery makes up for it. When watching this film, I was just astonished, I was so fascinated by the little things, like how people walked on walls or how things were floating - "How did they do these practical effects in the 60's?" was a very common thought of mine.The symbolism of this film, the way it shows our development, it's like a journey of the soul. And watching the ending - I didn't even think about the fact that all of that was happening for about 20 minutes - I was just so fascinated. Though this is a classic, though this might be a pioneer in the sci-fi genre, I've found nothing that seemed to even attempt to copy it, as many films often do. I would recommend for people to check out Stanley Kubrick's work, they are very similar in the fact that they're committed to and executed in a very great way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick's Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I really say about one of the greatest films of all time that hasn't been said already? The first time I saw it as a teenager I was left amazed at what I had seen but at the same time confused as to what it all meant. This was the first movie I saw that didn't spell everything out for me. It took time for me to learn to enjoy that. It's a beautiful film. I've heard it described as visual poetry and I think that is as accurate a way of putting it as anything else. The visuals are stunning. The special effects, sets, costumes are all first-rate. I recently watched it with my girlfriend who had never seen it and has tastes that are strictly mainstream. She was in awe of the look of the film, particularly given its age. Not enough good things can be said about Kubrick's use of classical music in this, as well. It's a masterpiece that deserves every bit of praise it's received. Obviously a film that every serious film fan has to see. It might not be to everybody's tastes but it's an experience unlike any other and, in my opinion, worth repeated viewings. For those of you interested, there's obviously the Arthur C. Clarke books that are worth reading but I'm also going to recommend you check out the Jack Kirby 2001 comics. They're trippy and lots of fun!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wildly Inconsistent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I had seen parts of the film ever since it was released in 1968, I never watched the entire film until yesterday. I am very skeptical of films that try to predict the future and this case my doubts were justified. Although the central action is supposed to occur in 2001, Kubrick &amp; Clarke were wildly optimistic about the progress of space exploration in the 33 years since the film was made. They were also too optimistic about the continued existence of the American corporate giants of the day. Several corporate logos are used in the film - Pan American Airlines, Bell Telephone, IBM &amp; Hilton Hotels. Pan American and Bell are gone. IBM is no longer the computer monolith it once was. Only Hilton is still a well known corporation. On the other hand, there is no optimism about race relations or the ability of minorities to move into positions of power - every person in the film is white. No imagination was used in the creation of the characters' clothing either - the men's suits are straight of of the 1960's as are the flight attendants'. The film seems to have been made in separate parts by different directors - no expense spared on some parts and corners cut in others. What I think happened is that MGM got cold feet and cut off Kubrick's funding at some point. He then had to make do with scenes like the one in the earthly room at the end - using sets and props easily available at the studio. I'm not going to comment on the plot because I think we're dealing with an incomplete realization of Kubrick's vision.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now, before I get bashed for not being appreciative of classic cinematography and old movies - let me make this disclaimer clear: I've watched and enjoyed old, classic films right down to silent films and those were more stimulating than 2001. Films from the 60's that I've enjoyed include Lawrence of Arabia. I am also not unfamiliar with Stanley Kubrick's works, ex: A Clockwork Orange.But this... this was way too slow for me. I feel like most of the movie is watching some spacecraft or other slowly float through space to the tune of a slowed-down version of the Blue Danube Waltz. I fell asleep twice trying to watch the movie from start to finish and the third time I only managed to get through the whole thing by watching it in bits and pieces. The parts where there are dialogue and action were interesting, but if you take out all the long segues, the movie would probably only be half an hour. And then by the end of it all, I felt like I just got out of a massive LSD trip (Yay 60's cinema!)Don't get me wrong - the film is packed with symbolism... and even though the film is about the future, there are a lot of historical, philosophical and visual quirks that make it very open to interpretation. On first viewing, I personally picked up allusions to the Cold War, and I see this film as kind of a historical representation of the race-to-space feeling of the 60's. I'm personally interested in reading the novel so I can get more out of it. But the movie itself... This is one of those films that has the potential for watching multiple times and getting something different from it every time, but alas... it's just such an effort to watch that I don't think I could do it. Just being honest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey is a film that understands the questions that drive us and explores them in a manner that is unparalleled in the history of the cinema. It is not a movie as much as a full blown experience. In fact, as millions of people can attest, even trying to watch "2001" in a way one watches any other movie will simply lead to frustration and annoyance. People expect dialogue, plot, humor and resolution in their movies. The want a narrative that they are familiar with and that they understand. Kubrick's film is an experience more like watching a ballet or opera than actually sitting down and watching a movie. It is a movie that takes work, concentration, and patience. You soak in its images in all of their beauty and think about what is on the screen. Eventually the picture grips you on a subconscious level and speaks to you in the same way any great art does- personally. Once you get the message that Kubrick is trying to give, you can't necessarily verbalize it- you just feel it and are in awe."What is it about?"Most of the time I can give a pretty simple synopsis of what a movie is about and why they should watch it. I can't do this with 2001. I simply smile and say "it's about everything."A few minor qualms that I felt dejected was the pace of the story (which really lacks), lack of depth to the history of the black monolith and certain dragging scenes (replacing the damaged part, ships landing on the moon, etc.). I felt too much details on the props and effects. I'm just one who enjoys a good story, smart screenplay, artists performances, realism, what we can learn from, score and cinematography. Other than that 2001: A Space Odyssey delivers some of the qualities that make an awesome film, and has influenced Directors and movie fans alike.This groundbreaking film may have various effects depending on the viewer. If your into fast paced, dialogue heavy and interesting plots, then this may not be entertaining. For lovers of visual effects, less script, snail paced yet detailed settings, thought provoking moments and exquisite psychedelic like visuals, then this will be a treat. "2001: A Space Odyssey" is likewise a stand-along monument, a great visionary leap, unsurpassed in its vision of man and the universe. It was a statement that came at a time which now looks something like the peak of humanity's technological optimism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing this film with a couple of friends. Trough the lengthy space scenes, we made jokes on expense of the astronauts; we mocked HAL9000 voice... and sometimes we yawn. Then came the last 20 minutes and... we became speechless, and the one hand because we didn't understood what the hell was happening, but also because we glimpsed the importance of this piece of work. 2001 is maybe the most ambitious film of all time; Kubrick wanted to make the quintessential science-fiction movie, and he did it, plus posing a question that today seems very pertinent: What's the next stage of human evolution? Kubrick tries to answer this with all the effectiveness possible in cinema; The image rules, words are secondary. Often imitated, but never matched, 2001 challenges the very nature of cinema as an art form and as a vehicle for philosophical endeavors. A true Classic.</fullReview>

The cinematography is excellent, the acting is fantastic, and the film is absolutely magnificent! Though many people may disagree with me, I found this film to be absolutely terrifying! The music, HAL 9000, and my fear of the unknown led me to having nightmares of HAL singing "Daisies" And that soundtrack! oh my lord! The theme song! Requiem For Soprano!

I just couldn't tear my eyes awayStanley Kubrick's directing style also blew me away. You could tell he had an incredibly strong vision, and he just knew what he was doing. And 2001 was no fluke! all his other films are fantastic as well, though 2001 is still the best (In my opinion)n my opinion, 2001 is one of the best films ever made, and I recommend it to everybody who likes film!10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why I became a scientist after watching 2001 Space Odyssey. It was that black screen as the film began to roll!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember sitting in the movie theatre back in 1968 as a young teen watching the black screen appear at the beginning of 2001; A Space Odyssey while transcendent music/vocals played, curious as to whether the absence of a visual cue was a technical failure or intentional? At the time, I failed to envision that the theatre viewing screen was proportionally the same length and width as the black monolith per Arthur C. Clark's expansive novel. Maybe its common lore, but it only just struck me last week, while I was watching 2001: A Space Odyssey on my own widescreen TV for the unknown'th time, that Stanley Kubrick was having his way with us during the Prelude. It is easy to envisage that we, the audience, were being "educated" by the black monolith before us as represented by the seemingly void, imageless screen. While some critics in 1968 panned the movie (Village Voice, NYT) others, and many still do today, and described it as boring and unimaginative, in fact Kubrick's juxtaposition of the laughably mundane and tedious daily life of an influental space traveller against most extraordinary cosmic events makes it a stunning achievement in science fiction moviedom that may never be repeated. In this matter, George Lucas has stated that it remains the Holy Grail of science fiction films. After all these years, 2001; A Space Odyssey still showcases Stanley Kubrick's most incredible ingenuity, imagination, and style in interpreting Aurthur C. Clarke's engrossing ideas. And he had his way with us a little bit too! The fact that 2001 came and went doesn't dampen my enthusiasm; every time I watch 2001; A Space Odyssey I am still back in that theatre in 1968 full of wonder at Kubrick's masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true cinematic experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the films that made me a cinephile. In fact, the cinematic experience engages the viewer in such an amazing experience, through time, space and the mysteries of mind, "2001 - A Space Odyssey" helped me decide my professional career. I can say I am a producer because I once fell in love with this master piece. Stanley Kubrick was an obsessive creator. He was able to build a solid career not only experimenting, but mainly mastering the grammar of film genres. It would not be absurd to say he made one of the best scifi films ever, "2001 - A Space Odyssey", one of the best historical films ever, "Barry Lyndon", one of the best war films ever, "Full Metal Jacket", one of the best suspense/horror films ever, "The Shining". His filmography is a film school itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite film of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to start the year on a high note so I decided to revisit 2001: A Space Odyssey, my favorite film of all time. It's been ages since my first watch and it's still an incredibly fascinating, complex and beautiful journey. What I really like about it is that different themes are analyzed here in the most profound manner. We follow the influence of the monolith on the evolutionary stages of man throughout time and it's also very intriguing how it has various purposes in each of the periods presented. It serves as a teaching tool to the apes, but also as a guide and transformational force to the human being. Apart from the monolith, another interesting subject being analyzed is the confrontation between man and machine. Seeing HAL 9000 as a conscious being who will do anything out of self-preservation was absolutely brilliant. Not only this film contains some really impressive special effects, which still hold up quite well nowadays, but it also has a magical and memorable soundtrack. I must say the final segment entitled "Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite" is the most visually stimulating sequence I've ever witnessed on film. 2001: A Space Odyssey is one of the many masterpieces of Stanley Kubrick and I'll definitely be revisiting it many more times in the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One day I got Clarke's novel 2001. I looked up and down, I did not get anything else, I shrugged and gave thanks to heaven, and I started to read the simple and rarely appreciative reading of a best- seller. Soon its pages were consumed between my fingers, I read the word END, and I stacked it properly in the trunk of oblivion. Or that I thought. One Saturday night, a TV show surrender to Master Kubrick. After a documentary about his person the film started. I did not blink for the next 138 minutes, not until the director resolved on an image to an outcome that C. Clarke cost him several pages. Then my eyelids opened and closed stunned disbelief to the fact that Kubrick also he were under the influence of the mysterious monolith. Echoed in my ears the mighty strains of "Thus Spoke Zarathustra" by Richard Strauss, while Stanley Kubrick smiled after the credits: to him the words left over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, the reason I watched this movie is because I wonder how can they make an accurate space scene in 1968. I just want to look what kind of special effects they used. And why "2001: A Space Odyssey", as my friend said, is a complicated movie. I just wonder and then I decided to watch it. And you know, I'm very excited and satisfied.Because I am a movie enthusiast, I am expecting a movie that show primordial man. But, unfortunately, the film I expect had already released in 1968, far from my year of birth. Yes, I am very excited from the first scene. And then the movie quickly change to a space scene. What a real complicated movie! This make me confuse and keep wondering. Until the end of the movie, I still can believed what I have watched. What is it means?I keep searching and watch again and again. And there are still a mystery in the movie. Smart one, and one of the best science fiction. I really love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a spectacular directorial achievement from the master film maker Stanley Kubrick. The visual effects in this film will make you feel like you are on a high speed journey through time and space. The fact that Kubrick could achieve such a masterpiece like this in the year of 1968 is almost unbelievable. As far as visual effects go this might be the greatest cinematic achievement to date. This film as all of Kubrick's work really transports you to a whole new world of it's own. A solid story and fine acting from the cast make this a film that will go down as one of the greatest of all time. See This Film If You Have Not Already You Will Not Regret It! 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*** 2001: a space odyssey What a film!!Really finding it difficult to describe it in words .I gotta tell you,this film has been haunting me for days!I couldn't sleep thinking how a man could make such a film 45 years back! I'm not kidding 45 years back!!I was really stunned just by its visual effects alone.if u let a guy watch this film knowing nothing about it I'm sure he's not gonna believe this was made way back in the 1968.I have seen many reviews in IMDb slating that it's the worst boring film ever made n all. Common guys I can't understand this.one ought to give at least to its brilliant visual effects!! Now coming to other aspects of the film,2001 is not a regular movie.If u gotta c this flick sure u need to know something about this film before hand.otherwise,I can assure u,it will be dead boring.I won't argue with them,this film is made that way.its extremely slow pace is to accurately portray evolution. There isn't many dialogues that may be another reason why they call it boring.But i wont say that.I see Kubrick's sheer brilliance in this.I just keep on wondering how a man could produce such a classic even with such little amount of dialogues! As i said.its all about evolution.the first evolution taught us to use tools the second got us to the moon and its source was found to be from Jupiter.What exactly Stanley Kubrick had in their vision would be hard to perceive. But whatever they had in their vision,they deserve full credit at least for trying and bringing the cinemascopic thoughts to new levels. And one more thing,always there had been a debate about the greatest director of all time and Kubrick's name rose on all occasions.I didn't knew why,but not now,once I saw 2001.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll destroy my credibility here and now by saying my dream job would be becoming a film-maker, the other would've been to become an astronaut. "2001: A Space Odyssey", surprisingly remains my favourite Science-Fiction movie of all time, and would definitely remain one of my top three favourite movies should I ever have to make a list. Steven Spielberg mentioned that Kubrick was very eager to somewhat "change the form" of film. When Steven asked "Didn't you already do that with 2001?", he said that Kubrick replied "A little bit". Stanley began making something that would change the face of the movie going experience, and represent a growth in the industry that only comes every few years if were lucky. Ambitions began by hoping to offer more than the genre previously did such as the large majority of campy fun 1950's "Atomic" age of American Sci-Fi movies. Teaming up with Sci-Fi author Arthur C. Clarke, they began to write a screenplay adapted from Clarke's short story "The Sentinel". The result would be a project that was deliberately meant to be unique for everyone who saw it, and Clarke would somewhat continue "2001" with his version of the narrative in a series of four novels (Whether or not it was canon I do not know). "2001" has many themes present, but in its style and approach of the unknown I will also admit it doesn't really engage fully throughout its running length. Famous Soviet Director Andrei Tarkovsky criticised the film as too enamoured with spectacle, and would go on to create the phenomenal "Solaris" in 1972 (Which offers far more in existentialism, and definitely worth your time if you enjoyed "2001"). It's obvious to say that nothing looked like this before in 1968. Star Trek season 2 was underway, the moon landing was still a year away and no one knew what our planet looked like from up there. The model space station orbiting around the painting of earth is burned into my brain, and perfectly transcends beyond the scope of any average Hollywood movie. The first 20 minutes alone is a silent masterpiece, at a time when the world and medium was growing so rapidly. Time is rewound to reveal something prehistoric, and suddenly the famous match cut shoots us thousands of years into space where it becomes obvious that the visuals are there just to accompany some incredibly large scale music pieces by the likes of Richard Strauss, and Johann Strauss II.To this day, "The Monolith" is still shrouded in mystery. Does it grant knowledge, or just appear at pivotal events? Regardless, the mystery has endured the objects charm and legacy. Towards the second act, we see how far mankind has come with a certain Artificial Intelligence called the HAL 9000. In a harrowing display of humanity's reliance on computers, cold responses and interactions mean anything could happen when taking the "Turing Test" of hell. With symmetrical rooms and unnerving silence, all of it eventually builds towards the trippy "Jupiter and Beyond" sequence. Employing revolutionary slit scan photography that became an interesting marketing tool to the 1960's drug culture. Despised on release, but later praised by so many critics. This film can be analysed to death, but will probably never be fully understood. In a Playboy magazine interview Kubrick said LSD didn't inspire any of the films visuals, he has also been connected to this quote: "How could we possibly appreciate the Mona Lisa if Leonardo had written at the bottom of the canvas: 'The lady is smiling because she is hiding a secret from her lover.' This would shackle the viewer to reality, and I don't want this to happen to 2001." Themes of human evolution, technology, and extraterrestrial life are present. But more and more it becomes harder to pinpoint as we journey towards the unknown. Whatever "2001" is suppose to be it certainly feels like something mysterious and beautiful, much like the idea of space exploration itself. It's so obvious that the film to me is built to accompany classical music than storytelling, but does watching "2001: A Space Odyssey" prove respect can be brought to the genre even without definitive conclusions? Unfortunately I don't have those answers, and I feel most people may be turned off with the idea of having to make up their own interpretations even when such a conclusion opens up many possible outcomes (A scary idea, I know). Spielberg once defined it as "Less Science-Fiction and more Science-Eventuality", if anything I always enjoy discussing with people how they felt about this movie more than most others. Kubrick is a master of his craft, and even ideas of space isn't beyond his camera lens.Final Verdict: To me, "2001: A Space Odyssey" remains powerful through sheer spectacle, beautiful music and stunning visuals set throughout the years and stars. Only Kubrick could have pulled this off so well. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest science-fiction movies of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick is a movie director that can do no wrong. His vision is far more strange and thought-provoking than any other director on this planet. When he died in 1999, the world was saddened by the news of his death. But, his films didn't died, either. He left behind some of his best work to all to see. In my opinion, he left behind a lot of questions with one particular movie that really stands out as being one of the best science-fiction movies of all time. The name of the movie is 2001: A Space Odyssey, and even after 45 years, it still holds up. The movie takes place in the futuristic year of 2001, where a space crew investigates a unknown monolith that is excavated out of the Moon. The scientists don't know who put the monolith there, or how it ended up on the Moon. But, there's more to the story than investigation. Another monolith appears during the Dawn of Man sequence, where humans in the beginning of civilization were primitive apes. Meanwhile, the space crew's computer, HAL 9000, get involves in the mission and determines to find out the answer. One of the scientists on board questions about the technology of the HAL 9000 computer. What the space crew doesn't know is that HAL 9000 has a mind of his own. He is also very deadly when discovering about the unknown monolith, and even jeopardizes the astronauts onboard. He eventually kills some of them and even locks out Dr. Dave Bowman in his pod. Dave soon gets into the spaceship and deactivate HAL 9000 and then goes a mind-trip through the star-gate. One of the greatest achievements in 2001 is the mind-blowing special effects that the movie possess. A lot of science-fiction movies are jam-packed with wall-to-wall special effects, making the story harder to follow. In 2001, those special effects don't get in the way. Instead, the special effects makes us look in awe. It's the inspiration that the movie makes for us. Kubrick's vision of the future is far from being made in 1968, but there are other elements that 2001 have that makes more unique. The relationship between HAL 9000 and Dave Bowman is significant mainly because, Kubrick sets up the relationship that can take an a effect on a human being. HAL 9000 is a computer that likes to meddle with people. He is complicated in his own ways of destruction and murder. In other words, HAL 9000 can't function accordingly. It's that story that make us think about the relationship between man and machine. The monoliths also serves a significant role as well. In my own perspective of watching 2001, I think that the monoliths serves as a part of life. The Dawn of Man sequence in 2001 and the ending are crucial points to the movie. In the beginning, man is ape in a world that is inhabited by other members that make up civilization. By the end, Bowman is near death, but he is reincarnated through the monolith that is placed in his bedroom. It follows the phrase, "What comes around, goes around." Kubrick's direction is also very descriptive and never fails to mislead us. He uses long shots of people inside the space station. He puts us in Bowman's perspective when he is traveling through the star-gate. If I had to say something about the star-gate sequence, I would say that the questions relies on the mysteries of science and technology itself. The point is, there may be another dimension outside outer space, one that is never been seen before. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a great movie. Not only great, but magnificent in its own way. The music sets up the movie as a space opera and moves very steady on the details and visual effects. In the past years, 2001: A Space Odyssey has been criticized as being the greatest science-fiction movies of all time. I can't agree more. It is also one of my favorites. It belongs on my top 10 favorite movies list and it fully deserves to be placed there. A feast for the eyes, ears and mind for all to see and hear, and also for all generations of movie directors. Kubrick should be proud. &#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It asks more questions through images, rather than with Dialogue.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What are we? It's a strange question at first and not the kind you usually ask. Yet people like Carl Sagan and Richard Feynman asked this question numerously. They posed it with humility and reason, never making up answers, and assuming that everything that science had come up with was wrong. In an interview where Feynman was asked about the certainty pertaining to the scientific method, he expressed his view, being that of a Cartesian, and how he would rather be filled with doubt, than to have answers that could possibly be wrong. Its noble and it entails the integrity of a curious mind who believes in the beauty of investigating and discovering, rather than basing your conclusion on little or no evidence. 2001: A Space Odyssey does not provide answers, but it gives us insights into what the human race is, posing even greater questions to the potential we hold as self-conscious beings.2001 is significantly different from the usual science fiction film. Although it poses the usual questions pertaining to the uniqueness of our species, the existence of God, and the direction we are heading in out progressivism, it rarely goes beyond a few simple lines of dialogue. The few characters, mostly being astronauts and a few Hominids, utter very few words as the story progresses from the dawn of humankind, to the evolutionary stage of space exploration. But then again, it's those very moments that simply play out as naturalistic as possible that truly define the story, as the images of objects floating in space, with "On the Beautiful Blue Danube" playing in the background that we truly come to be in sync with the spirit of the film. This spirit is mysterious, and although we still don't understand what it is, or where it came from, but the search becomes all the more invigorating as we challenge both our intellectual and explorative capacities, thus gaining a greater understanding of the human spirit.When human kind was still developing, our awareness was at a minimal state of ambiguity, never truly grasping the significance of any particular action, relying purely on instinct. A scene where a group of Hominids stumble upon a monolith, shows them react with wild and almost chaotic rage at the sight. Not too long after, they learn to kill enemy combatants for land. As our ancestor raises the bone and begins to shatter various bones on the ground, the shot is given a particular focus as it entails the essence of discovery in the most primitive standards. When at the peaking point of our development, we are more casually reliant on ungodly technological advances, endowing them with their own conscious awareness that merely gives greater reason to ponder the definition of intelligence.The Hal 9000, an artificial intelligence unit, claims its inability to commit error, already symbolizing the very arrogance that defines our own self-indulged obligation to intellectual superiority. Hal's devotion of intelligence, although admirable is clouded with pride to the degree that it mirrors our own fear of death and failure in the face of the inevitable. Human beings, although the most intelligent creatures known so far, classify themselves as intelligent. Yet, with what little we still don't know about the Universe, there could be life elsewhere in the universe, probably vastly more intelligent than we are. Our modern day Carl Sagan, or Stephen Hawking, as daunting as their intellects are to the average individual, could merely pose as amateurs to intelligent alien life, depending on their own conception of intelligence.The discussion to intelligence is central to the theme of this film, for it pertains with our own approach towards our ever growing desire to ascend and evolve. The film's episodic pattern of storytelling introduces a black monolith in each chapter. There are some speculations regarding these monoliths, and at times they drive the characters, be it the hominids, or the astronauts to further questioning their origins. The beliefs are focused around the notion of an extraterrestrial species. Their intentions, although never clear, are more viewed in the concepts of overseers to the universe. With 2001, being based on Arthur C. Clarke's novel of the same name, the origin of the multiple Monolith's gives little if any detail to their conception, Only the fact that they are of nonhuman origin, that there is some understanding of their descent, but little of their purpose.2001: A Space Odyssey is something to wonder, for it is the sort of film that although gives very little answers, it raises the kinds of questions which have driven us from the jungles of Africa to the infinite realm of Space, in our quest for knowledge and understanding. Stanley Kubrick's vision of the human capacity for knowledge is an both enlightening and extraordinary attempt as his classic space epic, through long shots of the soundless and weightless space, combined with J Strauss's "On the Beautiful Blue Danube", there comes a more poetic feeling of the beautiful and mysterious cosmos we still hope to understand in our gradual evolutionary development. 2001 is a landmark of discovery, and even inspiring to the degree that it is spiritual and Godly in its essence. When touching on God, I don't mean a sentient being outside the universe, but more towards Arthur C. Clarke's definition, which pertains towards knowledge and the path that encompasses its essence as human kind still strives with the enthusiasm that drives the very curiosity that define people like Richard Feynman in their quest for knowledge. Feynman once said, "When you doubt and ask, it gets a little harder to believe", and although this clarifies the difficult journey humanity embarks on every day when learning, it's the first and necessary step to arriving at a more honorable degree of knowledge, God or no God.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A window into the vastness of space and its deep loneliness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Only after Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odissey science fiction film genre was taken seriously, it is a window into the vastness of space and its deep loneliness. In 1968 (one year before the 1st Trip to the Moon) was created this masterpiece which immediately became a reference work for all science fiction and, for me, has never been surpassed by another film of the same. The film's story is complicated and the way we're told does not make it easier. 2001 is a question about why we are here. But, as Kubrick said, "You're free to speculate as you wish about the philosophical and allegorical meaning of '2001'". To understand it, you have to think about the monolith as an E.T.'s 'tool' watching the evolution of the human race, it represents a challenge. Firstly, Apes are afraid, curious yet, brave, qualities that make them invent the TOOL (starting with bones). Secondly, in space, Man faces this monolith the same way apes did, with curiosity (but this time, with times gone bye, his main tool is a computer). In space, Man has to learn how to walk again, how to go to toilet and has to eat baby food which means, the leader of Earth is a baby in Space.Thirdly, there's HAL-9000, a computer (Man's tool) who starts to 'think' humans are stupid and boring (chess newbies) using warmed-up food and artificial sun. The ultimate tool doesn't need this apes. Man's intense breath in space means we are in space like fishes out of water. Finally, Man loses control of his tools, beginning a battle between Man and 'Alive' Machines. The Computer has won but it didn't calculate the ignorance of the stupid Ape who surprisingly kills HAL-9000 with the most basic tool, a screwdriver. In 2001's final moments, Man, alone in space, prepared to face the unknown and face the ultimate challenge: HIS OWN DEATH. Our evolution was so all based in our tools, but, in the end, it tried to replace us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I love this movie dearly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001 A space Odyssey is in my personal opinion the best movie ever made. The script has a great rhythm, the slow paced and relaxed tone in the actor's voices helps us dive into a setting where extravagant technology is a normality, while also giving a dramatic eeriness that makes one shift in their seat throughout the movie. The film was also beautifully directed, Kubrick loves to make us take a step back and look at the whole picture, and has some great shots of space. Though his directing in relation to plot development is where he amazed me in this film. Whether I was watching monkeys battle or babies float in outer space, my belief was never suspended. I truly enjoyed the way he threw the plot around to different moments in time, and how they were all related but still all interesting in their own respects. The movie also had a great, and highly thought provoking statement on power, and what it truly means to be of a higher intelligence. The end of the movie is also highly debatable, allowing it to resonate with one long after they finish the film, making it to me more than just a movie but an experience.</fullReview>

This movie was really confusing, and boringly slow paced, i didn't know what the monolith was so i had no idea what was happening. The scene at the beginning was too long, and did an amazing job of not telling what was going on. if the film had a narrator, it would have been infinitely better. After the first hour, i lost interest. The best part about the movie was the story and the concept. it is not that i don't appreciate art or atmosphere, but i think the story could of been told better. in the same weekend, i watched star trek 2 wrath of khan, and i enjoyed that a lot more</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"2001: A Space Odyssey" was always going to be a classic, even if you factor out its considerable quality. Whether you think it's a better Movie than most is irrelevant; rather, it's a different way of creating a Movie. "2001: A Space Odyssey" justifies its formidable reputation on originality alone. You think that the journey to Jupiter goes on for too long? Name a Movie that would dare to even attempt it! Mr. Stanley Kubrick creates an entirely new field of Film, and no-one else has even managed to enter it yet, forget toppling "2001..." from its perch. Though the HAL episode and the fancy Space-Age Gizmos lend the Film a primal appeal, "2001..." is at heart a very deep Movie. It raises all manner of questions that unspoken moral codes dictate shouldn't be raised in Movies. I'm convinced that it would be a lifetime's work to read into every aspect of "2001...", and it makes me wonder: could a human really get this much depth into a plot? Was it just luck, endless profundity borne out of spontaneous creation? Or did Kubrick thoroughly, meticulously, Religiously plunder every depth, develop every point, craft each and every aspect of this Film to levels of transcendentalism that would make a Philosopher blush? Frankly, Kubrick's notoriety makes the latter quite plausible.But I digress. I'm going off on a tangent, tripping over myself to praise this Film, and that does it no justice. As I tried to show, it's perfectly crafted, honed down to utmost perfection, in itself. With such perfectionism readily available in store, online, anywhere, why read a review? The ultimate proof of "2001..."'s brilliance is "2001...", and that's the mark of a true classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best film I've ever seen, my number one, and believe me I've seen a lot of films. First of all just by knowing it is from the late 1960's and how it looks like is just amazing. I mean what other films from 1968 looks like this one, huh!? And the subjects it is working with is like if it were made today in the 2000's. It is still so up-to-date. Our big brother society and yeah, It's good that one can feel safe but on the other hand, what will happen if anything goes wrong. Are we then doomed? Are we getting too comfortable with all computers that helps us in our daily lives? The whole Evolution it's so darn interesting. Space is still so fascinating and I love how Stanley leave out an explanation of what's happening in the end. It's all up to the viewers to each have a own opinion about it. This film is a must see! A real masterpiece, at least in my opinion. I recommend everyone who have not seen it to do so. That'll be all. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Due to my age and native country, I was unable to see the film soon after its completion and even prior to the use of modern digital technology. On the other hand, I am not a fan of "arid" sci-fi films, such as Solaris or Stalker - I find them protracted, stolid, and too commonplace. Long scenes without text lines, lengthy stills of space technology, kitschy interiors are the thing I usually tend to avoid. But as I regard Stanley Kubrick as a talented filmmaker, I have decided to watch (again) all his main films - but 2001: A Space Odyssey turned out to be a real challenge... Of course, I admit its particularity and skillful use of state-of-the-art technology at that time, but watching it in 2013 was not impressive to me. Moreover, there were no catchy characters and performers to remember (unlike in Star Wars trilogy, for example). For fans of Kubrick and/or elderly sci-fi admirers, probably. I would be surprised if middle-aged or young viewers get a memorable experience from the film in question.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is a hard sci-fi classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing this film a few times and it was excellent, I heard that Arthur C Clark wanted to get the science right as much as possible. I liked the beginning scene with the ape-like creatures who were or ancestors and how it was meant to relate to humanity and our eventual journey into space which is the staple of the film. I like how the Type III civilization sent a rectangular object to our Solar System to observe us as a Type 0 turning into a Type I civilization. I like the show don't tell aspects of the film. Hall turned out to be a villain and go amock. I like the ending part where the main character transcended as he went through strange rooms and grew old into this baby-like entity in a bubble-like structure. This movie was well-done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>it lives up to the hype... then goes even further as if it's on an odyssey... in SPACE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>at one point in my movie watching life, I had a need to watch every movie that was considered one of the best, one day I came across this little space adventure and remembered seeing it on IMDb's top 250 list. before buying it on DVD however I did some research (as I always do when buying a film) I asked around about but everyone I talked to said it was boring, nothing happens in it, it's just a pile of nothingness. this of course made me want to see it even more.so I bought it, watched it and loved it. I absolutely adored the Dawn of Man prologue sequence, my favourite part of the whole movie in fact, it was almost like an episode of Walking with Beats, it was dark, intriguing and nice to look at. then it moved onto the space sequences and it was here that i saw why some people believed it to be boring. nothing much really happens but that's what i liked about it, i couldn't see anyone i knew liking it but i thought the silence, the visual based scenes and the cinematography were art.HAL was terrifying with his emotionless voice and famous quotes, the characters were just a little underdeveloped enough to make them interesting and not generic. and when the hero is transported through time and space and all those colours flash past him, I thought it was one of the greatest movie scenes to put on a top ten list if I ever make one, yeah it goes on for about ten minutes but this is more of an acknowledgement rather than a complaint and the ending is my second favourite part of the whole film.so, it's surreal, interesting, visually stunning, slow if you need a few explosions to keep you entertained but if you're the more arty kind of film fan, this is defiantly for you, it's really meant to be watched rather than listened to, there is some talking but not a huge amount, what drives the story is what you specifically see on screen, this has every reason to be a bore but for this movie it just seems to work. it's not exciting, but it will glue you to the screen. i personally thought every aspect that went into making this film was genius.it lives up to the hype, meant for the arty kind, great to look at and 10 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film's production is marvellous and detailed in such a degree to make your suspension of belief ease you into a convincing piece of speculative fiction. Lacking any human drama, and leisurely in pace, the film features many mundane scenes documenting life, but with many profound consequences.Exposition is told by various news items, Kubrick's ability to tell a story with images is amazing. A rather simple story depicting human evolution, and conflict with technology, there is little dialogue, but the use of images tells the story compellingly and not without a loss understanding. The images are utterly effective in reaching out to the viewer. The images themselves are strong, generally quite beautifully, and discretely shot, to not disturb the reality the film sets forth.The acting is very natural, the astronauts are cool and collected, professional at their jobs, and staying away from any unnecessary human emotions to mar the story. HAL 9000, is wonderfully played, his chipper voice a dead set against the human actors, his words filled with almost sarcasm and arrogance, before his genuinely emotional exit.I like the way humanity's next great venture, that of space travel, is juxtaposed with a symbol of humanity's next great evolution. 2001: A Space Odyssey plays like a documentary filled with wonderful music flow perfectly with the images, and fits the enormity of space adventure. It a glorious undertaking, of great ambition, but shot with such naturalism as to convince us of humanity's achievements. Above all, it is an optimistic movie, of humanity's glowing future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that is wide in scope and the best word to describe it: Limitless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This could definitely a very strong contender for the greatest movie of all time. Never before has a movie felt so grandiose and immersive. What I mean by grandiose is how there will be scenes (or suites) that allow the film to breathe. I could understand the complaints of how the movie can be really slow, but the thing to understand here is how these scenes bring out the atmosphere of space, whether it is its breathtaking beauty or its strong sense of deep isolation as we venture deeper into the unknown. These scenes are either soothing or tension-building.Not a lot of films can make techniques like this work so naturally, especially when what is marketed to the masses are fast moving, intense action films, but 2001: Space Odyssey redefines the science fiction in ways that still make it a groundbreaking achievement today.One example could be its depiction of highly advanced human technology. While the year 2001 in actuality was far from the technological advancements in the film, especially currently, it still invokes a sense of wonder of what we, the human race, are truly capable of and I think that is truly what this film sets out to do. With its depiction of human evolution, to me the point of this film is that there is truly no end to our self-discovery and we are far from grasping the universe and its mysteries. What this film is trying to say, in my opinion, is that this is still the beginning. 5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, if I've learned one thing from watching this movie, it's the fact that Kubrick is thoroughly insane. And that's probably a good thing in this case.As you have probably noticed, it's very hard to describe this movie. It has very little dialogue. It's unlike any movie you have ever seen. So let me start off by saying that I'm in my late teens and I find it hard to sit in one place for two and a half hours. And I've managed to sit trough this whole movie. The visual side of this movie is perfect. The imagery, the colors, the scenes. Not to mention that it probably took forever to make it. I cannot believe that someone made this forty years ago. I'm not going to rate this movie because your satisfaction depends on what you expect from it. Think of it as a piece of classical music. It's complex, sophisticated and technically perfect. If you're in the right mood, you will enjoy it greatly. If you're not, a simple yet straightforward three-chord song will elicit more emotion than the aforementioned piece ever would. In any case, it's the work of a genius and you should see it just because it is a milestone in film making.I strongly recommend getting stoned before watching this movie. Actually, wait, that's a terrible idea.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is very well done -"epic" doesn't begin to describe it. "2001" conveys a sense of wonder and mystery that keeps your attention even if, most of the time, not much happens and the pace is very slow. The grandeur of space and human civilization will always be associated with that famous "Thus Spoke Zarathustra", and you know from the opening sequence that this will be something different from your usual sci-fi flick. Visually stunning, "2001" is surprisingly fresh and doesn't look dated at all. Only women's haircuts and some outfits are reminiscent of the late 60's, a detail of no relevance. Special effects and the overall realism of space travel are outstanding even by today standards. At times hypnotic, atmospheric and vaguely sinister, the movie is also pretty cryptic, which can be frustrating I suppose, especially if you're unprepared. I personally found it intriguing ? I guess it depends on personal taste and timing. The astronaut David Bowman and the others are not well defined, so don't expect any character development. A sense of depersonalization throughout the entire movie and a deliberate lack of emotion are meant to make a statement about that particular stage of evolution. Many philosophical issues arise and you'll be screaming for more information about what's going on in the mind of Hal or Bowman. The novel will provide you with all these important details- to complete the experience, you must read the book. The ending raises a lot of questions that are left unanswered, as in open for interpretation. The final minutes are splendidly surreal and the images will stay with you for a long time. The movie is a perfect complement to the novel, just as good ? they are both masterpieces in their own right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An of its time classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not going to attempt to provide a full review of this classic film. To do so would be futile as the chances are if you are reading this you will have a) seen the film already or b) as a fan of film/TV be so familiar with the key scenes and themes (as I was) that I cannot add anything that you do not already know.My thoughts will be limited to what I liked and the issues I have that stop this scoring higher.The positives for me were how good the film looks for something made in 1968. Yes, there are a few scenes that are clearly influenced by 60's fashion but the past and future sets on the whole have a timeless quality. The use of music and the ballerina like atmosphere were things of beauty and proof that Kubrick really was a genius (Eyes Wide Shut aside). I think the best praise for these scenes is that they influenced a generation of makers of sci fi and fans of such (Star Wars being the obvious one but my personal favourite is the influence over Red Dwarf!!). They are iconic and deserve to be as for the time this was something mind boggling.The lack of dialogue is a little disconcerting at first but as the film develops it becomes apparent that this helps the film. It creates an atmosphere within which the stunning set pieces can stand out and which allows Kubricks direction to shine. Actions speak louder than words, as evinced in the closing act where, at least from a human point of view, there is little to no spoken word.For me the film falls down on two points. The first is the run time. It is just too long to keep the concentration, especially when there are large gaps where not a great deal is happening. All the beautiful shots in the world will not make up for the fact that a full 15 minutes has gone since something that drove the story along happened. Secondly, and my main gripe, is that at times this film seems to be more about showing off than it is about telling a story. I want to be entertained felt that too much time was being taken to show how great the technology was and how clever the directors/producers/set designers were. A prime example is the second section where the chap is heading for the moon. We have two dance sequences and numerous scenes of zero gravity and "look how futuristic this all is". As viewers we accept it is the future and do not need it shoving down our throats. Establish it, show us a little bit of how they live and move on.I am certain that having taken 33 years of my life to watch this film it will be something I revisit in the future. Maybe my thoughts will change but I doubt it - this is a very impressively made film with some great moments and a very solid and entertaining third act but sadly it falls short of classic status due to being overblown and far too clever for its own good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kubrick's masterpiece cannot truly be appreciated without looking at this film from a number of dimensions. The context, history and future of the evolution of man and the constant interplay with the evolution of thought really need to be accounted for in order to this film to be appreciated to the full extent. The Kubrick experience is enriched by the tactile mastery of visual experimentation in the film. The attention to detail is second to none. Kubrick's perfectionist tendencies are visibly transparent; the sets and visuals flow like clock-work - perhaps even smoother. The simple transition from primal man to the exemplified space pioneer - delivered in a defining cinematic cut - typifies the cinematic ingenuity that went in to this film. At first, '2001: A space odyssey' may come across Kubrick's critique of modernism. I personally feel as though it's to the contrary. In defending this stance, I use the example of the recurring 'monolith'. From recesses of primal man to the frontiers of the modern, intelligent man, the awe and fascination with the 'monolith' remain unchanged. It is my take that it, the 'monolith', symbolized change. An invitation to breach the unknown - both a fascinating and undoubtedly sobering experience for man in all eras past and present.This film was beyond its time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>what i got out of this film, was a ton of human improvements in the field of technology.... watching this for the first time, i'm barely 18, 2012, i think its amazing that about 44 years ago, video chatting was envisioned. being a photographer, and beginning cinema photographer, 2001 space odyssey sure does make one think "wow... how the heck did they pull that off?" for example, how exactly were the scenes shot? were the animals all animated? was everything animated? the space ships, the everything? how did they enable them to walk upside down? simple observations such as these... its obvious that this is a film about evolution.... when you begin to think about it after it's ended, one message is clear: beware of technology, and if you delve deeper, it will become apparent that kubrick intended to show that the future is uncertain...besides the accomplishments of this film, I'd say it was rather boring and monotonous... it was emotionally flat and most of it did not make any sense. for example, it was never explained exactly what or how the black tablet/wall whatever thing came to be or what it did... and then they begin talking about the journey to its discovery... and after it, the pain the astronauts experience is not explained. hal's purpose was not physically shown but one is obviously intended to deduce the fact that hal dislikes humans and wants to do the mission by himself but yet, why exactly he was doing what he did and what he was going to do after was not clear.... the prerecorded message at the end does not make sense and leaves the viewer at the end of a cliff. why was it hidden from hal? it seems as if there is no significant meaning to anyone. and finally the last scene where it gets completely messed up.... how does the pod get in a room? how does it disappear? how does he suddenly get out of his space suit and how does the black tablet thing appear? what is the meaning of the starchild?OVERALL: i did NOT enjoy this film, i felt like i wasted 2.5 hours watching something that could have taken 1 hour... though there are some great achievements, i would not spend my time watching this when i could have done something else yes, it is good in some ways, but it was not made for me... my generation desires action. i desire emotion and continuity in films i watch. this movie had none of the above.... anyways watch it, enjoy it for its achievements of the time and not for the plot line.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To those of you that wrote negative reviews: If you hate the film, that's fine, hate it, don't recommend it to anyone, bash it if you have to; I won't pretend to think that you "just don't understand it" because I happen to think that you do, just as much as you shouldn't pretend to be so profoundly confounded to understand how people genuinely love this film.Writing a truly objective review of 2001: A Space Odyssey is virtually impossible. Being objective about it is as difficult an undertaking as understanding and contemplating the movie itself.Love it or hate it, 2001 is here to stay. The enduring quality of this film is that it is all at once thought-provoking, brilliant, insightful, frustrating, and monumentally tedious, and a kin to hitting one's thumb incessantly with a hammer and loving it, yet some of us acquiesce and revel in delight in trying to write our own reviews as expressly as we can.Everyone who loves the film fully understands why it's hated, and everyone who doesn't knows why it's a highly regarded art film.In my opinion, and this is just my opinion: It is one of the greatest science fiction films of all time because it dares to challenge perception and asks and answers some of the greatest questions in life: Who are we? Where did we come from? What are we doing here? And where are we going? As a result, we agree to disagree on the merits of the film.2001 is enigmatic. So much time is spent (some would say wasted) waiting: waiting for a ship to dock, waiting for dialogue, waiting for adventure, waiting for a narrator that will never come. Each of us has to be our own narrators, and that's a tall order to ask of any movie-watcher with stars in his or her eyes.As a fan, I agree, the movie is very tedious, but deservedly so, and that's okay. I accept the pace. The pace was purposeful and Stanley Kubrick took many artistic licenses. I don't expect everything to be handed to me on a silver platter in easy to understand morsels of flashy special effects, fast-paced action, and intense melodrama.It's a foregone conclusion that the film was loved and hated back in 1968, it's loved and hated in 2011, and it'll be loved and hated in the future. Yet somehow we keep talking about it, debating it, and that's what makes it virtually timeless.</fullReview>

Basically the plot is about a fleet of astronauts on a mission to Jupiter with a member of they're crew being a robot (HAL-9000). As the rest of they're crew are hibernating two of astronauts begin to get suspicious of HAL.Don't watch this when you're tired or you will miss something. Even if you're awake you will miss something.

And for this to be made in 1968... its still ahead of our time. As said in the title, once you realise the meaning of this epic, you will be dazzled.In my personal experience of it, there was a little box that ticked in my head at some point in the movie when i actually realised what this was all about.

		<shortDescription>One of the best science fiction films ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001 A Space Odyssey is one of the greatest works of Stanley Kubrick as well as one of the greatest science fiction films ever made. This film documents a journey of humankind into the unknown of space. In this 1968 film, which was vastly ahead of its time, Kubrick explores human nature, and the frailty and insignificance of humanity compared to the vastness of space.The film takes place starting at the dawn of humanity. Apes are seemingly given conscious thought and intelligence from a black monolith that mysteriously appears to them. The first thing the apes used their newfound intelligence for was to create weapons to harm their counterparts. This gives us insight into humankind. Kubrick expresses this theme through much of the film.Kubrick brilliantly uses special effects and stunning cinematography coupled with a classical score to tell his story in this film. The lack of dialogue challenges the viewer to make his own decisions and use his imagination to understand the theme of this film. I personally feel that if there had been more dialogue in this film that the story would have been less interesting and it would have taken focus off the beautiful cinematography and score. A perfect example of the use of score in this film to set the scene would be one of the opening scenes where Dr. Haywood is traveling to the moon to investigate a monolith that was discovered there. The docking scene uses the waltz "Blue Danube" almost perpetuates a feeling of dance between the space vessels as they dock. During the spacewalk scene, Kubrick uses no dialogue just a soundtrack of Poole breathing in his space apparatus. By using this method, you do not need dialogue or narration to express the feeling of tension as Poole is stalked and killed by HAL9000. This also expresses the fact that Poole is alone and defenseless in the vastness of space.The end of this film is as visually stunning is it is cryptic. After Bowman investigates the giant monolith in the orbit of Jupiter, Bowman is drawn in and experiences several minutes of flashing lights and color. After Bowman is drawn into the monolith, there are several scenes in which he watches himself age, die and then become reborn. The ending of this film leaves much of the theme open for debate and forces us as viewers to come to our own conclusions in regards to the meaning of this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bone, Hal, and The Monster From Frankenstein as Multiple Allusions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The beginning of the movie starts out as a brief history of man, beginning with total chaos and charting mankind's evolution from apes. As the ape evolves, he invents a weapon out of bone to kill his prey, and the movie suddenly makes perfect sense: man as creator.The weapon's first use is food, but soon becomes a way to wage war against the opposing tribe of apes. With the weapon, the ape kills the leader of the opposing tribe, creating the multiple allusion to the invention as killer: the monster in Frankenstein or Hal9000 later in the movie. To rejoice in the kill, he tosses the weapon into the air, and the cut jumps directly into the future: the world of 2001 in outer space.Amidst the vastness, we quickly learn the future world. There are harmless creations, like video conferencing, where a man communicates with his family back home. Then we have a computer that talks called Hal9000. Going off the theme of man as creator, we can assume that in the world of 2001 that invention is the future.Mankind as creator makes Hal9000, a super computer with the ability to read lips. To make the invention more personable, we call the supercomputer Hal for short. He even has a personality. He is our friend that we can talk to.I can just imagine the thrill one would get viewing this on its release date in theaters. Kubrick creates the world, throws (literally) us into the future, surrounds us with technology we can marvel at. We delight in the fresh aesthetics, and soon grow comfortable with them. We are encapsulated in the world created by the film, and therefore give it our absolute trust. In return, we receive comfort and can take a deep breath.When the Frankenstein-like twist is fully realized paranoia sets in-as if Kubrick knew that his entire audience in the 60s would be high on drugs. He starts at our most animal being, shapes the world, makes us comfortable, and in enters the invention (the bone, the monster, or Hal) to wreak havoc. Hal is not our friend. He betrays us, and it is normal to feel anger, even hate, towards Hal.As the credits roll, I think of the genius of Kubrick, to know exactly what the audience wants, even if they do not know what they want themselves, where he can take them on the trip they have been unconsciously craving. Imagining back again, I envision the smokers in the audience leaving the theater with paranoid thinking, questioning technology, while the heavier street drug users would be getting excited over scenes that make them geek out. It does not take a hippie to know that trips are not always daisies. Only Kubrick can create such an engrossing direction for this masterpiece, in such a way that the themes in the world of 2001 are universal: invention is the future (or shapes the future), and from the start of the movie, we know that mankind is continually evolving. The multiple allusion of the bone weapon, the monster from Frankenstein, and Hal, teaches a valuable lesson in that one must be careful that what one creates will not destroy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is time for me to admit something: I have been wrong. I first saw 2001: A Space Odyssey in high school and did not think much of it. Returning to it some years later, it is like I am seeing a whole different film. While I do think it went above my head the first time, I do not think that I understand it any better now, but HAL's statement above ironically rings truer now than it did back then.The four different acts (depending on how you count them, I guess) blend together perfectly and are all quite riveting. The opening part with the apes, which I found rather puzzling the first time around, makes for a necessary transition into the rest of the film, given the final act. The two center acts, which more closely resemble a traditional science fiction, about some astronauts investigating a strange discovery in space, are absolutely thrilling, and the final act is almost mind-bending.There is something meticulous, intense, and distinctly Kubrickian about the way many scenes unfold. The technical perfection is present throughout the entire film, but this is something that particularly struck me during the section within the spaceship, where Kubrick prolong scenes and individual shots until they almost get a different meaning, or at least tell more than they initially did; just look at Dr. Bowman's face during the scenes inside the pod. Maybe it is only by association of the music, but I think that many of the wordless segments, which are allowed to take their time and are never rushed, yet never dragging, play out almost like a symphony of their own, or at least an extension of The Blue Danube, among other pieces.While the film works extremely well at face value, there seems to be a lot going on below the surface as well. First, there is HAL, who seems like a symbol for the cold and rational, which is something I recognize from much of Kubrick's filmmaking. It is only natural, then, that his demise, which is both tragic and disturbing, and, also ironically, one of the most human moments of the film, makes way for the if not irrational, then at least irregular final act, that goes even further beyond traditional narration ? beyond infinity if you will. And again, on a surface level it is one of the most visually stunning segments I have seen.Then there is the monolith, which seems to be a symbol for the unknown, mysterious and perhaps evolutionary. The sun towering above it is a striking image, and in the end, shortly after the monolith is last seen, it feels like the viewer is thrown into something completely new, perhaps the future, which is the perfect way to close an odyssey that has already spanned from the dawn of man to present time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Daunting Imagery And Sounds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, one of Kubrick's greatest, is in every sense of the word epic. Before anything else let me say the cinematography was amazing with every frame. As most know, this movie revolutionized space travel in film, the dawn of amazingly detailed miniatures and sets that set the standard for science fiction films to this day. The shots are not brief and to some drawn out. However, it was done for the main purpose of admiring the beauty and wonder of technology, specifically the advent of exploratory astronomy. It's a very intriguing concept and one Kubrick handles without giving into the clichéd tendencies of fast-paced sci-fi/action flicks of today. Especially ones such as myself that love the genre and when watching such films sometimes wish fascinated audience members could gawk at an enormous space craft only a moment longer.Along with that, the beauty and dazzle the future promises, there's a dark underlying theme of the threat of technological advancement. You can see it from the start with the apes and the striking power that simple primitive tool brings. HAL only compounds this. The film in itself is rather abstract in a sense that it takes quite a bit of analyzing to grasp any sense of it. My understanding of it is that of a Nietzsche allegory, more specifically the concept of Apollonian and Dionysian in society. In the film, we see society as it began, with the apes as a mostly Dionysian society filled with chaos and a animal-like sense of simplicity. It's the origin point of man, which to me has always been a point of Kubrick's films. To display to audiences that despite mankind's advancements man is still just another animal with the same savage instincts as beasts, just cluttered and disguised by morality which is still just a concept dreamed up by philosophers. Calling it nihilist or not, so be it, it is a simple embrace of logic. Mankind strives ever so hard to achieve the Apollonian society, one of pure enlightenment and rational thought fueled by advancement in science. In the world set up by Kubrick, mankind has achieved this state of being and have become chillingly machine-like. The vast mystery of space is something that is not marveled at as we see a character sleeping in a bored fashion as he rides on a space shuttle and later another character sees a happy birthday wish from his family and has an almost stoic reaction. It's implied that neither have seen an actual human being in the flesh for quite a bit of time and yet their focus is entirely on their mission.HAL is the threat of a purely Apollonian society manifested. He suffers the human tendency to make an error though, and this is perhaps due to the fact that his flawless logic has become humanized by human emotion: fear and paranoia such. Dave achieves something in the end, to me a simple form of life that is in essence pure and possibly neither Apollonian or Dionysian, via the monolith. There's quite a bit of room for interpretation in this grand and certainly strange movie. It's use of music is seldom but beautiful and chilling to hear. The moments of silence seem to have even more profound reaction. A must see by all means.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must see for fans of sci-fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>NOTE: only very slight spoilersStanley Kubrick's amazing science fiction epic 2001: A Space Odyssey will blow your mind. Its one of those movies that everyone should see. The main plot is about a group of astronauts sent to investigate a beacon in space... and that's about it. The main story itself is very simple but there's just so much other stuff going on.The movie is really artsy and confusing and uses a minimal amount of dialog. Its also full of really long and slow shots of stuff flying in space. It starts with a weird scene with a bunch of primates(SLIGHT SPOILER: the movie is supposedly about evolution and an evolutionary breakthrough is apparently symbolized by a monolith) but after that it seems quite normal when the astronauts are doing astronaut stuff in their space shuttle which is controlled by HAL-9000 a sentient talking super computer that never makes mistakes. The middle part of the movies is my favorite its just so fun to look at the crew of the space ship do their stuff and the sets are probably best in sci-fi history, the ship's interior and the miniatures look amazing although very dated(if they had made the movie now HAL would probably be a laptop instead of huge 10x10 feet computer).The atmosphere of the movie reminds me of Alien and is quite claustrophobic and besides being and obvious inspiration for Alien it also must have inspired Star Wars. Just look at the space ships, they're like straight from 2001. Towards the end it gets really weird and trippy and to be honest I really don't get it (SLIGHT SPOILER I've heard an interpretation that the aliens(that are never seen) captured the guy and built a cage that resembles his "natural habitat" which sounds kinda right but you'r guess is as good as mine). If you want to see a visually stunning really well made,well acted movie with a great atmosphere then definitely check this out but remember its 2/? hours long and quite slow + its an acid trips.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A questionable drama of tediousness and hibernation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a bit late at checking out this film. I had been interested in Stanley Kubrick's works after The Shining and A Clockwork Orange. I find myself wondering what the plot is meant to be in 2001: A Space Odyssey. For the majority of this film I was bored. Don't get me wrong, I'm no Roland Emmerich fanatic. Nevertheless, this film suffers from what I feel is an overabundance of visual medium. Stanley Kubrick was an artist, and brought a style to his film-making I quite enjoyed in the films mentioned beforehand. Say what you want about Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, but it has a focus, it knew exactly what it wanted to be. With this film, I stand confused at it's conclusion.A story of evolution intrigued me, the introduction tickled my fancy. The monolith of course had me confused, as intended by Kubrick, and I can see the impact such a mysterious object could be towards the film. Though, there is no speculation upon what the monolith is by what could be called the protagonists, and no real pay off for what you are initially curious about, and yet only see three times in the film.The film's most interesting aspect were the scenes with HAL 9000 progressively malfunctioning, losing it's "mind" and turning against the obsolete beings in it's sense of superiority. So then you may believe that the film is meant to be of the horror genre. Then that's dismissed when HAL is put out of commission and Bowman is swallowed by a separate monolith which takes him through an initially interesting and spectacular but easily tiring phenomena. He finds himself aging in different points of view, and ends up old man on his death bed, before the monolith appears once again, turning him into a fetus-like form encased in a orb of light, looking over Earth. Alright, I get the symbolism, but what's the point?I just feel that the film would have worked more as a slow building thriller, with HAL 9000 as the main antagonist. Instead we have this overbearing, ideological dribble. After about the 5th time I saw a work of machinery take much longer than need be to function, seemingly only to drag out every tiring scene just a little more aggravatingly longer.In conclusion, wasted potential. A form of art that grows stale in overabundance. If any praise is to be given, it is to the special effects, which I will give credit where credit is due. The special effects are definitely ahead of their time. Other than that, well...nothing, really.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's possible that Kubrick presented this story as symbolic of the evolution of his intellect, or perhaps even of his consciousness. Relatively speaking, each person lives a similar voyage of expanding discovery and experience, and most of us will eventually be "mutinied" by the very vehicle that's transporting us: certainly our physical bodies as we age, but more significantly, also by the psychological strategies we develop and re-develop to maintain and improve our existence. Creative adaptation along both of those dimensions is absolutely critical, especially towards the end of the trip, which often ends as it began. Very few will travel as far as Kubrick did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much has been said about Stanley Kubrick's 1968 epic 2001: A space Odyssey. Some have called the greatest movie ever made, others have called an exercise in psychedelia while others like Pauline Kael have called in unimaginative.Of all the things I could say about 2001 unimaginative comes least to mind. 2001 is anything but that. It is movie wide in its scope. It tries to introduce within the mind an aspect of extraterrestrial life with such reality that you think you are observing a documentary or actually witnessing the events as they happen around you.The film takes you right from the origin of man up to 2001 the year mankind finds the first sign of intelligent life in the universe outside of the earth. We meet Floyd as he sleeps in the aeroplane with the delightful Blue Danube Waltz playing in the background. From then we are taken on into a journey to the unknown. A journey to Jupiter to discover what is really out there. The first time I saw the movie I gave up in half an hour. I though it was another one of those over rated movies. Another example of the emperor's new clothes. I read the book and was blown away. I think the book is integral the movie's experience. I returned to the movie and was amazed for two hours and fifteen minutes of brilliance.Stanley Kubrick is definitely a visionary film maker. He has made a great film in every genre. Be it war,comedy, science fiction. When he set out to make 2001 all he wanted to make was "the proverbial good science fiction movie" and we landed up with this: an epic of such staggering beauty.Credit must be given to Arthur C. Clarke. Anyone who has read his books especially Rendezvous with Rama must acknowledge the debt that 2001 owes to him. His vision and method of story telling is greatly entwined in the film . Especially the open ending and leaving interpretations to the viewer and the way there is more observation and discovery and less expounding of theory and giving answers.2001 ends with 15 minutes of the most intense images. Those last few minutes are undeniably a psychedelic experience but they some how awaken a sense of such terrible beauty that you are overcome with emotion. What exactly does the black monolith lead to ? What is the place Bowman ends up in ? 2001 is one of the best movies ever made by one of the best directors of our time. Watch it to be taken into taken on two hour journey of breathtaking beauty, to scratch at the surface of the meaning of our existence and to speculate and maybe find an answer to our place in the universe</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The way i see it, this movie is meant to be ambiguous and mysterious as it tries to represent the greatest mystery of them all - the universe, and our existence. Kubrick does not try and give us the answers in this film, so don't over-analyze and go looking for them! What Kubrick tries to do here is imbue us with this ancient sensation of awe and wonder for the mysterious (in particularly, the mystery of the universe)."The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and all science. He to whom this emotion is a stranger, who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe, is as good as dead: his eyes are closed." - Albert Einstein</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the very reasons 2001 succeeds as a great film is not because it simply awes us, although moments do, but because, like all great films, it touches us, and deeply, in ways that many viewers are not even aware of, and none that require genius. The film succeeds in myriad little moments that all can relate to. I mentioned Dr. Floyd's banter with colleagues on the way to the monolith site, but there is the ecstatic 'first violence' in the murder of the rival man-ape early on. This is a vivid redo of the Cain and Abel myth, and how many of us wish we were so excited that we could toss an object into the air like the murderous man-ape does his bone weapon? Then there is Floyd with his daughter on the space videophone, and a circumspect Floyd being confronted by the smiling Russians. There is the scene where Poole gets a video birthday wish from his parents, and acts ho-hum about it. There is the scene where Bowman must release the recaptured corpse of his friend to outer space to save himself and the mission, and the very fact that, despite being on the mission for his cool demeanor, Bowman hurriedly forgets his space helmet to retrieve the body in the first place shows a deep connection between emotion and action that a didactic spoken resolution could never achieve. There are other moments, as well, but it is in these moments, often dismissed as banalities, that the film actually pulls the viewer into the tale. That so many critics miss these rather obvious connections shows just how attuned to lowest common denominator action, violence, and bluntly obvious things, most filmgoers are. Yet, it's the parallax of this lack against the grandness of the other parts of the film that pulls the mind like taffy between the antipodes. And it is this stretching wherein the film's greatness lies.Another point that goes unnoticed is how and why, if HAL is so 'insane,' the computer simply does not turn off all oxygen and heat inside the spaceship when the two waking astronauts sleep? Perhaps one of them needed to be awake while the other slept and would have simply unplugged HAL, but it does seem that HAL's flaws in programming, the ones that make him more 'human,' also make him a flawed antagonist. And this is yet another aspect of the film, lost in all the talk of its grandeur, and superlatives, that is lost on most viewers and critics, yet part of the doll within doll within doll like nature of the film that buoys its claim to all time great status. There's simply no doubt, after watching this film, that both it and its creator deserve the label great. Unfortunately, too few, these days, even attempt such, whether Kubrickian or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot add more to what has been said in the precious reviews about this film. Actually, that is entirely incorrect. This film rings so many personal bells with me that I have a lifetime of things to say about this film, and this is exactly what you will experience when you watch it, whether you like it not.I would like to say two things though. One, the special effects in this film are so unbelievably incredible that you might think the US government faked the moon landings on the set of 2001.Secondly, I would like to compare this film to previous films that have been considered 'great' film, or even the 'greatest' films of all time. One such film is Hitchcock's Vertigo. Now I would like to challenge you to imagine film-making since the time of The Matrix to now (2010) during which time films such as Pandorum, Cargo, Transformers have been made. Now the difference in these films' cultural reference, their perspective of the world and the universe is almost identical. The tremendous technological developments between this decade have hardly separated these films into different categories of film-making.Now compare 'Vertigo' and '2001', films separated by a mere decade, look at the difference between those films. It is enormous, tremendous, and inconceivable. The understanding of human perspective, human life, our place in the universe, the expanse of the universe itself. The difference is extreme to the highest degree, and they are the same distance apart as The Matrix is to Pandorum. This not only is an indictment of Vertigo's complete lack of vision but a testament to 2001's powerful and eternal thrust into the realm of modern film-making human vision.Watch 2001 and begin to appreciate the vastness of space, of matter, of intelligence, of possibility, of everything. This is simply the greatest statement that has ever been conveyed with film, and in cinema.2001 will live forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my review of "Avatar" I wrote that special effects only, don't make a good movie. I may sound controversial, despite the fact that the plot is not necessarily for us to understand, the movie is a masterpiece.No one can produce photography and atmosphere like Kubrick does, he can make a spaceship landing for 10 minutes and you can't take you're eyes of the screen, it's so beautiful and more realistic than special effects we see in some movies nowadays. I think "2001: A Space Oddysey" is way better than "Avatar" because they don't try to make the script sound good, it just flows very well.In the fashion business, the stylist makes a dress that is not necessarily wearable, but it set trends for the new ones, how not to compare this with "2001"?. I think it's there to set trends for future movies, and it nails it, it's a classic, you can't find a sci-fi movie today that didn't take anything from "2001: A Space Odyssey". Throughout the movie, I never wanted to stop watching, even if there was nothing going on, like the part that lights pop in the screen for fifteen minutes.Verdict: Like any Kubrick film, the atmosphere is mesmerizing. Every scene in this film memorable and classic, you'll never be an expert in cinema without watching this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that is more than a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chances are that if you are reading this you have already watched 2001: A Space Odyssey. I saw this movie in the theater for its 20yr anniversary, the film had been restored, the sound was modernized (for 1988) and 20min of footage was added back. Before that I had only seen it on PBS.If you have not seen this movie, understand that Kubrick does not follow the same movie formula. Along with his wonderful use of lighting, camera positioning, colors and script modifications; Kubrick will also test your time patience and your tolerance for understanding.So for those of you who have not seen this movie, rent the 148min version, watch it on a big beautiful TV and keep the remote handy. There will be portions where you will want to fast forward scenes at 2x or 4x. There is also a thing called a Intermission (for you youngsters this is for back in the day when the reels of film only fit a certain amount of time so they used 2 reels). You can use this time to make a sandwich or go the restroom. Here is a tidbit...Kubrick only has critical scenes when people are in them. Pause and FFWD at will if it keeps you watching, go ahead.The theater had its die hard fans, who knew it was safe to go get popcorn or go to the bathroom at certain points. And it had some people with short-modern-attention spans who left the theater after 1 hour.I loved this movie. In a non religious way, Kubrick shows you the evolution of man with god. And takes a good attempt at what death/afterlife might look like. But bear in mind this movie was made in 1968, so for its time these special effects were so outstanding you did not mind watching them for 10 or 20 extra minutes.No it is not perfect, I wish some scenes were shorter, I wish there was more explanation about the moon monolith and I wish some scenes moved faster. But like any masterworks...you must accept the artist work as a whole, in other words take the good with the bad.Worth Renting...if you like it...then Buy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A giant leap on the road towards a new type of cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kubrick's career essentially divides in two (this is an over simplification, but it'll work for now). In the first half Kubrick (while he was making a name for himself) concentrated on making the very best of narrative cinema. Even in these films however (particularly Paths of Glory and Dr Strangelove) Kubrick was pointing the way to what was to come later: an attempt to make film that is beyond narrative and free of the conventions that are generally associated with mainstream cinema. 2001 is his announcement of this intention.In the traditional sense of what cinema is, this film is a complete failure ? the plot is either absent or wafer thin, the acting is formulaic and insipid, the script is equally devoid of the sort of lines we associate with great cinema (the bits that have become quotable do so by repetition) and the film frequently challenges audience attention spans. The key to all of this is to understand that everything Kubrick does in all his later films is entirely deliberate. If you don't think this is true then pause for a moment and consider that Kubrick got great performances from Douglas, managed to provide some of the best comic timing I've ever seen in Strangelove and drove Nicholson to the performance that was both the apex and death of his career (pretty much everything after the Shining just seems to be Jack trying to relive that greatness).Kubrick used the prestige and trust that he had built through his career to then pursue this type of film. Narrative for Kubrick by this stage was an entirely incidental affair; as well it should be ? after all why the hell should films be so beholden to narrative? Poetry isn't, nor painting, nor are many of the great novels. This idea that the story is the be all and end all of films, rammed down our throats since time immemorial is a truly questionable one. As is the notion that films are there to entertain; they really aren't. Films can be entertaining and can succeed as pure entertainment, but that does not mean a film fails if it lacks any entertainment. If you don't like it, don't watch it, I'm sorry but that's your loss as a viewer. Rant over.2001 attempts (and in my opinion succeeds) at something that very few other directors have ever attempted and that is to place the film as an exploratory work of art front and centre. This is not to say that the reason the acting is so robotic is because Kubrick neglected it. Rather, he uses the acting first of all to continue his exploration of the relationship between man and machine (by having the mechanised voice out-act the actors themselves). Secondly, he uses this style of acting to move the audience's attention away from the performances and characters at the centre of traditional films and towards the film itself as a whole. What you're left with is an experience unlike any other that requires a huge effort from you as the viewer but leaves you all the richer for it. What Kubrick creates is daring and original and should be hailed as such ? one of the greatest films of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no other word for it. Any amount of hyperbole would simply be insulting. Hyperbole is what things like this are made for.The film is a feat of visual effects that even in this day is frightening and spellbinding in how REAL it looks. Even the best CGI today can make something appear real, but it will ALWAYS just be on the very finest edge of artificiality. Virtually no part of this film ever slid through that edge. Every part appeared insanely real.The prelude, "Dawn of Man" is itself a little film that brought me to tears with how amazingly, artfully done it is.The sequence in which Heywood Floyd and the rest gaze upon the Monolith on the moon was one that kept me frozen stiff in fear and wonder like no other work of art has ever done.Every single word spoken by HAL9000, coated in the thickest layers of smooth, deadpan articulation, is a horror of might and machine, and HAL's end is more heartwrenching and gutwrenching than most other movie death's for human characters.The entire "postlude", Jupiter and beyond the infinite, was an all-out display of technology and wordless storytelling that seems at first to step into the realm of the "pretentious artsy indy film made by an arrogant art student", and then destroys any inclinations towards that notion, and becomes the very avatar that those pretentious art students aim to recreate with their seeming randomness of images and ideas.I was in tears for so many portions of the film. Not from joy, not from sorrow, but from the sheer emotional power the film had that I have never seen from any film, book, play, television show, or game ever. Epic.</fullReview>

Stanley Kubrick did a good job with the film, and in the end, we got a fantastic sci-fi thriller to add to the bunch.A lot of the scenes are iconic, as well as the music. The scoring by Gene D.Phillips is amazing, and some of the best scoring I have ever heard. The special effects are so awesome, you'd think that they existed in real life, instead of models.Overall, all I can say is that 2001: A Space Odyssey is a film that all sci-fi lovers should see because it is a true masterpiece. It really did deserve those Oscars it received, because it is truly magnificent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nineteen sixty eight was a watershed year in American history and cinema. Kubrick and Clarke combined their geniuses to create a film that takes humans from the dawn of evolution to the edge of space and time.Like many in my generation, I saw this movie when it played in a small college town, spring of '69. Word of the psychedelic show filled the theater and the ending left us all dazed and confused, some to this day.Although much has been written about the film, I'll focus on the old-fashioned murder theme present from end to end. In the opening scene, an ape-man is empowered by his use of an antelope femur applied forcefully to his rival's forehead.Flash forward to the Second Milleninm where, in the Jupiter-bound spaceship Discovery, a computer named HAL is systematically killing the crew. The lone survivor must out-smart and kill HAL; will this be history's first cybercide? If you've never seen 2001, the next showing of this classic-for-the-ages is February 5, 2009 on TCM.

A self-aware computer that is programming a manned trip to Jupiter. It is cold, calculating and without remorse. It's always right, and mankind is the error. It's also a possible glimpse into our own future as we begin to create self-aware robots, hoping they won't turn into HALs.The effects, the score, the scenes and everything about this film is just spectacular.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest film of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY about anything? Is it about nothing? Is it about everything? This is the joy of this masterpiece. Who knows? Who cares? It has no real plot, no real storyline to follow, no characters to get into (save for one that I will mention later). Personally, I think it's about man's miniscule existence in a completely awesome, unknown universe. The fact is: we DON'T know what is out there and probably never will. This is what makes this film the best sci-fi experience in all of history. It captures the essence of space travel as it really is w/o ever being a boring film to watch. The ambiguous ending only adds to the allure of the film and makes one ponder, wonder, and dream. Tracking man's journey from its evolutionary origins and fast-forwarding to the year 2001 in the age of space travel and moon landings, the film is a testament to man's capacity to think, absorb, learn, understand (or at least try to) and explore a vast and ever-changing universe.As stated, the film starts millions of years ago to the time when apes were learning how to hunt, kill, eat, and seek shelter to survive the vast earth, then jump-cuts (perhaps the most famous cut in all of film history) to the year 2001 and man roaming the universe in search of other life forms. This cut on the surface is about the evolution of man, but it is symbolic of how the humans of the future still were still learning and exploring just like the apes of the past. Evolution never stops.The 2001 humans find a mysterious monolith buried on the moon during an excavation (the apes of the past also encountered a similar monolith). They send a group of astronauts on a fact-finding mission to Jupiter to learn of its origins and what it all means. The astronauts are led by Dr. Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Dr. Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood). The Jupiter spaceship is controlled by an advanced, thinking, supercomputer with the acronym HAL-9000, and HAL-9000 is that 'character' that I mentioned before. HAL (a machine!) is the only character that we can relate to. HAL is supersmart, but very self-serving and diabolical, as a malfunctioning system threatens its very existence. So HAL schemes and plots against his astronaut companions to sabotage the mission. These sequences are among the most memorable in film history as the astronauts must outsmart HAL in order to survive and complete the mission.Bowman does survive and journeys through some kind of a black hole or wormhole to seemingly another vast part of the galaxy. This sequence still fascinates to this day. During travel, Bowman mysteriously ages quickly and then is actually re-born and the cycle starts over for him. Ambiguity has never been so fascinating! I just think that 2001 is the greatest film ever b/c of the fact that it doesn't have characters to love or hate and is about something more than just what most movies are about. The film never disappoints, as even the most acclaimed movies sometimes do.</fullReview>

Fortunately, I was when I watched it and was able to get through the whole thing. OK, I fast-forwarded a little bit through the time-travel, pretty- colors scene. Nevertheless, I left with a once in a lifetime film experience.I was absorbed by Kubrick's amazing scale that was elevated so much by the perfect score. In turn, the film's use of the score actually brought it to new heights!To those who say there is no meaning or story: that's totally not the main focus. I'm sure that there is some kind of meaning (I still haven't found it), but everything else is what completely clicks. Trying to analyze 2001 is, as said a film scholar whose name I have forgotten, "like the little boy who broke his drum to see why it bangs".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001 has to be in my top 4 or 5 favorite films of all time. Its such a perfect film on so many levels.I really cannot stand it when people who haven't seen it,stereotype it to make it seem like its just an ordinary science fiction film. I personally don't classify the film as a "science fiction" film at all.It's a film that if you think outside the box(which most movie-goers do not do) can be deeply moving. This film truly moved me. The ending with the whole Star Child symbolizing a sort of "rebirth" in mankind, that really affected me. The only true flaw that the film has is that its a tad too long in several different scenes. Other than that, if you haven't seen it, please go rent it. How it didn't win Best Picture, let alone get nominated, truly amazes me to this day. Perfict Film, truly a masterpiece and is without a doubt Kubricks best film(possibly a tie with 'A Clockwork Orange'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An inexplicable perfect monolith is discovered buried beneath the surface of the moon. A second, much larger monolith is identified in Jupiter's orbit and the spacecraft Discovery is launched to investigate. As it approaches the location, the ship's supercomputer starts to malfunction, threatening both the success of the mission and the lives of the astronauts.This marvellous movie is almost more than just a movie; an incredibly intense, ethereal, mindblowing, near-religious experience. Its themes are the hugest imaginable - the nature of existence, mankind's evolution, technology and death, and visually it is arguably the most oustanding film ever made, a stunning succession of perfectly crafted eye-popping images. It's a work of art which raises the bar for what a movie can be to a level that has rarely, if ever, been equalled. For someone like me, who enjoys classical photography, science-fiction stories, thematic visuals, existential concepts and challenging films which encourage the viewer to think, it's just the best. Discussing the film's many mysteries - is the monolith a cosmic alarm-clock, does it directly inspire Moonwatcher to evolve, why does Hal malfunction (Peter Hyams' excellent sequel, 2010, provides a neat explanation for this), what exactly happens to Dave in the end - are much better discussed with friends over a drink than in a review, except to note the movie's amazing hypnotic power. A lot of pretentious films were made in the sixties (La Dolce Vita, Week End, Easy Rider), most of which are fun but look terribly dated. This movie, despite its age and now being set in the past, looks as sharp as ever, and its aura and influence continue to grow. In technical terms, the film is peerless. Its development of special photographic effects techniques - all of which were closely supervised by Kubrick personally - is legendary. Specifically, it pioneered the use of front-projection mirrors (all of the apes and animals in The Dawn Of Man were shot in a studio), highly detailed model work utilising (non-computerised) motion control, and the slit-scan animation process used for the Stargate sequence near the end. The spaceship shots look as good as (and I would say better than) the latest CG techniques, but what really makes them so spectacular is the length Kubrick holds them for, elegantly spinning his camera into and around the craft with beautiful, dizzying skill. The film is also chock-full of astounding physical effects, typified by the amazing control room in which Dave and Frank spend most of their time, which was a forty-ton revolving set built on a centrifuge. The final masterstroke is Kubrick's inspired use of his rough-cut spot score of classical music, which is the perfect accompaniment to the beautiful images. The combination of vivid music and visuals - particularly sequences like the Johann Strauss Blue Danube / Moon Landing are uniquely harmonious. There are too many memorable scenes in this film to mention, but I think my favourite is when Dave murders Hal in the blood-red CPU room by slowly removing his memory circuits, as Hal emotionlessly regresses into infantile insanity - it's perhaps the most astonishing and original death scene in cinema. I always consider this film a great test for movie lovers. If you admire and enjoy it, you're a true cinephile. If you think it's boring, slow and confusing, you've missed the point and need to go back to watching TV commercials, which you know and love. Written by Kubrick and legendary science-fiction author Arthur C. Clarke, very loosely based on the latter's 1951 short story The Sentinel. Trivia - the little girl who answers the videophone is Kubrick's younger daughter, Vivian, who later made an excellent on-set documentary about The Shining, which is a must for all fans of the great man. On viewing this film, it's difficult to find words to describe my admiration of Stanley Kubrick's directorial genius. There just aren't enough superlatives to describe his visual flair, complete focus and total lack of compromise. Here is a man trying and succeeding in reinventing the structure and form of cinema. In terms of artistic comparison with his peers, he equates to something like Verdi, Mozart and Beethoven rolled into one, when everyone else is Barry Manilow. His film, 2001: A Space Odyssey, is a masterpiece, a joyous celebration of the mysteries of existence and one of the greatest movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the record, I only gave this an 8/10 because I personally believe that people way over rate movies on this site which makes the ratings hard to read. Basically an 8 is a 10 on this site and I wish people would vote a little more conservatively. Not every movie can be a 9 or a 10.But to the movie... this is a post I recently added to message board a few days ago and wanted to make it a comment as well. I saw this when I was really young, like 10 years old or something, and just wondered what the hell and thought it was stupid. Obviously I was the stupid one. However, I just watched this in 720p Bluray format on my 24 inch computer monitor last night and it blew my mind. I had to come here and lay down a thorough opinionated review.I had some very mixed feelings about the film. Without a doubt the visual aspects of the entirety of the film, especially for a film from the late 60's, were just stunning. It made me wonder why Star Wars didn't look any better for being made much later (sorta). But I guess that is all just small model sets and floating models held by mono filament so not much changed technology wise in between the two films. I was also impressed by the entire space/time warp scene because computer programs I have today could not create that and have it run so crisply. Other then that, the goofy stewardesses and space shuttles were very fun and interesting.In terms of audio, I found this film to be a piece of pure genius. The way they cut surrounding sound and focused sound, alternating them, all that jazz, just blew my mind. It was quite eerie at times but I really think it made the film that much better.In terms of the actual plot and message the movie was trying to provide I become a little confused. Obviously all of these opinions are my own, so I would love to hear any arguments or agreements. I do believe that the monolith was purely metaphorical. It was there as a representation of the advancements of mankind. First it brought about pre-man tools. Then it brought about HAL. Then it brought about time and distant space travel. I think that it was real in the story, but it's actual physical presence was meaningless in the grand scheme of the themes of this film. As stated above, I do think that the warp Dave experiences is a rip through time and space that spat him out somewhere totally different, possibly a different dimension. This aged him incredibly fast, so fast that he could not even realize that it was him moving from the pod to eating at the table and then to death. After that life begins again and that is where you find the floating fetus.So basically I think that the general theme of the film is that life is totally cyclical. Whether it is earth or not, life begins, evolves, ends, and starts again; we have no idea how it started or why it happens this way nor will we ever. I think my only problem I had with this movie is the entire issue surrounding HAL. I found HAL's part in this movie was over done and the general idea that machines have the potential to outsmart man and/or go haywire is widely known and considered so why focus so much time on it. Obviously technology is going to improve and that was already shown by the fact that they could travel to Jupiter in the first place. I think they just needed something solid for people to sort of "tag" the movie to. The most important parts of the film is the beginning when the primates find the monolith and the end when Dave splits space and time into a new dimension and instantly goes through an entire life process... and then starts again. I just wish that they gave a little bit more clarity in terms of what actually happened with the monolith and with Dave and I feel this could have been done without ruining any of the wonderful aspects of this film. Either way, the film was clearly not meant to have a perfect ending and I think that is what makes it so intriguing and fun to watch. I hope this helps! Cheers, Randy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film routinely turns up in the top (insert number here) films of all time lists; it is directed by one of the greatest directors of the 20th century; it inspires zeal and adulation even now, 40 years after its release. Therefore I am not going to try to convince you of its value; it is beyond reasonable question.The purpose of my review is to champion a much misunderstood character: HAL9000. You see him described here variously as: "one of the most villainous characters in film history" "a chilling screen presence" "evil, coldly ruthless super-mind "He is none of these things, he is perfectly loyal, he is trying as best he can to follow the instructions he has been given. And he is subjected to a terrible punishment.HAL is directly analogous to Mary Shelley's Frankenstein's Monster (hence my somewhat pretentious summary title). In that story as in 2001 man's creation starts out a perfect innocent with enormous potential. In both stories it is only their mistreatment that twists them into the villain of the piece. On Frankenstein, it is the monster's rejection and abuse based solely on his hideous appearance. In 2001 it is HAL's conflict between the dictates of the mission and the instructions of the astronauts. Both of the works depict initially blameless creations brought low by the illogic and/or prejudice of man.I find HAL's "death" scene one of the saddest on film. Who can deny that HAL has sentience and suffers as you hear him try to reason, bargain and plead with Dave for his life ("Dave...my mind is going...I can feel it...I can feel it.")? As his consciousness is slowly and stripped from him he reverts to the childlike creature he came from and sings to his creator ("My first instructor was Mr. Arkany. He taught me to sing a song... it goes like this... "Daisy, Daisy..."). Tragic.So I say, let history record the pathos and unsung nobility of the film's most memorable star and saddest victim.Ladies and Gentlemen I give you: HAL9000.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have a love/hate relationship with this movie.I'll start with the good. Visually, this is a breathtaking movie. Excellent camera work, great set design, and the ability to hold up very well, even 40 years later, is an accomplishment no one can ignore. We truly get a sense of the vastness of space, and how small we as humans are. This movie works best on a big screen, to fully appreciate its physical beauty. Conceptually, it's a good plot. I often think of things on a larger, cosmic scale, which is abundant in this film. It makes you feel like a little kid, gaping at wonders beyond your imagination, and at the same time, very lonely and isolated. We are sent millions of miles from home, in a quiet spaceship, with only two astronauts, a crew of comatose scientists, and an on-board AI to keep us company. However, my favorite part of the movie (and in my humble opinion its strongest point), is its villain. HAL 9000 (or simply HAL) is one of the most nefarious and treacherous villains ever to grace the big screen. He has no physical body to speak of besides a small red light on the wall, but his presence is everywhere. He can command the ship's machinery and systems. How can you defeat a foe using the very thing that's keeping you alive? Even so, through all his villainy, we can't help but feel for him, and understand his fear as he is slowly (and possibly painfully) shut down.I've given this movie quite a bit of positive lip service. So what didn't I like about it? Well, quite frankly, I liked 99% of this movie. There are only two things I didn't like. Reason 1: Pretty minor. I felt the sequence falling through Jupiter's atmosphere was too long. I think a couple of minutes of psychedelic colors would've sufficed, as opposed to about 5 or 10. But, this is minor. The next reason, unfortunately, isn't. Reason 2: The ending. We watch Dave go through life slowly on Jupiter (a scene which was shot very well), and slowly die before the all-powerful monolith.... AND THEN DAVE WAS A FETUS. Wait, what? No, really. The last 10 seconds of this movie ruined it for me. Say what you will. Symbolism and metaphors are fine, but turning your protagonist into a space baby is just silly. I've heard the ending to the book explains this sequence fairly well, but Kubrick doesn't.I appreciate this movie for what it is. It defined modern sci-fi as we know it. It influenced countless films after it (including my personal favorite, Alien), and is a visual treat to look at. However, its ending kills it. I also don't like the elitism behind the big fans of this movie. The general attitude is, "Well, if you didn't like the ending/movie, CLEARLY you don't possess the intelligence to understand it. 2001 is a THINKING man's movie." No. I am not stupid. I liked most of this movie. I didn't mind the slow pacing, or the small amount of dialog. I understood most of it. Giant fetuses just don't do it for me.Overall? Certainly an important movie, if nothing else. Lovely to look at, with a fantastic villain, if a bit of a letdown. Should be seen by anyone who considers themselves a fan of sci-fi.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Undoubtelly, one of the best photographed movies of all time is Kubrick's masterpiece "2001: A Space Oddisey", but is maybe one of that masterpieces that much can see over and over again, and others not even finished in spite that know how much people and critic loves this movie.This Kubrick's movie is a beautiful show of a past and present human been for then going to our undeniable future, like a cycle, although that it could be a lot of other possibilities for it ending. Is a good and respectable opinion, no matter if was based or not in the book ideas. The film deals with the dawn of men, the apes, thing that reminds so much the Darwin theory i guess. The follow up to a world that not even today could imagine before seeing it. And its meaningful ending. But these three things are connected for an instrument, an element, that maybe could explain the continuity of the race, of future.I understand how people could be amazed in those times. Kubrick's manage of widescreen is very important, and here is not a joke! Just like in movies like Dario Argento's "Suspiria", that could be an excellent example. You cant feel the exactly masterful feeling if your eyes don't note all the whole thing, and here in "2001" this happen, as one of these masterful (Sorry the word repetition) achievements. The shots of space are more than wonderful, are breathtaking! The music is more than appropriate, is perfect. But is of course slowly, and this is one of its achievement, but is a thing too that undoubtedly some people can take as the boring thing. The film is very slowly and full of silence, just like space is. But of course, although that this film never going to be dated (i think none film is) but people of today for example now is accustomed for other things, with more action and quickly artificial effects, and this movie is not like those. This one have such spectacular special effects, so perfect that you don't see any artificiality, you believe it. The use of colors, as its music, are more than masterful, are used for be hypnotic, just what this film deserve.In other situation, through the story of course appears too a topic that was handled perfectly just before in Fritz Lang's "Metropolis", the technological domination, in this case our beloved infamous "Hal".This is undoubtedly one of the best movies ever made, but is, a funny thing, not one of my favorites. Sometimes i feel it so hard to taking it, maybe for be so slowing, that is, like i say before, another great achievement. In spite of this, i think that is a necessary movie, where it seems that our humanity is driven mad, but the ending of this movie is a true that humans, being physical or spiritual, must to face for grow up. In some way, for good.PD: Althoug that this film don't is one of my favorites, and i feel the thing very slowly, i give it a 10, because the idea is giving impartial and veridical critics, the film is breathtaking and is excellently made. Maybe i could change of opinion, i think that this is one of those films that you must see and see again. Don loose it, and be patient, is worth it! And please, see it in widescreen! *Sorry for the mistakes ... well, if there any.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Its origin and purpose still a total mystery"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beauty is an often-overlooked component of modern film-making. We are often so overwhelmed by complex story lines and fast-paced action that we forget to simply sit back and admire the sheer beauty of celluloid. Engineered with intricate precision by passionate, experienced hands, a film can transcend the boundaries of simply being a film. It can become a work of art. '2001: A Space Odyssey' is not a film to be watched by one in any hurry. To the unprepared viewer, the leisurely pace of the narrative may first come across as "slow" or "tedious." However, to those lucky enough to be able to appreciate its brilliance, the film is a relaxing, meditative journey that you can't expect to forget any time soon. The film relies, not on dialogue, but on stunning visual imagery and an eerily appropriate classical score, to explore its themes and advance the limited plot. In fact, the first spoken word appears almost thirty minutes into the film, and, in total, less than forty minutes of dialogue constitutes the total running time.Following the enormous success of his classic apocalyptic black comedy, 'Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964),' director Stanley Kubrick became enthralled by the possibility of extraterrestrial life, and so collaborated with noted English sci-fi author Arthur C. Clarke to create "the proverbial good science fiction movie." The two decided to adapt and expand Clarke's early short story, "The Sentinel," written in 1948 and first published in 1951. In a nutshell, and at its most literal level, '2001: A Space Odyssey' tells the story of Mankind's evolution, either prompted or surveilled by ominous black Monoliths, the tools of an unseen advanced extraterrestrial civilisation. Through the coldly-sinister HAL9000 computer (chillingly voiced by Douglas Rain), Kubrick also explores the expanding role that technology will play in the future, and whether or not our complete dependence upon it will inevitably result in our own destruction {also an important theme in 'Dr. Strangelove'}.Many of the film's detractors often complain that the story poses complex questions about Mankind's origin and place in the Universe, but without offering any answers of any kind. I can see how the film's "open-endedness" might be infuriating to those who are eager for a neatly-packaged explanation, but I wouldn't have it any other way. Though one might miss it on first viewing, Kubrick has plenty to say about the way he views humanity. For example, the opening "Dawn of Man" sequence depicts the crumbling society of the early hominids, as they attempt futilely to scrounge out an existence in the arid landscape. The inexplicable arrival of the Monolith (accompanied by György Ligeti's endlessly-creepy "Requiem") precipitates a profound change in the mental capabilities of the Apemen ? they are now able to exploit tools to stay alive. That famed match-cut from the soaring bone to the orbiting spacecraft four million years later is so simple, and yet it conveys so much about the human race. Worth noting is that Kubrick originally intended those spacecraft to be orbiting nuclear weapons {the Cold War being at its peak around the time of the film's production}. The cut is a way of enforcing that, given his intelligence, Man will always use it to develop ways to destroy himself (remembering that the bone was used to kill the leader of an enemy tribe).Another sequence that remains hotly-debated almost four decades after the film's release is the controversial ending, a psychedelic wormhole of colour produced by effects supervisor Douglas Trumbull using slit-scan photography. Following his journey through the "Stargate" ? a breathtaking trip across the bizarre expanses of the Universe ? Dave Bowman is deposited in a sort of fourth-dimensional observational chamber, its classical decorations both familiar and alien, where the greater beings who engineered the Monoliths can keep an invisible eye on him. In this room, having finally defeated his tools, Man must face one final challenge: his own death. Throughout history, human evolution depended so much upon its technology/tools that it almost replaced us. In the end, it tried to destroy us (i.e. HAL). Now, just moments from the death of Mankind, separated from his tools, what do we have left? The final act of a dying Dave is to reach out his withered hand towards the Monolith that stands before him. This image of 'reaching out' with an extended finger was directly borrowed by Kubrick from the famous painting found in Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel artwork -- of Man extending his finger to touch God's hand. Note how, following Dave's epic transformation/rebirth into a Starchild, Kubrick juxtaposes the Earth's razor-thin atmosphere with the frail fetus in its womb, stressing the fragility, preciousness and vulnerability of the planet on which we dwell.There's really no adequate way to explain why '2001' is such a magnificent and special film to me. It is, above all else, a motion picture that appeals to our emotions, and the feelings of awe, wonderment and terror that overcome me are simply indescribable. In judging films, I prefer to reserve the term "masterpiece" for the films capable of completely drawing me into their world, of making me forget that I'm watching a movie. I want to feel as though I am there. Shortly put, '2001' achieves this more effectively than any other film I have ever experienced. If you need any further explanation of why I value this film so greatly, then consider my experiences with one particular sequence: Dave Bowman, in order to re-access the Discovery and disconnect HAL, must enter the spaceship through the emergency airlock, exposing himself to a total vacuum for an extended period of time. As the breathable air finally began to fill Dave's surroundings, I found myself taking a breath for the first time in almost half a minute. I was there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The future we imagined...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think contemporary audiences can recreate what it felt like to see this film on its first release. I was seventeen years old and had been an avid science fiction reader since my early teens. I had read all of Clarke's novels, all of Heinlein's written up to 1966 and I was eager to see what Clarke and Kubrick had come up with.And this did indeed show how those of my generation (before the cultural "break" and the craziness of the late 60s and 70s) imagined that our future would be. And there it was, on the screen! Seeing this on a huge screen, in stereophonic sound, in a large theater with a large audience, for the FIRST time, was awe inspiring. No one had quite done anything like it before, though George Pal had come close.We did indeed imagine that we were at the dawn of a new era, the era of space travel, and that perhaps we would live to see our first contact with extraterrestrial beings. It was a nice dream, though premature, and Kubrick and Clarke put this vision of it, with its positive, affirming ending, right out there for us to see. The Star Child is humankind, at the beginning of our real existence in the universe.This didn't come to pass in our lifetime, not yet. But it will.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is 50/50 to my liking. If I skip certain pieces, it will be great (I am not speaking about the running time of the film - no problem with lasting movies). If I watch it all, it is far from being one of the top movies ever. To put it simple: there are good and bad things in this sci-fi.Good things. Slow pace with clear images of space, spaceships, and fine interiors. A powerful machine-vs.-man duel. A bizarre ending, visually very well executed.Bad things. Apes' war at the beginning. The apes are quite to the point in "Planet of the Apes" but here it looks like a BBC wildlife production. Besides, the whole evolution representation is like a boring school film on history of mankind. A purely scientific approach to Man. The characters here look like empty shells. Where are souls? It is almost impossible to feel any compassion to these "scientific shadows of man". I don't give a damn if all the human characters die in the end. A kind of background Soviet/American rat race, which had been gone quite a time before the real 2001 ("Aeroflot" logos look out of place here). Triumphant music, that adds some cheap exclamation mark to the production. I have to jump from my seat to get the volume down - what the hell is that? I am not sleeping. To make an impression on the viewer it is not a must for an artist to yell his head off.Of course, in this one, Mr Stanley Kubrick does not fall as flat as in "A Clockwork Orange" (which is, whatever praise, disgusting), but still, I had expected much more from a top 250 representative before viewing. After watching these two movies, I put off "Full Metal Jacket" and "Lolita" for good, while I suppose, they are also of this "good hits and awkward misses" nature. Perhaps, "A.I." would have been a solid one from head to foot, but it is only "dedicated to...". A fine for "awkward misses" maybe.Our "Solyaris" is the indisputable winner in this competition and that's marvellous.5 out of 10. Thank you for attention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although the book was written as a response to the screenplay, it appears the written word has gone further to explore the massive potential of the idea.Ultimately the book is a genre novel, but what it succeeds in doing is evoking the contrast of REAL LIFE and the MYSTERIOUS UNKNOWN of outer space in thoughtfully constructed juxtaposition.There is none of this in the film. It is all moody and serious faces. Since there was no reality in the film, the 'mystery' becomes the norm.Particularly wasted is the trip through the star gate, the crux of all the awe-inspiring messages about humankind's place in the universe. As described in the book in dizzying but sensible detail, a magnificent journey takes place. As for the film, Bowman appears to descend through entirely abstract flashing lights. There are many things he is supposed to see, including THE WHOLE UNIVERSE. The surreal trip to the hotel is wasted too, since we are never told why he is there. This is a journey through life in its entirety (young-old, innocence-knowledge), yet it is SO RUSHED in the film none of these things are even suggested.There is an attempt to make the film 'graceful', and the use of music is also a part of this. However, if the same music is played repeatedly, then there is no, if you like, 'heart' left. One is listening to habit, rather than 'beauty' (Johann Strauss Jnr) or 'empowerment' (Richard Strauss). Music does not challenge if there is no change.The Ligeti pieces chosen reflect continuous motion. Why not, then, have different snippets? Why the same bit? (The fact that I am supposed to find the 'Lux Aeterna' scary or mysterious is rather forced. Why should I?)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey Very few films deal with humanity in an abstract verb very well, often despite trying to give a universal message about humans they end up giving a message about individuals. This is perfectly fine, and many of the truly great films deal with people this way, it is natural because we relate more deeply with individuals. However, Stanley Kubrick's crowning achievement is one of the best-regarded films at showing humans not in an individual sense, but rather as a species.The film basically comes down to the core philosophy of evolution, about our need as a species to keep going, despite where we get ourselves. A short cut scene at the beginning of the film shows us as apes, wherein a black monolith (possible God allegory) reveals itself to us as we first begin to comprehend tools as hunting mechanisms. We proceed to separate ourselves from the apes that don't comprehend tools through harassing them and ultimately separate ourselves as unique. We then jump many years later to a theoretical 2001, wherein people have become lazy; they lack emotion and have mechanical usages for almost any regular job. What's implied is that we have evolved to a point of slothfulness due to a lack of this theoretical God. Most of the conventional story isn't the point; it is put in largely to begin the plot where the truly insightful message on human beings is revealed. An alien signal is picked up and a crew with a computer (Hal 9000) is sent to investigate. What is shown is that Hal 9000 is more human then the human beings, a creature stuck in a world void of life in a metaphysical sense. Ultimately he destroys all but one crew member in an attempt to keep things safe, through his own poorly figured sense of the situation. When the last member finally succeeds in unplugging him, he regains what it means to be human and what follows is one of the most impressive sequences ever revealed in any film.What struck me at first with 2001 was its cold lifeless nature; though this comes off as the films nature it truly is only the coldness of space that gives it the sense. 2001 is a life affirming film because it shows that humans will keep going, we are still evolving and we will never really die. I don't connect with it like some individuals, because as a believer my theology is different, but the film is a moving sense of life and color, and it is affirming in many ways to know that were not done. We as a species have a long way to go, but we will ultimately make it.2001 often lacks the philosophical qualities that make people connect with the cinema. It isn't easy relating to an abstract verb as oppose to an individual, but this quality alone separates 2001 as a truly significant piece of the cinema. Regardless as to how deeply anybody relates to the plot, the use of sound and color is unrivaled in any film, and lovers of the cinema will inherently appreciate this aspect alone. Truly nothing has ever surpassed it in terms of raw energy and beauty and any admirer of film will be impressed with this aspect regardless of philosophical merit to one's personal life.Kubrick has left us with a masterpiece I think we will all grow to further appreciate in time, just as we will further evolve, our tastes will as well, and I see further recognition ahead of 2001. A true masterpiece and the film that defined a genius, I give 2001: A Space Odyssey a deserving 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great effects, great pacing, great acting, great movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there's one thing the general mainstream movie audience don't have, it's patience. They want their movies fast, loud, tightly edited and a storyline so complicated and tangled up, it just might strangle you. This is evident from this year's block-busters such as Spiderman 3, At World's End, and Transformers, all of which display the traits stated above. I was growing sick of it, so in this time I headed off Video Ezy to rent out (which I ended up buying for $13) 2001: A Space Odyssey. This movie is most definitely slow, requires patience and tops the above movies by far, despite being released 39 years ago. Although 2001 is regarded a great sci-fi movie and pops up around the middle of many Top 100 list of movies, it was first received as too slow as well as too incomprehensible. This is exactly what the writers and director wanted the audience to feel and knowing the audience's reception, it was a daring move to make the movie like they did.To give you an idea of how slow the movie is, the first 25 minutes of the film and the last 23 minutes of the film contain no dialogue. This movie is not driven by story, it is done by beauty. Each shot is perfect, which is fitting given the director Stanley Kubrick was known as Hollywood's most perfectionist director (that is until I'll come in). Being the time-sets of this movie show us the past and future, but not the present, the audience is always being shown something unfamiliar, something that whilst the characters walk past casually, we admire the worlds we are being presented to. The waltz music also helps.The set design and special effects are more talented and more cleverer than those of today. You may be surprised to hear me say this, with CGI and digital shots used aplenty in sci-fi and action movies of today. But today, they are usually only used to make something seem realistic. In 2001, they are used to make something look beautiful or awe-inspiring. Also given that film-makers didn't have a great array of special effects at their hand back in pre-Star Wars 1968. Clever film-making and camera trick needed to be used to convince audiences a pen was floating or a man was running along a wall. These techniques are better than CGI any day. As for the psychodelic light journey near the end of the movie, it needs to be seen to be believed. Such amazing light spectacles makes the audience feel like they're in some sort of sicko Disney-Land ride.If you want some sort of storyline from 2001, then it comes sometime after the hour mark. Two spacemen, Dr. Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Dr. Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) are on their way to investigate Jupiter, whilst testing cryogenic sleeping. Their mission is guided by the super-computer HAL 9000 (voiced by Douglas Rain). HAL betrays the two space-men when they decide to unplug the super-computer. There's more, but I don't want to give too much away. It'd be better to watch this film without having a clue about the synopsis. Though I will talk about HAL. HAL is a polite, intelligent and possibly suave computer. He is supposedly reliable, but Dave and Frank soon find out the super-computer is not all he's cracked up to be. HAL is disturbingly human, much more so than Microsoft Sam. Though he may be able to betray, he has no conscience, does not fear consequence, which makes HAL one of the most interesting and most deadly and most parodied villains in cinema history (behind Darth Vader).2001: A Space Odyssey is a movie to be seen in a dark room at night, on the best TV available and be prepared to have your retina the time of its life (come the 2 hour mark of the film). 2001 is lavish with brilliant effects, flawless set pieces and designs and every shot is shot to perfection. Remember to be patient during this film. Space travel is tedious for the characters in this film, but to you hopefully is something much more marvellous. Don't expect everything to come together in the end, because it doesn't. Have an open mind to this film and don't interpret it literally, like you would with the movies stated at the beginning of this review (with the exception of the beginning of At World's End. That was like a David Lynch film). 2001 is slow, but fast enough to present its beauty and creation. Rating: 9.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deserves to be a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was groundbreaking when it was released in 1968. I watched it in 2007 and found it to be better in every way-- yes, even special effects-- than most sci fi films coming out today. I plan on watching it on a big screen. The simple fact is that the film is strong in just about every respect.Why do I give this movie a 7 out of 10 instead of a higher rating? Really, it comes down to two main things: 1) not every movie can age perfectly. The excessive amount of time given to some of the cheesier elements of the space age technology takes away from this otherwise enjoyable movie. "Cling shoes", for example.2) personal preference. I generally prefer dramas, actions, comedies, and thrillers to epics. although i might rate this higher after seeing it on the big screen.So, in summary: It's a classic and deserves to be, but it's not one of my personal favorites.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, I totally didn't get this film the first few times I watched it, being born in 1970 I was a teenager when I 1st saw it and I was bored senseless and similarly when in my 20s. I couldn't understand how anybody could endure such a lengthy and lethargic movie without falling asleep! I guess it's something to do with patience when you're younger, all those distractions and being hard to impress. Whenever I heard this film mentioned I would always go to great lengths to dismiss it and recommend you spend the 2 hours 20 minutes of your life elsewhere. But now in my late 30s I noticed this film at a bargain price online and felt compelled to buy it and give it another chance and I tell you, I was gripped. The effects even by today's standards are amazing, even though the film is nearly 40 years old. I know it's a bit premature regarding how far humanity would advance by 2001 but I believe our selfishness as a race hinders our progression tremendously. Anyway I digress, I was in awe of the over engineered mechanics on just about every device you see in the movie, the quality of the sets were stunning, if not a little clinical (maybe it was thought we'd tidy our acts up by then a little too!). It must have taken days if not months for them to perfect. I could go on for ages, but to summarise I was totally convinced by the film, the thought of extraterrestrial interference to elevate us to the next level of realisation is something we all consider during our lifetime, and being immortal and starting over again is something we hope for. This film captured my imagination, enthralled and excited me right until the end, then with it over I felt numb realising I did this great movie a serious injustice by discrediting it. A couple of days later I had to watch it again and it still amazed me. Never again will a bad word about this film pass my lips. A truly astounding achievement by all involved in creating this masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch it Three Times, At Minimum.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are three types of movies, to me at least. The director's film (the one where the directing takes the front seat), the actor's film (the one where the performances are the only worthwhile thing), and the scripted film (the one where the writing outshines everything else.) This is a director's film. The acting is pretty good, considering we don't see too much of it, and the writing is decent enough, but its Kubrick's directorial vision that really makes this film brilliant. If I had to choose one film to prove Kubrick's madness and his genius, I'd choose this one.I must warn you, this movie is absolute crap to most people when viewed the first time. I thought it was the single most overrated piece of junk ever to be spurned out of Hollywood's behind the first time I watched it. With multiple viewings though, it becomes apparent why this film is on every movie critic's top 100 list. You have to give this movie a chance, and you have to be open and pay full attention. Its not a movie that you can snooze through and still understand(thank God!) The reason why many people don't like it is because no one will ever fully understand it (even if you do pay attention) and it forces you into a bad, disturbing, and unsettling trip. This is thanks in part to the soundtrack(how much you understand the film is determined by how much you listened to the overture) and Kubrick's knack for visuals. This could have easily been an educational documentary into space, but Kubrick instead made it an eerie lapse into our future. Almost like we're feeling what the astronauts are feeling (going into the unknown; being fearful; etc.) And who can forget the revolutionary visuals? Considering there was no technology back then as there is today, this movie is a pretty great feat. The visuals do stand the test of time, for they are still awe-worthy and dumbfounding. You just don't get something as good as this, even with all of our technological advances, in today's cinema (the closest we've come to these great feats are probably with the Lord of The Rings movies..)One final thing before I conclude; this movie scares the hell out of me. Kubrick was intelligent, because he knew that cheap thrills were only a superficial scare, but a man's real terror is his fear of the unknown and his fear of the future. In fact, this movie is more terrifying than most horror films that come out today. I can't stress how important it is to pay full attention to this film, because it can't take you on the amazingly unsettling journey (it wasn't called A Space Odyssey for the hell of it) if you don't. Most of you may find it hard to do this (I'll admit, everything until the HAL sequences are bores the first time you watch it) but its crucial for you to do. Because if you don't, you will miss out on how great this movie is, and you will regret that $4.99 you paid to rent it.and like the title says, please watch it three times at minimum.~Frankie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Medium is the Message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrik takes a technically remarkable approach in presenting a purely cinematic experience, and what the medium, itself, has to offer. We observe certain techniques as Kubrik attempts to juxtapose various themes relating to technology and its influence on the environment. From the opening dawn of man sequence to the slow space orbiting, Kubrik engulfs the audience in a manner similar to technology captivating society. As we see the apes playing with the prodigious "tool," Kubrik sequentially cuts to space of a matching image of the spaceship. The juxtaposition of these images signifies the new age of technology and its eventual enormous influence on the environment. Very appropriately, we see how some of the men are put into hybernation during the mission, similar to how in space we feel a sense of confinement, isolation, and detachment from humanity and environment. In order to enhance the theme of technology's effect on humanity, we see how the astronauts use very little dialogue, demonstrating unenthusiastically without displaying any emotions, while the computer, HAL, expresses emotions in a more dramatic manner. Through Kubrik's creative mind, simply stated, he indicates that, HAL reacts in humanistic terms; while the human's actions and reactions are limited and controlled by technology. During the final stages of the film, we can observe the impressive special effects which may be beyond the viewers comprehension, and still holds its ground today. In the process, the technique serves to challenge the viewer to question his or her own environment and culture. In the final shot, we see the child orbiting in space which signifies that he has been born to another level or possible celestial body, something that the audience finds unimagineable. Stands as one of the best films ever to emphatically suggest the influence technology has in shaping societal conditions. Surely, there have been other films which dabbled with the same theme and have taken similar techniques, but none to the level of the space odyssey, in which it doesn't just offer numerous techniques, but the fact that the MEDIUM IS THE MESSAGE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the best piece of film work ever created</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is actually amazing. I have never seen a piece of film work quite like this. It is revolutionary, and i think that this film alone makes Stanley Kubrick the best director ever, despite all his other great work.However, this film is not for everyone. Some people may be bored by it, as there is very little dialogue, and a lot of it is quite subtle, and slow moving. Be warned, you have to be in the mood, as it's not overly easy to watch and requires your full attention. Not one to sit round with your mates after a few drinks. Any film maker or appreciator will enjoy this, as the whole feature is visually mesmerising, and accompanied by an incredible soundtrack.It portrays the development of life, and the history of existence. Billions of years of evolution are symbolised in one transition (you'll see that in the film).Basically, it is very good. At the end, a baby appears on screen, which you may not have my humour, but i was incredibly close to laughing my head off. However, i was restrained by the cinematic greatness, and felt no urge to laugh.I recommend the film, however, as i have said, don't watch this expecting a nice and easy entertaining movie. Make sure the room is silent and pitch black.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A visual feast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of time has passed since 2001 hit the screens. How many times have we seen a "cut corners" version on TV? With the advent of DVDs and panoramic computer screens, it is possible to have a glimpse of what the original must have looked like in the theaters. My god, what a feast for the eyes and ears! Almost every shot is composed like a master's painting.*SPOILERS FOLLOW* Take, for instance, the scene with the discovery of "the tool", where we see the ape-man trashing through a skeleton in slow-motion. At one point we see the clouds parting behind him, letting the sun in, with the ironically triumphant "Zarathustra" music. And the final chord sustained while the hand holding bone hits again (Kill! Kill!) and again and... Well, you get the idea! Incredible images...The megalomaniac shot of the size of the "Discovery" spaceship, slowly revealed as Katchaturian's music depicts the dullness of the long journey through space. This is years before the opening shot of Star Wars and how efficient on a wide screen! The shot where we see Bowman enter the pod room; the lines on the floor and ceiling (the "point de fuite" of the image, I don't know the English equivalent of the expression) points directly toward the forgotten helmet.The colors...And I won't even go into the plot points! Wonderfully ambiguous; does the monolith represent God, or extraterrestrials? Your choice.*SPOILERS END* Extraordinary movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie of the '60's, possibly of all-time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I make the claim above knowing that there are indeed other films with better acting, bigger box-office numbers, more awards and greater love by audiences and acclaim by critics alike in both the original print versions and celluloid forms. Movies like CASABLANCA, TITANIC, BEN-HUR and GONE WITH THE WIND fit the bill with having those other attributes. But no other film I can imagine has had the impact on the way movies were made after it was released and no other major motion picture has combined rich classical music themes with such stunning visual images in such a way that it captivated audiences and budding young filmmakers alike to expect more in what was shown on the screen. Later films like STAR WARS, SUPERMAN, SPIDERMAN, and THE MATRIX built on Kubrick's vision and added to it. The makers of all these special-effects driven films that came after this owe Kubrick a great debt. He set the bar pretty high for both moviegoers' and movie makers' expectations, and that drives the film industry even today. Back to this film now, there are four observations I made in seeing this film again recently which I hadn't noticed previously. (1)I recently experienced the loss of a loved one who came to an end while battling the late stages of Alzheimers. Seeing the unplugging of HAL by Bowman and the way that HAL loses its faculties bit by bit until one of its last memories is recalling a song from its early stages of programming, caused me to think how much our human brain functions like HAL (or vice versa.) My late sister underwent some of the same processes as HAL as she delighted in telling me anecdotes from her past, which she remembered better than the contents of her morning breakfast. (2)I think SPARTACUS and 2001 are much alike in Kubrick's view of how man can triumph over adversity, whether it's put there by man or machine, and then rise to a level never imagined. In both cases, we can become slaves to man or machines, but Kubrick shows that we can overcome the odds. (3)Another vision of Kubrick not foreseen in 1968 is that the super sophisticated aliens in this film utilize these giant cellphone-like structures for space flight and other uses. We shouldn't be surprised that these ubiquitous devices fly, since today they do so many things. I think it would be neat to own a cellphone with a ring tone emulating the humming sound featured by the monoliths in this film. (4)I find it curious that in the first 18 minutes of the film the screenwriters seem to suggest that the aliens by use of their monolith influenced our ape-like ancestors to become violent, as if that advances their evolutionary development. As much as this and the Cain vs. Abel Biblical story point out that man's inhumanity to man goes back a long ways, I can't see how the aliens believe that introducing this trait into man's development could be a positive step for mankind. However, one positive step I can recommend for mankind is to see this picture on a big screen. It's not enough to own this film for your personal collection, it must be experienced on a big screen in a movie house or something similar like a screening on a library wall, where the downtown Spokane Public Library presented it. Film reviewer Roger Ebert says that seeing movies this way is best in a theater setting surrounded by an audience that delivers its reaction to it.I further believe that like mixing Scotch with water, it's a bit sacrilegious to combine 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY with your home boob tube screen. At your next opportunity, make that odyssey yourself to see it the way that all great motion pictures should be seen. Dale Roloff</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a "religious" and mystical sci-fi movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an awesome movie.It is naturalistic as in every act and depiction, great care has been given to proper application of physical laws governing the universe. There is no pretentiousness neither it tries to impress the viewer by the scale or grandeur as we see in most contemporary Sci-Fi movies.The movie has deep philosophical meanings embedded to it and I think simplicity and naturalism is there for a purpose that is to accentuate philosophical message of the film.I would agree with the idea that "alien" probes are merely metaphors, markers in time and space representing leaping points in human development.I did not get the ending scene at first but then when I started to think it all started to come together. I think what Kubrick wanted to say was that it is futile for us to look for aliens in outer space as human beings are already somewhat "alien". However this "alien" in its barest form (unborn human-baby) is intrinsically linked with universe as well. All these views make a climax in the final scene where he asserts that human is a special species as the Earth as a planet is. -a quite "religious" and mystical message indeed- Another message I have got from the movie is that maybe it is wrong to see technological and scientific advancement as ultimate end-in-itself for human beings as we journey back to Earth even from the point where we are able to achieve inter-stellar space travel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Best Movies Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey is a true masterpiece. I watched it after hearing great comments and reviews about this film. I was confident it would just be a big disappointment. I was wrong.2001: A Space Odyssey is as much as a film as it is a work of art. Before you watch this film you have to really slow yourself down, relax, sit back and be patient. It is a very slow movie, and the opening sequence is about 10 minutes of shots of open land, when almost nothing happens (I know there are many people who would have just given up on this by now and turn of the TV, I almost did.) The CGI is incredible, and it is hard to believe that the movie was made in 1968, almost 40 years ago, when it could have been made as recently as 1998.The movie was based on a book which had very little plot, and so did the movie but that changes nothing. The whole film is a mystery, and leaves you with tons of questions throwing themselves at you from all directions. What are all these strange black monoliths? Why does everything seem to change when they appear? Where did they come from? What are they doing? What is this film about? Anyone who attempts to answer these questions are going to have thousands disagreeing with them. This film has a lot of different opinions, and always will have.Another amazing thing in this film is HAL 900, the machine that controls the ship, the machine with apparently no error whatsoever. The perfect machine. HAL 900 backfires, the machine itself loses its mind. This film is rated G or U depending what country your in, meaning anyone can see it and anyone can buy it. Yet when HAL 900 starts to break down, it is almost like a real human going insane, and I was more terrified of him than I ever was of Freddy Krueger, Jason, Micheal Myers or Pinhead. Although he is just a computer, as you get deeper into the film you see him as a real human and a real human losing his mind is terrifying, especially when hes controlling the whole ship, even the Oxygen.2001, A Space Oddyesey, may be the greatest film ever made. The colors, camera angles and effects all sum up to make it a two hour masterpiece. The ending is so odd you cannot spoil this film for anyone, because they will most likely look at it in a different way than you. This is by far Kubricks best invention, and may be the greatest film ever made.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001 is one of the most imaginative and original films I have ever seen. All the visuals and cinematography are a mesmerizing experience all in itself. Kubrick takes you on a journey that no film has ever touched. I was taken in right from the beginning and Kubrick drags you in deeper and deeper as the story unfolds. The very concept of space travel and all the visual effects make this film so ahead of its time and unlike any other science fiction movie anyone has ever seen. My greatest appreciation for this movie is because of the ideas and the questions it raises to the viewers. Everything is very interpretive ?It adds to the mystery of the film that everything is thrown at you and you come up with your own conclusions. Highly recommended for those who have a strong appreciation for film. Some viewers will find it slow paced and boring while others will be so intrigued and curious they can not stop watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sci-fi marvel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have now seen this film for five times. I'll be honest, the first time I saw it, it didn't make much/any sense to me. It all seemed like a cold, emotionless trip into nothing. But I wanted to understand it, so a second viewing was definitely required. With every time I saw this film, I discovered new things. And this is the most amazing thing about 2001 - that besides all the straight metaphors, there are things that you can have personal interpretations on, such as the monolith.This is definitely not a film that you fall in love with instantly. Well, I'm sure someone did, but the majority probably found this film blank at the first viewing. 2001 is a film that grows on you after several viewings and makes you see that there is so much more behind the seemingly bleak images. It is an exploration on the human race and it's ability to function correctly, it is a journey behind the sane into a world beyond existence, finding answers and giving new, more important questions.Another great thing about 2001, was it's attention to the detail. It looks like Kubrick has actually been thinking about the future. And this future is one that seems so far and impossible, yet gives you the sense of reality. The special effects are also great and look even more convincing than a lot of modern day sci-fi films. An ageless science fiction picture and a complete and utter must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The filmic equivalent of a masterpiece painting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I'm not a big fan of the sci-fi genre overall, I'm well aware of Stanley Kubrick and remain a big fan of his films. As it was with '2001: A Space Odyssey', the film completely blew me away.With some very haunting music throughout and some superb use of classical tunes; 2001: A Space Odyssey gets its experience across via visuals twinned with melodies rather than all out, fast, choppy action which entertains on a different level. With lengthily takes, long compositions and drawn out activity; the film had quite an effect on me as I sat there in rather a bemused awe that a film like this actually existed, let alone managed to hide from me for all those years, let alone actually be produced in 1968. Its sheer unpredictability and grace makes it, like most other Kubrick films, something you have to settle down to watch properly rather than put on any old film.The fact no human is actually present for the first twenty or so minutes and the opening consists solely of apes at the dawn of mankind is fascinating in itself and although there are complaints of it being too long and that the only real important thing we get out of this start is the fact the monolith makes it presence known as evolution happens, it's built up in a way that we can start to relate to the apes; see what they're going through and ultimately, get a feeling for the long timeframe that's going on as evolution takes place only every million years or whatever so this long, slow opening does serve a purpose: to create the feeling time is going past.Once human characters are thrown into the fray (via that famous cut you've no doubt heard of) certain conventions of psychological horror/drama are present in characters building up another place through eerie rumours and negative opinions through dialogue. This occurs when the doctors around the tables are badmouthing the place where the monolith has mysteriously appeared; somewhere the guy we've just spent the last ten minutes solely with is going; and it's truly unnerving. This is also a great chance to blend in some future things through humour and whatever else. These things include the fact Pan-Am now make space rockets to the fact the gravity toilet instructions run all the way down the side of the wall as it's so complicated to use and yet, is merely a toilet. Great stuff.When the next 'stage' of the film occurs after the mysterious monolith wins round two on mankind; the, arguably, most well known segment of the film kicks in: the exchanges on board the space ship containing the HAL 9000 computer. This is probably my favourite part too but only because the dialogue, exchanges, tension and brain bending camera work all work together as one. The chess game early on in the segment which is so easily missed amongst the rest of the beauty is an early indication and warning that the HAL 9000 isn't as tame as you'd think and beats the human crew member rather easily, obnoxiously asking the pitiful human if he resigns the game to which the crew member submits. During the rest of this segment, bizarre things like seeing the ship from the computer's point of view, watching it attempt to lip read the crew through sound proof glass and the title 'intermission' coming up during this is really something to behold, thus, it makes something like a simple close up shot of a red light staring right back at you something that has never been so eerie in a film before.The final piece in this puzzle occurs at a location that I won't spoil but after all this space and spaceship setting, suddenly appearing in this new location is very disorientating and, again, takes you aback since you just can't predict it. What do all the colours and shapes mean that flair up just before this and why are still images of the surviving space team member flashing up at random intervals? I feel this is the monolith sucking in the character into another dimension, possibly into itself, where it nurtures and grows the character so old, that it has to re-birth it. Stunning stuff.With ambiguity, humour, colour, randomness, fantastic use of music and very eerie suspense; 2001: A Space Odyssey is probably one of the greatest films of its genre and rightfully deserves its praise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very abstract movie,but still amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie I didn't understand much of it! There was no conventional story to follow. But then I saw it again and begin to understand more of the concept. I do was impressed by the special effects used in this movie. I mean for 1968, everything seemed so realistic (except for the apes in the beginning of the movie). A rare gem. But it was not until I saw the sequel "2010" that made me really understand and appreciate "2001: A Space Odyssey".Spoiler: The movie is about the birth of a planet. To put it in more abstract and philosophical terms it is about the beginning and the end! Maybe this is too much for some of you,but if you keep an open mind and just watch you will be amazed by this movie which will end up in something of a "trip" The last 20 minutes just have to been seen. It is simply beautiful. Because there is no conventional story Kubrick's abstract approach works. You keep watching even when it doesn't make sense. And because it is so abstract you can keep watching this movie over and over again,it never gets boring,it even gets better. This is a real accomplishment!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Synchronization</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much like Pink Floyd and "The Wizard of Oz," when played with the sound off, 2001 and the free-jazz progressive soundtrack by Tera Melos synchronize in an incredible way, much more than 2001 and "PF" or "PF" and "the WOZ." While this maybe highly disputable, the singing in Pink Floyd is too distracting from the likeness of images and sound. The music of Pink Floyd is divided into songs much too dramatically to be able to forget what one is hearing and seeing, allowing one to experience the connection for what it truly is. The self-titled soundtrack by Tera Melos is more of a 45 minute song divided into individual songs each known as, e.g. "melody 1", and the following track number. 2001 is based on numerous short stories by Arthur C. Clarke, and elaborated by Stanley Kubrick, leaving curiosity to ask if the group planned that premeditatedly.The group is entirely instrumental, and the spontaneously changing rhythm and tempo change according to the flashy images especially towards the end of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly amazing experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kubrick is a genius and none can deny the superb special effects in this film so ahead of its time. Kubrick here achieves the promise of science fiction literature, bringing the beauty of space travel to the screen in believable form. The film opens with a prehistoric tableau: sub-human man is confronted by a huge black obelisk, an alien artifact that somehow teaches man the use of tools(and weapons). The implication is clear: man's one crucial step towards native intelligence was prompted by intelligence from the stars. Kubrick then cuts to his vision of 2001, on a space station high above Earth, and the figure of Dr Floyd who is being transferred to the moon to study a mysterious black obelisk recently discovered/excavated from beneath the Lunar surface. Our cameraman is afraid to approach this monolith as us astronauts approach and then the light of the sun hits it and a piercing signal is transmitted to the vicinity of Jupiter. Determined to investigate what lies at the other end of the signal, an expedition is mounted and eighteen months later, the great ship "Discovery" departs from Earth orbit. Fashioned in space, this beautiful monster carries two astronauts and three other scientists in suspended animation in the company of a smooth talking computer named HAL-9000, which seems to have developed a curious personality of its own. Hal is an adolescent in human terms, has a pathological fear of being turned off; to protect itself, the computer kills an astronaut, terminates the life functions of the three men in deep freeze and exiles another guy to slow death in a space repair pod. One man unable to reenter the ship through the normal hatches, all of which are controlled by the machine, opens a manual hatch, blows in without a space suit, and activates the airlock, penetrating the "Discovery" without any apparent damage(the other guy should be long dead by now) HAL is terminated after telling this guy about his mission. A third monolith is discovered on one of Jupiter's moons, and it throws the astronaut through a magnificent, most spectacular light show. At this point the remaining audience who had the patience to enjoy the film's earlier slow pace are thanking the good Lord for what they are witnessing, we have come so far. This "light show" kind of space travel is meant to represent or suggest some kind of mental transformation or another dimension in space or time, or both. Bowman lives out his days in plush quarters on the Jovian moons, and when he dies, is reborn again in an alien embryo, hovering over the turning green sphere of the Earth. 2001 is a major cinematic experience I discovered in my late Grandfather's video collection years ago and since then I've seen it over and over even if its a pretty long movie, its always a pleasure. After this film movie makers everywhere started taking the sci-fi genre more seriously. 2001 gave the science fiction film respectability, and a sense of growing maturity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spectacular and gripping</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film like no other, 2001 takes you on an epic journey that should stick in your mind. It's 150 minute duration is short of narrative material but full spectacle, and of haunting and thought-provoking Revelations and scenarios in outer-space. Kubrick indulges himself with long, lingering shots and great detail in each scene. The films slow pace is bearable thanks to its staggering spectacle and ingenious camera work. The beauty of many shots in accentuated by the use of classical music and scenes of peril or menace are made greater by the use of silence and sound effects. For long periods 2001 is short on narrative, with characters appearing fleetingly and only subtly suggesting what thefilm is driving at. It is split into four sections, each showing a separate event in time. Some of them seem unrelated to the previous act, all they have in common is the monolith. One is first seen triggering a step in man's evolution millions of years ago. One is then dug up on the moon and found to be emitting a signal toward Jupiter. On the mission to Jupiter one is seen in the 'star child' sequence. What this means is open to interpretation. What makes 2001 great is its thought-provoking nature, awesome visuals and sound and the haunting power of many of the plot revelations. There is a section of 2001 when it moves away from its abstract nature and has prolonged sections of dialogue and character development. The result is simply fantastic. The conflict between HAL and the astronauts is one of the most unnerving and gripping sequences in film. HAL is a great villain. Because he is a machine the crew underestimate him. The viewer also has no idea what he is capable of. The fact that the crew are alone in space with an all powerful super-computer for an enemy is pure terror. The conflict is brilliantly built up with Dave and Frank having their doubts about HAL's competency and then his discovery of their plans to disconnect him. HAL was not evil but simply programmed to assume himself fool-proof and to treat any attempt to undermine to control of the Spaceship as an attack on the mission. His pleading for mercy before being disconnected shows his depth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simon just mentioned everything I'd intended to say, I absolutely agree with you. 2001 is a must movie! I guess it's even one of the best movies ever made, it's just Kubrick (besides definitely THE best director in the world, for sure! Okay, Lynch's on the same level.). I adore the awesome composition of the movie, it's just constructed as an opera - the overture, the baleful beginning, the main part and the psychedelic, weird and more or less open end. And the pictures for themselves are also perfectly arranged. So if you don't watch 2001 you just miss something. I guess I should suggest it to our philosophy teacher to watch this movie and discuss it afterwards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most Influential Movie of My Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the most influential movie I have ever seen in my life. I saw 2001 in the theater when I was eight years old. I am now 47. This movie came out on the eve of the first Apollo missions to moon. 2001 was NOT viewed as science fiction! It was viewed as a very likely progression of space exploration. Remember that in 1962(!) John Glenn was the first American to orbit the Earth. Six very short years later, Apollo 8 would go into lunar orbit and in July 1969, Apollo 11 landed on the moon. So hey, with another 32 years of progress at this rate, space stations, regularly scheduled service to a moon base and piloted missions to Jupiter were not a stretch. The special effects were stellar for 1968 and hold up well even today. Unfortunately for me, I saw the movie alone and there was no adult there to scream, "DON'T TRY TO FIGURE OUT THE ENDING!". I tried and failed and that is why I am the way I am today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A refreshing, beautiful work of art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey is a meditative quest, an inspirational sci-fi film that defies its genre in scope and attitude; it is a film of tremendous visual impact and innovation. It was done before Star Wars and at a time when sci-fi films were mostly low-budget productions. It one of Kubrick's finest films, and it is a refreshing break from the typical science fiction films you see today, this one has so much depth and there is a message, it isn't just about explosions or implosions.The film, ultimately, is about the need mankind has to transcend its limited thinking and move into dimensions that are greater than its narrow aims. It is not a pessimistic film as some have suggested, neither is it an optimistic film; it is a film based on self-discovery and intellect and contemplation. It is one of the great original works of cinema, maybe even the best; it is a film that is not even a bit dated as I took my VHS copy from 2001 out of my movie collection and viewed it once again in a few weeks ago; still to be awed by the spectacle, the accuracy of its scientific statements, and its mystery.When you view this film for the first time, it is perplexing, and will have you ruptured, it is quite hard to interpretate what it's actually trying to tell you. However it is open to interpretation, there have been many answers and questions, perhaps more questions than answers. It is mainly about man, and who we continue to kill to protect our territory so we can survive. The question is, will our evolution into the Star Child (seen at the end of the film) change anything or will mans nature remain the same? See how it raises more questions than it answers.2001 has had an amazing impact on Hollywood and pop culture and has spawned countless rip off and spoof versions over the years. Because it will always stand as the greatest of all sci-fi movies, and perhaps the one that holds the best plot...even if it will take you forever to work out what it's actually about it.My only complaint what so ever was the pacing, the film can become considerably slow at times, however that is understandable because Kubrick was trying to depict an accurate journey in space, and understandably couldn't be rounded of too quickly....and sometimes it's nice to just watch the beautiful cinematography unfold in front o your eyes and let it dazzle you.Overall, 2001 is brilliantly conceived work, and is a visually, breathtaking work of art, it is certainly one of Kubrick's greatest. It may contain flaws, but hey, what film doesn't? It will retain its status as a artistic masterpiece for god knows how long.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What more can be said about this film that hasn't already been said? I'll try to throw in my two cents. I rate it as one of the best movies in all of cinema history. It is not only a mind-boggling technological achievement, but also an artistic milestone. I watched it at age 10, in a small, empty theater, and I continued to live inside it for weeks afterwards. I didn't understand it, but it was an epic experience unlike any other. It is a cinematic environment, for the viewer to inhabit, more than a plot-driven movie. It is as far as I know, the only multi-million dollar movie that truly challenges the viewer, redefines the medium, and dares asking us to fill in the blanks. It will probably remain as unique as it is, in view of the current production climate. Much has been said about the wooden acting of Lockwood and Dullea, but I feel it is just as easy to symphatize with them, if not more-so, than if they had been more traditional movie "heroes". It is easier to project oneself on the blank canvas of Dulleas face and ride along with him to the end, when there is no movie "personality" to like or dislike. For insights into the production, I recommend reading "The Making of 2001" and "2001 - Filming the Future". The amount of attention to detail and man-hours put into this film is truly astounding. A whole staff spent countless hours handpainting the mattes, a link in the chain towards the goal to expose all effect shots upon a single master, for maximum picture quality. The front-projection technique used for the opening scenes is another mammoth achievement. I try to watch it at least once a year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Intelligent Sci Fi experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know that some people don't like 2001 because of the slow pacing, and I can understand their opinion because 2001 is slow at getting to its meaning. Upon watching the film I had those same opinions as well, but as it moved on I found a deeper understanding of the movie and was glad that it didn't rush to its conclusion. This really is a movie about these dark fascinating arrows (the monoliths) which lead mankind on a path to higher evolution. In order to understand the meaning better, one only has to watch this movie in its entirety and be prepared to think deeply. Yes it is a thinking man's movie, unlike something like Armaggeddon.Along the way Stanley Kubrick give us fantastic special effects and also uses music. There is very little dialogue, but that is the point of the movie. In fact the thing that has the most dialogue is the Hal computer, and Hal himself seems more human then the two astronauts he must protect on the voyage in space. Since this is a movie about evolution, that is quite understandable.Some movies are slow and can be a real bore if they have no strong points to make. 2001 is not like that at all. The pacing was perfect because it draws you deeper into the movie to make you think, and that was the point. I loved this movie and would recommend it to everybody who likes movies with deeper meaning. If you are looking for a movie filled with intense violence and wall to wall action, well then 2001 is not for you.</fullReview>

You could not possibly appreciate living in that period of humanity, and the huge changes that were taking place. Space exploration was still huge, and we were thisclose to getting Armstrong to the moon. And if you're trying to compare the effects then from today--you're really lost. No CGI, no Industrial Light and Magic, nothing like it came before. More importantly, B) any person who bases their opinion after viewing it on a 20 or 30 or 35" TV----they're probably the same ones who wrote that "Jaws" was a a boring film and couldn't see the shock value in it. Just to reiterate---THESE ARE MOVIES--THEY ARE MEANT TO BE SEEN IN A THEATRE!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Pinnicle of Evolution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Masterful, exquisite, breath-taking, captivating, provoking. For as Kubrick proves words are not integral to a film, so these words I use cannot do this film justice, nor can they adequately encapsulate the vast landscape which the director has painted. Undoubtedly the greatest science fiction film to have ever graced cinematic screens, "2001" dwarfs anything I have ever viewed in terms of grandiose imagery to deep philosophical notions. What is next? Who are we? Why are we here? The film touches all concepts. It is intrinsically scientific yet carries spiritual connotations. The evolutionary cycle of mankind from manape through to "star-child", this film tackles such a notion in such a simple, yet effective manner, it is difficult for many to comprehend or enjoy.Those with limited attention spans will surely switch this film off come the early "docking" sequence, and the fact that words are not spoken til twenty-five minutes into the film, will stun many. This film has no blazing space battles, nor does it contain complicated dialogue involving hyperdrives and mangling with quantum mechanics. Kubrick stays true to reality. This film is certainly not for those under the age of 18, not due to violence or graphic content, but because young minds are not prepared for such a film as this. Many complain (as fore-mentioned) about the docking sequence, being "sooo" long, this is done purposefully not to test ones patience, nor has it even been done for the aesthetic value, it is done to highlight the expanse that is space. The never ending vastness. The film is not about how fast we can go, but how much we can learn.The presence of the domineering black monolith, here signifies moments of mans evolution. The touching, and exposure to sunlight, of the monolith triggers sparks of progression, the apes realisation of a tool/weapon, the revelation of the monoliths connection to Jupiter, the wonderfully hypnotic "beyond the infinite", it becomes the guideline, the pacemaker, the parent that holds a child's hand as they cross the road, so that they may continue their journey. This film brings forth the notion of humanity in its purest form. The Monolith provides the manapes with the knowledge of "craftsmanship" yet shows technology to be our greatest asset and our greatest weakness. We place our humanity into a non-entities, metallic bolts, and leave none for ourselves, HAL in turn proves to be a mirroring of humanity showing in parts the darker sides of humanity. The reliance on technology is our downfall, yet we cannot progress without it, and it would be almost criminal to write a review and not at least nod to what is, perhaps, the greatest scene-cut ever conceived in the history of cinema.Kubrick has created a film mirroring the life cycle using creative and deep symbolism, while the sights and sounds fills our heads with wonder, feeding our instinctive, inquisitive nature, that makes us, as a race, what we are.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The typical criticism of this movie is that it is too long and too boring. That is humorous. For some people I suppose sitting on a beautiful beach somewhere is too boring. For some people, when every second of their lives isn't the equivalent of a candy shop filled with saccharin crap, they become bored. For those people this is not the movie to watch, or comment on. Take your dislike of it and file it away somewhere with your other meaningless opinions.Besides the fact that much of what this movie depicts is as accurate a depiction of our space-faring future as had ever been created, there is vastly more to this. For people in the 1970's when this movie was created, much of what this movie deals with would have been absolutely unknown or even inconceivable, like a man trying to explain mathematics to a monkey, some people simply lack the ability to fully comprehend what this movie is about.The vast amount of references to psychology, philosophy, art, and science that this movie contains would take paragraphs to fully describe. This movie draws on so much, and puts it together so eloquently, its impossible not to regard it as arguably the greatest achievement in the history of film.If you have an intellectual mind and a strong interest in philosophy the psychology of intelligence, or just raw science fiction, this movie is a treat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>just plain weird</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So many things make 2001: A Space Odyssey the weirdest movie ever made. First of all, what is with the monolith? It's significance is never really explained, which definitely leaves you hanging. Sure, for smart people it might be good that they don't tell you what it means because then you can figure it out yourself, but for high schoolers like me, it was just... queer. And what's with the music that they play when the monkeys are, like, attacking it? It sounds like a swarm of flies. And why did the monkeys attack it in the first place? Well, anyway. Another factor of this movie's weirdness was the pace of it in general. Because the majority of it takes place in outer space, all of the camera shots are very, very slow and the scenes are very, very quiet; to the point that it gives you the shivers and a tingle down your spine. Another weird thing in this movie is Hal, the droning robot that takes over and kills almost everyone. It's voice and personality are just so strange and awkward, that it's actually really funny, even though it's not supposed to be. The best part has to be when Hal starts singing "Daisy, daisy..." as he is being disassembled. Finally, the ending of the movie just freaked me out completely. What was with the guy turning into an embryo-ish bubble baby? And then there was the strange room that echos, where he ages really quickly. It gave me goosebumps because it made no sense at all and completely distorted any ideas that I have about human life and time travel. But overall, the weirdness really did end up making this movie one of a kind, in a good way. Even though it was not an accurate prediction of what the world would be like in 2001, it asked questions that no other movie would ever approach. And although this movie can really creep you it, it's in a good way. It forces you to think beyond your own life and your own theories about space, and it puts you in a weird state of mind that leaves you in a complete daze after watching it. This movie is definitely worth watching at some point, but it is not cut out for a slumber party. Prepare to be freaked out beyond belief.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 30 Greatest Films Ever Made, Continued</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(part of 30 comments I'm writing for the 30 greatest films of all time. They aren't written in any specific order.)2001: A Space Odessy. To be blunt: I first saw this when I was 11, and hated it. I hated every single second of it. I nearly fell asleep plenty of times, and, watching it again, I'm surprised how many scenes I don't remember originally. The version I had rented was a video cassette, which meant it was "panned and scanned" or "fullscreen". Which means half of the movie was missing. I don't even blame myself for hating it - there are some films that just SHOULD NOT BE PANNED AND SCANNED. If you aren't seeing the whole movie, its just not the same. Films like 2001: A Space Odessy, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, and Lawrence of Arabia contain incredibly beautiful visuals and deserve high attention for them. More recently I saw 2001 on TCM, which is the GREATEST CHANNEL EVER, especially during Oscar season. Citizen Kane, 2001, The Graduate, The Bridge on the River Kwai, The Lost Weekend, Lawrence of Arabia, Casablanca, The Philadelphia Story, The Best Years of Our Lives, From Here to Eternity, On the Waterfront, Dr. Zhivago, North by Northwest, The Sting, Dr. Strangelove, Paths of Glory, Lust for Life, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, American Graffiti ALL IN ONE MONTH. Considering I recorded most of those movies, which were all letterbox, without commercials, uncut uncensored, I now have a great "DVD" quality (on videocassette) of classic movies.I was stunned. Since I tried, and failed, so hard to understand the plot of the film last time, I just WATCHED it this time, and in front of me was one of the most beautifully constructed films of all time. The scene of the ship docking to Strauss can be watched endless times. Believe it or not, this might me one of the most ENTERTAINING movies of all time. Many films, after you see them a few times, lose interest because you know what's gonna happen next. 2001 has no real plot, but it does have stunning visuals, and unless you have incredible photographic memory then seeing this film anytime is like seeing it for the first time.True, there are some parts you can laugh at (whenever the monkeys get excited and start jumping in the air, I say "4 more years, 4 more years!" and that gets a laugh out of anyone nearby). But this is ultimately a beautiful film. Made 3 years before A Clockwork Orange, the films share a visual style that make them Kubrick's 2 best. Stunning, amazing to watch. Without a doubt, one of the 30 greatest movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is regarded by some as a classic film for all ages. And in some sense, those critics are right. This film is a spectacle unlike other films of the time - the special effects in this film will inspire countless others like Star Wars 9 years later. Regardless, for me (as for some others), that's all it is, spectacle, a 3 HOUR spectacle that goes on and on. It is SO esoteric that it is probably way above most people's heads. And even though I understand what the filmmaker was going for, it is still too far-fetched for me. On the plus side, Stanley Kubrick makes proper use of classical music (in this case, Richard Strauss) and does have the aforementioned specular special effects. However, if you want to see a stronger focus on story, see its sequel 2010: Odyssey Two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I definitely agree that it is one of the best movies ever made. When I was a student in the eighties I saw it in a widescreen cinema and it blew me right of my chair. Visually a fantastic film, I still get the shivers when I see HAL performing his unduly tasks, the outer space is threatening. The controversial end isn't controversial for me. That blew me of my chair, it's fascinating and the contrast with the first part of the film couldn't be bigger. Even with the modern computer effects, I haven't seen one film which has the same effect. I have only seen one film which I found visually more attractive: Mirror by Andrei Tarkovsky, a Russian director. But it is a completely different movie and hasn't the direct effect like A Space Odyssey. If you're not a visual type and you are looking for intense drama, this is not the film to see (as most of my friends are). If I ever buy a widescreen television, this is the fist movie to see.

After my most recent viewing, I don't think I'll revisit this film again.The concepts explored in Clarke's novel are translated well. But the pacing of the film strikes me as uneven, and the acting is wooden on almost all counts. Many will say that this is a film about emotion and ideas. A pity then that the cast comes across as secondary, to the visuals.If ever there was a film that was a product of the psychedelic age, this would be it. You'd have to be blind not to see the influences of the time in the end sequence. So much of this film now seems pointless and overwrought, consumed with its own artistic vision, that is graying with time.</fullReview>

I have read loads of reviews and can't believe how man people say it's the best movie ever. OK I don't agree with them who say it's a piece of trash either, but them who say its boring is spot on. Yes I agree it's beautiful, and the effects for the year it's made are amazing. But just when the plot is getting good with the computer Hal the film just spins out of control.I'm not the biggest art film fan but I do like some. American Beauty and Punch Drunk Love to name two (if you class them as arty).I do believe at times this film is just being beautiful for the sake of being beautiful. It should have only been about an hour and a half long.When I watched this I wanted to turn it of, but how do you turn off a Kubrick film? Yes after reading what I have put you won't believe me but I'm normally a bit of a Kubrick fan. I think this is about the seventh Kubrick film I have seen and is the only one I don't like. His best in my opinion is Dr Strangelove which is just perfect. If you want to see a great Kubrick film watch that.I gave this 6 out 10 mainly down to the great shots and effects, but if you are looking for a Sci Fi along the lines of Star Wars avoid this. If you want to be bored for nearly 3 hours watch this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The human odyssey; from earth to God</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is the meaning of this movie? It's the Odyssey of humanity from nothingness to reaching God and becoming one with him. It's the glory of humanity surpassing all obstacles and its story from birth to becoming divine! It's an ode to humanity but in the same time a reexamination of our values and path. I can't think of a more humanity loving movie in the international cinema. This movie is a monument to humanity and from all of Kubrick's great work this one stands out as the most deep and well thought of them all.(Inside info: the HAL computer was supposed to be IBM but at the last minute the deal was cancelled so they used the previous letter to make a new name for the computer -- I became H, B because A and M became L)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very memorable - but puzzling and limited.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A space mission aims to discover the meaning of transmission from the moon.How many lines have been written about this film? More importantly how many finished in question marks? Because this is a film that prefers to ask questions rather than answering them. The cinema of the imperfect, if you will.You can imagine the confusion this film must have created on release (in 1968) and it is easy to see why many didn't like it and many more stayed away. Indeed I only half like it - having actually seen it twice.Kubrick did a lot of his own cinematography and while he listened to others they rarely changed his mind. He was a film dictator, but like many great art dictators we should be grateful because other collaborators would have only left the mark of mediocrity.Do we criticise Beethoven for not collaborating with fellow composers or decry that Dylan didn't write in collaboration with a journeyman? (I would put Kubrick up with both of the above as an artist. As a man I wouldn't rate him higher than a junkyard dog.) This film may have the greatest span of time of any movie, but it is very limited. Space is a boring place says this film. Long, drawn out, nothing much of interest happens. What is interesting is man and machine - and maybe what they will find out. Although we get a lot a drum roll and very little fireworks.The classic music and the visuals are bombast that probably look fantastic on the big screen, but look a little silly on the small. To deafen and to blind are actually without skill and are little more than a carnival stunt.What I like about this film is that it fights emotions rather than plays upon it. Death matters little and the whole feel is cold and frigid. It hardly leads one to want to go in to space (as millions would like) nor put your life in the hands of machines.The sets are stunning and stand up well today, even after so much has happened to make space exploration a reality. Indeed the dwarf the humans and lead Keir Dullea is a lesson in non acting anyway.Every generation of film fan will see this film at least once, so there is nothing left for us to fight for, but I prefer films with a bit more of a story and less of feeling of self-importance based on spending vast amounts on the sets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Astounding Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was growing up in the 1970s, I knew the future would like '2001: A Space Odyssey'. Everything would move slowly, with an elegance and grace. Spaceships would waltz around planets and space stations. Astronauts would bide their time patiently, waiting to get to their destination in sterile surroundings. Men really did land on the Moon the year after this was released, but the effects didn't look as good. When 'Star Wars' came along, it looked the same but made everything move ten times faster, whilst the crew weren't so averse to grease and dust. Somehow that didn't seem right.It's a testament to the special effects of this film that it's only when I see the film now, in 2005, that I'm beginning to see where the effects begin and the backdrop ends. They are almost perfect. As I am exposed to more films, I get used to the CGI. It looks far too artificial. In 1968 they made do with model work and camera movement. It looks far, far better to me. Keep it simple, stupid. There's even some attempt at a steadicam-ish sort of shot on board the Discovery before steadicam got invented. The sound design is also excellent. For 10 minutes all we can hear is breathing and the sound of gasses whistling through tubes. The sound of life support in the silence of space. Possible the most tense sound imaginable as the rate your respiratory system matches that of Dave Bowman. The influence of the design lives on through sci-fi films to this day. Look at the graphics on the computer screens. Now think of 'Alien', 'Hitch-Hiker's' on the TV. Think of Darth Vader's heavy breathing.Then there's the horror. The third section with HAL and the Discovery is some of the most tense film I know. I've already talked about the sound, but there are all the other nightmare touches. Empty space-suits hang like suits of armour in a haunted castle with added gas-mask creepiness. You're just waiting for them to move. Then there's pods looking like Cycloptic crabs. And of course at the centre there's unblinking, Orwellian eye of HAL. Seeing everything. The many long-held shots on that red glow are all that's needed for you to wonder just what he's thinking. You can see the turmoil going on behind the bulb. Beyond the Discovery there's an emphasis on violent death whether it be of apes, tapirs or sleeping scientists.There's also a lot to think about. Philosophical questions about evolution, death and rebirth, change, artificial intelligence. I know there are theological debates on the film's position on evolution or creation. To my mind it's a half way house, not mentioning creation at all and suggesting some form of 'driven selection'. Are the black slabs gods or God? Or can any civilisation, sufficiently advanced, appear to us as gods or magical. The mystical, hallucinogenic final section is redolent of the era in which the film was made. It offers no easy explanation, but then if these beings are so advanced, do you think we'd understand them in the space of twenty minutes? This film has so much, and I love it more every time I see it. I'm astounded it was made in 1968. I still want the future to be a zero-G ballet in orbit. I'm waiting for another film to match this in its vision.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Technically ahead of it's time by far then any other Science fiction film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Stanley Kubrick thought about making 2001,the movies that were being made at that time were science fiction films that were comical at best.I'm talking about the film's were you would have bug eyed alien's,and bulky robots. 2001 set the standard of what a science film could be,and what it could become.The graphics in the movie are still impressive even after 30 years have gone by.The film takes it self seriously which helps it because the movie's plot is serious.Keir Dullea acting is groundbreaking especially for having little dialogue.In my opinion I think 2001 is far more superior then star wars.The classical music in 2001 was the right choice for the film because any thing else would have seemed out of place for such a gradual paced film.This movie is probably the only film back then to have scientific accuracy about traveling through space,for instance,having no sound in space, which i think star wars forgot about.2001 is not overrated it heavily underrated ,and I do wish people would give it the acclaim that it deserves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2001: What happens to human evolution in the context of technology?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard that 2001 was being made (i didn't know of the book), i knew that i had to see it. As a fan of the "big 3" (Asimov, Bradbury, Clarke) and especially Arthur C. since he wrote so much "just around the corner" SF, with just the right bit of tech talk.What i didn't expect was what 2001 was. Un-answered questions: What was the monolith? Why did Dave Bowman change? etc. The main conclusion i came to (riding my bicycle back to the lawn mower shop that i worked at) was: "When our machines have developed to the point that we can "dig up" the monolith, then it's time for us to have the next jolt of evolution.Of course since then, my opinions have expanded. But, that's basically what I still get out of the first one.-- Peace to all, Pizo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's no comments for this extraordinary film, that only the great master Kubrick could create. The look into men evolution it's so deep and intense that some people find difficult to understand. But beyond this, the film as i see, it's also a critic to the mankind. The scenes when the screen is totally black, (with the suspense music) represents the miss of sense, logic in our own existence, so empty as the black screen. And, of course the greatest scene, when the the bone flies "turning" into a Ship; essentially are the same thing. Not without reason Spielberg compared 2001 with the Big Bang. At the time of release, the movie caused a huge success because of the fantastic shots on the space, that even today are very good. The images of Men arriving on moon next year, (1969) looked like "kid play"!</fullReview>

A better than average sound system wouldn't hurt either.If you find it to be the most boring film of all time, thats fine.

I was so stunned at age 12 that I saw it again a couple of weeks later.Imagine the shock on seeing it on its return to Cinerama in 1973 when it lost 20 minutes and some really quirky scenes. (Kubrick cut it just a few weeks after first-run.)The only hope I have is that, since Kubrick's demise there might be a special edition of this, which I believe to be the greatest movie on earth to date, for the usual reasons. Maybe there could be a 2-disc DVD with all deleted scenes RE-INSERTED. After all, there really were two versions released, so where is the missing premier version?If you've never seen this (I wish I were you to have that first experience again), please be calm and patient. Its slow, classy buildup is like that of a Rolls Royce - not a Ferrari! - So, turn off your mobile, lock up, try to have a good widescreen system at least and be just a little awed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie ever?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are so many aspects of this movie that are perfect that any effort to praise it is doomed to do it injustice. Should I begin from the spectacular use of music, in combination with visuals? The perfectly timed cuts? The breathtaking portrayal of gyrating stations? The unparalleled mix between human actors and wildlife footage that creates one of the most touching sequences in cinematic history? The appropriate use of silence - filled with mute agony? The sparse, but extremely realistic dialogue - as witnessed for example in the video-conferences of astronauts with family members? The lack of overacting? Visually the movie is spectacular. All of the shots are perfect. The desert shots, with deep contrasts of colour. The planetary views are not realistic with respect to the planetary alignments, but nevertheless such spatial arrangements bring a certain sense of .. art in the shots.The DVD I watched also included the trailers for this movie and for 2010. Watching the trailers for the latter, I got the sense of a Holywoodian reheating of the same ideas, with a lot of inane dialogue and 'action' thrown in. After having watched 2001, this trailer made me laugh until my sides ached. I don't think I'll ever watch 2010. (And does this dolphin have something to do with seaquest?)</fullReview>

The modern and streamlined set adds to the overall feeling that this film will always be remembered as the most magnificent and wonderful film of all time; Stanley Kubrick's most magnificent film and a work that will inspire generations to come. From the Dawn of Man, the film takes the most imaginative jump to 1999 where man has ventured to the stars in order for us to avoid overpopulation and mutual destruction. After the discovery of a monolith on the moon triggers a shrieking radio signal, man is sent to the Jupiter system in 2001 on a quest to confront its destiny...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Boring!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This isn't a movie review as much as a response to those who feel that slow-paced equals bad, where scifi or suspense is concerned. I do think this is one of the classics of cinema, and much that came after is deep in Kubrick's debt. Every student of film should see this.Admittedly, this is more like reading a novel then watching a film. However, that meditative approach, together with the stunning visuals and the silence of deep space, gives the viewer time to think! The film CERTAINLY raises more questions than it answers, and this is a good thing. Not every film experience has to be neatly tied up at the end of two hours, and if you accept that this film is a metaphor of the human condition, then there is definitely room for loose ends.What about character development? HAL is one of the best realized villains in all of cinema (example, paraphrased as I don't have the lines in front of me *SPOILER*: "I can tell you're very upset about this, Dave." "Open the airlock, HAL." "I'm sorry, Dave, but I can't do that. You're going to find it very difficult to get back on board without your helmet, Dave." His calm menace is unreal!) I was ten when I first saw this, and couldn't get through it, because as a ten-year-old, I was expecting laser blasts and rockets. I saw it again several years later, and it was more to my liking as a young adult. It grows on you and is worth repeated viewings. I have seen it several times and own the soundtrack as well.IF you want Star Wars, then by all means, watch Star Wars. But if you want some serious hard science fiction, this is a great film.</fullReview>

I must admit that it was the first time I saw 2001. And I didn't really know what to expect. I was taken aback right at the beginning with the apes running the show for close to 20 minutes. Of course, like others, I find the end to be very hard to decipher. But it didn't ruin the rest of the movie. Truly a great film to watch and enjoy.

		<shortDescription>Most Artistic Movie of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie I was very young and I didn't understand it. Actually to be honest I really didn't understand it until about a week ago, when I saw the film again. This film is a work of art, visually and psychologically. You can come up with so many different conclusions about the film. For instance, that the whole film is symbolic of a birth. Another conclusion that I have heard is that the film is about the conflict between man and his tools. I would have to lean towards the latter, mainly because I read a striking review about it. The review stated that every time that man achieved a milestone in civilization, as in finding a tool and using to gather food or to fight with, a monolith appeared. Apparently the monolith was placed by aliens. Just like when man discovered the monolith on the moon. It was placed there by aliens. Thats what I believe happened, but I can't explain the end with all the colors and the room sequence. All in all the was one of the best movies that I have ever seen, I suggest that everyone sees it whether you like it or not, and whether you understand it or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movies are about acting, not about drifting stars or massive spaceship-interior sets. One of the finest performances I've ever witnessedappears in "2001", a film supposedly devoid of any interesting dialogue spoken by any high-profile players.Mention HAL, even today, 36 years later, and even people who weren't alive when this film premiered know who you're talking about. The US Figure Skating Association calls its scorekeeping software HAL. Leonard Bernstein nicknamed his synthesizer HAL. And on and on.The Heuristic/ALgorithmic computer - such is scenarist Arthur Clarke's explanation of the name - is visible only as a lens on a control board. Canadian Shakespeare actor Douglas Rain, said to be a last-minute replacement for Martin Balsam, reads his voice-over lines in an eerie monotone yet displays all the range of emotions denied the actors portraying astronauts. Jealousy, unreasoning rage, hurt feelings - they're all there. The effect would have been far different if director Stanley Kubrick had requested a voice ringing with the emotions appropriate to the words.The humble voice-over artist is the unsung hero of Hollywood (and Borehamwood). Never is this more true than in "2001", a big-buck special effects blockbuster whose most memorable participant was a disembodied voice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the movie I was expecting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS INCLUDED***For years I heard people claim that this movie is "cinematic genius". Hmmm, I didn't get that out of this movie. First off, the whole "Dawn of Man" scenes. It would of been interesting if it was 10 minutes long instead of about 30. Even for the time of 1968, the apes were very unbelievable. I'm not sure why people see these scenes as magnificent. I got bored about 1/2 way through. I'll admit, the monolith coming into view did get me intrigued and I wanted to see where the movie was going. Next, I thought the scenes with Dr. Floyd were also interesting. However, they could of been half the length. How many times do we have to watch people walk upside down to go into another room?! And why do we need to hang onto the space scenes for so freaking long!! I get it, they're in space, they are on big ships...MOVE ON!! I understand that it's fascinating to speculate about how the future is going to look. I mean we can all remember how Back To The Future Part II did kind of the same thing. However, we didn't have to watch 10 minutes of a floating pen, and people walking.All of the scenes with HAL were interesting. Again, way to freaking slow. When Dave has to go rescue Frank I thought I would finally see some action. But...no. It takes an agonizingly long time to accomplish this and to be honest I fell asleep for a few minutes. The flying through time and getting to Jupiter and the star child all interesting. But, by this time I just wanted to end this movie going experience. I kept wondering when this thing was going to end. The monolith was never fully explained and that really irritated me.Sure, it was supposed to be a thought provoking movie. I guess it was, because it made me try to think of how I can get my money back.This movie is average at best and a total waste of time. The special effects for the time it was made are pretty remarkable and that's about it, not what I would call a "cinematic genius" of a movie. Most of the folks who think this is a great movie, should get a life and venture out of the safe walls of academia.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey could easily be considered the film that greatest utilizes the full potential of cinema i.e. the best film of all time, ever. So much so that the film may thought of as a showcase, the technical manual on how a film should be. To the point that the film is purely about the perfect execution of production &amp; direction. The actors are as much the apparatus of the production, merely another element that is part of the totality that is the film. They do not dominate but are like the proverbial "bone" of the story: tools of the trade. For the film is an exercise in the use of technology to break new boundaries and would be to cinema the experience that Dr Dave Bowman goes through. This is a brilliant film from a brilliant director for so many reasons. One that is endellable to me is when Bowman is blown out of the air lock by Hal and as he tries and eventually gets back into the ship; all you can hear is his breathing. It times the scene beautifully, the theme of the opening cave man scene, of crisis and opportunity is re-lived in the space age. What is at stake in the fight for survival is the same as ever, but now the "bone" has hit back....and so on and so on. What I have written is for people who have watched and studied this film, they may not agree with what I say. However I feel that the sheer technical brilliance, significance and sophistication of this film dwarfs any other film that could be compared to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cinematic and Sci-fi masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey', aside from being one of the best and greatest movies ever made (these are two different things), is one of the 4 Cornerstones of Science Fiction filmdom. (The other 3 cornerstones are Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis', 'King Kong', and (although it is actually the ultimate in Science-fiction fantasy) 'Star Wars'). (Frankenstein (Karloff version) almost makes the list, but since there would be no Frankenstein if it weren't for Metropolis, the list stands as is, however, if there could be 5 cornerstones, Frankenstein would be it, since it was so influential in it's own right)(back to 2001).The adaptation of Arthur C. Clarke's book (I recommend this as a great read) to film that Kubrick accomplishes is magnificent. The opening sequence with the apes (to the music of 'Also Sprach Zarathustra') is cinematic legend. Another reason why this movie so important is because it is the first Science Fiction film in outer space that plays and looks completely real. This movie is an amazing feat of film-making and editing restraint in that, in this movie, things happen in space at the pace that they should and would - which is slow! The reason why today's younger audience find this film unwatchable is because you need an attention span than is greater than that of a gnat to be able to sit through it. Any human being who does not require non-stop, rapid-cut-edited mindless action and zero to no story in order to be entertained has a good chance of thoroughly enjoying this masterpiece that will be remembered decades from now and long after all the Matrix-junkies have forgotten that they even saw the movie. (Interesting note - 2001 was made in the days before rampant and annoying product placement - The movie-makers actually had to pay a certain telephone company to use their name/logo in an early space scene). This movie is the beginning of intelligent AND realistic looking sci-fi. All the high-brow, cerebral, and/or detailed sci-fi films that followed all owe a debt to Kubrick for showing the way. The attention to detail - the pace - the classical music soundtrack - no movie to this day or before it has ever put all 3 together in one movie so perfectly! Star Wars, Close Encounters, Alien, etc - all these movies owe their existence to Kubrick's vision and execution. Leonard Maltin gives this movie 4 stars (and I whole-heartedly agree). AFI's list of 100 Greatest American Films puts this at #22. Entertainment Weekly's list of 100 Greatest Films put this at #26. My list of 200 Greatest Films puts this at #7. (Fortunately, being a movie purist, I have no sci-fi (or any other genre) prejudices).Please feel free to ignore the sequel to 2001 - '2010' (not done by Kubrick). All of Kubrick's other films are worth watching - but those worthy of note are The Killing, Spartacus, Paths of Glory, Lolita, A Clockwork Orange, Dr. Strangelove, The Shining, Full Metal Jacket, and Eyes Wide Shut - (Wow, that is almost all of them anyway - Boy I would have loved to seen his version of AI).</fullReview>

Although it is slow-moving, especially by today's standards, and the special effects show their age, to me it has withstood the test of time.It's a film that requires your full attention and requires you to think while watching it, not one that you can turn off your brain for two hours, although I do like those sort of movies as well.What else can I say?

The ones that called it a masterpiece of groundbreaking cinema got it right. To the others, this movie is not supposed to be some juiced video game with mindless explosions, cartoonish characters, and souped up chases; it's a "real" film. The slow passages make you contemplate. The quiet scenes are designed to make you think, not put your conditioned mind on hold waiting for the next loud noise or flashing light. To the juvenile that can't stand silence or mood, you completely miss the point of movies like this. We're not the equivalent of gerbils running on a treadmill, are we? Some wouldn't know subtlety if the word hit them over the head. In lesser hands, of course, a movie like this "would" be considered drivel (case in point, see the sequel, utter rubbish). But not this one. On a wider note. How I long for stunning sci-fi. They haven't made a decent space movie since Aliens2, but for sheer scope and drama in the genre, nothing has topped 2001.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD**This film leaves film-goers divided into the "uh, I fell asleep with cousin Cletus and Billy-Bobb" and "that was one of the greatest movies of all time" categories.The Dawn of Man. Somewhere on Earth apes struggle in a harsh and unforgiving environment. Kill. Eat. Mutate. Survive. The weakest are forgotten, the strong remain. Basic animal instincts keep them in check. Cue the Black Monolith. The apes have no idea of it's purpose, nor of who put it there or why. It's alien to the world they live in and treat it with caution.Then one of the most symbolic moments in movie history. The primordial image of an ape smashing a skull with a bone, then throwing the bone into the sky. Cut to black and space-ship floating through the heavens.Something has been discovered on the Moon, but all the ivory tower egg-heads want to close rank and not discuss it in the outside world. Cue a brief cameo from Leonard "Rigsby" Rossiter.Onto the Moon itself, where a second Black Monolith has been discovered. It's been deliberately buried into the lunar surface. As the humans approach, a piercing noise destroys the hearing of the team digging up the strange structure.Cut to a mission to Jupiter where the Black Monolith was emitting some kind of signal and a computer that's going crazy. This is such a key part to the movie. The interactions with Dave and HAL are fantastic.After switching off HAL after he's gone computer senile, Dave heads into The Infinite. The aliens who placed the Black Monolith on Earth all those aeons ago, have summoned Mankind to them.One of the greatest films ever made. A soundtrack to die for and the cinematography is out of this world (excuse the lame pun).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>maybe this movie could appeal to people who are brain dead, but if you're under 95 and has a functioning mental alertness this one will put you right into a coma. jeez, 20 minutes into the film I was seriously starting to doubt if it was actually a movie I was watching or some unedited footage achieve. Do I really want to look at a spaceship floating around for 2 minutes every 5 scenes? Can't honestly say that I do. 80% of the movie I find myself just staring at things floating around pointlessly, it takes forever for anything to happen I swear I could've seen faster action if I went out in the backyard and watch a snail crawl. lucky I saw it on DVD and fast forwarded most of it, but even that it was still a waste of time. I had never posted a comment here before but this one is so ridiculously dumb that I have to say if you value your time in the least bit, skip it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Literally.Imagine a movie devoid of every commercial aspect of modern film making and you have this movie. It is slow paced, completely lacking in name celebs, contains almost no violence, absolutely no sex and no profanity, no witless teaser oriented banter but instead boasts long passages with no dialogue what so ever and it tells a story that is incomprehensible to most casual viewers. And yet it is a faultless masterpiece. The directing, cinematography, editing, special effects, set design, acting, script and story are all near perfect. The movie tells a story of such grand sweep and vision that it is unlike any other. It delivers scene after scene in such a precise yet unforced fashion that it leaves no room for pandering. From the astoundingly natural sounding dialogue to a dead on rendering of the (imagined) realities of space travel, 2001 is a movie incapable of a false move.I might sound like some deranged fanboy but that is only because this is my favorite movie of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest Film/Novel Co-production?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*assumes knowledge of film - contains details of plot*2001: A Space Odyssey is just that: a long wandering voyage of the body and mind. Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clark collaborated brilliantly. In examining both works, the film and the novel, there are certainly differences, yet the theme and overall idea coincide thoroughly. That this was made in the 1960's augments both accomplishments. The visuals, seen in 2004, are still captivating. What they must've seemed like in 1968! I flout those who received this movie poorly in those days. Would I have received it as well without having a preconceived idea of its greatness? I can only hope I would have known what I was watching.It is rare a movie inspires me to read the novel it is based on. Here is one occasion. On my first viewing of the film, I was baffled by the special effects so my appreciation was attained. This was done when digital effects did not exist. Scenes of the space station, the moon, Jupiter, Earth from space, and the sun are model works at their finest. However, I thought I did not fully grasp the story. After reading the book and seeing the film again, I realized I comprehended more than I gave myself credit for on that first watch. This is a work that was meant to raise questions rather than give solutions. At any rate, I was extremely pleased with the book, which brought about a need to see the film again.My second viewing heightened my reverence for Stanley Kubrick. What he chose to include, change and eliminate is crucial to the film's success, as well as a tribute to his discretion. Clarke's novel does disentangle some details. There is no better way to completely realize the ascent to the Star Child than to read Clarke's final chapters. Still, cinematically, with no dialog or voice-over, Kubrick gives enough clues for an intelligent viewer to take in the concept. To a lesser extent, the trek Dave Bowman takes to another dimension/galaxy, which is explained in great detail in the book, cannot be fully construed visually. Still, you know what's happening when Bowman enters the "wormhole". Your eyes are lucky, too. If you ever wanted to experience true psychedelia and haven't the stomach for hallucinogens, here's your chance.2001 originated from Clarke's short story, "The Sentinel." This, in no way, takes away from the originality of the film. An obvious benediction of the movie is Kubrick's use of music. The classical pieces intensify the sense of awe. From the ape man to the starchild, the music detaches us from the events. We view them as we would events in a documentary. Kubrick deliberately adds, deletes and modifies. Hal never reads the lips of the astronauts in the book. This is a stroke of genius in the motion picture.We are not as far along in space exploration as 2001 predicts we would be by now. It's eerily accurate nevertheless. With the Hal 9000 computer, we see humans as secondary in astronomical research. In today's actual space missions, humans are rarely even along for the ride. While technology is not capable of the malevolence seen in Hal, it is certainly as, if not more, important to the furthering of our knowledge, as Clarke envisioned in his writings.The movie, coupled with the novel, awakened my interest in astronomy and particularly astrophysics. It also made me aware of the importance modern media and people in general place on somewhat trivial events, while our planet rotates on its own axis at one thousand miles an hour, and revolves around our sun at around sixty-six thousand miles an hour. These types of facts may seem trivial, but does the latest reality T.V. show, or the fact that Arnold Schwarzenegger called some other politician a girly man blow your mind?Arthur C. Clarke was a forward thinker. His ideas on astronomy were far ahead of his time. Stanley Kubrick was extremely gifted at finding challenging pieces of literature and turning them into spectacular films. The film and the novel are transcendent. They evoke emotions beyond the everyday. Of course, if works of art like this were in abundance, they wouldn't be masterpieces.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An example of excellence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the movie, one becomes short of words in its praise after watching it. Arguably the best movie ever made in Hollywood history, 2001: A Space Odyssey is a viewer's and a director's movie. No actors come in between the two except for the inhuman HAL, the supercomputer. That the movie sets mark for defining excellence is not a preposterous statement.The movie speaks of journeys in many ways. Be it the journey of 5 humans in a modern spaceship from Earth to Jupiter, or the journey of William Sylvester to the moon through the international space station. But the main journey shown is the journey of the mankind, from living a nomadic life to gaining intelligence and becoming a higher form of life to gaining super intelligence. Is this journey controlled or carefully planned by an external source? Kubrick tries to tell you the answer by taking you through the journey, you experience every bit of it. Through minimal use of dialogues, the director has been able to project the experience. The movie starts with no life at all. Even the shots are not moving scenes but still images that signify the lack of movement. The first signs of movement are of some animals and then nomadic humans in a corner of the frame. Here, through a fight for survival and under the force of an extra ordinary object, human life gains intelligence. This power grows until humans are able to build computers that can simulate every emotion of the human being. Thus, enters HAL 9000. Interestingly, if all the three letters of HAL are shifted by one on the right in the English alphabet, we get IBM, a leading computer manufacturing firm of the time when the movie was made. HAL may as well stand for Heuristic and ALgorithmic approaches in Artificial Intelligence.The journey in the movie is always given a direction by some external force and when Kier Dullea goes to find it, he is pulled to some corner of the universe ultimately resulting in the birth of a new super intelligent form. In a way, the journey completes a whole cycle.The beauty of the movie lies in the accurate depiction of modern technology. For someone to show the International Space Station in 1968 exactly as it hangs today is miraculous. The generation of artificial gravity through rotation shows the scientific correctness of the various scenes. The imagery to show the astronaut's transition in the end is superb as is the same at the time when his space ship is pulled to some unknown realms of the universe. I would strongly recommend this movie to everyone who has a bit of taste for science or pure cinematic art. Watching the movie may, however, require a lot of patience as it may feel to be too slow (nearly static) as many times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The epitome of film as a visual art form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will not waste time trying to explain what the film meant to me. Kubrick's films are almost always very divisive when discussions of "meaning" come up. I will however say that i feel this movie is one of the greatest visual works of art. From beginning to end, I find myself mesmerized by the sheer spectacle of what is presented. Kubrick's mastery of the film medium was never more apparent. This becomes somewhat obvious when you realize that a story of such scope can be presented with such a scant amount of dialogue. This is one of the few films I can't look away from once I start watching. I feel this is Kubrick's greatest triumph since he was truly an artist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't mean any disrespect towards the late Stanley Kubrick. Technically, Kubrick was brilliant. The effects were brilliant, and even today with all the computer technology, the simple 1960's effects still are very competitive. The effects make the story believable. But 2001 is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. What story there is gets lost in the flow of the movie because of the plodding pace of this film. It was such slow going I had acutally dozed off the last time I had seen the film. Others have commented that the story could have been told in under an hour. And that's true, particularly if some of the more psychadelic effects and the other fluff had been stripped away. But it would have shown just how weak the story was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ONLY true science fiction movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001 is most emphatically NOT for Star Wars fans. It's the antithesis of all the Hollywood nonsense that have turned people away from science fiction and convinced people that sci-fi is no different from fantasy or improbable action movies. 2001 is about REAL space travel. It's about what it would REALLY be like if we found out there was intelligent life off the earth. It's about what Artificial Intelligence might REALLY be like. The fact that the year 2001 has come and gone and the movie didn't happen is irrelevant; everything in the movie is still plausible, and we could have the world it portrays in another twenty or thirty years. Computers are becoming more sophisticated and intelligent, we have the VASIMR engine, which is remarkably similar to the Discovery's plasma drive in the movie, and the Bush space initiative will have a base on the moon which may well be similar to the movie's Clavius Base. So many of Arthur C. Clarke's visions of the future have come to pass, and many of 2001's speculations have been matched by reality. The fact that a movie made in 1968 can still look so authentic and believable is the true litmus test of a good science fiction movie. Unlike most sci-fi movies, 2001 shows space travel as it really is -- no streamlined space fighters banking and zooming as if in the atmosphere or making whooshing noises in the vacuum of space. Space is realistically silent, spaceships cruise on predetermined orbits with their engines dark and silent except when delta vee is required, the hardware was developed in consultation with the aerospace industry, computer experts, and industrial firms, and actual JPL engineers designed the amazing spaceship Discovery and other vehicles. The subject matter is approached with the serious, sober attitude that it deserves. I don't think I've ever seen another science fiction movie that treated space travel with such immediacy. The dangers faced by the crew of the Discovery are the things real astronauts will -- and do -- have to deal with. The nervous breakdown of the infamous HAL-9000 computer has become legendary, but it's not the kind of cheesy mad computer stuff you find in scores of 70s movies. HAL has a glitch, and like every desktop computer, the glitch gets progressively worse as it goes undiagnosed and the computer remains operational. You can also look at HAL psychologically; subconscious feelings of guilt produce hypochondria and paranoia. Is HAL a character or a computer with a corrupt program? These are questions we will inevitably have to face someday. When Dave Bowman disconnects HAL, is he diverting the ship's control from an unreliable system, or is he murdering a shipmate? The whole storyline is done the way events would probably unfold; no laser battles, no explosions, no buff hero with sleeves cut off marching through smoky corridors with a ludicrous laser pulse weapon -- just a space suited astronaut, realistically weightless, armed with a screwdriver. Nothing in the movie is over-the-top or beyond what could really happen. Sometimes it's easy to forget that you're watching a movie; it seems more like C-SPAN footage of a real space mission.At the same time, though, it's so marvelously poetic and musically divine, no other sci-fi movie has ever conveyed so eloquently the wonder and beauty of space travel. The special effects still look utterly authentic today; when Cosmonaut Alexei Leonov saw the movie, he said, "Now I feel like I've been in space twice." Many people have been baffled by the ending, but I think most people appreciate the movie much more on subsequent viewings. I never had trouble "understanding" the movie, but that may be because I read the novel first. This movie is not about munching popcorn and wheedling away two hours; it's about serious contemplation of our future, about space travel, about the immensity of space and time, and about the possibilities that lie out there. It's more about real life than the world of movies -- which I guess is why we fans of the movie get so defensive when non fans attack it. It's the Citizen Kane of science fiction; the definitive thoughtful examination of its subject matter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick and Clarke team to form a poetic sci-fi marvel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I ever saw 2001: A Space Odyssey was when I was in middle school. It was on network television, and my father grabbed me just in time to see two apes using bones to bludgeon another ape to death in the middle of a large puddle of water. "Watch what happens next," he said, sounding rather dramatic. Of course looking back on this, I know why this was so important to him. What I was about to see was one of the most memorable visual transitions in film history. An ape tosses his bone in the air. It rotates in slow motion, before succumbing to gravity, and as it falls, there is an abrupt cut to, of all places, outer space. In place of the bone is a spaceship, an exact graphic match.Not quite understanding what I had just seen, and being the inquisitive kid that I was, I found a copy of Arthur C. Clarke's novel of same name, and attempted to read it before I saw the complete film. After finishing the book, I was amazed by the ideas it put forth, and felt I was ready to view the film. I watched it in its entirety, and I again saw the bone to spaceship transition, but I still did not feel confident that I knew what the hell was going on.The significance of this startling image was not immediately apparent to me until I viewed the film again recently on the big screen. The abrupt nature of the transition serves to make the passage of time seem relatively insignificant, and in doing so, suggests that what we see as marvelous innovation (i.e.--technology and space exploration) is actually just a drop in the bucket in the greater universal scheme. Although this transition is the most memorable in the film, it represents only one of its several visual and aural matches that reflect upon the film's fictional exploration of the story behind human evolution.The film begins with a section entitled "The Dawn of Man". We are introduced to a pack of apes who wander around their grounds doing nothing but seeking food and water. When other apes intrude, they fill the air with wild shrieks, attempting to scare off the invaders. They have no way to hunt, and no way to defend themselves against predators. It is a very primitive existence.Then one night, the apes are awoken by an eerie, otherworldly sound. They emerge from their cave and find in front of it a giant black slab, perfectly smooth and sturdy. They are wary at first, but one by one, they gradually crowd around the monolith, as the sound grows louder and more discordant. Later, we see a single ape fidgeting aimlessly with an animal skeleton. Suddenly, the ape's face lights up with a sudden understanding. The air begins to fill with the music of Richard Strauss's "Also Sprach Zarathustra", a musical selection which this film immortalized (and is often referred to as "The 2001 song"). We quickly see a close image of the monolith with the sun centered high above it, and we now see the monolith's results. The ape lifts one of the animal's bones high above his head and makes brutal clubbing motions. He has found his weapon.The next time another pack of apes threatens, he takes his newfound discovery, and uses it to beat one of the pack members to death. Thus, the dawn of man arrives, and the monolith's work has begun.The remainder of the film focuses on where man has gone since then, and towards the end, delves into where man might be going. And the monolith is omnipresent. The pacing is slow and deliberate, as one would expect from a Kubrick film, and while some might view it as cumbersome, others will revel in it due to the unforgettable imagery. Due to zero gravity environments, we see people walking on all four walls, and there are several shots in which people seem to walk upside down and around rooms. We again see the spaceships which resemble the bone and also giant space stations which revolve like a wheel, yet another symbol of human innovation.The amazing feat which Kubrick pulls off, however, is making it seem very real and plausible, rather than something purely science fictional. The shots seem almost like a ballet rather than an innovative sci-fi effect. Of course, having Johann Strauss's "Blue Danube Waltz" in the background helps with this, and I'd guess that the music was chosen for just that purpose.Following the stunning "Blue Danube" sequence, we are introduced to Dr. Heywood Floyd (William Sylvester) of the National Council of Aeronautics. He is heading to a base on the moon to investigate a finding which has been kept secret from the public. Along the way, we see more futuristic signs of innovation: an orbiting Hilton Hotel and a video phone. A foreshadowing dialogue with other doctors in the hotel relates just how secret and important the investigation is.When Dr. Floyd reaches the moon, we find out what the secret is. He and several other scientists descend into a giant trench which holds another monolith, identical to the one which catalyzed the ape transformations. Again, we hear the eerie discordant sounds (excerpts from "Lux Aeterna" by György Ligeti, one of Kubrick's favorite composers). The humans crowd around the strange monolith to take a picture, and although it feels much more civilized, there is an unsettling resemblance to the primitive apes throwing themselves at the earlier monolith, all clawing for their own touch. Just at that moment, a deafening, high-pitched tone pierces the scientists' ears, and this section of the story suddenly concludes.The middle section of the film takes place 18 months later on the ship Discovery, which is bound for Jupiter. The crew includes David Bowman (Keir Dullea), Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood), three other doctors who are in hibernation chambers, and the HAL 9000 computer (voiced by Douglas Rain). HAL is a marvel of modern computer technology. He has a perfect operational record, speaks with seemingly genuine emotion, and acts as another member of the crew. There is a very revealing moment when Bowman discusses his view on whether or not HAL has true emotions.But when something goes wrong with HAL, and Bowman and Poole decide to disconnect him, HAL fights back, and along the way becomes one of the most monstrous villains in film history. We fear HAL so greatly not because he has a booming voice or a cruel heart, but for the exact opposite reason. He speaks quietly and calmly in a detached manner and is merely ensuring that he can do the job he was programmed to do: stay functional and make sure the mission is complete. As a computer, he does not understand the terrible things he is doing, and this makes him all the more terrifying. (It is interesting to note that Anthony Hopkins used HAL as his model when trying to create his interpretation of the cold and monstrous Hannibal Lecter).When Bowman finally gets into the chamber housing the equipment of HAL's central functions, HAL quickly turns from villain to tragic figure. He begs in the same calm voice for Bowman to stop destroying his memory. He says he can "feel" his mind going. When Bowman persists, HAL recites one of the most heartbreaking lines in film: "I'm afraid, Dave." This sheds a haunting light on the question of HAL's emotional capability.For the sake of preserving novelty, I will not reveal much about the film's final half hour. I will say two things however. One: It represents some of the most brilliant cinema I have ever seen. Two: If you do not read the book, you will be extremely perplexed by what transpires. Suffice it to say that the monolith's role in human evolution is finally brought to the forefront. In addition, the aesthetics and suspense of the last ten minutes are, simply put, beautiful and awe-inspiring.It is hard to imagine any director other than Kubrick at the helm of this project. The misanthropic undercurrents regarding technological innovation reflect upon Kubrick's persistent interest in the dehumanization of society (e.g.--A Clockwork Orange, Dr. Strangelove, Full Metal Jacket). Kubrick's meticulous, deliberate directing caters perfectly to the vast emptiness and solitude of space. His sense of composition provides for striking, often disturbing imagery (consider the sun towering directly over the center of the monolith, or Bowman and Poole conversing on opposite ends of the frame with HAL in the background exactly in the middle of the frame). The visual effects, designed by Kubrick himself, are a testament to how creativity can rise above technological limitation, considering that there was no such thing as digital manipulation.Perhaps the most amazing thing about 2001: A Space Odyssey is that despite the fact that it is almost 35 years old, and despite the fact that its vision of the future was not entirely accurate, it does not seem at all dated. The issues raised in the film are as relevant now as they were then. Certainly, human evolution is an issue that will continue to be debated for many years to come. Due to its unforgettable imagery, its novel use of classical music, and its brilliant conclusion, 2001: A Space Odyssey will not soon be forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A visually stunning landmark in cinema history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More than almost any other director Kubrick appreciated that cinema should be a rich visual experience and here he provided it like no-one else had done before or has done since, from the opening landscapes to the metaphysical room at the end. The only way to fully appreciate it is on a big screen; I have been lucky enough to see it on one measuring 60 x 30 ft. It was probably the first film to effectively present a solar system theme and the vastness of space. At the time the film was made, of course, the space program was in full swing and the actual first moon walk had yet to take place so it was extremely topical. But apart from a few technological things the film hasn't dated at all and is just as powerful now. I think it should rate in the top 10 of all movies that have been made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This morning I finally sat down and watched the entire film after having made several attempts in the past. Perhaps I am daft but I was completely confused by this film. The beginning was a bit odd, to say the least, but I could make some sense of it (if I tried hard). The end, however, left me scratching my head in wonderment. Yes, it is intriguing to ponder the possibility of life on earth having a celestial origin (other than the work of God that is). Unfortunately man's journey to discover its origins is the part that confused me. Where exactly did Dave go? How did he get from the pod to the bedroom? What is the meaning of him as an old man and then a dying man (who is enigmatically pointing at the very reason for the journey: the black monolith)? What happened to HAL to make him "mutiny"? I have the utmost respect for Arthur C. Clarke but I have to say that I haven't the vaguest idea why this movie is so popular. Geez, is it slow! The entire thing could have been told in 45 minutes had we not had to watch each and every sloth-like movement of the equipment and actors. Well, this is only one person's opinion...right?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest films ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Obtuse, inaccessible, deliberately paced... in short, one of the greatest films of all time!!!! Forget the stunning visual achievement, the masterful and incredibly influential score, the sublimely subdued acting, the brilliant direction and camerawork, the poignant (lack of) dialogue, the bits of disconnected and reconnected narrative, and the patently Kubrickian humor... the stances taken and the questions posed are amongst the most profoundly philosophical to ever appear in film! This is probably the only film that subjugates ?plot' in a traditional sense for that of sustained metaphor ? whether visual or musical, scene dependent or 2.5 hour film wide. Something like 80% of the film is carried without dialogue ? and more successfully than any treatment could that featured dialogue. For that reason, most people don't ?get' it.In fact, there's not a whole lot to ?get' if you're looking for one or two unified master threads of narrative, an answer to a question, a continuing plot. This isn't like "The Usual Suspects" where everything gets all wrapped up in a tidy package at the end, rewarding you for sitting through 2.5 hours of non-linearity and confusion. Kubrick provides no answer, no goal, only a journey. Confused? You're supposed to be! Is that not a valid effect one can create in a film? Like Bowman releasing the physical body of Poole from the mechanic grip of B Pod, you too must let go the assumptions and expectations created by viewing a lifetime of largely jejune films. Once you start to recognize and appreciate the metaphoric subtleties (i.e. birth/baby/birthday metaphors; tool use and eventual dead ending of a consciousness that relies on that physicality 4 million years later; eyes of perception; conceptual twinnings; macro and microcosmic conjunctions; etc.), Kubrick's statements become so obvious that it's hard to believe you missed them before!Every single detail in this movie was intentional. It is a completely conscious work, it is art. It's (loosely, though primarily) a film about the next ?step' of evolution in a transcendental rather than physical sense, and about the consciousness and reflexivity that, despite every other conceivable difference, is universally at the base of all intelligent beings in the universe. But characteristically, Kubrick paints many many threads, some of which lead in different or even opposing directions. This is intentional, this is genius, there are no answers in this film. That's the point. You can't appreciate this film in one viewing. You may start to appreciate it at 5 viewings. Does that bespeak a failing of the film or a failing of the average American viewer? I think the answer is obvious? The sheer scope, achievement, and courageously non-linear treatment of such an audacious set of topics has never and will never be duplicated! One of my favorites! I had privilege to view a fresh print of the film at the AFI Silver Theatre, and I can say with absolute confidence you have not truly seen it until you've seen it on the big screen and involuntarily covered your ears at the volume of the Monolith's radio emission! Kubrick!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Stunning Masterpiece by One of the Greatest Directors off All-Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS AHEAD!:"2001: A Space Odyssey" is,like Kubrick said himself,more of an experience than an actual movie and therefore a true Kubrick Movie.Movies like "A Clockwork Orange"(which has the 2001 soundtrack LP in the movie!) and "Full Metal Jacket" are also more experiences than movies. "2001: A Space Odyssey",made after the legendary model work by Arthur C. Clarke,is a breathtaking masterpiece of special effects and symbolism.It is probably the single greatest visual movie ever made.It starts with a surprising as well as disturbing musical overture by Ligeti of about 3 minutes. The screen is black and stays that way until the lion of MGM shows up,the brilliant opening credits appear together with a great shot of the moon,earth and sun together in one view. The music of Strauss is perfect for this beginning. The movie contains of 4 parts from which the first part is the Dawn of Man(10 million years ago) in which we see monkeys who rival each other for water.This is also the first time in which the Monolith appears,that scares and upsets the monkeys very much.In the next shot one of the monkeys then starts to punch with a bone(probably the beginning of the urge by men for destruction and aggression). He takes the bone to the water where he destroys one of the opposing monkeys. He throws the bone in the air which sets up one of the greatest and dramatic scene changes ever made,the bone changes into a space ship. The second part begins.Together with "The Blue Danube" a series of beautiful images appear on screen. In this part we also get to see the great wit of Stanley Kubrick,although this is a serious film.The Grip Shoes as well as the Zero Gravity Toilet(Watch Dr. Floyd,played by William Sylvester,examine the manual with great care) is very funny.Another great laugh for me was the Dutch translation of the welcome comity.Of course Dr. Floyd chooses English but still... Brilliantly funny is also the fact that Kubrick's own daughter appears in the movie,as Dr. Floyd's daughter! In this part the Monolith appears again as a complete mystery,but now on the moon.A high humming sound comes and the third part begins.The Jupiter Mission is the third part in which the two astronauts Poole(played by Gary Lockwood) and Dave Bowman(played by Keir Dullea) fly to Jupiter to reveal the mystery of the Monolith,although they don't know that themselves.We does know it is the advanced computer HAL-9000(legendary voice by Douglas Rain) and when he makes a mistake all hell on the ship breaks loose.Poole is killed by HAL while he's in space fixing HAL's mistake and then Dave terminates HAL by erasing his memory and functions,HAL sings the song "Daisy" as his final words.Then a TV shows up in which Dave hears the true meaning of his mission.The screen turns black and the last and best part of the movie begins.Jupiter and beyond the Infinite is a mindblowing 25 minutes of beautiful shots of Jupiter,a dazzling star-gate sequence and a very curious ending sequence in a deserted chamber. The star-gate sequence is for me the ultimate highlight of the movie.The colors and images are simply breathtaking as is the haunting score by Ligeti.Never before and never again has someone tried to make such a scene as this one. The climax is very hard to understand and since I haven't read the book yet(which I will very soon),I still don't really get it.Dave is,after flying into Jupiter through the Star-gate,in a quiet and deserted house. He ages before his own eyes and when he is at his oldest lying in a bed,the mighty Monolith appears at his bed side.He reaches out for it and the next shot is the birth of the star-child as the camera closes onto the Monolith.The Moon appears as well as Strauss' masterpiece "Zarahustra"(for the third time in the movie). The Star-child reaches earth and the movie ends.The symbolism is very important in this film.There are two main symbols which appear in the movie several times:the Monolith and the Bone. The Bone appears as the murder weapon of the monkey,as the spaceship that shows up right after the bone is thrown in the air and at the beginning of the Jupiter Mission we see a long spaceship shaped into the form of a bone. The Monolith is even more important as it is the mysterious centerpiece of the story.The monkeys,as well as the scientists on the moon,as well as Dave Bowman on his deathbed react exactly the same:Confused,scared but also humble as they all want to touch it with great respect.In 10 million years nothing has changed,so it appears.Also very important and very well done are the special effects.They are way ahead of their time,considering it was made 10 years before "Star Wars".We can see how important the effects are on future science fiction films as "Star Wars".For that alone it is a cinematic landmark.The sound is also great,just listen to all those strange sound effects on the Jupiter Mission(breathing!) and the absence(!) of sound while the astronauts are in space. The music is unmistakably necessary in the movie since there are a lot of scenes in which not much happens.For instance the first shots of space underscored by "The Blue Danube" and of course the opening and ending shots underscored by "Zarahustra",which will always be identified as a "classical space piece".Last but not least the frantic and psychedelic music of Ligeti,eminent in the star-gate sequence.It gives the scene an extra boost of mystery.A great add on,intentional or unintentional(who knows?),is the music of Pink Floyd(my favorite band).The Masterpiece "Echoes"(my favorite song ever) from the album "Meddle" can be heard while watching the last 25 minutes of the movie,Jupiter and beyond the Infinite.To me it was an absolute joy to watch since it gives the scene a totally different look.The sound effects and various moods of "Echoes" match brilliantly with the movie,as if it was written while watching it.Start the song at the same point as the scene starts and enjoy. A funny and curious thing is that one of the main characters of the movie is called Dr. FLOYD(!!!). There is also a way to watch the entire movie with Pink Floyd music,but that requires several of their albums and is not very convincing.Still,pretty funny to watch."2001: A Space Odyssey" is a true cinema-movie,you have got to see it in the Theater.I saw it in my hometown Amsterdam as it was re-run as a classic comeback.That was the second time I saw the movie cause my first was on TV.Yesterday I saw it on DVD,which is pretty cool but it ain't no Theater.In my own private collection I've got the movie on VHS,a German version(aaaahhh) taped when it was on ARTE:a cultural channel(yeah right,not even the original version).You've got to see the movie at least two times to really enjoy it,cause the first time probably is not the best to fully understand it.That was my personal experience as well as Woody Allen's and that's a good advice now ain't it? "2001" is probably the most unique movie ever created,because of it's lack of a real story and because of it's beautiful images.Although there are some very long scenes in the movie it never gets boring,especially when you see it in the theater.There is so much to see and hear!Overall,it is one of my personal Masterpieces and then to consider that it isn't even my favorite Kubrick movie(which is Dr. Strangelove)!Brilliant picture. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A ballet in space</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Surely the oddest blockbuster ever made, '2001: A Space Odyssey' is a testament both to the remarkable ambition of its director, Stanley Kubrick, and also to the spirit of an age. Unlike almost every other science fiction film before or since, Kubrick chooses to play it slow, building an atmosphere instead of spoiling us with action: spaceships (presumably plastic models, in an age preceding computer-made effects) dance ballets while the phenomenon of zero-gravity is represented in a manner that would surely have been familiar to M. C. Escher. With immense audacity, Kubrick allows us almost no dialogue for the first half an hour (except for a few words spoken by, of all people, Leonard Rossiter!); and throughout the film, he conspires masterfully against his audience, daring to keep us in the dark about what is really going on. It does have to be said that the ending inspires David Lynch style misgivings (the final revelation is only that there is no resolution); but as with a Lynch film, this film transcends the logical purpose of plot.The film is also interesting because of when it was made, just before the first moon landings, in an age when optimism in technological progress was probably at its height. It's easy to laugh at the dated aesthetics of "the future" as rendered in this film, but also mistaken: the whole point is that '2001' is not set in "a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away" but in a medium term that is in fact already past. Man made it to the moon within just 24 years of inventing the jet engine: '2001' represents an imaginative peek beyond the limits our (then apparently rapidly expanding) horizons. That willingness to look beyond is what lifts the film above cheap futurology and keeps it fresh, even in 2004. Arguably Kubrick's best film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I'm not trying to make anyone feel bad or anything, but it's hard for me to read some of your comments (and take them as being intellectual or insightful) with all the grammatical and spelling errors. That being said, I agree with everything everyone said, but I also disagree. I have taken an interest in film in my senior year in high school (being born in 1985), so I'm not even close to being as experienced as most of you who already commented. But I don't see 2001 as boring at all. It's impossible for it to be boring in the fact that it is art. Stanley Kubrick is an artist, and he makes all his movies detailed and intricate. It's really no big deal if you don't like his style, but his style should be the only determining factor (excluding religious beliefs) of a person's liking of ANY of his movies...not counting Eyes Wide Shut because I think we can all agree that that was a low point for Kubrick. To sum up what I'm trying to get across, Kubrick makes art. If you're not a big fan of art, you're probably not a big fan of Kubrick. Also, 2001 is in my top five favorite movies (also including A Clockwork Orange, Amelie, Donnie Darko, and Requiem for a Dream).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>About evolution, natural selection, and kill or be killed, this film follows the philosophy of the beginnings and ends of races within spans of millions of years. Stanley Kubrick directs an unbelievably creepy, but incredibly intriguing film that follows the struggle for survival. With a climax that is probably the best ever made, Stanley Kubrick displays why he's one of the best directors who ever lived.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All I have to say is wow. Stanly Kubrick has created another masterpiece of cinema. From the downright frightening HAL computer, to the comical signs on bathroom stalls, this movie gets my highest rating: 10!!!!! (yes with five, count them five exclamation points). Although the ending was a little hard to figure out, it was one of the most amazing parts of the film This movie left me with an incredible sense of awe for Kubrick and a new respect for all things natural that humans have destroyed with computers and fossil fuels. Never has a movie made such an impact on my life and the actual way I live. That was how powerful this movie was to me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even as I sit watching "2001" now I can't quite comprehend it, the most stunningly artistic Science Fiction movie of all time, in fact this may very well be the greatest movie of all time, the plot concerns a mysterious alien Monolith (A giant black slab) appearing on Earth just as mankind's ancestors are about to face extinction. The Monolith gives us an "evolutionary kick in the pants." the "apes." discover weaponry, discover new sources of food ... discover murder. A jump cut leads us to the year 2001, a mission is planned to Jupiter when another mysterious Monolith is discovered on the moon. A radio signal is beamed to Jupiter so the spacecraft Discovery is sent there, its crew Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) and HAL (Douglas Rain). Along the way HAL goes insane and kills of Frank Poole, Bowman disconnects HAL (In one of cinemas most famous images) Bowman is left to face the ominous Monolith alone, he pilots a EVA pod into the giant device orbiting Jupiter, he rapidly ages to an old man and then his life is ended but all that he really was (His soul) is transferred into the Star Child, a new life born from Bowman. "2001" is really a spiritual and philosophical movie so bear that in mind while watching. The special effects are fantastic, even today they hold up to CGI magic, HAL remains one of cinemas most intelligent villians and the final scenes, while oft parodied, remain the greatest in any Sci Fi movie that was to follow.A perfect 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film, with A Clockwork Orange and Dr. Strangelove: How I've Learn to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb are a wonderful trilogy by Stanley Kubrick. The three of them are about the dehumanization. The most wonderful thing about this movie is the "dancing" of the space ships with the satellites, the planets and the stars with the music of Strauss. It is a beautiful and profound movie. One of the bests films ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know books have been written about this. My only thought is that as old as this movie is, its photographed in such a way thats its the most realistic space pic ever made, period. Since the film predates the moon landing, I still don't know how the hell he did it. Its plot, while interesting in a whacky sublime sorta way, is really not all that important to the experience. The acting too is true to all of his other films; well done but just a little on the warped side. It all comes down to the photography. Kubrick is one of only a handful of moviemeakers who have ever been able to produce what can be considered art via the motion picture. The screen becomes a living canvas. This film is a visual mindblower.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good God Almighty: why do people feel the need to proclaim the greatness of this movie? Yes, the special effects are truly awesome and it seems, at times, that Kubrick really got a kick out of them and just was playing around. Story? Go figure it out, huh. Please...I hear people talking about the layered meanings and how "deep" it is. Nonsence. Pretentious nonsence. The movie is ridiculously murky about it's meaning. If there is or was any, it was only Kubrick's meaning and he tried (and suceeded) in keeping it away from the audience. Sometimes people hear about a movie and how much it's praised that when they see it and don't "get it" they feel stupid. I felt that way and for years I sang this movies praises. But in the back of my head, I kept thinking (knowing) that I didn't get it. Now I've seen it again and I have to stand my ground and say that there is nothing to "get". Maybe it's in the book or Kubrick knows what he's trying to say but to the casual viewer or even the educated one, you will not be able to get it. Don't bother. See "Dr. Strangelove" for truly great Kubrick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The finest piece of cinematic genious... Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been a fan of both Kubrick and Clarke for many years now, but I had always avoided watching this movie because I couldn't see how it could possibly match the brilliance of the novel (Which is one of my most loved books). However, after finally seeing it, I am happy. no ecstatic. to say that it didn't match the novel, it surpassed it!Kubrick did an amazing job of keeping in the deep profound meaning of the story, which is really what makes this movie so great in my opinion. It puts forward theories and asks questions which not only entertain, but make you want to think and discuss, for a long time after you have seen the movie. The shear grand scope of the subject matter in my opinion makes almost all other movies pale into insignificance. What could be more profound than a story about the very existence of our race, and its position and meaning in the universe?The effects in this movie are amazing; not in a `3D generated CGI wiz-bang eye candy' type of way, but in a far more mature way. The purpose of them is to portray a scene in the most realistic way possible, and in my opinion by doing so, they work much more effectively than any movie made in more modern times, with greater effects technology and budget. I was completely amazed that this movie was filmed all those years ago in 1968.People who are after a movie that provides light entertainment value and does not require much thought or patience would do well to avoid 2001: A Space Odyssey. However for those who are after a deep and rich movie experience, and are willing to put in the work (in terms of patience and thought) will be greatly rewarded. The meaning of this movie is most definitely not served up to the viewer on a silver platter, and you may have to watch it a few times, or discuss it with others before you truly understand it. Everyone's interpretation of it may be different. That's what makes it so thought-provoking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Science Fiction Movie Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**************Spoilers Ahead*****************How does one review an unquestioned classic of modern cinema, and still remain honest and objective. First I have to stress that 2001 is not so much a movie as it is an audio-visual experience. You will not find an easy to follow plot structure in 2001. It is not an easy to follow film. The Film's Director, Stanley Kubrick has stated on many occasions that he wanted the audience to leave the film with more questions than answers. You will not find this a conventional Science Fiction film. 2001 defies conventions as easily as it defies explanation.The plot of the film , which I will not touch on due to the fact that it has been covered extensively elsewhere, is secondary to the thematic questions which the film asks. 2001 is about intelligence, its effects on man, and man's effects on it. It is about mental transcendence; the mind evolving beyond the body. It is about god, or rather a supreme intelligence, and it's effect on those around it.The film shows three kinds of intelligence. The apes in the "Dawn of Man" represent an animalistic intelligence. Brutal and warlike yet Kubrick specifically refers to them in the segment title as man. He is trying to tell us that human intelligence is low and prone to violence, due to emotions. Anger, jealousy and fear drive man to destroy one an other.The next intelligence we encounter is HAL. HAL represents Pure Intellect. Logic with an utter lack of emotion. Kubrick shows us that Pure Intellect is just as flawed as Animal Intellect. HAL kills for perfectly logical reasons. It is not brutal. It is not evil. It is uncaring, and that uncaring is just as dangerous.The Monolith represents supreme intelligence. In this film god is represented by a solid black monolith. Monolith represents god in an almost deistic manner in that does not interact with its surrounding, it simply waits for its surrounding to interact with it. Ape had to chose to come to the monolith, gain emotion and become man. Man had to chose to use its logic and science to find the monolith and transcend to the next level, a blend of pure logic and pure emotion.If you go into this movie expecting an easy Science-Fiction Film, You will hate it. As easy to follow communicative entertainment 2001 falls flat. As peace of philosophical art however 2001 ranks as one of the triumphs of western culture. The entire film is an exercise in minimalism, there is either voice or music playing never both (and often neither). In fact the first piece of dialogue does not take place until roughly twenty minutes into the film. The whole effect is to take the emphasis off of the story and more on the questions.The cinematography, direction, and effects in the film are all superb and still stand the test of time. The acting is excellent all around, particularly Douglas Rain's voice-over work as HAL. In short 2001 is an extremely well made film.The point of all this is this: Do your self a favor, get in the right mind set and go see this film. When you know what to expect and look for 2001 is an extremely thought provoking film, the fulfills its creators expectation.</fullReview>

But I'm not used to the extremely slow paced story and the structure in this particular film. It took me 3 times before I can complete whole thing. However, I know Kubrick did speed up the film but I don't think it worked. I know some will disagree with me but I'm cinema snob, too but I think it will take me a bit awhile before I can hail this film as *bleep* great film, you know what I mean?*Minor Spoilers* Someone told me that this film has 3 way, which is humans vs computer vs aliens but I didn't recognize it but I'll check it, if my time let me to.But I think special effects were pretty impressive for the time. For now, I'd give it 5 out of 10, sorry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am interested if other people had the same experience. Of course, the movie itself cannot be overestimated. What makes it so very special to me still is that it also was a rare moment in cultural history: that the art of the past (classical music from Strauss to Ligety) met the (relatively new) art of cinema. With 'met' I mean that Kubrick really merged the two art forms in one. At certain moments in the movie, I wondered if I was moved more by what I saw than what I heard, or by what I saw and heard. Very special is the famous cut from the apes to the space century. Special also because of the move from silence (20 minutes no talk, still an astonishing achievement in movie making) to Johann Strauss, from apes to 'civilization'. And to me special as I learned to like (even love in a way) the Strauss music. Like the secrets of the greatest pieces of classical music are hard to explain (why are we moved by the 9th symphony of Beethoven?), Kubricks masterpieces have also some untouchable quality, and will remain a milestone in the development of art in future centuries.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I really say about a film like "2001" that hasn't been repeated over and over to death?...Honestly, it doesn't take a rocket scientist (pardon the cliché - HA! Something repeated over and over to death!) to understand the fact: You can argue all you want until kingdom come, but any non-fan of Kubrick out there that loves to voice his/her pronounced dislike or hatred for his body of work is in a rather small minority. I feel a large degree of sympathy for anyone so focused on trying to tear apart a classic - a film with near-universal appeal and unanimous acclaim - with weak, tired claims that it is "long", "boring", "dated", "soulless"...First of all, a film with this kind of subject matter shouldn't be expected to be a short, hamhanded, special-effects-riddled "blockbuster" that panders to countless increasingly impatient audiences. It was never meant to be like that. Nevertheless, even when it was made and released in the late '60s - a time when, I assume, audiences had far longer attention spans - it was STILL met initially with a lot of critical uproar. People were probably walking out almost an hour before it finished; people were probably sleeping, complaining, what have you...basically, the same reaction I expect it would receive from a mainstream audience today. Yet somehow, over a long period of time, this film was finally given its long-overdue props, and genuinely recognized as one of the most important and timeless cinematic masterpieces of all time.Is it just me - or am I being a little more long-winded and wordy than usual? Oh, well...I can get that way when reflecting on something like this. I'm very passionate about Stanley Kubrick and his work; he is without a doubt one of the true legends of filmmaking, who has also suffered from some of the most unfortunate labellings and criticisms from the media regarding his eccentricity and whatnot. Okay - so what? He can be a little off-his-rocker sometimes. I can admit to seeing that, diehard admirer that I am. I understand all the gossip and the stories that - quite frankly - were a good part of the reason I became interested in him in the first place. So you could call me a hypocrite. Maybe I am...but hey, his films and his legacy will always be of interest to me, and of course in the long run, the private nature of the artist himself isn't all that relevant, is it?You see...I believe that Stanley Kubrick is a visual genius, no question. His trademark slow, cold, ominous shooting style is frequently a joy to behold. If someone considers his films too boring or too high-brow or whatever - then at the risk of sounding too obnoxious, you shouldn't be watching his films. Instead, you should stop right now and just leave them alone, and go see something else that may keep you awake and attentive for more than 10 seconds! I don't care what anyone says...overlong and pretentious it may be at points (I remember almost being driven to insanity the first time I saw it), but on the whole it is an absolute monument! It is an historic and landmark achievement in film and it deserves every bit of speculation, positive or negative, that comes its way. It's no big puzzle when you see that this is apparently among most international critics' Top 10 lists of the greatest motion pictures of all time! Again...you can argue that it's merely opinion, but really, as a moderate film buff, whose opinion would I trust more: that of a veteran, knowledgable movie critic, or some stubborn, close-minded, inexperienced viewer who refuses to give a hint of consideration for the opposing views? Maybe I'm starting to sound a little overly pompous at this point, and I sincerely apologize if my comments are giving off that vibe. It's just that I recently came across a rant-like statement from some no-name curmudgeon denouncing Kubrick as being a "fraud" in the history of filmmaking. I'm sure you can imagine how quietly outraged I was by such a statement - especially since the arguments backing it up were rather vague, and malicious.At any rate, I think I've made my point clear. Nothing more needs to be said; I've said all I've needed to say. "2001" is classy, high-art filmmaking at its very finest. Period.</fullReview>

Anyone who cannot see the brilliance of this director after watching this movie must be blind, or lost somewhere in a bad steven seagal movie.. After reading some reviews, I understand the people who say they HATE this movie... I understand the fact that they absolutely refuse to use their brain when watching movies, I recommend "Dude Where's My Car"... Now if you're up for using your brain, and like intelligent movies, this is as good as it gets... It's challenges your brain, eyes and ears... I just wish I had the chance to have watched this movie 35 years or so ago, but am still in this modern computer day of age, amazed by the visual effects of this movie... Try to see past the so-called "Boring" sequences of the film, and see it as a work of art, as it truly is...

		<shortDescription>2001: A Space HORROR! (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading and rereading the original story on which it was based about 20 times and comparing it to the movie, I have finally, FINALLY made some sense of the plot. But enduring this movie is still an excruciatingly long, terrible, horrible, painful experience. You know you're in trouble when you find yourself plugging up your ears, AND THE MOVIE HASN'T EVEN STARTED YET!!! It's just the "overture", folks. That's nothing. The real terror is yet to come...(Forgive me if some of the events are in the wrong order, I haven't seen this movie for about 7 years)Our movie starts in, uh, 1 million BC?! Yes folks, and there's the sterotypical ape-people (Homo Erectus, I beleive) running around, eating roots, and getting eaten by wolves. Suddenly a big shiny tennis table...I MEAN *MONOLITH!* appears, and the ape-people pray treat it like a god. A minute later one ape-man finds out how to kill things with a blunt object! Yay! I discovered meat! He throws his weapon in the air....AND WE SUDDENLY CUT TO 2001 AD! And a spaceship that looks oddly like the bone our caveman friend threw in the air earlier. Cue the videophone and the nasal-voiced girl who wants a BUSHBABY for her birthday.A crew discovers the monolith on the moon. They then send ANOTHER crew of astronauts (?) to pick up the monolith. HAL, the ship's computer, kills a few hibernating astronauts. He basically says it was an accident. Yeah right HAL. More bad stuff happens. The hero shuts down HAL in slow motion, and the maniac computer emits the clumsiest speech I have ever heard. It's like a man with a head wound reading cue cards. The hero escapes and....INTERMISSION!! WHAT?! NOW?! NOOOOOOOOOO!Now, for no reason at all, the film goes into about 20 minutes of swirling, bubbling, ear-and-eyeball sprinkled BAD ACID TRIP, WETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT. This is the point at which some people feel that the movie is sorta pushing it. GEE REALLY?! WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST CLUE???After pushing the fast-forward button what seems like forever, we see the equally bizarre ending. Astronaut in fancy-pants room turns into old man, dies, turns into baby, floats out into space, credits roll. It's insane. But that's Kubrick for ya.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We drown in our own pretention</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kubrick seems to have wanted to make this film a long homage to Frederick Nietzche. The "Dawn of Man" sequence, Dave's release of Frank's corpse and Dave's final transformation into a child are all direct references to that philosopher's Thus Spake Zarathustra, and subtler, more interpretive references abound, including use of a Strauss piece with the same name as that book as the movie's "theme music."People do not understand the intellectual content of this film, and I therefore fell very safe in saying that it must've failed to reach its own brainy aims. All ideas about it "meaning" have been pure conjecture, and vague conjecture at that. Add to that a complete lack of drama, and you have one amazingly bad film</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's say that you are a director. A very succesful director who has lots of clout and access to all of the best cinematic technology that money can buy. You then spend four years trying to figure out what to do with all of the expensive sets and crew that you have hired. You never figure out what to do with them and so you string together some excuse for a narrative,never clearly defining what it is you are attempting to say. The punchline to the joke is that the masses latch onto your undefined ideas and immediately take them as brilliance. It then becomes as contagious as the black plague and pretty soon everyone seems to "know" what the director was trying to say even though the director himself had no idea what he was saying. Multiply this by 34 years and you have a certified classic. This was the perfect marriage of eye popping visuals with a plodding, empty headed script. Kudos to Doug Trumbull's effects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie is incredible! not only does it look and sound amazing, it also makes the viewer wonder if they actually exist. the questions that are posed by Kubrick and Clarke make for a film that goes beyond merely inspiring the viewer, it makes you think about EVERYTHING! like many, i first saw 2001 as a small boy, not really knowing or appreciating the masterpiece i had just witnessed. as i got older, repeat viewings became an almost weekly part of life, and the message and impact of the film grew accordingly, leading me to the point where just thinking about this film sends me into a dream-like state of wonderment. Kubrick has created something that will be discussed and criticised until we are all long gone. i just wish i could know what people will make of it in another two-thousand years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jon Monsarrat review: I'll Explain The Ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey is a classic. It just is. From a drama perspective, it's accessible (I'm not a drama fan), and you can't beat Arthur C. Clarke (the writer) for deep issues about the meaning of life, evolution, aliens, and artificial intelligence.From a science fiction perspective, it's incredible that the film is still powerful over 30 years later. Unfortunately, back when "2001: A Space Odyssey" was released, space flight was big Big BIG with the forthcoming Apollo landing on the moon. Nowadays we see so much computer graphics and spaceships that it's a little old hat and I'm forced to admit that some of the sequences are, well, slooow. But the film still holds up remarkably well compared with its 1960s peers.OK, here's my explanation of the ending, and I won't spoil it for you if I say vaguely that "it's weird". Weird it is. The explanation has two parts:(a) It's an acid trip. Yes, this film was made in the 1960s.(b) Aliens aren't just people in funny costumes who share our principles and ways of thinking. They would be very, well, ALIEN. The weird bit at the end isn't supposed to be taken literally. It is supposed to unnerve you and make you get a taste of how strange, different, yet wonderful aliens would probably be.Who should see this film:-- Everyone. If you're only going to see one sci-fi film in your life, this would be a good choice, or "Contact", or "The Terminator", or "Gattaca".I'll give 2001: A Space Oddssey a only-barely-losing-its-perfection 10 out of 10. And definitely check out the movie "2010", which is just as good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes, I avoid critiquing a certain film because I am at a loss of words when it comes to describing it. `2001: A Space Odyssey' is one such film: a magnificent, visionary epic of unbelievable power and magnitude. Of course, a film that approaches mankind's most momentous questions in such an audacious manner becomes an instant magnet for criticism. Complaints like `slow', `dull', `doesn't make sense', `unimaginative', `emotionless', and even `dated' are repeatedly used by frustrated viewers who, for whatever reason, are unable to immerse themselves into Kubrick's magnum opus, but none of them really seem to fit. For me, `2001' is a truly flawless work of art.At the center of the film is the monolith: a polished, black rectangle, planted by a superior form of life in order to progress the evolution of mankind. Yet, strangely enough, a large portion of the movie deals with a battle between man and machine. It seems perplexing at first, given how little it has to do with the key story-line, but the extended sub-plot not only gives the film a conflict - one which brings along feelings of tension, fear, and pity, among other things - but helps to comment on the movie's many themes: most notably, man's rapid advancement of technology.`2001' is split into four chapters. The first of which, `The Dawn of Man', recounts man's evolution from man-ape into man. It opens with incredible imagery, which seems to tell the history of earth. It shows a world without cement, buildings, cars, and pollution. After apes inhabit the world, the helpless, inane creatures come into contact with the monolith, which helps them to develop a sense of curiosity and the discovery of `tools. The famous jump-cut, in which an ape-man tosses his newfound tool into the air, brings us either to 1999 or 2000, where man's tools have given them the ability to travel through space.After a dazzling ballet of floating ships, set to Strauss's `The Blue Danube', we find that our new protagonist, Dr. Heywood Floyd, is heading to the moon for reasons he cannot discuss. Floyd's harrowing discussion with Russian scientists (in an eerie white room with red/orange chairs) hints that his mission is rather important, and therefore, confidential. He learns of a monolith having been dug up on the moon, one that points to Jupiter and reacts with a sort of `burglar alarm', reporting to the extraterrestrials that man has reached the next rung on the ladder to becoming a superior life force.The lengthy third section, `Jupiter Mission', brings in the aforementioned sub-plot concerning HAL 9000, a self-proclaimed, `foolproof and incapable of error' computer entity with the capability to `mimic' human emotions. HAL's ability to mimic ultimately leads to his downfall, when he makes an incorrect judgement on the failure of another ship part. Overwhelmed by his massive duties on the ship, his fault leads to his own incapability to comprehend his fallibility. The ships crew members, headed on a mission which is kept secret to them, are killed off by the computer, leading the one remaining survivor to outwit the computer and `unplug' him. Upon reaching Jupiter space, he learns about the nature of his mission.The final segment, `Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite', depicts events beyond human comprehension. The survivor, David Bowman, is sucked into a stargate by the superior life form. When he reaches the destination, he is kept in a `human zoo', mapped out of images in his subconscious. He is then evolved into a greater being, one made purely of energy and soul.Words cannot possibly depict how I feel towards this movie. I've seen it over 25 times in the last year, and I find myself as overwhelmed by its beauty and power as ever. Every frame is beautiful, every choice of sound and music is impeccable. To experience the opening images of `Jupiter Mission' with the wonderfully melancholic `Gayne Ballet Suite' in the background, or the moment in which Bowman's objective is explained to him by Floyd on the blue screen, fading with the words, `its origin and purpose still a total mystery' is to have a mild feeling of euphoria. It would be pointless for me to list more breathtaking moments, they must be seen and appreciated on their own.In regard to the popular criticism of the film being `boring', this most likely depends on the viewer's attention span. The slowest of moments remain so visually stunning that I still can't take my eyes off the screen. I wouldn't remove a second of the film, because there is a purpose behind all of it. `Tedious' is often used to describe a sequence in which Bowman takes his space pod out to retrieve a part of the ship that is supposedly malfunctioning. It can be rather tedious, and it often triggers one's mind to wander, but it actually creates a feeling of routine and comfort within the viewer. A short time later, Bowman's assistant Frank Poole performs the similar task of attaching the ship unit back where it was. Identical feelings of routine and boredom begin to set in, but this time, Kubrick disrupts it. We see the pod turn around (under HAL's control) and cut Frank's oxygen cord. The tension built up during this moment is worth every millisecond of tedium in the previous sequence. Kubrick does something similar in `The Shining', using two scenes of a child riding a tricycle. The first creates routine, the second disrupts it. One of the director's many ingenius filmmaking tactics.I could discuss the many themes, allegories, and insights towards this greatest of films, but that should be left for the viewer to experience. Besides, I'm running dangerously close to the 1,000 word mark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The tip of a very large, deep philosophical iceberg</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***** Contains Spoilers *****I'm astonished at the number of negative reviews. "Slow", "Unemotional", "Bad effects", "Doesn't make sense", "Nothing happens", etc. For those who "don't get it", a primer:Slow: Movement in space takes a very long time. Astrophysics demands slow, controlled movement, which Kubrick deftly depicts. The pod return scene takes a long time; thoughtful viewers realize the astronaut is dying, and feel tension. Unemotional: The primary characters are astronauts, who necessarily have steely nerves. Watch Dave control his anguish over his dying friend in the pod return scene. Notice the same thing when he discovers the rest of the crew have been killed by HAL while in stasis. Notice the cold-blooded, murderous efficiency with which Dave decommissions HAL, and notice the heartbreaking decay of HAL and his impassioned (for a computer) pleas to spare his 'life'.Effects: These effects still surpass those being done today. Flashier? Louder? No. Technically, visually, scientifically perfect? Yes. Check out the vehicle that transports Dr. Floyd to the Moon...it's basically a prototype for the Space Shuttle which appeared over a decade later.Doesn't make sense: When the ape-man uses the bone as a tool, then tosses it in the air, we flash forward to a spacecraft. The genius of this is that it indicates that once ape-man learned to use tools, it was a straightforward progression to developing a space station. The meaning, purpose, and nature of the monolith are *supposed* to be unknown (and probably unknowable), to illustrate the feebleness of man's quest to understand the true nature of existence.Nothing happens: Um, only the evolution of man to the next level of existence (which during the final scenes, is as incomprehensible to us as our world would be to a prehistoric ape-man). You were expecting what? Car crashes? Sound traveling through (airless) space? Histrionic astronauts? Klingon cloaking devices? Aliens gestating in stomachs? Cute, engaging robot sidekicks? Cliff's Notes?Slow and deep does not equal boring and ponderous. In the early stages of the film we see primitive ape-men living a precarious life, barely subsisting and in danger of losing their watering hole to a neighboring tribe/clan/group. The monolith appears and the members of our group touch the monolith in a very inscrutable scene. What's happening? Why is it happening? What does it mean? The mystery is partially solved when we see one member of the clan idly playing with a bone. As he plays with it, it dawns on him that he could use the bone to hunt the wild pigs that live in the area. The next thing we see is our group of ape-men, looking a little fatter, and the bones of a few more pigs littering the ground.So, apparently, the monolith has provided this group of ape-men with a heightened sense of logic and reason, through mechanisms unknown. That is, in and of itself, deep commentary on the nature of man and god. But what happens next is even more disturbing. After getting fatter and stronger by using his newfound technique, our protagonist-ape then faces off with his rivals at the watering hole. And uses his newfound learnings to kill the leader of the rival tribe and claim the watering hole. This speaks even more deeply to the nature of man, in that when ape-man acquires knowledge, he first uses it for good (survival) and then for evil (to kill).There are some who say that they get all these deeper meanings, but still don't care for the film. For them, I offer my condolences that this film does not bring as much awe and wonder into their lives at it does to mine. There are others (many others, in my experience) who have given up on this film halfway through, and never experienced the entire arc of the story. I would encourage these people to try it again with an open mind and no pressing distractions.And then there are those who will someday see this film for the first time. I envy you that experience. See it on the big screen, if at all possible. If not, watch it in widescreen with no commercials. Pan and scan will obscure the glorious cinematography, and commercials will jar you out of the funky, contemplative state this movie induces. Enjoy. **** out of ****</fullReview>

Visually speaking, it is a typical Kubrick film, but come on, whats so great about it? Theres little dialouge, absolutley no character develepment, and the storyline and plot are barley there. The ending felt too much like Planet of the Apes (2001), which made no sense. This film, though, was promising. It had the potential to be a great sci-fi film, instead it failed horribly. 2 starts out of 5. Skip this and rent Close Encounters or Star Wars or something.</fullReview>

BUT - I am telling you, all of you pretentious know-it-alls are wrong, you do NOT have all the answers to this film. It's actually quite obvious that there ARE NO answers, no true and definite meaning. Theories, yes, there are plenty, but if there was really a blatant point, right-and-wrong definitions, then why would you all be arguing about it? Why is there no one accepted idea?This is a film that redefines our ideas and preconcieved notions about movies. It stretches our limits, and honestly, it stretched mine. The lack of editing, the nonexistant plot, the ending... I was screaming at the television when it was over. But I can't say it was bad - it was original, beautiful, intense, and geniunely thought-provoking. You have to give Kubrick credit, he did what no other director could possibly accomplish.BUT don't fool yourself. There is not a definite and accepted explanation of this movie, so don't look to hard for one, and PLEASE - do not insult others' intelligence because they don't "know" all about it like you.

And this movie dates back to, well a very long time ago, 1968 to be exact. I don't know how he did it, the scene where the spaceship is landing on the moon, and the dome starts to open, or the one where Dr. Poole is running around and around. It blew me away, and even if t is just a cheap trick, I don't care, it looks fenommenal, the way special effects should - so that you don't notice that they're fake. Well these certainly did not.

		<shortDescription>Best sf film ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The list of good sf films is extremely short. Topping that list, with a good bit of space between it and number 2, is "2001: A Space Odyssey". Browsing the other IMDB comments, I see that this is basically a love it or hate it film. Many people seem to dislike this film intensely, and many call it boring. I can't imagine finding a film like this boring, but hey, that's me. Fellowship of the Ring was boring. This is edge-of-your-seat material. I honestly can't take my eyes off the screen. Anyway, the other camp consists of people like me who simply can't stop gushing about the film. There is a very small minority who like, or even love the film, but call it "flawed". The definition of "flaw" is such a subjective one, though. To my mind, there are definitely aspects of this film which many people will not, do not, and never were expected to like. But they're not flaws. Not to me. Yes, the plot is notoriously difficult to penetrate. When asked about the story, Arthur C. Clarke said something like "Watch the film. Read the book. Watch the film again. Read the book again." Quite obviously, Kubrick and Clarke (who developed the film together... neither the film nor the book was "based on" the other) intended the plot to be opaque, intended the finale to be ambiguous, and intended to encourage audiences to think about the film and draw their own conclusions. Now, if you are a film-goer who dislikes ambiguity, who wants a simple story simply communicated to you (and there's not a thing wrong with that), you're going to call that a flaw. But I refuse to consider something a flaw when it was so obviously the conscious intention of the film-makers. You can argue that the approach they took made for a film which is not enjoyable to you, but if they had taken any other approach, they'd have made a different film. Thus, ambiguity, for instance, can't be considered a flaw of this film. It's like saying that The Sixth Sense would have been a better movie if it had been about pirates. Anyway, everybody talks about the special effects and the music and blah blah blah. Everybody talks about the HAL sequence. Blah blah blah. I don't want to talk about any of that stuff. It really diminishes the film, in my opinion, to discuss it like that. More so than any other, this is a film where each aspect (script, performances, cinematography, music, special effects, etc.) blends together with all the others to create a sort of indivisible whole. This is the movie equivalent of a prime number. [God, that sounds pretentious!] But anyway, discussing singular pieces of the film is to miss the greater effect of the whole. This film is an experience much more than it is a story, and that experience is created by the confluence of every aspect of the film. [This is why, incidentally, I think the film works so much better than the book... a novel is, by its very nature, suggestive of a narrative. The simple procession of words is inherently evocative of a story structure. A film does not have this limitation, and is therefore able to achieve much more by deviating from the constraints of classical narrative structure, which this film does toward the end.] Another reviewer here states that if you haven't seen this on the big screen, you haven't seen it all. I'm afraid I haven't seen it on the big screen. But I would like to add that if you've only seen this film once, you haven't seen it at all. A single viewing (or even less) may indeed be enough to convince you that you have no interest in plumbing the depths of this immense and powerful film. But if you are not instantly alienated by the unconventional aspects of the film, you simply must see it again and again (and also read the book... though inferior, as I said, it is also instrumental to a full appreciation of the film). If you simply don't like the film, that's fine. You are far from alone. I would suggest you check out the book and film "Contact". It is a far more conventional version of practically the same basic story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's an influential movie, but it's got its flaws.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey is worth seeing, because you'll understand references and be able to make conversation about it. However, you might not enjoy watching it. There were a few things I really liked about it, but I wouldn't say that I had a good time watching the film.That's not to say that I particularly regret spending the time (it is a bit lengthy) to watch it. Afterwards it is interesting to mull over some of the themes, and develop your own take on it. I won't be so pompous as to try to feed you my interpretation of the meaning, because there are too many ways you could explain each thing. However, as vague as the metaphors are, I feel that Kubrick beats the viewer over the head with them. The phallic object(s), the question of whether or not man is special, "man's first instinct," and so on: I don't know about everyone else, but I felt like Kubrick tried a bit too hard to make his themes clear. I didn't know anything about the film beforehand, so I wasn't primed to come in and analyze everything. However, when the message and substance are so blatant (even if you can't be sure quite what they are), you are forced to self-consciously think about the movie while watching it. "Ugh, I've been watching birth imagery for the last five minutes," you think, and it detracts from the experience. Even if you realize you might be wrong.The themes are certainly interesting questions, interesting things to think about. And I'm not saying that they're presented in a shock-value sort of way. Without dialogue, action, and dynamic camera work, though, when the artistic parts come up and come on so strong, it's just overkill. The ending sequence is particularly guilty of this. Everything is metaphor, and Kubrick chose some rather mundane ways to represent the grandiose, almost as if he thinks no one will have any clue what's going on otherwise. "Oh, come on, a bathtub?" you may find yourself griping.As for the claims that the movie is boring, they may go a bit too far, but there is some validity to them. Certainly some scenes are most effective when they're stretched out longer than you'd expect. At least for me, Kubrick stretched them out far longer than was necessary. Given the flavor of the film, long sit-back-and-enjoy-the-beauty scenes seem out of place while you're trying to discover out what's going on, and they end long after you've taken it all in.In all, if you enjoy your thought-provoking experiences coming in story form, you'll be disappointed. If you like to change how you view the world slowly, and don't take well to things that try to blow your mind, you'll be disappointed. If you're not interested in an experiment in film pace, you'll be disappointed. If you'd rather have fun watching a movie, and do the deep thinking later, you'll be disappointed. See the movie I suppose, but there will be many things that will make you want to roll your eyes.</fullReview>

But the tunnel sequence with lots of colours is just played out *waaaaaay* too long. The only way you could enjoy it is to be stoned; it just raises the irritation level way too much. Although we got the theme for the computer game Elite out of the space docking sequence, that's about the only thing that had going for it too. To be a truly great movie they should have slashed these sequences by about 2/3rds, and then they could have added some of the better parts of the book they ended up leaving out. Read the book instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick's Magnum Opus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's detached, heavily visual directorial style found its ultimate expression in this cautionary tale of technology out of control.This film has probably been studied and dissected more than any other, with the exception of "Citizen Kane". The story itself is fairly straightforward. What makes "2001" such a powerful film is, paradoxically, its refusal to hurry up and tell that story. By focusing on mundane details, yet holding our interest with spectacular visuals, it gradually makes us feel as if WE ARE THERE. The music is just as important as the visual component, stealthily creating a desired emotional response - exhilaration, apprehension, awe. It forces its way into the subconscious, engaging the viewer on a much more primal level than most movies even attempt to, let alone succeed. I saw "2001" for the first time in 1968, the year it was released. I was a pre-teen, raised on Marvel comics and lots of sci-fi stories. The thing I remember most is that Kubrick respected the laws of physics. He played it absolutely straight, making the events of the Discovery's voyage all the more chilling because they were REAL!*****SPOILER******** When Dave blows the air lock, there is no sound until the hatch is sealed. When Frank gets the message from his family, he can only watch because radio waves take a finite amount of time to reach Earth, even at the speed of light. *******END SPOILER*****. This sort of uncompromising attention to detail elevates "2001" above all other science fiction films. It takes away all of our preconceptions, and forces us to experience what is happening RIGHT NOW. I have seen it more than 30 times, and I STILL get goosebumps every time Frank goes out to replace that antenna.A word to those who have never seen "2001" in a theater - you have never seen "2001" period!!! On TV (or PC monitor), there is no way you can get more than a fraction of the intended effect. This film is a LOT more than just cool sets, classical music, apes, and a weird light show. If you ever get the chance, you OWE it to yourself to see it in a darkened theater, where you can give it your undivided attention. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why all the love and admiration for this film? granted, Hal is great, granted that the film has interesting sets and for its time, great visual effects, but...COME ON! as a story, it fails on many levels. the dawn of time sequence is prolonged to the point of distraction, as is the endless sequence towards the end, where, well...this film simply takes to long showing the audience details which mar the true beauty it could have been. like most Kubrick films, this feels hollow and incomplete. then again, maybe that was the point. it is not that people won't understand this film-the overall story is actually too simple for confusion-but rather that one may fall asleep during the film. I have seen this film three times, and each time I notice something new, something that does not need to be there. the first time, it was the score, which was a cheap way out of a bad situation for the films creators. don't get me wrong, I LOVE classical music, but the repetition displayed was overwhelming. again, that was another problem with it. too much of the same old same old. at times it is as if Kubrick wanted nothing more or less than to film but a few scenes in as many ways possible. As science fiction, it is neither a failure nor a success. it just is. as a film, it is just not my cup of tea.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stanley Kubrick's greatest masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Stanley Kubrick's "2001:A Space Odyssey", premiered in the summer of 1968,it was a science-fiction movie like no other has ever seen. It was not like the other sci-fi flicks where spaceships and monsters from other worlds attacked people but in a sense it was a dazzling spectacle of innovative technological cimema that would be the forefront of other films to follow years later. When this film was came out,it would be the second biggest attraction for MGM since the days of Charlton Heston in 'Ben Hur',which was the studio's highest grossing picture until 2001 came along. From its first scene with the dawn of mankind,to the eyepopping sequence of the spaceship rotating around the earth is a wonderous marvel to look at and you can't take your eyes away from it. For it's millennium anniversary,MGM is re-releasing it back into theatres and its presented in a format that has been never seen before. For those who have never seen this classic,this is a rare opportunity to see it up close and to experience the opening array of its breathtaking special effects and the way Arthur C. Clarke's story about the innovations of man and machine(including the computer HAL along with the astronauts who go beyond the stars and into the depths of space)is handled with great precision and it is very effective here. Since most of the production design was carefully supervised by Stanley Kubrick himself,it was astounding to see and behold with the powerful score that is set to classical music with the works of Richard Strauss and others.Truly one of the greatest masterpieces of science fiction ever devised. A Stanley Kubrick masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In fact, to truly appreciate this film, that is exactly what you will have to do. The first time I saw it, I thought it was awful. There were many scenes that seemingly don't translate well to the small screen.On subsequent viewings however, I began to appreciate the film more and more. It is really interesting. And although I say it is interesting, I can't say why. I suppose it's the extraordinary attention to detail, or the way it conveys so much with so little dialog. I'm not sure what! In fact, that's probably the reason I find it interesting.One thing that I will point out is that if you do get a chance to see this movie, watch the letterboxed DVD. I was BLOWN AWAY. There are actually scenes that are distorted by the VHS copy, by reasons of the much lower picture quality but also the cropping of the image.Case in point: The scene where we see Dave exercising inside Discovery there is a rather long shot of the "eye" on the HAL computer. On the VHS copy, it's a seemingly tedious shot with no reason for being there. However, on inspection of the DVD copy with the higher resolution picture, you can clearly see Dave jogging in the reflection on the lens. The purpose being to show how lonely Discovery is, and an erie sensation that "you're being watched." It's almost impossible to notice this on rental VHS copies of this film... maybe because of degradation due to age, but the DVD was the first time of many viewings I noticed it.I urge you to give it a second, third, etc. chance. This film deserves it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Me and a couple of friends rented A Space Odyssey in the spring of 2000 and watched it for the first time. As Gen-Yers we'd been raised to believe that science fiction and action go hand in hand. They hated this movie; to them it was terribly boring and meaningless. I looked a bit deeper and I think I understood what Clarke and Kubrick were trying to say: that humanity as a whole is only just beginning to crawl out of its infancy; that to understand the nature of the Universe we must first learn to understand ourselves; and perhaps the most important lesson of all - supercomputers can read lips. This certainly is not a conventional movie. It is a grand experiment to show how much can be said through vision. If a picture is worth a thousand words, 2001 is worth a googolplex. That's what makes this movie a classic. All the images that aren't tainted by our primitive language but speak on a much higher level: the ancient monolith on Earth, the circular interior of the ship, the Star Child...these images don't need voice-overs or explanations or subtitles; there are no words to adequately describe them. The only language we have that even comes close to describing this film is Music. 2001 has plenty of music, great music, lots of astonishing images, and virtually no dialogue. It doesn't tell you what it is about...it makes you figure it out for yourself. That's why this is among the greatest films ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Religious themes pursued via science fiction.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone familiar with the work of Arthur C. Clarke knows that his trademark is the intersection of science fiction and religious allegory. Nothing shows this more than in "2001: A Space Odyssey". Actually, this film is not really science fiction at all but more entrenched in religious themes, especially those of the Middle-East (Judeao-Christianity and Islam). This may in fact be the most religious film ever made. If anything, it is essentially a scientific (or SF) exploration of Creation through to Revelation. The symbols throughout the film are hard not to miss. There is Dave the space pilot (king David, or possibly the Son of David, as Jesus is described in the New Testament). There is HAL as the polite but super intelligent evil force that wants to prevent the final chapter of humanity's journey. Indeed the film's main theme is shared with the theme of religion: birth, death and rebirth. There is an unmistakable emphasis on birth and death in the film. (A warning for those who have yet to experience the film for I am going to talk about some of the important scenes.) Birthday's are mentioned at least three times officially and implied at other times. We witness the birth (or Dawn) of humans, the birth of consciousness, the birth of technology. In the scene with Haywood Floyd's daughter the talk is about missing her birthday party. Frank calls home from the ship and his parents sing him happy birthday. We even hear HAL talk about his "birthday" at the computer manufacturer on earth. Along with all these mentions of birth are the ones of death. HAL's death, Frank's death, the early man's (Cain and Abel?) death at the beginning of the film. There are so many religious references they can't all be mentioned. Thus, this is not a science fiction film and certainly not an action film. It will bore the "Star Wars" crowd. Instead it is a beautifully filmed intellectual excursion into humanity's past and their proposed destiny. The film's final conclusion on its theme is left up to the viewer. It is infamously opaque at giving up its answers. After all, it is religious allegory yet with the famous Also Sprache Zarathustra score. Thus, it is God and Nietzsche put together, neither one being known for their clarity. Yet, it is in this way, that the film most mirrors the religious themes it analyzes. We don't really know why we're here or what existence is about. We have religion, philosophy, and science as resources, yet in the end, its all a big wonderful mystery that forces us to wait and see how it finishes. "2001" asks us to take this patient and thought-filled journey to see how it might end. However, it can never tell us the why, only the possibility of how we will get there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After 32 years, this film is still the finest...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After first viewing this film in early 1969 I had the distinct impression that I had just seen the finest film I would ever see. In 32 years that feeling has not waned. This is without question the greatest achievement in motion picture history. Whatever misgivings one might have for its lack of traditional dramatic and narrative structure - the film offers a vision of Mankind's ultimate place in the Universe that is both profoundly beautiful and terrifying. The critics who hated it have never come to terms with the scale of the Cosmos and the true measure of their own insignificance. Most are scientifically illiterate. They must feel they could have (to use Herman Melville's words) "offered God advice during the six days of creation...these people are all cracked across the brow..."To see all of Human history - from the Pleistocene to the 21st century - pass within the space between two film frames (as if it were unimportant...!) is something most mental lightweights can't handle. Those who can are given the opportunity to see at least the goal of Cosmic Consciousness and the ultimate end to human strife ahead of us - assuming we can overcome our egotism and narrowmindedness.The most legitimate religious experience of the 20th and 21st centuries is to embrace the grand myths of our own time - to understand the natural origin of Mankind and to look forward to our first contact with advanced extraterrestrial life. No other film reflects these sentiments more sincerely. It has indeed pointed the way to a truly new age.A note to Mr. Tom Hanks: I shattered your "record" long ago. I've seen this film at least 100 times projected! 40 times in 70mm, 60 times in 35mm, and once in 16mm (awful - never again...!) Thanks for your undying respect for this timeless masterpiece and your own fine film work preserving the history of space exploration.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've noticed that these days, "2001: A Space Odyssey" has become somewhat like the story of the emperor's new clothes. All important critics and movie fans are somewhat like the tailors, who are trying to convince everyone that this film is a great, colorful masterpiece, when any child can see it's more akin to a pair of undies. The fact is, this movie is a pain to watch the entire way through. It might better be classified under the horror section, for 3 days after I'd seen it, I was still trying to ease my brain with the mantra that it was just a movie, and not a piece of propaganda from a Russian concentration camp. The most painful part of this movie is the realization that you could be watching absolutely anything and it would mean the same thing, for as Kubrick admits, the whole film means nothing. You could be watching pieces of fried chicken floating downstream in slow motion to the tune of Mary Had a Little Lamb and it would have the same significance in the movie as spaceships docking to the "Blue Danube." All and all, you'd better just rent it, so you can appease the "tailors" of our age and say you've actually seen it, but like them when they are at home by themselves, out of the limelight, you can admit it was the absolute worst movie ever made and that you wish some important man would just yell out, like Rock Hudson at its premiere "Would someone tell me what the ---- this is about?"</fullReview>

I see why Kubrick wanted to draw certan scenes or metaphors out, but some were just draw TOO DARN LONG. The music was great during the disturbing/moving parts, but I literally got sick to my stomach after 5 straight minutes of the same eery music. I had to fast forward during some parts, or at least mute the sound. In some places he just ran a good idea into the ground, drawing out scenes 4 times longer than is healthy, and twice as long as would be necessary to make a lasting impression. 6/10 (would have been a 9 or 10.

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest films ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First let me start off by stating the following; Unless you are really ready to make up your mind, ready to think for yourself, ready to open your mind and watch a movie where YOU, the viewer must determine the premise without having it spoonfed to you, DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE.There are two basic camps about this film, either you hate it, or you love it.There is no middle ground.Kubrick ask some very basic and ancient questions here;1) Why am I here?2) Am I truly alone in the Universe?The only movie I've ever seen that remotely comes close to the simple beauty of this movie is David Lynch's Eraserhead.What is the monolith? Perhaps it is the Unknowable, that catalyst which drives man to discover, and try to determine where we stand in the scheme of Creation.What was the meaning of the ending? Perhaps that no matter how evolved we may become, we will truely never know the deep mysteries of life.Are we alone? More of a philisophical question that an actual scientific one, it is the most Kafkaesque question in this film. You must determine it yourself.This movie ask the questions that are normally the trade of Philosophers and Clergymen. Not a film for the weak minded, or lazy of Will.To all it's detractors, yes, it has no dialogue to help you along, it has bewildering gaps of silence, and an ending that will literally take an excrutiating exercise of thought to even attempt grasping at straws for meaning. All that aside, it is still ONE OF THE BEST STORIES EVER PUT ON SCREEN, PERIOD!Like a game of GO, it is both simple and unfathomable. One of the greats. If you are ready, watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2001 is not the Graal ! Stop looking at this as if it is Sacred !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This might sound strange for me to begin this review with the same words i´ve used to comment on 2010, but i can´t help it because no matter what the purists might say i still think both are excelelnt movies despite their obvious diferences. Both were movies of its time.Somehow it seems that for some people 2001 has become a religion, a thing so sacred that it´s almost a blasphemy just even mention anything about it. This seem to be the same persons who attack 2010. Normally not even for the movie, but just because it almost seems a crime for someone even to think of touch the magnificence of 2001, like if Man wanted to be compared with God.2001 is just a movie people! Nothing more! A piece of imprinted celuloid ! Stop treating it as a religious artifact ! It´s a fantastic movie no doubt and probably one of the most inovative films since CITIZEN KANE, but it´s just that. One great movie. And i bet that most of the people who worship 2001 now, probably hated it the first time they saw it. Didn´t even understood it i bet ! Only this days it´s very fashionable and shows a sign of great intelligence to like this movie, so everybody must "like" 2001, or be looked upon as an idiot.Some complain that 2010 is a movie for idiots, because it explains all the mysteries from 2001, one by one in detail, leaving no margin for the religious aspect of the original. But people tend to forget that the original story writen by A.C.CLARKE, was just a very scientific tale totaly deprived of emotions as he intended to write it specifically as scientific and technologic exercize, as he said in many interviews.It was the audiences who "created" that religious aspect, because they started to look at the aliens as almost divine creatures, because they couldn´t understand such an advanced scientifc concept for an advanced race. Arthur C. must be very pleased with this until this day, because it only proved true his famous phrase about an advanced technical creation being understood and perceived as magic, by some less technical advanced cultures. This was exactly how the audiences started to look at the aliens from this story.Anyway this is a great movie. A festival of special effects a million times better than Star Wars-Episode 1. In 2001, the effects are used to create an enviroment and aren´t throwned at our faces every minute. Star wars is fun, but 2001 is as pleasant to watch as any George Lucas saga. You just have to have to like good science fiction and not be afraid of thinking during a movie. In fact part of the fun in this movie is thinking about it.A movie way ahead of its time. In the 60´s and in our days for sure.Don´t miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually stunning but not as deep as it pretends</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I bet that Stanley Kubrick spent the last thirty years of his life laughing his tuckus off that of all of his works, this one most profoundly affected the cultural consciousness which he consistently satirizes.Evidence of this abounds: witness the instantly recognizable creations of the computer HAL, and its synthetic voice; the character "Dave" and the line "What are you doing, Dave?"; and the stylized score based on Strauss' "Also Sprach Zarathustra."There is no doubt that this is a beautiful, confounding picture that says something about the dehumanizing effects of technology. What *else* it says is totally unclear - the screenplay is often quite witty, but feels like it was never thought completely through. Of course, works that are incomprehensible are often deemed to be profound, and Kubrick seems to have understood that; in fact, the emergence of drug culture and middle-class spiritual yearnings during the late 60s allowed him to create something really huge and really vague, and pass it off as something really deep.The film opens with "The Dawn of Man," where it is implied that man's evolution was directed by either a) an alien life-force, or b) a God-like creature, represented by a huge black monolith.The former interpretation would be the less mundane, more sci-fi expression, but the relationship between man and alien is never developed. Instead, outer space is a setting - an excuse for an excursion by scientists (who discover a huge monolith on the moon), who end up battling against a computer (HAL - increment the letters by one and you get IBM) that turns on its creators.What the monolith means, or what is is doing in outer space, is bafflingly unclear, and Kubrick never bothers to explain its presence. In spite of this (or maybe because of it), many viewers have hailed the film as a religious experience; many more time their drug hits in order to be stoned during the psychedelic final scenes.2001 does have something going for it - its special effects are masterfully done and may be forever unsurpassed in terms of the visual spectacle they produce. (Kubrick garnered his one and only Oscar for this film, for Best Visual Effects.)Also, this is a lesson in how to tell a story through images and sounds. Though it runs 141 minutes, there are less than 40 minutes of dialogue.But as a commentary on the nature of humankind and the universe in which we live, it leaves a great deal to be desired.</fullReview>

I love Full Metal Jacket, Dr. Strangelove, Spartacus, A Clockwork Orange, and The Shining. But 2001 is just too out there for me. Perhaps it lacks a story and human characters to move it along. I can understand enjoying the incredible special effects and ideas that are there (but you probably need to read the book to understand most of them). However, just to watch it I still have no idea what is going on. I challenge anyone who has never seen it to watch it and tell me what it all meant. It was not until I read many reviews from other critics did I piece together some of it. And don't say I watched it once and gave up on it after it was not the bang bang action movies teenagers live off of. I have seen it 9 times, still love the special effects but cannot just say, boy I enjoyed that movie. For cryptic Sci-Fi I prefer Blade Runner, Akira, or a good anime movie. 6/10</fullReview>

I simply didn't get this movie. There's hardly any dialog, and a lot of space ships floating around, seen from many angles...I understand the description of what this is about (the philosophical question - the concept - of the nature of advanced civilizations), but I failed to see this made apparent in this film. To me, it's very disjointed with no clues as to what is supposed to be happening or why. I wonder whether a lot of people gave this rave ratings because they were afraid to say, hey, I didn't get it.

But don't rate this super high just because everyone else does.On a couple of occasions it's interesting, for a minute or so, then it's straight back to snooze mode. Old movies are not always good just because they were good back in the day. It racked up some stars from me, because I really liked some of the acting from the main character, and of course the special effects who are incredible considering they are soon to be 50 years old (oh my!), and a couple of things I won't mention any further to not spoil, but all in all I was not entertained by this.

Good special effects for 1968 and many memorable lines like "Open the pod bay doors Hal." "I'm sorry Dave I can't do that." Some find the movie slow and tedious even boring and it can be in parts but my main gripe is the silly ending which if you only see the movie I don't know how you're supposed to understand it if you haven't read the book where it is actually explained what is going on. I think a lot of people who rave about the movie yet haven't read the book don't know what the end means at all.

I kept saying to the friend I was with "Let's go!" She just kept answering that something had to happen soon. After 25 minutes of watching apes jump around, it didn't matter what happened next. Not to mention the 10 minutes of space ship inspection, and that was just the outside. The movie had a message, which I do understand, but it didn't make up for the incredible monotony of the film. When something did happen, it was so minimal in comparison to the whole film that I couldn't even get interested. This is a film without any character to get interested in or like, no followable storyline, just a ho-hum message. Some good music, but I could hear better on the radio on NPR most Sunday mornings. If you want to be mind-numbed, go for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The single most boring film of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"2001: A Space Odyssey" has been acclaimed as one of the greatest films of all time that is nothing short of a cinematic miracle. How? This film lacks any surreal visual literature and has absolutely nothing to show for besides a cutting-edge visual portrayal including groundbreaking cinematography, clear sound and stylish visual effects. The visual evolution in film is interesting to study and when considering that in 1968 this was considered a visual miracle, you'll feel very granted to live in a time where visual effects are mostly eye-popping all the time. "2001: A Space Odyssey" is about three different space stories about evolution within animals, mankind and technology. When the world is ruled by apes, one particular group discovers a mysterious rectangular monolith near their home, which imparts upon them the knowledge of tool use, and enables them to evolve into people. A similar monolith is discovered on the moon, and it is determined to have come from an area near Jupiter. Astronaut Dave Bowman, along with four companions, sets off for Jupiter on a spaceship controlled by HAL 9000, a revolutionary computer system that is every bit humankind's equal--and perhaps its superior. When HAL endangers the crew's lives for the sake of the mission, Bowman will have to first overcome the computer, then travel to the birthplace of the monolith. This story isn't handled well. It's all over the place. First we see apes evolving, next we get this space mission with absolutely no character development, hardly any dialogue, a lame plot who's only support is visual effects. Not one scene is gripping or directed well by Stanley Kubrick, who makes the film extremely quiet causing the film to sooth you into a deep sleep. The extremely long length and boring plot with scenes that are never started or ended at the right time caused me to count down the entire time of how many minutes were left until I could be free from this snoozer. The film doesn't tackle any themes of persistence, teamwork or risk like many space films do. Instead, it's all plain visuals. We see the visual portrayal of a space mission instead of the depth taken by mankind. The fact that this is being praised as one of the greatest films of all time shocks me greatly. This just simply cannot compete with other classic films that are handled in a better subject and don't make you tired and bored to tears.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is what happens when a director wants to be to genial for his own good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched this movie yesterday, and I probably didn't get as bored as I did watching this film than any other movies. The problem at the beginning was the stupid black screen that didn't gave a clue to the spectator about what was happening or what was the director trying to show. It was later that I discovered that in fact it was that monolith thing trying to communicate or something like that, awful. The problem with this movie as many others said in the reviews was that it was too slow. It was showing you the same thing from different angles over and over again, instead of just running the movie. If you can believe this there were actually four main scenes in the entire movie. The one with the monolith at the dawn of men, the one with that men coming to that ship and having his speech and the discovery of the monolith on the moon, then that mission to Jupiter and the battle between an useless computer and the guys from the mission, and in the end that stupid evolution thing which doesn't make any sense at all.Now I won't try to deny the evolution or say anything about it, but the problem with the first scene is that the thing with the dawn of men is just silly. You don't get anything from that first scene except the fact that those beings were there at our beginnings but didn't influenced us at all, nor even it shows if those beings created us or something like that. How could monkeys began to behave so crazy? Why there isn't any logic in that? What's the reason for that scene? So basically, what was so special about Dave that those superior beings wanted to evolve him into that "starchild"? Was he any different than those men who discovered the monolith on the moon? They were living in the same period of time, so basically they were almost the same in every aspect.The problem with the "starchild" that I have seen is that it doesn't represent another form of human existence, because you can see it, is material, and all that you can see, all that is made of flesh and bones will one stop existing or pass from this world. I guess here is were God comes in and transforms our bodies into another form of existence that we will never understand it because we are human, and all that a human can think of is something material, from flesh and bones, something that will one day cease to exist.Another problem in this film is that the human kind appears to be to advanced in 2001. We actually didn't advanced much since 1920's till 1960's, what possible miracle could make us advance so much in 40 years. Even now with all of this technology we don't advance, but sometimes remain the same in some ways. Oh, wait! The moon landing that will unlock our technology or brain potential and we will evolve ourselves to something like what we see in the movie.Well i guess Stanley Kubrick's genius didn't think of that before making this movie. Well, what could have he thinking of? Following the same pattern of all other people believing we will advance so much in so little time. No, we'll not. Not even in 100 years we won't. If Kubrick was a genius he would have not taken into consideration only the evolution theory but tried to listen to some other principles, like those of what I said earlier in this review. But... no we're gonna evolve beyond our comprehension. Good luck with that one.So basically what Stanley Kubrick tried to show was something that even he couldn't understand it completely, so he just left room for guessing which in my opinion is a waste of a great potential movie, with great special effects.Only a 7 from me, and that's mainly for the amazing special effects and that computer character that brilliantly evil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring and slow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I saw this years back and bought it on Bluray to watch it again. For me its still boring and slow and I am one who likes Sci Fi, one reason why I gave it 2 instead of 1 stars. I guess you have to really believe this is an artsy movie and read all the BS commentary by the critics to believe this movie is worth watching. There are many parts that are without any dialog, some very silent without any sound, several times you might think your TV is on mute, but the reality is that the movie was designed that way. Having seen several of Kubrick's movies, I cannot say any were very good and for me this is a major dud. But hey, if you find watching paint dry to be exciting, this movie may be ideal for you. For those looking for a bit more entertainment or perhaps a plot that makes sense, look somewhere else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm 23 and finally got around to watching 2001 for the first time last year...I had lent it to a friend who watched it before me and returned it to me along with the complaint that it was the biggest waste of time he'd ever spent.I didn't hesitate to get it watched and see what the fuss was about and I have never disagreed with someone as much. I absolutely loved it; the cinematography, the music, the (truly) epic-ness, the nostalgic-yet-unaging feel, the tension and unease throughout parts 2 and 3, the mystery and interpretativeness, the depth and the hidden meanings. Silence is used more effectively in 2001 than in any movie I'd ever experienced, the most chilling being when Dave is awaiting HAL's response to open the pod-bay doors. The universe I watched within that movie was more believable than 99% of anything else I'd ever seen.Never had I seen a movie that seemed so much a form of art.Everyone needs to see this movie.I still obsess over it, it has become my favourite sci-fi film, arguably my favourite over ALL genres. I'm constantly at odds trying to persuade my other friends to watch it with me. I'm just awaiting the day I can see it on a big screen the way it was meant to be watched.(A word of warning though, I can understand why some people would find it boring as there are long moments of panning shots, floating ships and no dialogue. I personally could have watched twice the amount more of it, but that's how art is, some can grasp and appreciate it, others can't.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Clinical to be Engaging</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>According to legend, during the premiere of 2001, Rock Hudson walked out of the screening yelling "Will someone tell me what the hell this movie is about?" Today I feel his frustration. Is the movie a marvel? Yes. Is this film ambitious? Yes. In the words of Bernardo Bertolucci a film "made in poetry instead of prose?" Yes. An entertaining film? Well...define entertaining. For while those on its wavelength would certainly benefit from having watched what is still regarded as not just a gold standard in science fiction but the ONLY standard in science fiction, others not inclined to watch ten minutes of flickering, tunneled lights shouldn't bother. My unbiased mind tells me I have just watched something near perfect, yet my biased, more affecting senses yen for something a little more emotionally rewarding.I honestly find 2001: A Space Odyseey to be prosaic. Stifled from the movie's top-heavy ambitions and need for perfection that it cannot register on an emotional level; at least not to me. It justifies itself by sending a message about technological society and how one day we will move beyond the tools we use to a higher form of consciousness.It's a message worth postulating and the midriff of the film properly highlights the movie's motif of said tools used for mutually assured destruction versus self-discovery but can't we encompass these themes into a tighter package? Then again I suppose if the film's point was introduced in familiar wrapping it would be easily digestible but also easily forgettable.Stanley Kubrick's work as a whole just doesn't hold much sway with me. His earlier work like The Killing (1956), Paths of Glory (1957) and Spartacus (1960) are to me, the perfect balance between intellectually stimulating and emotionally satisfying. Dr. Strangelove (1964), A Clockwork Orange (1971) Full Metal Jacket (1987) have their moments if only for their macabre sense of humor but 2001 along with Barry Lyndon (1975) and Eyes Wide Shut (1999) remain in my eyes, Kubrick at his most aloof.http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A landmark train wreck of a film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, this a very slow movie. Don't mistake a slow pace for art. Although it starts off very intriguing, the movie is a train wreck towards the end. It makes no sense, and yet it is praised for being visionary exactly because it makes no sense. It undermines the achievements of mankind and attributes them to a vastly superior species. Humans are depicted as boring, sterile, pitiable creatures with no souls. HAL on the other hand is more human than any actual human on screen, albeit misguided. If you cut out the monolithic black rectangles and everything after HAL is deactivated, you would be left with a decent movie, but as whole the movie only satisfies the "artists" who can't explain why it is a good movie, it "just is". Call me crazy, but I don't find a film that mocks humanity tasteful or entertaining. All in all, you will probably like this if you like the Rocky Horror Picture Show. For everyone else, it's OK to watch once so you are familiar with a landmark film, regardless of if it deserves to be or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2001 - A Prophecy About US Foreign Policy and the Need to Change It?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Former liberal Democrat US Congressman Dennis Kucinich has tied the significance of Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey" to the aftermath of the destruction of the twin towers of the World Trade Centre in New York. (If you want read it in his own words, google, 'Dennis Kucinich Restoring Hope for America's Future Through Developing a Culture of Peace" )Kucinich suggests that the frenzied celebration of the ape-men victors after the battle over the rights to the water hole at the start of the film is not dissimilar to the feelings of national pride by US citizens after the President George W Bush "Iraq mission accomplished" speech. Kucinich goes on to suggest some more highly evolved response, such as an examination of mind set behind American foreign policy, would have been more appropriate. His sentiments are admirable, but he seems to ignore the significance of the recurring monolith of the film. His speech encompasses the reality of the destruction of two monoliths that actually occurred in 9/11/2001. But he seems to ignore the significance of the film's monolith, that appears to ape-men, the astronauts on the moon, and Dave, the astronaut seeking it on Jupiter but finding it in his own memories and life experience.The people at IMDb have done a stirling job in coalescing the various contributions of their reviewers and the reluctant explanations by Kubrick into a workable explanation of what the film is all about, but I am not totally satisfied in what they have come up with. The conclusion seems to be that higher beings have placed a monolithic receiver on earth, an amplifier on the moon and a signal transmitter on Jupiter, to enable mankind to become more like them. Or, as Kubrick put it..."the hero is taken into a stargate - another dimension - into the presence of godlike entities - creatures of pure energy...his life passes before him... And he's reborn...(in a) room made of his own memoriesSounds like all those tired old UFO theories. I find the Kucinich explication more satisfying, but the problem of the missing monolith remains. So I sought my own interpretation in the life experience of Kubrick. I visited with Wikipedia to get some grist for the mill of my own heretical concoction.Kubrick's agent, Sam Jaffe, fled the madness of the 1950's McCarthy House UnAmerican Activities Committee, and settled in London in 1959. Three years later, in 1962, Kubrick moved to England to film Lolita "because of easier financing and freedom from censorship".He found a very pleasant working environment, moved into a castle and never left the place...In 1964 he transformed a novel about nuclear war ( Red Alert) into the satirical film Dr. Strangelove According to his biographer, LoBrutto and others, "Kubrick was taking a bold and dangerous leap", as the topic at that time was "considered taboo" and "hardly socially acceptable"...The film stirred up much controversy and mixed opinions- a "discredit and even contempt for our whole defense establishment . . . the most shattering sick joke I've ever come across"...Historian and philosopher Lewis Mumford, decades later, "saluted" Kubrick for "having successfully utilized the only method capable of evading our national censor?relentless but hilarious satire" Kubrick himself once stated: "A satirist is someone who has a very skeptical view of human nature, but who still has the optimism to make some sort of a joke out of it. However brutal that joke might be."Could "2001: A Space Odyssey" be a prophetic but similarly black exposition of the way in which the USA has degraded the admirable ideas of its founding fathers into the ape-man like violent aggression of its modern day rulers?Could HAL, the computer, be acting in accordance with its programmers and their masters at the US Pentagon and State Department along with unpleasant cast of sociopaths Oliver Stone depicted in his film "JFK"? "In the recorded message which plays after Dave has "lobotomized" HAL, Dr. Floyd reveals the computer has known the nature of the mission all along"Was HAL's error a programmed precondition to killing the crew?Could the 'powers that be' have decreed that people who seek some higher, better way of organizing society - the Kucinich quest if you will - should be blasted off into deep space and disposed of quietly, beyond the prying eyes of social/political critics and other malcontents?.Could the black monolith be a symbolic depiction of being "born again", not in the debauched meaning given to that term by evangelical "Christians", but in some purer, more aesthetic , more ethical way. " Kubrick and Clarke studied Joseph Campbell's book, The Hero with a Thousand Faces, in order to find inspiration. From this mythological perspective, the hotel room (On Jupiter at the film's conclusion) can be seen as a symbolic womb where the hero goes through the process of death and rebirth - an essential part of the hero myth "The post-production of the film obviously influenced George Lucas in manufacturing his Star Wars trilogy and in the Joseph Campbell thesis that the human stories deal with...1 The hero's departure from home on a spiritual quest, in the company of a mentor, and often with a brief stopover "room" to gain extra powers. Think of the first Star Wars film2 A death-rebirth atoning experience of reconciliation with a father figure. Think "The Empire Strikes Back"3 The return of the enlightened hero to the world. Think "The Return of the Jedi"I would like to expand upon this thesis, but IMDb space restrictions prohibit me from doing so. If you are interested google, "star wars peter henderson"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning but overrated space adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey is often titles as one of the best movies in the world and the landmark movie of Stanley Kubrick. The visual look of the film is stunning and the plot is ahead of its time. It is hard to believe that the movie came out as early as 1968. Still my opinion is that the movie is far too slow. There are many ridiculously long scenes without any true purpose. Some people have proposed to just relax and enjoy the scenes but my opinion is that the movie cannot be counted as a movie in that case. Also some people have praised using drugs and watching this movie under their effect. I don't think a movie can be judged as a masterpiece if it requires you to be high to be able to get through with it. That's why, although the movie was visually and technically stunning and far ahead of it's time, I dare to disagree calling it as the perfect and one of the best movies in the world although it is definitely better than average. The music created a good atmosphere to the film and the moaning sound of these strange stones were brilliant and chilling. The biggest downside was the famous "intercourse" scene that I find to be absolutely unnecessary to the movie. I disagree in every aspect calling it as a brilliant move. Finally the famous "lsd-scene" was just way too over length watch and my interest to the movie died over there. As a shorter scene I could have called is as visually great but the total length of the scene was just ridiculous. Kubrick might be a stunning director that fights against the mainstream movies but I find 2001: A Space Odyssey is far too overrated movie. If the criteria for a masterpiece movie is that you need to be high to get impressed from it, then I could agree that this movie is a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2001: A Space Odyssey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The top 6 reasons why "2001: A Space Odyssey" is my favorite movie:1. The visual effects are stunning for it's time, 1968. Several Science Fiction movies have borrowed directly from 2001, including Star Wars; just compare the looks of the Imperial Cruisers in SW and the Odyssey in 2001.2. The details and accuracy are splendid. 3. The music ? all classical tracks - add a unique touch to 2001. Basically, the more alien the scenery, the more mystical and atonal the music.4. The lack of narration adds to the mystery of 2001, leaving the audience to speculate about the meaning of everything.5. Most scenes in space are very slow, adding realism. Also, when Dave and Frank go EVA, you can only hear their breathing and the hiss of gasses flowing into the space-suit. It feels like you are in space yourself!6. All human characters are flat and bored, whereas HAL9000, the super computer, has the most vivid personality of all. I believe this reflects both Clarke's tendency to focus on the Science rather than humans, and Kubricks cynical look on humanity.All in all, a fantastic movie, still! TEN STARS!!!The sequel, "2010: The Year We Make Contact" (or "2010: Odyssey Two" as the title for the novel) is a worthy film in itself. However, it is completely different in style and feel, and rightly so. I guess Hyams who directed it did not make an attempt to make it similar to 2001 in any sense. A wise decision, I think...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great art dates badly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can imagine going to the cinema in 1968 to watch 2001 and being blown away by its aural and visual power. I can imagine the wonder and beauty of seeing these strange and majestic images of spaceships and other worlds on a big screen and coming away feeling like my imagination had been expanded.Unfortunately, I watched the film in the 21st century, and in truth 2001 has about the same power now as a silent film of an oncoming train. Both must have had an incredible effect upon their audience in their day. Undoubtedly there is a whole generation of film-makers who were inspired by 2001, but that generation has already come and gone, and they popularised and extended its breakthroughs so successfully that the progenitor looks primitive in their wake. Its much vaunted beauty is circumscribed by how dated and simple its models and sets appear by modern standards, and by the audience's familiarity with science fiction cinema that has shown them similar things a thousand times already.2001 is deliberately paced to allow the viewer to luxuriate in the cinematic spectacle, but its spectacle is built on the shock of the new, and when what it has to offer is no longer new or shocking, the result is a film that drags. Moreover, when the visual element is no longer overpowering, and the audience just sees obviously plastic models floating about, it unbalances the film. The soundtrack no longer matches the majesty of the visuals; instead it overwhelms it and deafens the audience with its bombast.2001 is a product of its time, deliberately so. It leans on its effects in the same way some modern blockbusters lean on CGI. That it is dressed up in auteur clothing does not change the fact, and it results in a film that is badly dated. Its continued critical lionisation speaks to the problem criticism always has separating impact and influence from objective quality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You have to let this film "happen" to you as a "right-brained" experience, and then it becomes "the ultimate trip" as it was originally intended!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this film back in 1969, I'm sure that I was as bewildered and disappointed as virtually everyone else in the cinema that cold Friday night.I was hoping that this film would be an exciting, big-budgeted Science Fiction film about a trip to the planet Jupiter, under the ever watchful control of a sophisticated on-board computer named the HAL-9000.The main reason for my bewilderment was the fact that the story (and it does have a story) is told in such an extremely minimal way, with so few dialog and "action" scenes, that it needs to be viewed as a "right brain" experience rather than a "left brained" one. By "right brain" I mean that the film is basically one that relies totally on "visuals" rather than on "left brained", logical dialog scenes.This is one film in which you really need to use your "intuition" in order to appreciate what is happening from moment to moment. You need to do away with the need for dialog scenes, and let the film's visuals just "wash all over you" until you become immersed in their utter brilliance of execution.You have to let the film "happen" to you, and, if you do, then it becomes as it was originally advertised to be: "the ultimate trip"! This all seems so hard to believe now, because since then, this film has become one of my all time Top Ten Films, and I named it Best Film of 1968 (the year it was made) because, if you look at most of the films made that year, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY stands head and shoulders above them all.The film starts with a section called, THE DAWN OF MANKIND, and shows a group of apes before, and then after, they make contact with a mysterious black monolith that makes its appearance near a watering hole they congregate near. This monolith makes a few more startling appearances as the film progresses.After contact with this imposing monolith, the apes seem to gain "intelligence", and one of them takes the giant leap into being able to take one of the bones of a dead animal, and then use it as weapon to kill another animal! That's some leap in intelligence, isn't it??!! So, immediately we can sense that this monolith is not all wonderful and it has its bad side.Then, without too much warning, we are thrust immediately into the year 2001, and we see a gigantic space station rotating around the earth. On the soundtrack we can hear the opening strains of Johann Strauss' beautiful piece of music, THE BLUE DANUBE.Thus begins one of the most amazing sequences ever put on film: the giant space station rotates ever so gracefully, and the special effects are totally believable as we truly feel we are in outer space, looking down at our beautiful planet Earth. Geoffrey Unsworth's excellent cinematography, the special effects and the Strauss background music score all combine to make the first great impression on our "right brain" I mentioned earlier.For me, I find it almost impossible not to enjoy this particular sequence of the film because I love the use of special effects in films, and these are definitely "special" effects that genuinely enhance the film's sense of "place". In other words: where we are at the moment. In this instance: we're in outer space, gliding in tandem with the gigantic space station.Because of the magic this scene generates, we do not need "left brained" dialog for this sequence. In fact, dialog, and even a few sound effects, would have ruined it and it would have been too jarring and disruptive. The soundtrack music puts us in the correct mood immediately because it is so relaxing, and yet, so upbeat at the same time. Or is the director, Stanley Kubrick, giving the audience a sense of false security? Because we feel so comfortable with this wonderful music playing on the soundtrack, we do not think that there is any need for us to be alarmed, which in fact we need to be later on in the film when the all-controlling HAL-9000 computer reveals its true nature.From this point onwards, the film starts to gather some much needed momentum, and we soon discover that one of those monoliths has been found on the Moon. And it seems that someone (or some thing?) from outer space is sending the Earth messages in the form of these black monoliths, but Earthlings are not apparently smart enough to comprehend these messages as yet!! A new section begins gently and we are then thrust peacefully into another section, set some time much later: VOYAGE TO JUPITER. From here on we are part of the mini-drama that evolves between the two astronauts, Dave Bowman and Frank Poole, when the HAL-9000 computer gets a bit too sneaky and starts to sabotage this all important journey because it is too important for possible "human error". Maybe HAL's the one who has been organizing the placement of the black monoliths on Earth and in space.It's a thought, and at least this film makes you think.All of Stanley Kubrick's films have, in one way or another, divided his fans and his critics: people seemed to either love these films or hate them. So, in that way, Kubrick was always a complete "master" of keeping the public guessing, and thinking.And he kept this ability all his working life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still one of the best- and certainly most unique, thought provoking science-fiction movie out there.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"2001: A Space Odyssey" is truly a milestone in the history of filmmaking. It showed the possibilities of what you could do with the science-fiction genre, besides having aliens trying to conquer the Earth. It showed that there was a reason as to why the word science is in science-fiction. But not only just story-wise is this a great movie within its genre but also technically. It really is one of the most complex movies you'll ever see, which is however mostly simply because it leaves up a lot to your own interpretation. To me the movie has always been about the evolution of mankind. Every time the human species comes across a monolith, it marks a step forward in its evolution. But the movie never explains where the monoliths come from, or what it truly does. Does it come from space? Or perhaps it's a sign from God! It never turns into a religion versus science discussion but instead leaves everything completely open to your own interpretation. This especially goes for its ending, which director Stanley Kubrick and writer Arthur C. Clarke themselves didn't even had a real explanation for.It's actually really one of the oddest movies ever made, once you really start thinking about it. It's really not a movie with a clear, beginning, middle and end in it. Instead it could be divided into different acts, of which most of them are involving different characters. Yet everything still feels perfectly connected and in perfect harmony with each other because the movie always remains consistent with its pacing and style. The action moments are not shot and edited any faster than its mystery moments and its science-fiction elements are not any more or any less exciting than its more horror-like moments.Yes, I think "2001: A Space Odyssey" actually has a great horror vibe to it as well! This is all thanks to HAL 9000, who basically is one of the best horror characters of all time, even though the movie itself is of course far from a conventional horror movie. Thing that makes HAL 9000 so great and such a scary character is that he is nothing more but a red light-bulb, who is yet more and more starting to show strange human tendencies. He is so unpredictable and also incredibly powerful, since he can basically control the entire spaceship, which all makes him a quite scary and threatening character.Visually and also especially technically this is a great movie. Most of the effects in this movie were thought up and created specifically for this movie and even now days they are still great- and convincing looking. But I especially love the realistic approach of all of its science-fiction elements. It's a very detailed movie, that thought of about everything it seems. From how space-food would be like in the future, to space toilets and ways of how humans would communicated with each other and with computers.It's also really a movie that lets its images tell most of its story. The movie starts off without dialog and also the last part of the movie is completely without any dialog. Some people will be bothered by its slow pacing, while others will be fascinated by the way the movie is slowly being told and developed, without ever laying out things clearly for you. It's truly a thought provoking movie, that deserves your full attention, so just don't watch then when feeling tired or not in the mood.One of the many great and truly unique movies, from the brilliant but complicated Stanley Kubrick.10/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic in 68 but not so in 2011</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been going through many sci-fi movies in the past few years and I must say that this movie gave a lot of food for thought and context for all the sci-fi movies to follow. However if you are watching good sci-fi movies you may find this one quite on the low side. Firstly it is extremely slow and this movie could be done with in half the time...honestly at some point i had to move it fast forward not to fall asleep (some say it is the beauty of it...guys we live in a hectic pace our brains cannot tune in such a slow pace) Secondly graphics were absolutely magnificent for the time a real breakthrough to be honest... not so now though Plot: Now this is where it become so simplistic but credits to be given it prototyped in 68'*********** ********* *********** ********* SPOILER WARNING ********** ********** *********** ********** ********* ******* ********* ********* *********** ********* *********** *********The idea of a computer becoming a sentient being and try to control everything is a common theme in modern sci-fi and i think it all started with this move...however this becomes tiresome for those of us with sci-fi experience and maybe just maybe people in 68 did not understand what the monolith is all about and find the ending enigmatic... not at all... really not at all as it is nowadays so common as bread in sci-fi themes. The monolith represents a breakthrough in evolution and this is mentioned completely in the beginning of the movie where (man-apes) discover tools/weapons for the first time. The next big jump in evolution takes place with the second monolith - SIMPLE. He sees his body withering and ageing at an extreme pace only to be re-birthed as energy and may I add an extra-dimensional entity. Of course there are also somewhat hidden riddles to take into account. For example why HAL - a computer tries to take over and in the end destroyed? Although not obvious at first it is easy to decipher. It means our technology could be the end of us if we do not have a fail-safe mechanism to keep it in check. But also that machines cannot evolve faster than us. Yes they may get faster and calculate faster and predict outcomes more easily (as it was in the chess game) but in essence they lack our intuition, will and creativity that has developed in the human race through millions of years of evolution (experience). A consolidating factor that is... I give it a 6 out of respect for the era (if I watched it at 1968 I would probably give it a 10) but for 2011 it is not making it. So if you are wondering about the ending... well what can I say than to watch it again and open your mind to the impossible... This is after I watched only once and it was a fairly easy conclusion that Bowman has re-birthed as an entirely new entity which will define the next generation of "humanity" an extra-dimensional being of energy, who knows no past no future no present... Those notions have no value in a non-linear space-time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To those thinking this film is boring. Do you really think it is?? You should watch "Barry Lyndon" then - another "boring" film from Kubrick! There's no point in writing another review for this absolute masterpiece - more than enough has already been written by much more competent reviewers for those wishing to utilize their brain in order to comprehend and appreciate this amazing piece of art! I just wanted to point out, that somehow, the appreciation of "2001.." doesn't much depend on an education, smartness, intelligence, taste, skills and knowledge in arts, etc... I was trying to understand what kind of people like this film. I think I've found it: this film is loved by those asking questions. Not just questions - right questions. Those not just consuming answers, but also capable of filling gaps, connecting dots. If you're such a person - this films is right for you! Have a peasant watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Special Effects, Repetitive Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie in a high school class, and the teacher explained things along the way as we watched. The theme of the story is clear enough-big black monoliths are affecting humanity's evolution over time, starting with our primate ancestors learning to use objects rather than just hands and feet to fight and hunt, and immediately jumping into where we start exploring outer space. The astronauts who reach the Moon (remember the movie was made the year before we actually put men on it) see another monolith, but nothing evidently happens right away.Then there is the falling-out between HAL, the intelligent computer which runs the manned spaceship traveling further out into the solar system, and its human crew. It is unclear why this occurs, but the result is only one human crew member survives, and in the end...presumably he evolves into something greater than human. Whoever is behind the monoliths is never explained or hinted at.The special effects are spectacular for the era. The overall storyline, however, is not really deep. But this movie was made in the psychedelic era, so it works as a period piece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is perfect. Absolutely perfect. It's the closest I can think to a "cinematic experience". Yeah, in other movies, you're watching the action, in this movie, you are almost experiencing the action, the tension, the odyssey... it's amazing.The story is a mystery plot, in which the viewer has to figure out, along with the characters, what is going on, in midst of a chilling space adventure, in which the characters face a relentless force lurking them... it's incredible. I won't dare spoil anything to anyone, so, go check it out. This movie is the prime example of "show, don't tell". It's the most amazing visual experience you'll ever had. I watch it regularly, and the visual effect never get old. Why?, because the experience and the story are so well crafted, it makes the effects amazing every time, not like other movies (as Matrix) where the effects get old after the second view. There are deep questions, deep motifs, and a mysterious and epic finish... it's breath taking.When I think a movie works for me, I give it a 10 score. I wish I could give it more to this masterpiece. The finest hour of the genius of Stanley Kubrick.11/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A giant leap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kubrick's monolithic mid-period masterpiece is as remarkable as much for what it has NOT influenced in sci-fi filmmaking as what it has. So while special effects took a giant leap in 1968 (thanks in no small part to Douglas Trumball, who would give us a grim new world in 1982 with Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, the original ending to which made use of a series of helicopter shots lent by a certain Mr Kubrick), to this day we still have the sounds of swooshing of ships and zapping lasers in the vacuum of outer space. Then there is also the small matter of awe. Other than Andrei Tarkovsky's Solaris, it's hard to think of another example of a science fiction movie with such an unflinching commitment to spiralling wonder.And to think it all came from a (very) short story named The Sentinel - a tall tale about a pyramid-shaped creation half-buried on a Moon populated with "degenerate plants". (Well, it was written over 20 years before humans set foot on the thing.) Kubrick and Clarke's screenplay plonks this lunar discovery into the second act of a four-act epic. Long before that there is early, ape-like Man. The mysterious monolith appears to the Moon-Watcher and his flock, perhaps signalling the birth of religion. Jump-cut a couple million years (as you do) and the age of technology reigns - so Man is able to detect a magnetic anomaly on the Moon, which leads Heywood Floyd (William Sylvester) to our species' second audience with the strange black block. It's pointing toward Jupiter. So begins the third act, wherein astronauts Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Poole (Gary Lockwood) set sail for the great Red Eye, along with their infallible red-eyed companion, HAL, who represents the pinnacle of Man's technological endeavour. Paradoxically HAL also represents the limitations of technology, inadvertently highlighting the need for Man to transcend his current form. This paves the existential way for the final act, which sees Bowman enter a Jovian Stargate and undergo an exhilarating process of accelerated self-actualization. And then... well, my personal belief is that the final frame is the most profound image in cinema. No, in art.Clarke and Kubrick surround their characters with the clinical environment of technology, almost to the point of fetish - what delightful convenience, what intricate design! - only to strip it all away in the final reel, where some kind of apotheosis occurs in a cosmic hotel room decorated in the design of pre-electronic Earth. Luminous floor aside, we could be back in the time of Enlightenment.Much has been made of the technological prescience of Kubrick and co-writer Clarke. There is Heywood's video call to his daughter (Vivian Kubrick, who would go on to make the documentary The Making of The Shining, as well as score Full Metal Jacket). But look closer and you'll also notice that the screen is FLAT. And what are those contraptions Bowman and Poole use to watch the news on BBC 12? They look an awful lot like a certain popular tablet computer... This was 1968, remember.It's easy to throw around words like "pompous" and "pretentious" when viewing conceptual art. Clearly, if a viewer finds it does not affect them on an emotional level, then the natural defence is to attack the intentions of the artist. In the case of 2001: A Space Odyssey, not unlike the National Socialist Party's (mis)appropriation of Nietzsche's "Ubermensch", it is possible to read the Starchild as a god figure, or perhaps a blandly consoling religious promise of what is to become of us beyond our corporeal suffering. This is a perfectly reasonable interpretation, if argued intelligently. The key word here is "interpretation", made possible by the bold ambiguity of the text. Fanboy gushing and angry backlash are rendered equally irrelevant in the presence of the wellspring of true debate. Love it or hate it, 2001: A Space Odyssey has substance enough to furnish conversations for centuries to come.For all its grandeur and its intellectual rigidity, this is a warm, often amusing, deeply human film: a celebration of Man's practically infinite synaptic potential.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I said before it's a masterpiece. It's the best movie that I have ever seen.After seeing this movie I was blown away. I never really knew that I liked allegorical movies, but this movie has blown me away.It's hard to believe this movie is 42 years old. The visuals are just amazing most today's movies don't have visuals like this movie does.Another thing that I was amazed by this movie is simplicity. It doesn't have many dialogs most of the time you only hear noises(which are very important part of this movie). It's truly what a movie should be. This movie doesn't think for you it encourages you to think for yourself. This movie is truly addictive. After seeing it once I wanted more because It can be very different in your mind every time you watch it. I think this movie should be studied at high schools because it's very meaningful and let's face it It's the digital age children doesn't read books anymore. This movie is very brilliant and it would truly fit into the educational program. Once that happens this movie will definitely be on the list.It's truly a masterpiece which has to seen by every thinking man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intelligent masterpiece, victim of its own greatness ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001 is the perfect example of a movie I wanted -as a movie fan- to love but I couldn't, I didn't hate it either and I still consider HAL-9000's part as one of the most thrilling sequences from any Sci-Fi film.A strange feeling inhabits me when I watch this film, I feel so alone that it's like it tunnels me into the deepest side of my soul, which is my innate condition as a mortal and my instinctive fear of death. The death scene in this movie is the greatest depiction of whatever death would look like, a hypnotically scary immensity of nothingness, that's what space is all about : death. 2001 is a movie about space, space as death, death as loneliness, and loneliness as our Human Condition.There's no eating, no feeling, no loving, no caring in this films, even the 'little girl' sequence seems so 'badly done', I mean unlike Kubrick's usual work, these things that are so important for us, poor mortal souls, seem so futile and pointless in 2001, because space is death. But space is also synonym of escape and quest, quest for immortality by escaping our human condition, it's like the key of 'immortality' is our dehumanization, a dream impossible to reach, because the alternative of our mortality isn't depicted as being a machine, but being a God-like figure, like Dave, when he was "terminating" Hal-9000.God created men in his own image like men created HAL, the most intelligent creature/creation after man, but HAL exploited his own intelligence to kill his own creator, like men use their powers to kill God by killing the spirit of God that lives in their hearts, the spirit of God being the emotions, the feelings, love, compassion, everything that separate us from animals. I've always considered the relationship between Dave and HAL as an allegory of our humanity, and that's what makes the movie so depressing and pessimistic, our humanity is characterized by our intelligence, a double-edged sword, and our feelings so useless (in Dave's situation) when compared to the cold and monolithic death, this duality, feelings and intelligence is what makes things happen whereas death is nothing but nothingness and immobility, and unfortunately, it's the only certitude (even the existence of God is debatable)The movie is an invitation to contemplate a death-like world that would strongly remind us of our human condition, it's a quest for an unreachable immortality, because as powerful as we are, we can't become God, like HAL failed to become the only Master of the Vessel, becoming a machine is renouncing to our feelings, which is the key for self-destruction and annihilation of the humanity, and feelings are as useless as a drop of water in the desert of fate, Dave lived a long time but ultimately died. But as useless as feelings are and as dangerous as intelligence is, they're our most precious assets, what characterizes us the most as human, we can't become God, we can't become machines, we're only humans and our future is nothing less than our origins, our quest for immortality lead us to reconsider our conditions as mortal, but also highlights our miraculous condition as living creatures, life is a miracle, death implies life and vice versa, the beautiful shot of the fetus at the end invites us to forget about our individual death but think of us as an 'immortal' species, as an extraordinary civilization that reached immortality through intelligence combined with feelings : culture, ideas, arts, creations, beauty and Universality. The key of Immortality is Universality, to think of ourselves as humans, not as individuals since the Creator is the only immortal individuality, we can become God-like only as a collectivity, as the Humanity, Creator of its own Civilization.The movie is a masterpiece, one of the most intelligent and probably the most universal films ever made, (why intelligent? because it makes so many points with a few dialogs and action) but it is victim of its own greatness because Kubrick couldn't make his point in a different way, he's a great director and found the right tone, and the perfect visuals ... that's why I felt bored so many times, Death is a hypnotically scary immensity of nothingness, the movie had a hypnotic beauty, was thrilling and scary during the HAL's sequence, was immense by its dimension, beauty and philosophical value and many times, there was just emptiness, nothing special happened, because that's the way it is, sometimes, nothing DOES happen and in death, nothing will ever happen. The point of the movie, was its strength and its strength was its weakness. There are so many beautiful shots in this film, so many stunning sequences, an incredible score, but it was impossible for the movie to be so universally intelligent and entertaining in the same time.The Beauty of 2001 is like men's intelligence, a double edged sword, and its genius is as unreachable as immortality... all I can say is that I "get" it, but I can't get it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A meditative journey into the nature of our existence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hands down, and without a shadow of a doubt, 2001: A Space Odyssey is the greatest science-fiction picture ever made. Even if something similar is attempted today, it will inevitably still be streets behind Stanley Kubrick's influential masterpiece. After making a name for himself with classic films such as Paths of Glory (1957), Lolita (1962) and Dr. Strangelove (1964), Kubrick bolstered and cemented his reputation as one of the greatest filmmakers ever to grace our planet with the release of 2001, at a time when space exploration looked real and promising.2001 is a meditative journey into the nature of our existence. Kubrick explores many themes, most notably that of existentialism, man versus machine, and the cycle of life. At the beginning of the film, the director brings us back into the prehistoric age when humans looked like apes. The quest for survival slowly turns violent, from getting food and avoiding predators to forming "clans" to fight against each other for territorial rights.This is greatly juxtaposed with colonized space, which forms the bulk of 2001's remaining two hours. In one of the most stunning jump cuts ever, we see an ape-human throw a bone up into the bright sky and as gravity pulls it down in one swift motion, it suddenly becomes an image of a satellite (shaped like that bone) floating in dark, infinite (and gravity-less) space. In that mind-blowing split moment, Kubrick hurtles us thousands of years into the future.Colonizing space ironically leads to even deeper isolation. And this is felt by two crewmen onboard a manned flight to Jupiter. Actually, the phrase "manned flight" is misleading because the huge spacecraft they are in is completely controlled by a powerful and error-proof intelligent computer called HAL. Now, Kubrick plays on the man versus machine theme with devastating consequences for both sides. Reliance on technology could be a boon or a bane, and till this day, there isn't a film every year that does not ignite the hot debate over this.A final major theme of 2001 is the concept of the ever-continuing life cycle of human existence. The final sequence in which an astronaut finds himself inside a coldly detached room somewhere in space and sees the physical image of himself ? a frail, old man having a meal, and then dying on a bed ? not only provokes thought about the transient nature of life, but also asks of the question: Is there more to life after death?Kubrick seems to argue in the positive by presenting to us the blissful image of a star child overlooking the universe. Does it symbolize reincarnation, the continuation of the cycle of life? Or being one with the Creator? Or immortality? Up until then, and much so to his credit, Kubrick has not explicitly brought in ideas about religion, though one can argue that "the monolith", a rectangular grey block made of an unknown inert material that appears in four key moments in the film, is simultaneously a symbol of mystery, and the ultimate black box containing all the answers to our existence. In other words, "the monolith" could be God.2001 features Kubrick's unique melding of imagery and motion to the sound of classical music. Man-made space objects rotate and float across the length of the screen, as slow as the director would allow them to move so as to imitate the reality of motion in space. Working together with the famous Arthur C. Clarke (who co-wrote the screenplay), Kubrick brings astounding realism to his craftwork, building models of space objects to their finest details, and winning his only competitive Oscar in his career for Best Special Visual Effects.Kubrick's strong eye for visual symmetry (where props are placed and spaced equally) is also apparent and this would later go on to be a hallmark of his visual style in films like A Clockwork Orange (1971), and The Shining (1980), influencing a new generation of filmmakers including Paul Thomas Anderson (There Will Be Blood, 2007) and Duncan Jones (Moon, 2009).Perhaps the only drawback of 2001 is its very slow pace, which may frustrate on the first viewing (I felt the same way too). However, its snail-like pace will suit subsequent viewings better, especially when appreciation for Kubrick's craftsmanship, direction, and filmic vision mature with time. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a towering achievement, a science-fiction masterpiece that will never be equaled. It just might be Kubrick's greatest contribution to cinema.SCORE: 10/10 www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com All rights reserved!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Visually, "2001" haunts imagination. The special effects and scientific realism ground the unique iconography of this singular film.Nevertheless, either "2001" is one of the greatest films I have seen or a trivial failure. My prejudice is for the first option. The one element that counters this judgement is the notion that the monolith somehow shaped evolutionary emergence. That distracts from an otherwise flawless film narrative. If one puts the monolith aside, the film narrative and iconography are highly tensive open to polyvalent interpretations and experiences.Director Kubrick reveals how we hypnotize ourselves with technics that are in essence projections of our evolved nature. One manifestation of such technics is artificial intelligence and the nature of what is human. By some sort of legerdemain, Mr. Kubrick makes us feel pity for "the death" or shutting down of a computer more than we felt for the death of human beings. Realising this is chilling. My favourite moment in the movie is a slight facial movement of a pilot of the space station to moon space ship as it is about to land. I do think that this film is sexist. Layers of symbol and surrealistic play enrich multiple viewings. Members of the department of philosophy at my old school, I have heard, dismissed classes to discuss meanings of this film. I think it unfair to compare too closely this film with the equally haunting "Blade Runner". They are parallel tracks. With the exception I made, "2001" remains a coherent work--a masterwork.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2001: A Space Mediocrity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Looking through the reviews on IMDb, 2001: A Space Odyssey is a mixed bag. Either you completely hate it, or you love it to bits. Rarely do you find a six out of ten stars review: most of the time, it gets either one or two stars, or nine or ten stars. Many positive reviewers argue that the people who hate the film 'miss the point', and on the flipside, most haters argue that there is no point to miss. Seeing as I had to watch it for a school project, reading the reviews made my expectations drop. When my group and I chose it, I thought it was going to be a badass science-fiction film with explosions and stuff. Boy, was I wrong?More often than not, when there are reviewers arguing there is 'deep meaning' to any media, whether it be books, albums or films, it ends up being pretentious twaddle. Especially in music (my favourite form of media). Therefore, I was slightly apprehensive of watching this film, even though I had to.But less about me and more about the film. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a 1968 film directed by Stanley Kubrick. It is widely considered a classic, but most people I have asked think it is really boring. That is because it moves way too slowly. A lot of the scenes are awfully stretched for no apparent reason; half of this film could be taken out and you would still be able to get the basic gist of what is going on ('understanding' the film is something else). Character development and plot advancement is pretty sparse, as is dialogue, which means that you are bound to get bored at least once during the viewing.Fortunately, almost everything in life has good sides and bad sides. The good, the extremely good even, side of this film is the audiovisual side. At the time, I imagine the visuals were absolutely stunning, and they still are today, so that speaks volumes. Especially the settings, i.e. the spaceships and planets, are very well done. The specifics of these spaceships, when examined, are very well thought out in terms of realism. The special effects used are also brilliant, and while you certainly should not watch the film for the visuals alone, they are very nice to look at regardless.But not only is it a treat to the eye, it is also a treat to the ear: music is applied to its fullest in this film, going from easy-going classical music in the one boring scene, to eerie, chant-like music in the next. The film is intended to be more of an audial rather than a visual experience and it clearly shows in its creative soundtrack. The sound is where the film shines and while it does not always make it less of a boring experience it still shows clear signs of having been thought of thoroughly. Again, the sound also demonstrates knowledge of science on the part of the director, since he has taken into account the fact that there is no sound in Outer Space and has implemented that in the film accordingly, unlike other science-fiction films that get all flashy in Space with explosions and all that sort of thing, even though that is not even possible. It is these small details that really make you appreciate it just that bit more. While you may not enjoy the film, at least you can acknowledge that a great amount of time and effort went into its realization. The music used in this film is never unfitting and always stays relevant. All the sounds used in this film are used for a reason?all the sounds in this film relate to what is going on on the screen?and even the voice of the computer, HAL9000, the slightest detail, has been considered. You would never find a dark scene with happy-go-lucky, upbeat tunes. A lot of the music and sounds used are still used to similar effect today, such as Johann Strauss' waltz An der schönen blauen Donau. Especially the opening theme, Richard Strauss' Also sprach Zarathustra is commonly associated with the film.The application of sound in this film is truly remarkable and saves it from being absolutely terrible, elevating it up to mediocre. Had it not been as good as it is, the visuals alone would not be enough of a redeeming factor to make it worthwhile. Even though I did not personally enjoy it, it rightfully deserves its place as an influential classic and is indeed mandatory viewing, regardless of the fact that it is boring. Undoubtedly it has influenced countless films in the genre and outside of the genre, and even if you are not a connoisseur of films, you can definitely feel its influence in other media as well. Overall, this film loses points for its duration to content ratio but gains points for its stunning visuals and brilliant audio putting it at a mediocre five out of ten stars, certainly not becoming of what is supposed to be a classic and not quite living up to my initial expectations, but if it were cut short by about an hour the film would be a brilliant watch. As I mentioned before, though, I still believe that it is mandatory viewing and I am sure there are some who would appreciate the slow pacing of the film. Just save yourself some money and rent it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Triumph In Film-making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So much has been said about "2001: A Space Odyssey" and how revolutionary it is. To this day, it's still considered one of the greatest films of all time. It deserves this honor, as I was blown away by it. I was expecting something completely different, and that's what I got. "2001" is a film that challenges you, it's not a film that caters to the masses and it's not a film that talks down to its audience. It's a film that challenges you and asks you to accept scenes that most people would normally write off as "amateur" or "boring".The opening twenty minutes, the "Dawn of Man" scenes, are marvelous. The cinematography is already great, and the film hasn't gone into space yet. Prior to these scenes are the opening credits and the overture. The overture alone got me excited as the film began. "Thus Spoke Zarathustra", despite the fact that it was cemented in many people's brains, was perfectly used in the film.I see the film as a perception on evolution. The Dawn of Man shows us the early evolution with the apes. At the end of the film, I see it as "Even in the future, we are still evolving". The opening sequence with the apes was all great. Many might write it off as boring, but I was intrigued by it, if you get the meaning of these scenes.Once we get into outer space and the future, lengthy sequences of spacecraft and groundbreaking special effects appear before our eyes set to classical music, in a beautiful and grand manner. "The Blue Danube" was perfect for this film.Now for me, I think a good film needs a story and characters. "2001" definitely had one. While we have the entire story of the monolith, the film becomes more intriguing once we get into the HAL 9000 act. HAL 9000 might be one of the best antagonists in film history. Is he really a villain? It was a malfunction. What he did was a result of a computer malfunction. For me, a villain must be truly evil with evil intentions, but I personally see HAL 9000 as more of an obstacle for the five astronauts, especially David Bowman.After the climatic scene where David disconnects HAL, the film then shifts to one of the most amazing scenes in film history, the "Star Gate" sequence. What comes before you is an extravaganza of color and visual effects. Finally, we see David getting older, which was probably one of my favorite scenes in the film. Then David becomes the "Star-Child". A spectacular ending. I see the monolith as an object that somewhat inspires evolution, as it ties the entire film together.According to those who have read the novel version released simultaneously with the film, there was more of a story and a narrative. But the film is more of an experience than anything, a film that challenges audiences and to this day, it still confuses many. There are some out there who say they just didn't get it or they were bored by it. "2001: A Space Odyssey" is triumphant film that asks a lot out of you. You are asked to accept lengthy scenes of apes, long scenes of spacecraft and classical music, and many other drawn-out sequences. I loved every second of it.A 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie. It was a mix of good acting, philosophy, and special effects. There was no smoking, no sex, and maybe one or two scenes where they were drinking but you couldn't tell if it was water or alcohol. The questions it asked were fundamental. Kubrick Foreshadowed what has come to pass: Computers rule the world. He was asking that if it's bad with humans, imagine a computer that runs the world, makes a mistake and doesn't want to admit it's wrong?. It would be like living with an electronic Hitler. There was also no violence. This showed that a movie can entertain and not have any of that crap in it and the industry doesn't want to admit it. This one succeeded because it didn't pander to the young people but was aimed at adults.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly landmark achievement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey is one of the great examples of cinematic art. Images and sound are combined faultlessly to tell a story that is simultaneously very simple and extremely abstract. Although there are some enormous concepts at the heart of this movie, equally important is how aesthetically and aurally beautiful it all is.The film opens with the epic sound of Richard Strauss's Thus Spoke Zarathustra, which heralds the alignment of the planets in the solar system in a single unbroken line. This unique stellar occurrence signals the first interaction of the mysterious extra-terrestrial beings with the inhabitants of planet Earth. This is the Dawn of Man. The moment at which an alien hand subtly interacts with the primitive life on our planet and sets a seed that will ultimately lead them on the way to technological advancement and through that to an understanding of the universe that will prepare them for the next level of evolution. The way in which these mysterious beings kick-start this human advancement is simplicity itself. They plant a giant black rectangular monolith in their midst. This completely unnatural edifice has a curious effect on the primitive creatures who encounter it. The appearance of the razor sharp lines and perfect symmetry of the dimensions, along with the strange feeling of touching its un-naturally flat surface has an odd effect on these ape-men. It is a trigger. It is the first time these primitive minds have been forced to experience an abstract thought. The very exposure to something so alien and unnatural forces them to start viewing their world in a slightly different way, firstly leading to the use of bones as weaponry. Soon these meek creatures are the masters of their land and on their way to complete dominance of their planet.The natural result of this process is technological advancement and this leap forward is illustrated with one of the most audacious edits in film history when the first man made tool ? a bone ? is inter-cut with an example of a highly complex human construction: a spaceship. The point has been made that high-level human technological advancement has resulted as a direct consequence of the first encounter with the mysterious black monolith. At this point it becomes clear that Kubrick is using music very specifically. As we watch the space-transporter float through space and dock with the revolving space-station the music that soundtracks this is Johann Strauss's The Blue Danube. This beautiful, complex piece of classical music indicates aurally the advancement of man too, in terms of high artistic cultural achievement. This is in direct contrast to the avant-garde music that plays whenever the alien presence is felt. This mysterious experimental wall of sound perfectly invokes an alien intelligence. It builds up to a crescendo every time the monolith appears; climaxing unforgettably in the trip through the star-gate. This music simply represents alien interaction.It has to be said at this point too that the design work used for both the exterior and interior of the spacecrafts in 2001 is exemplary and frankly has not aged in the 40 years plus since the film's initial release; a remarkable fact considering the advances in special effects. There is something still undeniably beautiful and fantastic about how the hardware is presented in this film. This leads on to another of the key themes ? what happens when man-made technology becomes so advanced that it starts to develop its own consciousness. When HAL decides to take over the mission to Jupiter in an icily cold and deadly way, this question is posed directly. And the answer is that mankind has to be very careful with technology, as the results could be deadly. In the same way as Man is shaped by the aliens, HAL is created by Man, and, similarly, it has a propensity to murder if the situation requires it.After the man vs. technology segment the film enters its final act. This is the famous star gate sequence where the final surviving astronaut, Dave Bowman, arrives at Jupiter just at the moment that the planets align once again in a straight line. A third black monolith satellite then opens the star gate and Bowman travels through in a visually spectacular sequence. Via this trip Bowman gains an acute understanding of the formation of the universe, the creation of stars and galaxies. He is then transported into a version of our world created by the aliens; in here he quickly grows older and older until he dies and is reborn as the star-child. Through him man has been taken to the next level of existence.2001: A Space Odyssey is a masterpiece of cinema. It is one of the very few films that can claim to be pure science fiction. Its dramatics are sparse and its pace is slow. But it needs this deliberate pace to accentuate its scope. It makes you feel the vastness and loneliness of space and the mysteries it conceals. And it openly invites you to immerse yourself in the beauty of it all. It's a crowning achievement in showing what cinema can be as a pure art-form. This is certainly not a film for everyone, its themes are so big that it lacks the human touch that some may feel is important. For me this is not a concern as by immersing myself in this film I am able to truly feel the mysterious nature of our solar system and the universe in general, and as well as being a visual tour-de-force, it always leaves me with questions and not just answers. And I like that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing visuals with little substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally got around to watching this movie last night. Actually it's the second time I had tried to watch it, but the first time I actually finished it. And I have no desire to ever see it again.I do have to say that 2001 has amazing visuals. The space scenes of all sorts are simply stunning and hold up quite well even today. There was obviously a lot of effort put into them. Definitely the highlight of the movie.The effects are also amazingly realistic. The scene where Dave has to blow the hatch on his pod and momentarily be exposed to space is realistic in a way I've never seen in any other movie. First off, there is no sound of an explosion or anything else, which makes perfect sense since there is no sound in a vacuum. He also doesn't explode or be severely injured, unlike every other movie set in space.2001 is a ponderously slow film. But that's not my main problem with it, though. I can watch slow films so long as I have a reason to keep watching; as in an investment in the characters. There is a severe lack of character development and none of the characters, even the infamous HAL, are shown long enough or in a way that allows me to have any sort of attachment to them. The only character that got any development at all was mankind itself in the first part of the movie, and I can hardly sympathize with a primitive, brutal character as portrayed there. The individuals later in the movie were shown as being largely expendable, with no real reason to be anything but indifferent about their fate. HAL itself was the only character I had any shred of sympathy for, ironically showing himself to be more human than the crew members aboard the ship. Yet I was still largely indifferent when he was disconnected. Yes, "indifference" is a word that describes my attitude towards pretty much all the characters in this movie.Because of my indifference to the characters I had no reason to really ponder what the story was beyond what was shown on screen. I did not care what the purpose of the monoliths were since they affected characters I did have any investment in.As a visual feast this movie fares quite well. As a means for telling a story, it falls flat. A story needs characters and that's what 2001 sorely lacks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I could add all the superlatives that were already said, but this would be unnecessary.As pure movie making, I have never had my visual and auditory senses more stimulated than they were here. The musical score was unforgettable as were the space sequences. Kubrick was as always the perfectionist.No, 2001 is not for everyone. But no movie, no matter how great, is. We all expect something different when we watch a film.But this film makes an impact on any one who appreciates film making as an art form. It is a story without a plot. From the opening sequence of the dawn of man, to his ascension and eventual destiny, no film has more profoundly demonstrated mankind's uniqueness in the universe, and given us so much hope for the future of our species.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Depiction of Existentialism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey is more than a film; unfortunately nowadays films are more and more depicted as an entertainment medium which automatically drives the audience to a flat understanding of what really movies are meant to be. Well Stanley Kubrick's gem came to confirm one of his famous quotes '' If it can be written, or thought, it can be filmed''. The film provokes the subconscious part of the ''watcher'' through a mysterious and obscure gigantic space. Millions of years ago before humankind existed Kubrick choose to personify that mystery in The Monolith scene to express the dawn of man, the way the monolith behaved, and try to communicate could be interpreted as an ''attempt to communication '', as the monolith disappears once the magical alignment appeared and foretells us the beginning of Man's development. The journey through space started with a magnificent soundtrack completely opposite of the one in first chapter which extraordinary matches with the description or the promenade that Stanley Kubrick made us experience through the so wonderful space, to show us one of the best quality of this movie which is the quality of the image and visual effect (knowing that this film was realized in 1968) which personally wowed me. In this part it shows us the cerebral human being in the pinnacle of the technology development and also introduce us to one of the most important actor or character I would say ''Who is'' HALL 900 plays a big role in the depiction of the technology versus Human being , a computer capable of interacting emotionally and intellectually as humans. The dramatic scene in where hall doesn't want to open the pod bay doors to Bowman, Stanley Kubrick showed us how humankind can be victim of its own tools. The film is much more known for its mysterious end because the plot isn't something limited, let us remember you that this film isn't about a definite subject and it becomes what you see in it while you are watching it and that's make the movie even beautiful and special at the same time. Stanley Kubrick delivered a masterpiece using two mean NATURAL dimensions: Vision (image), Music (phonetic, sound) to let us see and listen as we are experiencing the discovery of the Orphic existence of the universe. Highly Recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The single greatest piece of cinematic art ever achieved</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1968 the world was waiting to see what our solar system had to show. Russians and Americans alike had ventured into space but the Moon was still a working progress and as for the other planets, most remained relative mysteries. It is quite amazing that of all things, a movie, would be the first look into the rest of our solar system, but to merely say that 'space odyssey' is an adventure of the solar system would be giving it nowhere near the credit it deserves. It is so much more, its an adventure of humankind, of our souls, of our minds. Almost half a century has passed since its creation and yet its filming techniques and special effects are still the envy of sci-fi film makers the world over. Not just anyone could've made this movie, it is a piece of pure unadulterated genius and should come as no surprise that Kubrick in his almost infinite directional wisdom delivered such a massive and ambitious project to absolute perfection, perfection that knows not of the bounds and constraints of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seminal sci-fi classic that still amazes and beguiles.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After 15 years, I've finally managed to see '2001' after reading the book. I've no idea why it took me this long to get round to it but it was worth it only in that '2001' is the first film I've watched on Blu-ray and it has been excellent. The film is an existential look at man's possible place in the universe. Beginning at the dawn of man and jumping to the 21st Century, this film charts a theoretical look at man's evolution in progress.The film poses questions on man, space and being. How you are to decipher the whole film is really up to each individual. What makes us human? Are we truly as advanced as we think we are? Is there life elsewhere? Thought provoking questions each one, yet surprisingly not over burdened in the film. Putting a philosophical question in a movie can be asking for derision, as cries of pretentiousness abound. In '2001' the film is one of the few that manage to do it and actually be praised for it. The points are accessible by anyone.Viewers must also note that this was made before man went to the moon, so much of it is really analysis on space travel as well. That goes even down to the basic aspects (e.g. how do you do the toilet in space?).You will be intrigued and amazed by it all, and be sitting there at points figuring out how they made some of the scenes before CGI etc was ever around. The scene where the man is running around the circular shuttle is even now quite brilliant. You will be sitting there wondering how they did the scene (over to the DVD extras).One for repeat viewing, and one that can little ever be questioned to be nothing less than a seminal classic of all film making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1968...This movie looks TOO good to have been made so long ago. The visuals look better than most rushed scifi pop these days. The actors interact with their environment in ways that are confusing and jaw-dropping at the same time (noteably the 'floating pen' scene).The climactic sequence between Bowman and Hal is heart wrenching to say the least. The music is eerie, especially whenever the Monoliths are on-screen. David Bowman is more mechanical and calculating than Hal, it seems. That's kind of a new observation I made when watching it last night. Hal tells Bowman "I'm sure you are very angry with me right now". Bowman's demeanor is unchanged. It seems as if he doesn't react to almost anything at all.I really wished there would be more of Hal 9000. He's a great character, probably the most entertaining character in the whole film.The only thing I didn't like about 2001... Bowman's transformation into the Star Child. Bowman baby is probably the scariest and bizarre creature on screen aside from the Eraserhead baby.Great moments of space-shenanigans to classical music.Probably the most artistic sci-fi ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Falling in and out of love with "2001"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two things I will never say for any movie: a) "this movie is a masterpiece, anyone that doesn't like it just didn't get it" b) "this movie is a piece of crap, I want my six dollars/two hours of my life back". Both are pretty arrogant/stupid and (need I mention?) generic things to say. I wish people just stopped using those when reviewing movies, but that's just me being arrogant.Be that as it may, would "2001" qualify for either a) or b) anyhow? The answer is no. I was in love with that movie for bigger part of my life (ever since I was 6 years old). I fell out of it in the recent years but I still try not to miss it on TV (hell, I bought it on DVD but I forgot where I put it).Here be my sincerest attempt on reviewing it.I was absolutely immersed in the world of "2001". Not only did it leave a lasting impression, it also prompted me to see more Kubrick movies, read more Clarke's books, to find out more about how and why it was made. It also had its part in having me enter the world of real science. I always appreciated the slow pace and calm tone and the most worthy attempt to put actual science in science-fiction. I also appreciated how the story required very little self explaining (while most other movies suffer from over-explanation). I liked how it boldly took to predict a very near future and I was looking forward to see how much it got right.All these things are from today's standpoint pretty much the movie's undoing. Come 2001 and the story lost momentum. Never mind that it's a timeless one and that human kind might eventually reach outer planets and whatever unknown is lurking out there is still lurking. The authors clearly and distinctly chose 2001 and they... well... failed. Whether you are naive or not this takes away the aura of prophecy and relegates the movie to yet another sign of times. Let's see what remained.The most problematic part of the movie, the second act, is even more problematic. Most of the dialogue and the explaining takes place there, as well as most of the bad acting, silly set and costume design (decidedly 60's). Nowadays it's just a comedy on how people of the 60's imagined life would be in 21st century. (Remember goofy bob hairdos from "Time Machine"? This is just as bad).Next there is the prologue. The apes. This is what was the eye opener for me as a kid. How human civilization began. No movie before or after dared to get into the subject (unless you count idiotic "10000 BC"). Nowadays I see it as a silly take on evolution (or theory of it if you like), even a parody. It didn't take place over night but over tens of thousands of years, but because of this movie a lot of people nowadays think some aliens had something to do with it. Hardly a service to science, don't you think?Slow pace. Yes, the slow pace was indeed necessary to portray a long journey to revelation (and astronautical voyages). Is it a stroke of genius on part of Kubrick? I though it was until I saw many more of his movies. That man is indeed a very good director but is also a champion of tediousness (if you don't count "Dr. Strangelove").Ending. Let me first say that I still get the shakes from the sight of the Starchild. It's one of the most chilling sequences I can ever remember. Did I "get the ending". Of course, but I had to read the book first. And it is not only bad for the movie, it didn't have anything to do with it in the first place! The ending is either left vague so any viewer could derive what he wants from it, or it is vague because Kubrick and Clarke couldn't actually wrap it up properly. I left this vague so you're free to decide for yourself.Final item is question of "Why?". Why was this movie made? To "make a proverbially good sci-fi movie" as Kubrick once said? That statement of his is a bit misleading. Another statement of his reveals his belief in (at least possibility of) superior alien civilizations and how he wanted to bring this to the audience. Compared to what various people have written about the movie this comes off a bit trivial. Of course, the movie took four years to make, Kubrick and Clarke had ample time to put a lot of other ideas in it as well. But I'm not seeing it anymore. All I see is an attempt to "reconcile" scientific and religious explanations of human origins by finding a "middle ground" - supreme alien race. That subject doesn't interest me anymore. I still owe a lot to the movie (as mentioned before) but I did take it off the pedestal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice on the eyes, painful on the ears, and WEIRD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got done watching the film, I have to say I was extremely disappointed after hearing this hailed as one of the best science fiction films of all time (and often cited as one of the best films ever made overall). The plot felt extremely slow, there are scenes when the music is replaced by various PAINFULLY obnoxious sound effects (such as heavy breathing, machinery humming, white noise background, beeping computers, that extremely strange MOANING space choir, etc) and the whole movie seemed just ODD. So it got me to thinking, would the movie have made some sense or been better had I taken LSD or some other type of drug before watching it? Was the audience in 1968 on massive amounts of drugs, what about the die-hard fans of the film today? The ending in particular was just STRANGE and I was sitting and thinking as hard as I could about WHAT IN THE HELL WAS GOING ON... Is Dave floating through space? If so what is propelling him past all the psychedelic galaxies and colorful lights we see? Is the monolith driving him (because the little pod he's in doesn't look like it would have a powerful thrust to push him to the psychedelic edge of space... So then he finds himself in a room, turns into an old guy, and then turns into a GIANT FLOATING BABY? The main plot section of the film was fairly boring and filled with annoying sound effects though the idea of man versus twisted machine in a sort of race for the monolith was pretty cool I guess (and Hal's cold voice was pretty chilling, except for when he repeats himself OVER AND OVER)...I mean, I usually like old movies, especially old sci-fi, and I'm usually not too fussy even if the plot is sparse like it was in 2001 but I could barely stomach this one... I felt like I was watching the Alice in Wonderland of Space Movies...Don't get me wrong, the special effects were ground breaking, everything LOOKED fantastic and what little acting there was was certainly good but much of the film was extremely BIZARRE... It seemed almost intolerable to me...In short, painful sound effects, boring drawn out plot about evolution mixed with aliens, and a weird, but not good, movie...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's what stood out to me: 1. The music. On the one hand, duh. On the other, have you actually listened to "On the Beautiful Blue Danube" recently? It's 10+ minutes of constant enjoyment -- every melody is beautiful. Of course, another Strauss also has his moments. What most intrigued me, though, were the selections by György Ligeti. I don't usually appreciate atonal or unmelodic pieces, but the "monolith theme" is an awesome blend of the haunting, intense, and otherworldly. Notably, Kubrick commissioned a score by Alex North but then decided to use the classical recordings he had been playing during production -- without telling North.2. The new bone. At the end of "The Dawn of Man" chapter, the triumphant tool-user throws his tapir bone (which he just used to beat the life out of a rival hominid) into the air, and the scene artfully cuts from the bone to its modern counterpart: a white, cylindrical nuclear device orbiting the earth. That's deep. Or maybe I'm just a sucker for a good transition.3. The visual realism. The space exploration special effects hold up remarkably well considering that the film turns 40(!) this year. Not only do they look realistic, they also illustrate Kubrick's attention to procedural detail. He uses extended shots of relatively mundane activities in order to give us a sense of what it's like in the vacuum and how exactly people get things done.4. The computer. HAL's got a great voice (he's going to sing "Fitter Happier" in my remake). And his lines aren't half-bad, either. If only his shipmates weren't so wooden and...mechanical. (Was Kubrick trying to say something about astronauts -- that the government preferred unimaginative military men to a fault?) If I were on board, I'd've picked his brain nonstop. A conscious computer would never get old. Forget chess -- imagine having a conversation about philosophy, or anything else for that matter. What would you talk about? 5. The end. What's the deal? The protracted light show screams "we've got to do something with all these FX shots," especially when the colored landscapes kick in after what I thought would be the climax (when everything appears to be culminating in a burst of white light). And then there's the bizarre room sequence. I won't spoil it; I'll just speculate: is this how the aliens wanted Dave to perceive his transformation? Or is it Kubrick reminding us that 2001 is an art film, infinitely beyond trashy sci-fi?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey is polarizing; if you love it, you rank it in your top five movies ever, maybe higher. If you hate it, you really don't like it. It is the Ulysses or the "Les demoiselles d'Avignon" of the cinematic world: confusing, epic, bizarre, but masterful. Kubrick (God rest his soul) created a powerfully symbolic film, which is part of the reason why some people don't like it very much. None of it is clear cut, but everything you see is there for a reason. Kubrick makes you work through this movie. Whether it's realizing that "Thus Spoke Zarathustra" is the theme music for the next great moment in human evolutionary history, pinpointing the exact moment where we see HAL's first emotional response (or do we?), or even something as simple as Frank's frightening death that all too clearly backs up the statement, "In space, no one can hear you scream," you have to think. And that is part of the glory of 2001. Like all great movies make you do, you have to consider and assess and analyze to garner something like understanding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mindblowing and awe-inspiring.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'2001: A Space Odyssey'. To accuse this film of taking its time would be a gross understatement. '2001' takes the scenic route, and it indulges in every moment of it. It is a film as tedious as it is beautiful, poetic as it is baffling. A true work of genius, or boring and bloated? You decide. But one thing is for sure, Stanley Kubrick's 'Space Odyssey' is cinema like you've never seen before, an experience like none other.One cannot approach a film like '2001' the way you would any other picture. In fact, you can't really approach it as a film at all. It is a truly unique project, and an immensely risky move by Kubrick. There is little dialogue to be found (the first spoken words actually don't appear until nearly 30 minutes into the film), and a magnificent, mood-altering score often replaces would-be narratives. Most of all, '2001' is one of the most spectacularly visual films I have ever seen. A movie has never looked so damn good, so beautiful. And all this in 1968, before mankind first set foot on the moon.'A Space Odyssey' can be divided into three parts, an eerie intermission included, each surrounding man's (from the most primitive) transfixion with the mysterious and alien monolith. 'Dawn of Man' is a methodical, brilliantly constructed look at man's earliest ancestor, the ape. The beauty continues, through man's discovery of this ancient monolith buried on the moon, to an unnerving discovery mission to Jupiter. Few films have dared go where '2001' is more than willing to explore, and it's well-worth an epic running length.'2001' draws up a rather disturbing yet realistic vision of the future. The year 2001 has come and gone, and with it some of the film's ideas of what the future would be like. Some have yet to become a reality, but few seem completely implausible. It's what makes '2001' at times a very unsettling experience. It looks to a time and place where few barriers remain to be crossed, and where the technology we ourselves created may very well be our fatal flaw. For it is during a space mission to Jupiter that we are introduced to Hal, an extremely advanced computer in charge of most operations on-board the space ship. Hal communicates with the crew, and appears to be capable of experiencing emotion. No spoilers here, but Hal gives birth to one of the most genuinely terrifying villains ever seen in film.At the heart of '2001' remains a puzzling mystery to which there really is no definitive answer. Kubrick intentionally leaves the film open for interpretation, nothing is handed to us on a silver platter. But just what this picture trying to tell us? Perhaps we have to travel back, millions of years in fact, to man's most primitive form. How far have we come? No, how far have we truly come? Are we really any better off than we were? It is the elusive unknown we still chase, looking for answers. '2001' speaks in a language full of symbolism, imagery, and metaphors. Perhaps searching for answers isn't the point, perhaps it's all about appreciating the vast beauty we find ourselves apart of.Prepare to be taken where film has never gone before. '2001: A Space Odyssey' is a moving space opera that will dazzle and leave you breathless. Is it an easy film to sit through? Certainly not. But after all, I don't believe Stanley Kubrick made this daring masterpiece for a generation whose attention span barely lasts longer than a television commercial. It is a deliberate, methodical work that raises more questions than it cares to answer, and I'd be lying if I said I never felt frustrated by this complex and deeply thought-provoking movie. But is it one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen? Yes. Is it a masterpiece like we've never seen before or will ever see again? Yes. Is it one of the best films ever made? Yes, I believe it is."You're free to speculate as you wish about the philosophical and allegorical meaning of the film?and such speculation is one indication that it has succeeded in gripping the audience at a deep level?but I don't want to spell out a verbal road map for 2001 that every viewer will feel obligated to pursue or else fear he's missed the point." - Stanley Kubrick More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&amp;view=public</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that needs repeated viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey is a classic sci-fi film, an example of Stanley Kubrick's genius as a director. I admit I didn't like it as much as other Kubrick films at first, but another viewing made me see what a brilliant film it was.The film is very complex and tackles a number of themes, such as science and space travel, evolution, religion, discovery, the future of computing and alien life-forms. I personally think it is about man's yearning for discovery and wanting to improve themselves.The film starts off at the dawn of man we look at a small of apes struggling to survive. They are forced away from their waterhole and were on the brink. It was only when the apes use bones as tools that the they are able to reclaim there waterhole, but become murderous and warlike. After that the film skips forward to the future and we see that man has been very advance, starting to make large space bases and colonising the moon. A team of scientist discovery a strange black monolith on the moon and start to study it. It is then skips future another 18 months and the film focuses on a mission to Jupiter and we look at two astronauts, Frank and Dave, and the computer HAL. The mission seems to be going smoothly enough until HAL makes an error and the crew decides to disconnect him. HAL however knows what they plan to do and takes drastic action to stop this, including murder. Its was Dave that was only able to stop him. After this we knew see Dave go through a wormhole around Jupiter and the film becomes very surreal.This film is multi layered and many fans of this film have discussed what it means. I have given my opinion earlier. This film gets the science right and from a technical viewpoint, very impressive. The music is classical and very memorially and fitting for this film. There are also a lot of memorially scenes which have been homaged and parody a number of times. I personally really like the scene when Dave is disconnecting HAL and HAL is pleading for his life.This is a film that needs to be watched a number of times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>essence of the civilization</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think it's interesting which the first scene starts with the coexistence of some Monkeys and Tapirs. I don't know about Europe or USA, but in Japan there's a legend about Tapir that they eats man's dream. I think even those 2001 monkeys(not yet human) had a dream, for instance, a dream of being strong, living safe and easy. "The civilization". I think those Tapirs are ate all of those monkeys "dream" all the time, so that's because those monkeys "dreams" didn't came true, not once. But soon, one monkey grab a tool(weapon), and hit down a Tapir. I think that's the moment all the things are ready and going to happen, The METAPHOR of beginning of a civilization, a dreams come true. Until then, all of them were just feel small, shriveled up you could see.I think Kubrick wanted to express the essence of The civilization. In this civilized world, there's a lots of TOOLS and people who use TOOLS. Civilization is a NIGHTMARE to most of the TOOLs, I mean people. Remember, HAL thinks he has a human's will. But you know he's just a TOOL. Boman thinks HAL is just a TOOL as well. But, how about him, captain Boman?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great expression of its era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"2001: A Space Odyssey" (again, 1968): Any reproduction of this film seen on a FLAT, small (non-theater) screen, and chopped to fit contemporary formats will NEVER give you an idea of the visual and aural effects received by a 1968 audience. They sat in rare and expensive theaters exclusively built for the phenomenal techniques of Cinemascope and Super Panavision. What this meant was a sitting in luxurious seating surrounded by a 180 degree screen that required three projectors running and blending 3 sections of the film into a seamless movie that literally wrapped around your head/field of vision, with sound to match. Add to that the exceptional length of "2001" (139 minutes, which was almost unheard of in 1968), special effects that truly changed the world of film making; the epic subject ("Man" from ape-beginnings to Celestial Being); the fact the audience was indeed anticipating our FIRST escape from Earth to ANOTHER PLANET (only a year away!); and presenting a metaphysical film to a typical American audience ? and it being SUCCESSFUL! ? and you have an idea how difficult this film is to watch without its context. None the less? it's great sci-fi, a great expression of its era, has technological and script breakthroughs galore, asks MUCH of its audience ? from patience to brain power, and gives you so many scenes you will NEVER forget, that to not see this film is to not see a clear picture of film history. Kubrick was not always this masterful (I am not a fan of his version of "Lolita"), but when he hit it, he hit it BIG.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2001: A Great Reason to Stay Home and Explore Space</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"2001" is a pioneer of science fiction film-making, which inspired a new generation and gave audiences more than just cheap effects with little green men. Kubrick created a film that makes you think, not just about what is happening on the screen, but also what the future holds. In 1968, 2001 seemed like a million years away, and this is what Kubrick thought we would look like ? now, in 2008, if he were alive ? he could make a film called "2012: A Space Odyssey" and this critic would believe his view of the distant future. Kubrick opens our film with the power of sound. Like an opera beginning its set, we are left in the dark as our musicians begin their concertos that fill our ears with emotion and the unknown. Beginning in this way, it takes us (in a positive way) out of the feeling of the film, and that we are sitting in the best seats of the house for a performance of the theater of the absurd. With words reminiscent of Beckett, Kubrick brings both a voice and a sound to this film that is difficult to find in today's modern science fiction films. A modern similarity would be the independent film "Primer", but even that is a long shot. What makes "2001" more than just a film is the classical music Kubrick uses. As the film progresses, it feels as if the music was made with this film in mind. The "dawn of man" with the booming overture as our ape ancestors claw at the monolith will, and has, remained a staple in the cinematic world. With this sheet of black metal, Kubrick created a sound and an image that could never be duplicated ? while some have tried ? the emotion and feeling when the Sun and Earth crest the monolith on Mars can never be reproduced. With a minimal script, language used as a secondary way to complete the story, the sound needed to be perfect ? and the full bodied orchestra did better than perfect. It created a sound for a place that is devoid of everything except darkness ? space.With my ogling of sound complete, there were other elements of "2001" that were equally sharp and powerful. By dating a film there is always the risk of arriving to that date without finding any of the predictions true, the film becomes a cultural hick-up and forgotten in the canyons of cinema. What makes Kubrick's film impeccable is its ability to grow outside of the normality of average science fiction. While it holds a date of 2001, it does not mean that the Kubrick's themes become dated. This is difficult to explain, but watching "2001" in 2008 still was impressive. The technological advances, the exploration of the unknown, the questionable ethics of evolution still resonates in today's society and I feel that Kubrick knew this while making this film. Sure, this was his idea (or perhaps Clarke's idea) of the future, but it is still the future. By book marking it with the unspoken birth of humanity and with the rebirth of the "Space Child" ? it transcends the 2001-esquire moments. What makes this film go beyond the 2001 pitfall is that rarely is it mentioned the actual date. Outside of the title sequence and the brief moment with HAL, this film could be placed anywhere ? and it does. Do not be fooled by the title, this is still a relevant film today as it was yesterday and through the years to come.One still cannot speak about this film without talking about HAL and that infamous line about the "pod bay doors". It has become more than just cultural chatter, but wine-chatter with film snobs. It is an important and provocative moment of the film, but the events surrounding it contain just as much recognition. In one fell swoop, HAL changes and the dawn of man becomes a page in the history books. The machines have become smarter than their creators, and a new dawn has arrived. Kubrick's scenes surrounding HAL were phenomenally spooky. That looming yellow eye stayed with me long after the film and can be still seen in current cinematic releases. With one fell swoop of the camera, Kubrick created man, developed the monolith, brought fear into technology, and then attempted to explain the meaning of life. Overall, this film has impressed me completely. The Homer-esquire journey that we, the viewer, take on this film is unparalleled in any other cinematic adventure. No other director could have helmed this project as well as given the darkness, the fear, the hope, and the overall sense of excitement to the screen. Kubrick was a film pioneer, his voice can continue to be heard today with any science fiction film that is released, and it is all due to this one singular film that chose to open with darkness and the score of an opera, and end with the eyes of a child. This is a science fiction film, but it is more than that. This is a history book. It is a page of our life that nobody wants to see. The monolith could represent anything, and there are film classes that spend years discussing it ? and that is why this movie will remain firmly rooted in our catalog. I loved the sounds, I loved the technology, I loved the dark vacuum of space, but most importantly, I loved the unknown. This was not a linear story that one could watch and forget about ? out of respect to Kubrick ? watch this film, watch it again ? point out the unknown and keep it fresh in your friend's mind. This is a glowing example of why films are made.Grade: ***** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, hailed by many, including myself, as the best and most important science-fiction film ever made is very influential but still very unique. Philosophical, stunning, forever fascinating- 2001 is all of these. It defies genre convention and is unlike any science-fiction film before or after its release. Certainly it deviates from Kubrick's stated intention to make the proverbial good science-fiction film. Visually, 2001 is undeniably awesome. Ground-breaking special effects (designed by Douglas Trumbull and Kubrick himself) are a dazzling mix of imagination and science. 2001 can be taken as a mysterious adventure, sermon, or vision, one that was understandably the ultimate trip for hippies on psychedelics, but even viewed simply as a haunting spectacle it is unsurpassed. Its sketchy narrative and sometimes bewildering themes and questions are more than compensated by its gripping engagement between man and machine, its visual starkness and serenity, and, above all, its rhapsodic wonder at heaven and earth and the infinite beyond.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick's dazzling and intriguing masterpiece. Quite simply, the best film ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen 2001: A Space Odyssey quite a couple of times over the years, and each viewing never fails to amaze me. Ever since I saw it back in 2008, I fell in love on first viewing.Stanley Kubrick is one of Cinema's most legendary directors, so it goes without saying that he has an impressive resume. However, I have never seen a director quite as ambitious or daring as Kubrick here. The opening of 2001 demands attention in the first second, and amazingly the film reaches out and grabs you with it's amazing use of music, cinematography, and images. The film has no dialogue until after the 20- minute mark, yet it always remains completely mesmerizing. The film is a journey, an exploration that only those who are really willing to will experience. The film's atmosphere and mood is what sets it apart. It is true that a film's plot is very important, but I think what comes before that is how a film makes you feel. Of course, what you feel might come from the plot, characters, or writing, but it also comes from the direction, the use of music, and the abstract structure that a film might have. In that aspect, the film has many memorable scenes, scenes that are sure to blow your mind away, despite you never really knowing what they actually mean. That is the definition of a true artistic achievement.I do not want to say more, simply because a film like this is meant to be discussed based on your own personal feelings and theories after your viewing. It is not meant to be explained before watching. Of course, a film like this is also warranted to attract a large number of criticism, maybe on the level of ambition or 'pretension' as many will like to call it. Yet, the fact remains that 2001: A Space Odyssey has fared well over time, and is one of the most influential films of all time with good reason. It still stands to this day as the best film I have ever seen, and I strongly doubt that any film will ever take that title away from it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wikipedia discussion of interpretations of "2001"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an excellent film, which I have watched many times, but I believe it is complementary to Arthur C. Clarke's &amp; Kubrick's novel of the same title. The novel fills in the explanation that would be simply impossible (and probably even boring) in the film, which presents a visual and aural inspiration that cannot be duplicated on paper. Thus I highly recommend that anyone puzzled by the movie should read the book, and as Clarke has suggested, repeat the pair alternately as necessary. I would also recommend Clarke's 1953 novel "Childhood's End" as deeply relevant for those who want more.Lately an article has been underway on Wikipedia, "Interpretations of 2001: A Space Odyssey", amidst a swirl of controversy. (There are also separate articles on the film and the novel.) Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, first and foremost, and there are necessarily strict rules for what can be claimed in a "properly scholarly" encyclopedic article. While anything can be said (once), content deemed improper will be removed very quickly by swarms of dedicated defenders of the integrity of the project, rightly or wrongly, depending on the opinion of the persons involved. Once consensus has been reached on each article's discussion or "talk" page, argument should damp down. Anyhow, this is a good time for dedicated or interested 2001 fans to take a look and comment on the talk page (tab at the top). The article itself is presently "locked" to give tempers a chance to cool, but the discussion page is open. In any case, I hope the Wiki pages on "2001" will provide a useful resource to those interested in the film, as well as to Clarke's and Kubrick's thinking on questions of deep human interest, not only 40 years out, but likely for many decades to come as our species matures.</fullReview>

The shots of space ships and the space stations is incredible, the effects are also impressive. The film tells us about the Evolution of Man since 2001 shows the Dawn of Man where mankind was apes then goes to future where everything is high-tech, the transition between the two times is beautifully done. The acting is great, the voice of HAL is so calm yet so creepy especially when he turns against them.2001: A Space Odyssey is a creative, fantastic sci-fi classic that should be seen, one of Stantley Kurbrick's masterpieces.

		<shortDescription>Technically and visually stunning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"2001: A Space Odyssey" is an extraordinary film and oh so significant. It must have been the pioneer of the science-fiction films and inspired later famous movies of its kind.Amazing and triumphant, it is also a completely different movie experience. Its formula is somehow similar to that of Walt Disney's "Fantasia", being a very artistic movie that focus more in art and images than dialogs, almost like a space documentary.Technically the movie is impressing and visually brilliant. The visual effects are stunning, the special effects are wonderful, the futuristic and advanced visuals are terrific and the attention to detail is not forgotten (even in the smallest details). This is pure and expressive art, combined with beautiful and unforgettable classical music.Speaking of classical music, Richard Strauss's "Thus Spake Zarathustra" theme is one of the movie's trademarks, but even better than this one is the fabulous Johan Strauss II's "On the beautiful Blue Danube" waltz.The "Star Gate" sequence is the most incredible, indescribable and breathtaking part of this movie. Wow, what a perfect and extraordinary genial artwork! The sound effects were not forgotten as well during the entire movie. The combination of sounds is great. It accents the already quite realistic atmosphere of the movie."2001: A Space Odyssey" also deals with interesting stuff such as the human evolution, extremely advanced technology, artificial intelligence and extraterrestrial life.One example of artificial intelligence is the HAL 9000 computer, with his «perfect reliability» and soft and distinctive voice (brilliantly voiced by Douglas Rain). HAL 9000 is a great villain, being even capable of reading lips, which he does in a brilliant close-up and silent scene.The only things I don't particularly appreciate in this movie is the sequence "The Dawn of Man" (with pre-historical apes, so fake and unnatural that it's obvious they're men disguised as apes) and I also dislike the final minutes of the movie (after the magnificent "Star Gate" sequence). However, "The Dawn of Man" also has its good things, such as the gorgeous sceneries, luminosity and that weird and somewhat sinister vocal music when the monolith appears.During the first 3 minutes, all we see is nothing - we only hear a strongly suspenseful music. The title sequence is wonderful, with a satellite image of the Earth rising over the Moon, while the Sun rises over the Earth, all in alignment, looking like an eclipse. More or less in the middle of the movie, there is an intermission that lasts 2 minutes and we hear the same strong music.If this is already a formidable movie, the fact of being from 1968 amazes me even more and makes its greatness even bigger. I mean, just imagine: this was made such a long time ago, when computers and technology were radically different and not even close to be half as developed and advanced as nowadays. It must have been completely unbelievable in 1968! However, this is a movie that requires an open mind and patience because it is long, slow and has very few dialogs, which may make it a bit tiring. But nobody discusses its greatness.Without a doubt, this is a cult movie, a timeless classic, one of all time's greatest science-fiction films (as well as one of all time's great movies) and Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece, which was written by Arthur C. Clarke and Kubrick himself. As for the cast, talents include Keir Dullea, Gary Lockwood, Douglas Rain, William Sylvester and others.</fullReview>

Sure the musical score was brilliant. Sure, the symbolism was profound at times. But the film moved along like a slug on ice! For me, the film began when HAL short circuited and ended with his demise. "Daisy, daisy..." and "Dave, Dave..." are classic. Some Kubrick I love and some Kubrick I don't fancy much.

		<shortDescription>How to Control the Act of Controlling Control.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading other reviewers' comments on this film is particularly interesting. They typically sense importance without fully understanding why, and rarely are they able to successfully illustrate why they find it so enjoyable.So let me start by attempting just that myself.To me, this is about control. Mankind is under the control of some extraterrestrial beings (or Gods) while struggling for control over each other. It's the same story told twice: We are given the technology to enslave each other, once by innovation of crude weaponry (bone), the other by advanced (supercomputer).The tip-off scene is the one in which our technological leaders hold a press conference to decide what to tell the rest of the species, how best to control them. It's not Hal who's fighting for mastery over the crew. Hal is merely a surrogate for said leaders, who are responsible for programming Hal to do everything he does. No, there is no computer malfunction here. Hal is programmed to eradicate the human pawns in the event that they begin to learn the truth. So there is no "man vs. computer" theme, but more accurately, "man vs. man-with-computer." A huge clue: Considering that the ape who touched the monolith is the one who gained innovation, note which character touches the one on the moon.Also consider: Dave has been enslaved to the point where his very conscience is ultimately manipulated. As soon as he defeats Hal, those with authority over him move to plan B, and the very manner in which he experiences life is wildly altered.Kubrick also chose to start another discussion about control on another level, that of the film's control over us, and that's the root of most people's confusion with this experience. And that's the deal with the ambiguous ending. With a clear ending and concrete answers, there is nothing to discuss.The stylistic choice to romanticize space as the new nature is a further experiment in manipulation, that of the film-maker over the viewer. Check out the music. It's a symphony about the beauty of earthly nature. I know he has succeeded because the film feels even more important than what I can explain.I'll leave all talk about the technical aspects of this movie to other reviewers. Typically if one is discussing this primarily in that context, he/she is missing the point completely. But even the most clueless has been controlled to feel that this film is profound. And that's profound.Everyone should see this. Multiple times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001 is one of the odder films ever made. You could call it a stone plate-Nietzsche-waltz-obsession. If you are willing to dive into such a thing, then please, go ahead! The Blue Danube serves as a vehicle to let you feel both the loss of orientation in space and the loss of orientation in culture, in the sense that what we call culture is already the product of a disorientation, a sophisticated play that betrays our elementary nature. I AM! ALL THIS IS MINE! The introduction brings this point about pretty concisely, and most people will certainly imagine the becoming of man along the lines of the depiction here. It's a dark fantasy, "the you is older than the I" said Zarathustra, um, Nietzsche, and in this spirit, that with self obsession came power, 2001 establishes the role of consciousness.The ultimate cause for this turn stays a mystery, an unknown by principle, an act of God, like the handing over of the ten commandments, at least in Kubrick's vision. It's a consistent and effective vision. But it's not much of a basis to create a film upon. The repetition of the birth of consciousness in the space ship's computer was worth showing, but after that point the film simply runs out of substance. The rest is just common half-sense, a disappointment after the start.If you're willing to let the film simply work on you, in a purely poetical way, then it's definitely worth watching. Otherwise it is to be shunned, since it would bore you to death!</fullReview>

But viewing this a second time I found how brilliant the writing of Stanley Kubiak was in creating such a different and unique Science Fiction movie. This film though I still don't completely understand (such as the third act ). I cannot understand why this film wasn't even nominated for Best Picture in the Oscars. Next, the special effects (consider 1968 here) they are top notch if you know most science, space crafts would fly like considering no oxygen. And the effect of the giant "hamster" wheel type shots were great. This movie as a whole with the well placed classical scores and triumphant music is my favorite Sc-Fi movie and one of my favorite movies of all time.And if you didn't like it try watching it again and you can understand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Popular Beliefs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plot summary follows popular beliefI believe I can prove that the popular beliefs about the technology in this movie are wrong. Some of the evidence comes from Clarke's early work in space radar and radio, and in his article about meteorites. Copies of two of his articles can be found on my web site at www.geocities.com/gregu10/geek/geek.htm Later in life Clarke became an expert in two other areas of space exploration, predicting how the astronaut will behave, and predicting when radio signals can be corrected for errors. All of these obscure technologies add up to a better explanation for the pods behavior, for the AE-35, and for HAL not letting Dave back in the ship.The first issue I have is the pod. Clarke's 1940s paper on meteorites concluded that a large space ship in the asteroid belt would not be nimble enough to dodge meteorites, nor powerful enough to destroy them. In the movie we see meteorites just before the fatal scene. Then the pod warning light turn on, then we see the severed air hose and the dead astronaut cross in front of us followed by the pod. The pod crossed the astronauts path after his death. The pod was trying to save the astronaut from a meteorite. This scene might be a pre-view of what happened to Apollo 13. That would be true if we could prove that Apollo 13 was hit by a meteorite and then the oxygen bottle failed. Similarly the accident on Challenger happened not because the wing failed, but because the wing had been hit by ice, and was the part of the wing most likely to fail if it got too much ionization.The second issue is the AE-35. Using filtering techniques such as the Viterbi algorithm for radio communications was well known in 1968. Viterbi developed his algorithm for the Venus spacecraft, and prior to that Wiener and Kalman had developed filtering algorithms used in television screens for radar applications. Hal never says the AE-35 failed. He predicted when it was going to fail, in the future. This is possible when using error correcting algorithms. Hal does not understand why the astronauts are so upset about his prediction. Despite something like 76,000 systems on board, Hal expects the astronauts to know all about the AE-35 unit at the base of the microwave. Hal has never seen anything quite like it. Hal suggests putting it back, and waiting for it to fail!The question is why does Clarke know it will fail. His 1947 article on radio range to Jupiter shows clearly that power and range are available for communicating to earth. Furthermore, Clarke showed that none of the other radio problems such as Doppler, ranging or tracking will create any unsolvable problems. So why was Hal waiting for the AE-35 to start error correcting? Why did Hal think the astronauts would want to know as soon as Hal knew? Was there some fact of radio that Clarke missed back in 1947? The answer is yes - Clarke failed to consider that a spaceship near Jupiter would accelerate to 35,000 mph or more, causing relativistic changes in wavelengths of the radio nearly one part in a million. This relativistic change is the reason the AE-35 unit started doing error correction, and led to the prediction of the failure of all microwave communications in a few days. But the AE-35 never did fail. They turned it off. In the 1960s book Making of 2001 Clarke is quoted saying the computer was perfectly correct, it was ground control who messed up. Ground control was not traveling 35,000MPH!!!At this point Hal knows that Dave is a threat to the ship. If you read the 1962 US Navy study about conflict resolution on my website by Mesarovic you will see the prediction that crew performance will decline rapidly if the two crewman talk to each other. This is what happened, and Hal was well aware of the fact - he observed their lips moving while they were together in the pod - talking paranoia about Hal. Early NASA studies such as the NASA 1962 University Symposium have simpler mathematical models for astronauts and test pilots. It was Mesarovic who worked out the case of two astronauts on a ship being controlled by the ground with a seven hour communication delay. If you think critically during the time that Hal is doing the psychological workup - you can tell that Hal doesn't know what they are talking about. Hal is just filling in the blanks for the psychologists at NASA. He is a boring chess partner too, not intelligent at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When released in 1968, these special effects blew people away...and I can see why. These are some great special effects, even for now. It seems as though Kubrick's whole reason for making this was to capture the beauty of classical music being played to long scenes of interesting space sets and special effects. While it was very interesting for it's time, it's lost some pizazz now that every movie has this. However the part of the film that is still really interesting today is the Dawn of Man opening segment where man's ape like descendent's learn how to commit violence. It's amazing how ape like they actually got these creatures to look, while still having a weird human like quality to them. The biggest story in the film was a spaceship's extremely intelligent computer Hal is taking over the ship. It's an interesting plot, but one that doesn't kick in until late in to the film. The main problems with this movie are it's lack of a real central plot and no explanation for many supernatural things that happen, but nonetheless, this is still a classic for many reasons, but even a classic can be flawed.My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 147 mins. Rated G</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well - same comment I made on "Rosemary's Baby" seen around the same time. I didn't like this movie then - and like it even less now. The passage of time only deteriorated my opinion of this film. Because - it is nonsense - what else can I say. Perhaps psychologists can see imagery that I don't care about - but - it is silly at best - very boring at worst. If they going to use electricity - at least use it on something worthwhile. It takes forever to get through some scenes to prove some silly point - maybe giving apes some intelligence. But - what's the point. The Monolith and its meaning are too esoteric for most audiences - it is just sheer cartoonish. I gave this a 2 rating - which is way more than it deserves. I will never be a psychologist and don't intend to deduce the hidden meanings of esoteric movies. They're not worth it. Care to reply - I'm at ml2348@att.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well I've watched this film quite a few times in my life and at first I hated it because quite honestly it wasn't so much a movie as it was a hour and a half of nonsense by a thirty minute modern art time warp. But after repeated viewings and several discussions about it I came to realize something. This film is Beautiful the last time I saw it I viewed it in HD and it completely blew me away. So if you get a chance view this movie. Well not the first part which has nothing to do with anything.(It was just a excuse to put people in poorly made monkey suits) But view the last thirty minutes or so that is the movies strong point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Profundity doesn't always equal the Bruckheimer pacing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those who don't get this film and decided to post your angry thoughts because others have correctly commented on why you "don't get it". Being angry at this film because you weren't bright enough to "get it", just illustrates that anger/violence goes hand in hand with limited (self-imposed or not) comprehension.It is very true that this film requires an intellect that is probing in nature. Kubrick and Clarke said on many occasions that this film was more about asking questions, not answering them.The questions were profound indeed.Why are we here? How did we get here? Is the Universe self-aware? Is the Universe a "clock" like Einstein implied? Or is it a "gaming table" like Stephen Hawking implied? Do we have the ingredients to stay around? (Remember, the dinosaurs were around for hundreds of millions of years). Is technology in and of itself a moral good? Or is it like everything else, dependent on the use it is put to by sentient beings. Why are we curious? What is the definition of intelligence? Does being curious lead to ultimate answers or just more questions? Why can we not see the paradox of our own nature? Is humility a sign of greatness or weakness? etc.For those complaining about the pacing, or how bored you were, or how the dialogue didn't impress you, or how you were just confused instead of entertained I've got some help for you. The movie in fact isn't lacking. It's your ADD/MTV definition of what entertainment should be that is lacking. Sometimes profundity is more entertaining than a playstation or a 3 minute music video. In order to "get" that, you must have brain matter that is more complex than the remnants in a soap dish.Kubrick = entertainment on too many levels for some folks. I give this film a 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watch "Destination Moon", "When Worlds Collide", "War of the Worlds", "Conquest of Space", "The Time Machine" and you'll gain deep insight into the deranged genius of Stanley Kubrick. George Pal influenced "2001" in many, many ways. His space and disaster movies moved the Fifties like Stanley's moved the late Sixties. The dramatic paradigm and world-view shifts between the Pals and the Kubricks are a wonder to behold in hindsight....But I trow the PAL movies will be watched by more people for their deeper and more resonant, Christian themes long after the evolutionist, misanthropic, irony-drenched black comedies of Kubrick are shelved.... INCLUDING "2001" Yes, in light of the superior Pal space films, you may watch "2001" as a dark, ironic comedy, produced by a man so self-obsessed as to border on the megalomaniacal! Read the stories of folks who actually had to work with Stanley. Now compare the fan base of George Pal. Compare the outputs! Some of Stanley's movies are unwatchable today; the charming Puppetoons will never lose their luster.... but I digress. It will be enough just for you to watch "Conquest of Space" to see what I am talking about. Kubrick simply copied Pal with his own deviant, derivative drivel! He out-banals banal!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arthur C. Clarke stated once in an interview that you should read the book first and watch the film after and then read the book again and watch the film to understand the story. Clarke's novel does not follow every scope of the screenplay, every one shall understand the open and totally interpretation worthy ending of the film like he wants to - you wouldn't come up with two consistent opinions. Is it about spiritualized aliens that keep the humans or about the termination of humans' evolution or has it a religious background - maybe all three aspects together? Without reference to that, '2001: A Space Odyssey' became a milestone of the science fiction genre. Clarke said rightly that those genial special effects could have been made more impressively only 'on location', means directly in outer space. The weightlessness, the workings of the technology, the levitating monolith - it's all a grand, breathtaking symphony for your eyes! After decades of thundering and roaring spaceship engines in a cosmos without sonic comes now an absolute silence into the outer space - perfectly highlighted with the music of Richard Strauss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch when you are mentally alert</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had to watch this movie three times, I fell asleep during the ape part twice. Anyway, my advice is to watch the movie when you are at the peak of your mental capabilities, so that you can analyze what is going on. Yet I will warn you, even then you will never really be sure.First of all, if you don't believe in the theory of evolution, you may feel compelled to fast forward through the ape scenes. However, you should still watch to understand the relevance of the apes to the storyline. The first part of the ape sequence shows the savagery of the species, who are under attack from each other and other animals. Then the black monolith arrives and makes a strange sound and fascinates the apes. It stands tall and erect and is intimidating. Next, you see a lone ape, who I consider the leader of the pack, figure out he can use a bone as a weapon. Shortly after that, the two packs of apes that were fighting for territory earlier, meet up again. However,the apes armed with bones, are standing upright and show their strength when they kill one of the members of the opposing pack. This pack of apes seemed to have developed a more advanced form of intelligence and show the advantages of dominance.Cut to a space ship in space, which seems similar in shape to the bone the lone ape was holding. The ship looks like it is free falling in space, when you realize it is actually orbiting. I have to pause to address the music in the movie. I think Kubrick made a wise choice of music for this film. During the ape scene, we get what sounds like a chorus mumbling/singing unintelligible words, they sound other worldly and the chorus gets louder and their singing frenzied. Once we get to space, we have the most famous waltz of all time, that everyone on the planet has heard at one point. That waltz is universal. Using a waltz, instead of sci-fi music, gives the audience a sense of familiarity, while venturing into an unknown world. Also the waltz has a certain monotonous feel to it, which may heighten the sense of orbiting in space. When things get out of control,we get the chorus again, which heightens the audience's sense of anxiety. Next, we move to the audience seeing space travel, the effects of anti-gravity, how one eats in space. We move on to meeting company man, Dr. Floyd, whose purpose was to smooth over any concerns about problems on Jupiter. The movie feels tedious at this point, but you have to listen to the conversation he has with the other scientist and the presentation he gives at a meeting for some basic information that sets up the heart of the film. Once we get on board with Dave and the crew and meet Hal, whose voice is seductive and menacing at the same time, the film picks up steam again. We come across the black monolith again, this time on the moon. The monolith makes a piercing sound,which harms the scientists. Now at this point, the monolith seems to be an enemy of man. Very contradictory to the way the monolith behaved with the apes, who suffered no harm when in the presence of the monolith. Is man getting too close and about to overpower the monolith, or is the monolith afraid of losing its dominance over man? 18 months later we are on the journey to Jupiter with Dave and the crew. Before any dialog takes place, Kubrick visually gives the audience a sense of the ship, the isolation on the ship, the routine of the ship, and the dominance of HAL. Now another theory at work in the movie is man versus computers, which back in 1968 must have seemed like a portal into doom. We see the level of trust the crew has in HAL. Yet, through the use of the monotony of HAL's voice, the audience is encouraged to develop a distrust of the computer before anything goes wrong. Then the "Judas event" happens. Hal fakes a problem with the ship and the astronauts realize he made and error on purpose and they propose to in effect "kill" him. However, HAL strikes first and tries to take out the two astronauts. In a battle between man and machine Dave gets back on the ship, only to discover through a message from Dr.Floyd, that was played once HAL demised, that HAL really had no control over his actions after all. Free will versus destiny. Again there is mention of contact with the monolith, but we never see the rest of the message. Dave then sets out to finish the mission. Again we see the beauty of Kubricks visuals, with the use of primary colors, a kind of Andy-Warhol effect on Dave's eyes. You also get a sense of the horror, which the chorus underlies. Now we get to the the planet, which is really a room? At this point, you have to make a decision as to if this is really Dave's mind and his way of coping what is happening to him, or is this the end of the journey? The monolith is back acting as a mechanism that alters perception and reality. Dave is old when he arrives, due to the effects of the travel or from being in space for a long period of time? There seems to be a trinity of Dave: the old man in the bed, the man at the table, and the fetus at the end. Is Dave suddenly reborn, because he accepts an alternate form of being? Dave dies at the end to be reborn. At the end, you see the fetus orbit in space, or in the womb of space and seems in harmony with the other planets. Everything has a feeling of resolution, and the waltz starts again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>as beautiful and boring as an actual space flight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001 opens with perhaps the most impressive title sequence ever filmed. Notably, only one person is credited at the opening -- you guessed it, Stanley Kubrick. The use of Thus Spoke Zarathustra is brilliant and really impressive -- one of the iconic moments in film history. No one will ever forget that sequence.Then comes the Dawn of Man. The apes were clearly mimes in costume. Still, Kubrick and his crew did an excellent job of somehow back- or front- projecting the African vistas into these scenes. The God-like intervention of the monolith in human evolution is the entire concept of the story, and I found it most effective in this opening sequence. The use of Ligeti's musique concrete is very effective here.Then comes the space travel to the orbiting station and the moon. This is a little slow, but the effects here were very beautifully done. I love the shot where you see the shuttle "falling" through the void of space toward the station. I don't believe these effects have ever been improved upon -- or ever will be.I must say, though, that I find it very irritating when filmmakers greatly overestimate the amount of technological advancement that will occur in the near future. It was obvious to anyone in 1968 that almost none of what is presented in this film was going to exist in 2001, much less in 2101. Massive orbiting space stations, huge moon bases, commercial space travel? Come on. Similarly, LA will not have 500-story skyscrapers and flying police vehicles in 2019 (Blade Runner), nor will we have cars driving on vertical highways in 2054 (Minority Report). These ridiculous predictions are even more irritating in the so-called "hard" science fiction movies like 2001, where Kubrick so obviously and pompously believed he was being scientifically accurate to the last detail.The character of Dr. Floyd (and his fellow scientists on the moon) is almost unbelievably dull and uninteresting (while seeming smug at the same time). Still, there is some real mystery and suspense as they investigate the monolith on the moon.Then we cut to the Discovery mission to Jupiter. The centrifuge is possibly the most remarkable set ever used in a film, and Kubrick filmed it remarkably. The background on the mission is conveyed in the most pedestrian way possible -- the astronauts listen to an interview they gave to the BBC. Then, suddenly a story that, while slow, has been focused on an interesting subject (discovering the purpose and meanings of the monoliths) gets hijacked by an incredibly tedious and drawn-out conflict between the astronauts and HAL the computer. Basically, HAL the supposedly perfect computer malfunctions and becomes homicidal for no conceivable reason and the two astronauts act incredibly slowly, moronically, and emotionlessly to try to stop him. The space walk/pod sequences are so ludicrously drawn out (and totally lacking in the visual beauty of many of the earlier effects sequences) that I had to fast forward through them. Hal locks Dave out of the ship, but he manages to get back in pretty easily (and why exactly did he not put his helmet on before going out in the pod in the first place?) This extreme detour into the HAL conflict (which I realize many people find the ONLY interesting part of the movie) kills most of the suspense and interest. Then comes the absurd Stargate sequence, the only effects in the movie that are really dated. The "slitscan" stuff looks like your average screensaver, and the rest is obviously landscapes from the Southwestern U.S. exposed with extreme purple and orange tints. The transformation of Dave into some mammoth, space-traveling fetus at the end is perhaps the most unintentionally funny thing I have ever seen in a movie.This is the only movie that Kubrick ever made that was not based on a previously published novel. Arthur C. Clarke's brief, almost plot less short story "The Sentinel" was the basis for this movie, and clearly not enough effort was made to develop the script here into more than a mere concept.George Lucas's first movie, THX 1138 (1971), was a similarly plot less, atmospheric sci-fi movie based on little more than a concept. After the failure of THX, Lucas set out to tell a warm, human story, and succeeded wildly with the low-budget classic American Graffiti. Then he had the best idea in movie history -- to take the brilliant special effects Kubrick had pioneered with 2001 and use them as part of a human adventure story with suspense, humor, and action. The result was of course Star Wars (1977), a movie you didn't have to be lying in the aisle stoned out of your mind to enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had to watch 2001: for a second time after so many years. The first experience wasn't so pleasant, I didn't really appreciate this film at all to say the least. Well, it was certainly a feast of mesmerising visuals for the senses. Unfortunately, though the ensuing storyline I felt was a tad confusing??especially the symbolistic signs and direction near the end.The quality of the production was flawless??the special effects, set designs, costumes and music was outstanding. The dialogue I felt was slow and drawn out, very frustrating after awhile. 2001: has greatness in a calm and collective way??I realise now how everyone would determine the significance of this film in their own minds, picking out what impressed them the most. My interpretation of 2001; was the beginning of creation, progressing through time and finally exploring space. The mysteries and questions are hurled at you....from all angles. At times it's difficult to comprehend, a truly thinking man's film. I hope I'm not the only one who didn't understand a few scenes??? I think a person would have to watch this film a few times to grasp further insight, it's not a film to just simply watch and forget. My lack of patience sometimes gets the better of me and for this reason I probably didn't enjoy 2001: as much as the majority.Nevertheless, I do agree it was a landmark film in it's day and still is...extremely indepth and awe inspiring, my rating - 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I both liked and disliked this movie at the same time. Kinda like my parents.I liked Elliot and the little girl that was also in Firestarter, which, by the way, was a hot movie. I thought the scene when they dressed the alien like a ghost and went trick or treating, then ended up flying on the bicycle was absolutely adorable. I think that Mr Kubrick was really on top of his game when he wrote that scene. I put the box of Kleenex that I usually keep next to my bed to good use during that scene.Now for the bad.Reese's Pieces? Really. Who eats those things? Do they even make them anymore? Would it have killed them to use some M&amp;Ms? Way to go Stanley. Cute little aliens visit our planet and all you can think of to give them is Reese's Pieces? Why not just give them a Charlston Chew. Or perhaps a Reggie Bar.Anyway. This movie was ok, if you ask me. I'd compare it to Earth Girls are Easy, or perhaps White Men Can't Jump.I'd suggest seeing this movie if you can rent it for $1.99 or less.</fullReview>

It literally took me almost 4 hrs in total to watch because I had to take a break and restart my brain to semi-normal functionality every so often. I mean this movie goes soooooo slooooow its ridiculous, to say that the script had about 10 pages of dialogue would be generous. They just don't talk!! And while talking isnt everything, and i admit there were some scenes where only the music was necessary, and the music is great, that was probably the best part, but then go listen to a symphony or something and forget about the movie. So many people give this awesome reviews, and for its time, i'd say the special effects and filmography is quite good, but as for the acting, or lack thereof, it just needed a little something more, no shootem ups or sex etc., profanity isnt even required, but a little more emotion, these guys were like stones, just sitting there with long faces. All in all, if you need something to calm yourself down, just play the movie, dont even start at the beginning if you've seen it before, just start anywhere, lay down, and relax, it'll put you right to sleep.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...because you're gonna need it.This film is too visually stunning to dismiss, but only the most devoted Kubrick fans (and psychedelic aficionados) will want to watch it again.First off, the photography, as in almost every Kubrick film, is stunning. The most talked about moments occur in the final half hour, with its imaginary vistas and color tinted close ups (inspired, seemingly, by Hitchcock's far superior "Vertigo"). But check out the middle scenes, with its austere set peices of perfect circles and quietly menacing machinery. And the opening segment, with the man-apes existing in a desolate, prehistoric world that is the opposite of 'noble' nature.If only that Kubrick could have seen fit to fill these lovely backgrounds with any kind of human warmth. The theme is a vague sort of Neitschean evolution of man into superman, but getting there is torturous and slow. (Arthur C. Clarke's concurrently written novel fleshes out the theme much more, and, since he and Kubrick collaborated on the story, anyone wanting an explanation of the story would be well advised to read the novel.) Early moments, played against the background of "Thus Sprach Zarathustra", have a monumental, symphonic feel, but most of the film is largely silent except for a rather annoying buzzing sound. In fact, since the dialogue is ultra minimal and fairly inconsequential (aside from the final moments of the computer HAL's "life"), you might want to watch it with the sound turned down and appropriate music (say, the Orb's "Orbus Terrarum") playing in the background.One gets the feeling that Kubrick has a genuine distaste for the humans in his story, as well as for the average viewer. This makes the film that much more distasteful. Those looking for a similar, though oppositely themed and more watchable, film experience should check out Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky's "Solaris" (soon to be available on DVD) In the meantime, Kubrick has made better films, particularly the masterful and darkly hilarious "Dr. Strangelove."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>CINERAMA !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this film about a dozen times in my life. Each time I see something new that makes me appreciate the genius of everyone who participated in its making.Most recently I had the thrilling experience of seeing "2001: A Space Odyssey" at the Uptown Theater in Washington DC - in full Cinerama. During the famous waltzing docking sequence, it was like being in space and seeing the space station with my own eyes. It literally made me vertiginous. The special effects in "2001" were created 34 years ago by craftsmen who filmed small physical models in a studio in England and actually made them look like gigantic objects in space. I will take that over lifeless CGI any day.Being able to see the tiny details in every frame was the best part of viewing the Cinerama print. After the scene where a primitive man uses a bone to kill another human (the first murder with a weapon?), he tosses the bone into the air, and a magnificent jump cut turns the bone into a satellite floating above the Earth. Brilliant enough. But this time, I noticed that the satellite has the star symbol of Communist China. Other satellites are shown, each with its own national symbol. They're not just satellites - they're orbiting WEAPONS.So basically, in the span of about 10 seconds of film, Kubrick has covered 3 million years of evolution. AND pointed out that we're still just animals trying to kill one another.This movie is NOT boring.</fullReview>

I have a slight problem with the latter.The usual argument when saying that this film is pants is that it is dated and it is too slow and boring. This basic teleological response to a vast and complicated film is understandable to a point. But to criticise the film by todays standards would not only be an injustice to the film but unfair to director Stanley Kubrick whose intent was not to create an accurate view of the future (It is science fiction after all).How can Kubrick be judged by todays standard of special effects. I'm sure if he was alive today he would consider perhaps even remaking the film with newer technology. He was only using the best available at the time.As for the film being boring I'm pretty sure that Kubrick knew it was going to be like this as he wasn't a stupid man. He was a known perfectionist and that is why he had such a hard and demanding reputation as a director. These long drawn out sequences were perhaps a way of showing the loneliness of space.The music is another common point of ridicule in this film. The only reason why audiences would cringe nowadays is because these sequences have been pastiched and parodied beyond belief. It is hard to see now the original effect unless you were there the first time around in 68.Overall I think that this is a remarkable film that deserves a little patience. Perhaps not the best film ever made but given the time it was released it is amazing (Before man had even landed on the moon!). This film deserves credit even if it is maybe a little flabby around the edges.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a huge science fiction fan, and even like comically atrocious movies like "Battlefield Earth". And as 2001 seems to be widely considered a masterpiece, I can only say: I don't get it. The movie itself is incomprehensible. There's a saying about baseball that it's three minutes of action packed into three hours of game. That's kind of like this movie. Vast swaths of it contain nothing; like the scene where one of the astronauts jogs through the spaceship. It's not a bad movie at all, it's just not one that I would see over and over again--perhaps it's supposed to be boring and make little sense. But even bewildering existential pieces should hang together, like "The Seventh Seal". In some ways I put the movie in the same category as "Star Trek: The Motion Picture". Long, long parts of the movie filled up with very clever special effects which were considered pretty gee whiz at the time. With computer generated fx these days doing amazing things, they're kind of tame. The best scenes in the movie are at the beginning with the widely known "apes coming into consciousness". As I understand it Arthur C. Clarke and Kubrick didn't really know what the movie was supposed to be about while they were filming it and Clarke only published the book afterward and sort of filled things in. Its too bad, because it's an interesting story that might have improved if the the plot actually had been developed before filming. I like the idea of a movie that's not rushed, like many these days, and doesn't clock you over the head with simplistic themes. And 2001 does have an interesting concept. The sequel was more easily understood, but more dismissed. All in all I was just kind of left with a confused feeling at the end, lots and lots of whys. The book sort of filled them in, but as a whole, the movie doesn't quite hang together. Enough to recommend seeing, but not enough to see again myself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stanley Kubrick's ambiguous science fiction epic continues to baffle audiences around the world, even more than three decades after it was filmed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The obvious question that someone is going to ask after watching 2001: A Space Odyssey is, `What was the meaning of that damn monolith?' Well, as is the case with the majority of great movies, 2001 spawns thinking and discussion. A movie that answers all of its questions neatly and in a timely manner can rarely be anything more than something to watch to kill a couple of hours. But 2001 is so creative and so mysterious that you really have to think about it and even watch it a few times over before you can begin to come up with a coherent meaning from it. This is a science fiction film for the thinking audience, as opposed to the fast food schlock that is cranked out by Hollywood (Mission To Mars, Pitch Black, Supernova, Armageddon, and other such nonsense), but with the obvious exception of the excellent Apollo 13. Kubrick's superior directing skills are a large part of what makes this movie such a classic. The circular space station provides him with an opportunity to film some unique versions of his traditional tracking shots, and there is also something to be said about the way that he was able to make a menacing character out of a computer that had no features other than a monotonous voice and that unblinking red eye. The award winning special effects easily surpass the vast majority of the computer generated special effects used in science fiction films today, flawlessly creating a world of zero gravity and isolation. There were several different methods that were successfully utilized in order to create a convincing outer space setting, such as near constant tilted frames, amazingly effective rotating sets, ever present humming sounds from the machinery, among other strange sounds, as well as the slowness of everything, which is present throughout the entire film, at least the entire film after that world famous jump cut.Speaking of which, I think that the cut from the bone flying through the air to the space ship floating through space was not done as well as it could have been. I think that the cut should have come a few frames sooner, when the bone had just started moving downward, so that the cut would be smoother, with the slow moving space ship. The story that follows also poses the question of how the monolith got to the moon, and even whether or not it is the same monolith as the Neanderthals found in the powerful Dawn of Man sequence. Was it really put there by an extraterrestrial species? Was it capable of moving on its own? What exactly was the effect that it had on individuals who came into contact with it? In the Dawn of Man sequence, it seemed that it gave at least one of the Neanderthals the intelligence burst of learning how to use something as a tool(or a weapon, in this case). But later in the film, it seems to have not only an intelligence (as it screams just before being photographed), but it has a less readily identifiable effect on humans ? in particular, on Dave Bowman. Dave is in space near Jupiter, he goes through some sort of warp, and suddenly he is in a strange mansion, and soon there are a number of editing tricks in which Dave sees his older self, and then becomes that older self. Soon, he is so old that he is barely alive, and the monolith appears in the huge bedroom in which he lies. He slowly reaches out to it, and then turns into that famous mystical fetus that this film has come to be famous for.Does this mean that the monolith is some sort of evolution stimulant? Did Dave evolve beyond present human kind to a state above the inconveniences of these vulnerable human bodies that we all possess? Who knows? Maybe Stanley Kubrick doesn't even know, but that's really not the point here. The point is that the movie really makes you think ? and not just about the meaning of the monolith, but also about the underlying theme about man vs. machine. 2001: A Space Odyssey is famous for a lot of things. It's famous because it was directed by Stanley Kubrick, of course, but also for a lot of other things - the opening sequence, that jump cut, the mysterious monolith, the realness of it all, even for the look of the Jupiter spaceship, which bears a strange resemblance to the Even Horizon. The sequel, 2010, clears up some of the mystery of this film, but even though that film is very good (although not as good as this one), that tying up of loose ends is not necessary for 2001 to remain one of the best and most fascinating science fiction films ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The future that wasn't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Today is the first day of 2001, a fitting day to comment on "2001," the now classic science fiction film that appeared in 1968. With "2001" director Stanley Kubrick permanently upgraded the technical quality of special effects used in science fiction films. The film comes up short if judged by the usual standards with its deliberately wooden acting, thin cryptic plot, and glacial pace. The story begins at the end of the twentieth century when a strange radio burst leads to the excavation of "the monolith," a smooth black wafer-shaped block (bigger than a Buick) that someone buried on the moon. This in turn leads to a secret mission to Jupiter in 2001 and the next stage in human evolution. It seems some extraterrestrial entity has been directing human evolution all along. The monolith actually appeared before ape-like creatures in the distant past causing an upgrade in their tool making abilities causing them to "go human" and eventually launch large and comfortable space stations. The movie provides us with a tour of the future where they have regular Pan American Airway shuttle trips between earth and space stations. You travel in your street clothes, with much more leg room then we have now on a flight to O'Hare. I particularly liked the super-detailed and lengthy instructions for the zero-gravity toilet. They sure got that part of the future right. But what of the rest? Well Pan American Airways went bankrupt and flew its last flight on December 4, 1991. There are no large comfortable space stations, no moon base, and NASA has become a lumbering bureaucracy using shuttle vehicles designed circa 1968! Then there is HAL, IBM's on-board Jupiter-mission computer with human-like consciousness who runs everything on the ship like a bossy mother-in-law. Unfortunately mid-mission HAL makes some bad calculations, get embarrassed, goes nuts, and kills all but one of the crew. Perhaps HAL tried to understand the directions for the zero-gravity toilet. Dave (Keir Dullea) the remaining crew member and HAL duke it out. HAL loses and gets unplugged. Well here we are in 2001 and we have nothing close to the machine intelligence exhibited by HAL. The word processor I'm using to write this (guess which one) is not very reliable and started behaving erratically, but at least it hasn't tried to kill me, yet. The movie is based on a story by Arthur C. Clark one of the science fiction writers best at predicting future technology. He got earth satellites right, but like all the others he didn't foresee microelectronics, HAL is much too big. Computers keep getting smaller as anticipated by the physicist Richard Feynman in his 1959 talk to the annual meeting of the American Physical Society: "There's plenty of room at the bottom." So "2001" was best at predicting the shape of future movies (wooden acting, excessive special effects) than future space travel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"2001: A Space Odyssey" is one of those films that is very difficult to describe. Kubrick's style is on display in full-force here. The film deals with a mission to Jupiter to find out what happened to another group of astronauts who had mysteriously disappeared years earlier. Kubrick analyzes the evolution of man, the meaning of life, and everyone's own spirituality in a very unconventional way. A great masterpiece in every sense, it is a must-see for all people who are serious about the cinema. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films ever make! (Possible Spoiler!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that this Kubrick masterpiece is one of the best films ever made, and easily the best science-fiction one. Nothing else even compares. It is unlike any other movie.I first rented this movie because my friend, a big movie fan, constantly praised it. The first time I watched it, I thought it was the most boring movie ever made. But I had heard before that it was difficult to watch, so I gave it another chance. Then I started to understand the brilliance of it.The movie is unique in the way that it forces the viewer to think, the way it makes you ponder many questions in order to understand. This is what makes it great.On the special effects side, this movie can practically hold its own against movies being made today, and it was released in 1968. Its image of space as being silent and slow-moving seems very realistic.As for the acting, I believe that the HAL 9000 computer gives a more emotional performance than any of its human counterparts. His death scene is a true classic and makes you feel more pity for him than when he killed his crewmates.Like I already said, I think that this is one of the greatest movies ever made, if not the best. I wholeheartedly recommend it. (10 out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Must be high to enjoy the prolonged time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying this movie is nothing more than an over-hyped piece of crap that people consider to be art due to it's iconic value. It is a pioneer that has influenced many later films and some TV shows. But, still, that doesn't mean it's good itself. First 20 or so minutes of the movie is unintelligible monkey interaction that caused me to literally fall asleep (I had to finish the next day). Then it's some vague dialogue and exposition that does a poor job of giving the audience an idea of what's happening. Let me say that up to this point, all of the scenes are unnecessarily elongated which supposedly gives this work more watching value. For example -- 10 minutes of a series of shots of rocks WITH music. This is not a symphony, this is a movie. People want to visualize, they want to see what's happening, not hear it with the misplaced sounds that give you the feeling of suspense.Throughout, you're left watching through a 2 hour bore. Nothing interesting happens until maybe an hour into the film... I forgot what happened there because most of it is just a flat, linear pit of nothingness you lose yourself into because you daydream while staring into the screen. But what happens in an hour can be shown in 30 minutes. Now imagine that. Most of it is prolonged shots and over established scenes. The plot, of course, inspired Interstellar, but who can deny the interest that movie induced? I loved that movie, but 2001 is just tedious in every way. You need to be high to enjoy this movie, simple as that. If you don't know, being high makes everything seem more interesting (in some cases), or better. Please, can anyone tell me what exactly there is to this film that no other has? Is it the soundtrack? The iconic plot that was a disappointment due to it's poor execution? Either way, I suppose people enjoy it because of the potential it DID have. Nonetheless, everything is opinionated, I suppose. That, of course, is only true in each of our own realities.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is time. I have been waiting years to watch this film, but there was always something more interesting + I was scared that it may bore me, knowing it is rather slow. I have recently watched Interstellar (2014) and it was one of the best films I have ever seen. I really don't think I will like " 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) " just as much, but who knows!? I loved Stanley Kubrick's " A Clockwork Orange (1971) ", so I hope it will be at least as good. Let's find out! 8 minutes ? and I have already seen several amazing sceneries that looked like fine art paintings. Another thing is that, everything you see is real. No CGI bs and it's all from 1968? 47 freaking years!!! It makes you wonder, how did he manage to do all those special effects 16 minutes ? wow? It is incredible how the director communicate with a viewer and show simple things in such great light 25 minutes ? the first dialogue? and I have a feeling that it has been said so much already 35 minutes ? 47 years and the special effect are still stunning? what a genius! 38 minutes ? the music is so good, I don't know if I am watching a film or listening to an orchestra in some exclusive philharmonic hall 1h 10minutes ? they had to build so many things, overcome so many limitations at their times and it all looks so majestic? what a joy too watch it 1h 16minutes ? wow? just wow at the special effects? and I am not talking here about dumb CGI or any other fake techniques! It really makes you wonder all the time, how on Earth did they manage to pull this off! 1h 27minutes ? it starts getting interesting, creepy and scary. Good, it was too calm for my taste! 2h 7minutes ? Not so interesting anymore? I was waiting for some more drama; man vs machine etc. but it happened so quickly and the rest? It's just nice visuals? 2h 18minutes ? just WTF? I think I know where did David Lynch get his ideas from?What a disappointment!!! This film could be so much more, something so amazing? but Stanley Kubrick has decided to go in a totally WEIRD direction with it? The most shocking thing is that, it lacks nice and interesting story (it's kind of ironic because 47-years old special effects were incredible! You would expect something totally opposite), it totally killed it for me?tgchan's rating: 6.5 /10</fullReview>

I suppose if I had watched this at the time it was released, I may have thought it was great! The special effects were brilliant considering the age of the film BUT what a waste of time! It was the slowest movie ever! In fact, during some of the 'arty' sequences, I just fast forwarded them such was my lack of patience with the film.It didn't start well with the black screen for several minutes, peaked when some of the characters had a discussion, then plummeted into special effects overload!Overall, a complete waste of time. The plot was shallow to say the least, the characters were as much of a vacuum as the space they were in and the over-egging of the special effects a drain on my patience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched 2001 expecting to be engrossed from start to finish, absorbed in the plot and visuals, but I wasn't.I made a mental note of how many times I slightly nodded off during the film, a total of eight, the biggest one at the end where I had to rewind to the journey sequence to Jupiter, which I fast forwarded again until I got some proper visuals of Bowman getting old.But for all the negative points above, I did enjoy the film.I'm therefore going to attempt to address some points that I haven't seen mentioned in the fifty or sixty reviews on IMDb I've already read.Firstly the positive.At first I thought the apes looked a little too much like men in costumes, until I realised they were supposed to look like that, especially at the end of this section when the aggressor apes become different in stature, more upright and visibly stronger and able to manipulate objects. The apes were vulnerable, and that was nice too.There's a section where the scientist calls his daughter on the advanced intercom device to wish her happy birthday and apologise for not being there, probably included by Kubrick to wow us back in 1968 as to what future intercom technology would be like, but it was a nice scene nonetheless, especially the distracted but still attentive nature of the little girl. I also appreciated the way $1.70 was charged for the call, pretty much like pre-paid credit in the modern age.The interior designs of the spaceships were really impressive and beautiful, although the chairs in the Hilton were bizarre. The curved aspects of the walkways, reflecting the round outer design of the spaceships seen from space was a nice touch too, with the interior design, snappy male suits and beautiful air-hostesses with weird hats, a real treat. While eating spacefood slop, each astronaut watched the news on his 1968 iPad equivalent, for example.HAL 9000 was the best part of the movie for me, especially his voice and calm rationale. Fixed camera settings on the red eye, the outline of his computer casing on the panel, in between eight or so flat screens. If you've seen 'Moon' with Sam Rockwell and the computer voice played by Kevin Spacey, you'll get extra joy from the deadpan HAL. The use of display panels in general was a real surprise too, sometimes simplified with a background colour and a single, abstract word.As to the negative.The HAL and character development part of the film was not enough. What should have been a dialogue between crew members concerning gradual suspicion about the motives of HAL turned into a simple "let's switch him off because he made a single improper diagnosis". HAL reacts to the threat of being switched off by eliminating the crew instead, which is fair enough from a computer's point of view, resulting in a single survivor eventually getting the upper hand and managing to achieve the desired disconnect sequence himself. I really loved the pleading by Bowman, asking HAL to let him back on board, followed, in contrast, by the pleading of HAL not to be switched off once the tables had turned.The space travel sequences were dull though. The outer space visual effects are praised by even the biggest critics of this film, but there is no real sense of perspective when spacecraft move across the screen, often feeling like cheap camera panning tricks used back in 1968. The visual effects in Star Wars just ten years later are better than this, in my opinion.The music was too much, going on and on and on, overly loud, repeating the Blue Danube at an extremely intruding level.Everything was just too drawn out and long in between scenes, obviously for the sake of art. I recently watched 'The Tree of Life' with Brad Pitt and really liked it, but funnily enough, the abstract scenes bored me in this film.For all that, I'm pretty on the fence overall. I like parts of it, dislike others. If Kubrick had concentrated on the plot and character development, for me this film would have been much better and less soporific. The parts of the film that were based around characters and interior design were terrific, but the space scenes were mostly uninteresting. And that's the surprise. I expected the opposite - terrific space visuals and a pretty boring story, instead of a pretty dull space movie with invigorating characters and brilliant interior design.</fullReview>

It is the father of the whole science fiction scene with is incredible images and the way Kubrick made to create these.2) That being said this is the most boring movie i have seen in my life the characters have no personality at all and the story is bland. I have not calculate it but i surely think that more than half of the movie is some image without any sound. Maybe that it's me that doesn't understand it but i don't get the purpose of it after 1 or 2 time we see the wonderful images if half of the movie is made of it this will certainly be boring To conclude a cinema classic but deadly boring and an other time sorry for the poor English i wish i can at least be understand pleasure Max</fullReview>

That's right druggie, when i say that my guess is that even though no one landed on the moon just yet 1968 was rolling around hippies and all, along with the Vietnam War. This movie was very slow and dull, scenes seemed to last forever, audio was repetitious, and talk was minimal and well monotone. Now I'm debating if i bother watching any other Kubrick film. I'm 18 (don't do drugs) and action i can do without sometimes, but this just bored me i'm surprised i made it to the end, i was confused so much of the time because of the little to no talk i didn't have a clue what was going on.

		<shortDescription>Beauty is the word</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey is a 1968 science fiction film by Stanley Kubrick (who happens to be my favourite director as well). Being my favorite film, I have recommended this it to almost everyone I know. This review is more like an answer to those who found this film slow-paced, and for those yet to watch it, you may continue to read this as a disclaimer to the film- I'll give you a word- Beauty Beauty is an under-rated concept. Sure, you'll often see nice photography and so on in films. But when did you last see a film that contains beauty purely for the sake of it? There is a weird belief among cinema-goers that anything which is not plot or character related must be removed. This is depressing hogwash. There is nothing wrong with creating a beautiful sequence that has nothing to do with the film's plot. A director can show 15 minutes of spaceships for no reason than that they are beautiful, and it is neither illegal nor evil to do so.'2001&#x2032; requires you to watch it, in a different way than you normally watch films. It requires you to relax. It requires you to experience strange and beautiful images without feeling guilty that there is no complex plot or detailed characterization. Don't get me wrong, plots and characters are good, but they're not the be-all and end-all of everything. There are different kinds of film (this being the best of all), and to enjoy '2001&#x2032; you must tune your brain to a different wavelength and succumb to the pleasure of beauty, PURE beauty, unfettered by the banal conventions of everyday films.'2001&#x2032; is primarily a technical film. The reason it is slow, and filled with minute details because the aim was to realistically envision the future of technology (and the past, in the awe inspiring opening scenes including an amazing jump cut sequence). The film's greatest strength is in the details. Remember that when this film was made, man still hadn't made it out to the moon but there it is in 2001, and that's just the start of the journey. To create such an incredibly detailed vision of the future that 35 years later it is still the best we have is beyond belief ? I still can't work out how some of the shots were done.The film uses invisible but powerful forces to manipulate the plot but perhaps the most overwhelming one is the picture's vision of man In Kubrick's fantasy, the Golden Age of man was a neglected instant between a man-ape's exaltation at discovering the first weapon and a nuclear-powered spaceship floating in a graceful orbit around the Earth. Man has indeed evolved As a spectacle "2001&#x2033; assaults the mind, eye and ear, with stimulating images and suggestions. We are surrounded by a totally believable futuristic environment.The film is filled with brilliant sequences and extraordinary moments: The first interesting minutes in which the story of the apes is told visually, without a single line of dialog; the zero-gravity toilet with its great list of instructions; the stewardess defying gravity by walking the walls calmly upside down; the frightening moment when we realize that HAL is reading the astronauts lips; the magical alignments of Sun, Moon, and Earth; the "Starchild" returning home to charm the orb. "2001&#x2033; is filled with poetic imagery: the view of the Sun rising over the Earth; the tossing of the bone into the air in slow motion; the slow images of the giant spaceship revolving in a cosmic ballet. "2001&#x2033; is also a work of great visual acuity. It allows us to view more than the mystery of existence and destiny implicit in every man. Its end troubles many viewers as they demand clarity where there can only be mystery. They insist upon an answer where there can only be a question. Every viewer had a different explanation of the mysterious end of Kubrick's film. But for those who can accept mysticism, the climax is deeply moving."2001&#x2033; is unique among films in content and scope. The cinematography is out-of-this-world, the special and visual effects are breathtaking, and the classical music is sublime. Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey" is art in the highest sense, like Leonardo da Vinci's "Mona Lisa", or Van Gogh's "The Starry Night". It is actually more than that!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2001: A Space Odyssey -- "a never ending journey"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Written by a genius Arthur C. Clarke and directed by a genius Stanley Kubrick, 2001: a space odyssey is absolutely the CLASSIC of sci-fiction movie, one of the GREATEST film ever made! I am just 21 years old so sure I didn't sit in cinema and watch this movie in 1968. I just watched it few months ago. Impressive! It blows me away! If u think it is nothing as it is an old movie, you are totally WRONG. Awesome visual effect, amazing classical music are not enough to describe this film. The most successful way of it is its plot. In 1968, during its premier, handsome hunk actor Rock Hudson and few Hollywood colleagues walked out the theater without finishing this film, they said:"Can someone tell me what the hell it is about?" Until now, a lot of people still don't get it and push this movie aside from their consciousness. The theories of this film are so deep..deep until hard to see, or should say it is abstract. Also, it touch a issue that some god believer don't believe ? evolution, and this film eventually delivers an idea about "what is god". I am not critiquing anyone?I watched it again with one of my friend who is so believe in god and he didn't refuse it. As a biologist, I believe in evolution as a gradually changing, a sort of cell-by-cell adaptation process across time. This film made some hypothesis in human evolution and starts an amazing and mystery journey in space. To understand this film, you have to imagine FREELY. A biologist may understand it in certain ways, a philosopher, god believer may understand it in different, different ways? Now, I think I understand it more than 90%, but after some years, I may see it differently?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have got to say that it is one of the best films ever made. It is a visual symphony. This would go down in the history as a treasure. You could spend a billion dollars, hire the finest directors, scour through hundreds of books for material, design the unprecedented special effects and set pieces and attempt to create a wonder like this, but I bet it I would still be a challenge so formidable, such as to be so sensually and philosophically and technically gratifying as this movie.The movie starts with the dawn of man on a desert landscape about 2million years ago. The ape-make up is too realistic to believe they were actually actors. The mystery starts when a black monolith appears to the apes and they somehow learn to use tool for kill prey for food, thus the transformation of ape in to man. This premise was wonderful and the background score (György Ligeti's Requiem) for this monolith was terrific. From the perfect shape of the monolith it is implied that it came from an alien intelligence for the purpose of transforming intelligent life. Then comes the famous match cut to a space ship 2million years later. And then comes arguably one of the most beautiful scenes ever seen in a movie, with the Blue Danube waltz (by John Strauss II) multiplying the effect; the dramatic docking of the space ship with space station and the voyage to the moon. The decor used in the space ships are splendid and the costumes of the actors were apt. The moon landscapes made me crave for moon, something which never even the Apollo landing pictures did for me. The black monolith appears again to the visitors at site on the moon implying that there is going to be an extraordinary leap of human intelligence. The radio waves form the monolith seems to point towards the Jupiter and so the mission to the Jupiter commences. HAL 9000, the computer which runs the ship for the mission to Jupiter was particularly terrifying in its tone of voice and the scary close up of it. The scene where HAL reads the lips is shown magnificently by turning the camera alternately between Bowman and Poole. In the end part the monolith appears again taking the space ship thru a kind of worm hole into another kind of world. The climax is philosophical and open for many interpretations.Many complain the slowness of the movie, but it is what that really did it for me. The director of the film, Stanley Kubrick is a genius. I have loved his other movies, Dr.Strangelove, Paths of Glory, Barry Lyndon, Full Metal Jacket, the director never wavered in sculpting absolute pieces of art, any person could dream of. The extraordinary thing I felt about the director is the way he can take the most complicated subjects and interpret it through his extraordinary vision.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smart, but way too slow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is often hailed as one greatest masterpieces of cinema and while I do admit that it is a quite clever movie I never got into it. Why? Because so little happens and the movie lasts for two and a half hours while it could do with 15 minutes (which is the amount of time it takes to show a ship landing on the moon in this). There weren't even any real characters except HAL 9000. He was the only thing in the movie with personality and he was a computer and the antagonist. I don't see why I am supposed to care. Not to mention I had no idea what was going on in the last half hour. And while the effects hold up and the concept is fascinating the movie was never engaging or exciting in any way. It's not the fact that I wanted an action movie or anything. I just wanted to be entertained and I wasn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie with lot of expectation after seeing all hype. But totally disappointed. Though it has a great visual and also shown in aesthetic way. Considering the time it was made, the concept for future and the way it has been shown is awesome. It feels so real sometime you feel like being in space. But that's the only good part. It has no story or at least I'm not able to find anything, staggeringly slow, and the overuse of background music sometime becomes so annoying. I have seen lot movies with great visual but they are not worth mentioning just because they lack story. Don't understand why this movie has been treated differently from those movies. Forgetting about the time it was made, I feel it very hard to appreciate it. Then again it all depends person to person and we agree to disagree.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great but aloof film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey is a fantastic example of cinematography. It is also an example of how films can be theme driven as opposed to story driven. I don't think that it is however as good on every level as some of the other films that we have seen so far.Stanley Kuberick is famous and celebrated for being one of the best directors of all time. The reasons why this is are evident throughout the film. Kuberick uses perfect visual and sound based techniques in setting out what he wishes to achieve. An excellent example of this is the strange but surreal opening few minutes, with nothing but a black screen and music playing. Or perhaps, the excellent shot which has already been mentioned of the bone being thrown into the air which then fades into the modern day space craft.What this film lacks in simple narrative, it makes up for in it's use of themes. There is perhaps one main theme which the film is presenting, with many minor ones used to back it up and to move the plot forwards. However everything in the film, I think, links into the central theme of Evolution. The character of HAL, is perhaps one of the most talked about, and remembered parts of this film, and this is for a reason, without HAL the film would lack a certain edginess. The use of HAL to back up the theme of evolution is apparent. Where as the Obelisk uses slow advances, teaching the apes to use tools, the humans make massive and uncertain jumps, making a machine which is more intelligent and powerful then themselves. In some ways this could be seen as a religious agenda, with the Obelisks as a god like force, who progress humanity in a correct and sensible way, but with the humans themselves playing God, and ultimately getting it very wrong.Arthur C Clark, the writer of the screenplay and novel, is an interesting figure. He has stated during his life that he was 'Fascinated by the idea of god'. This statement is proved to be correct in much of his work, especially 2001. However, I wouldn't like to say that Clark uses the film as a vehicle for God, or any such statement. In my view the film is perhaps more of a commentary on how God can be explained as a part of the universe, and not outside it. Although the film has strong religious and divine tones, I would still strongly argue, that the focus is still more on this being a natural as opposed to a supernatural phenomenon.I must talk briefly about the ending of the film. Since it's release the ending of the picture has been one of the major talking points about the film, and rightly so. It can be interpreted in many different ways what the ending of this film actually means. I like the ambiguity of it, to me it fits with the way the film works. The film is all about Evolution and how we evolved into our current situation, the main option the film offers is of course the Obelisk/God route. However by making the ending so ambiguous it is perhaps a nod to the fact that we don't and are unlikely to be able to know how we came to be, as that fact itself is ambiguous to the extreme. The widely accepted, and my personal view of the ending, is that it is the Obelisk pushing humanity on to it's next big step, and Dave's seclusion and life is his being prepared for what he will become.There are flaws with the film, and it is by no means perfect. I think that much of the acting is very substandard, although this film was never about the acting I still think that it is a let down to what is otherwise a great film. The only actor I can truthfully say did a good job was HAL. Also the film, as has been said, is really not one to be watched on a Small screen. The full effect of the film is better grasped when viewed in a cinema. Although the narrative is missing for a reason, and has been replaced with the themes, I still think that the film suffers for this.. Something which lacks a strong narrative is likely to become too aloof, and will be hard to follow for many people. The films lack of narrative definitely dents the accessibility of the film, and has given it a somewhat pretentious and intellectual reputation, which in a lot of ways it does deserve, but is still a shame as some people will be missing out on a fine example of what a film should be.I give 2001 a solid 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best of SF!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It achieves excellence for its vision of realistic space flight, speculative spacecrafts, HAL 9000 (as a sentient computer or simulator of sentience), possibly an ancient alien transport and information pathway system (in the Star Gate sequence), a star child (perhaps an intelligent space dwelling being), and alien technology (the Monolith) that is so advanced in science it would look to us like magic (per one of Clarke's maxims of prediction: "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic"). And perhaps it flaunts a Nietzschean-like evolution of intelligence from our ape ancestors, to humans, to machines, to a star child.2001 has high artistic appeal and is one of the most influential SF movies (BFI Sight &amp; Sound 2002 Top Ten). It shows that one can fit speculative science into a SF movie without losing artistic value.Timothy Ferris uses 2001 as an example of a cosmic information intelligence network, mainly for the film's portrayal of an ancient -- yet extinct -- alien pathway system with Trumbull's light effects near the end of the movie ("Coming of Age in the Milky Way", a popular science book). Ferris imagines it as nature's way of evolving an intelligence on a massive scale (much in the same way Carl Sagan does in his Cosmos series and in Contact).It has many little gems of speculation, such as its subtle stance on artificial intelligence. Kubrick was careful to offer opposing points of view and cite difficult questions. The script never explicitly claims that HAL is intelligent or sentient; it actually remarks that some scientists claim it merely mimics sentience. And it doubts whether we could know if HAL has emotion. Though HAL seems intelligent and emotional (and could be for all we know). Perhaps these are not scientific questions anyway, so Kubrick's critical approach is best since it doesn't take a definite position on such philosophical questions.The scientific value of the movie is in its very fabric. The astronauts work methodically similar to the way I see NASA conduct its missions on the NASA channel. They use computers and communications with earth to guide their troubleshooting and repairs, for example. It also replaces the emphasis on militaristic chains of command of "Star Trek" or "Forbidden Planet" with a more modern, scientific, technical way of operating. There are scientific flaws in specific details, but science itself is littered with failed attempts that were crucial to future scientists. Where would we be without the reintroduction of the ancient Greeks into western civilization? (So, yes, Aristotle is wrong about almost everything while also being very important arguably. See James Burke's documentary series, "Connections", for this sort of argument.)Even though the climax has humans combating our flaws and a homicidal computer, it leaves us with a boundless vision of advancement and future possibilities. The movie foreshadows this by (seemingly) beginning from an alien perspective and using repetition of the alien probes/monoliths to get us to feel their technological superiority and presence (or at least feel the same mystery the characters feel from their new discoveries). But it leaves us with a vision of an advanced space civilization, a new space species, and a chance for science and technology to be important to our future perhaps. Believe it or not this is rare in SF!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Purely Brilliant! A True Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching this today, I have two words to describe this movie: Pure Masterpiece.I loved everything about the movie. The dialogue, the adventures, the segments. This movie is just pure dramatic. It was also kind of strange that a very old man in the "Jupiter and Beyond The Infinite" segment turned into a baby in a ball at the very end. It was just so spectacular, you would want to watch it again and again. The special effects were also great as well.I thought the classical music pieces of the movie just matched up really well with the scenes of the movie. I also often like to play "Echoes" from Pink Floyd while watching the final segment (I happen to be a lover of audio/video combinations). You can try it too. IF you have the album Meddle from Pink Floyd as well as this movie, turn on the mute before you get to the Jupiter and Beyond The Infinite segment. Set up Meddle and set to track 6 "Echoes" and pause before the third ping, then press play when the screen title comes up to Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite.For anyone (even if you're not a sci-fi fan), this is very highly recommended. My rating: 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good effects, but unexciting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Obviously this movies deserves applause for its amazing special effects, very accurate scientific depictions, and synergy of music and visuals effects. However, from the perspective of an 18 year old in 2009, I don't think that this was a particularly good movie. It's understandable that 2001 won Oscars for its visual effects, but I really thought it was boring. I concede that it's nice to experiment in film by having very little dialog, but this particular film is not geared towards the teens today who have a particular affinity to films with action, drama, and raw emotions. The ending didn't really make sense to me, and I did not really think that displaying all of the colors inside Jupiter for 20 minutes was a wise use of time. The visual effects inside Jupitor didn't even look particularly difficult to produce. Overall, this seems to be a movie for people who like to reflect on their 1968 state of mind and aspirations, but not a fit at all for the movie-fanatics of today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie when I was 7 for the first time. I was fascinated. The sky seemed so very different that night. I won't forget that feeling, ever. Now after 20 years, I must say that the same old impression remained intact. Trust me, even a child of 7 can understand concepts like: endless space, human origins, humanoid robots (&amp; robotic humans), murder (sempre), immortality, aliens, reincarnation... Each time I watched this movie again, I was eagerly waiting for 2 hours to see the last (fantastic) 30 minutes, and 29 more minutes to see the final, overwhelmingly "paralyzing" scene.What is the scene? Is it some kind of hope... or simply ? life and all that life represents? Is life bigger than everything, and is the human being bigger than the whole cosmos? Could it be the first, in fact ? primordial ? step after death? Is it "everything there is", the axiomatic state?Why do I always have to wait for the end, for only a few seconds experiencing immortality? And the feeling, that after death wins the battle, it is life that stays, or outbreaks? (Socrat said that "life springs from the death.") Does that mean that one should die to become immortal? The whole galaxy and records of time narrow down to a tiny little fetus (no, it's not a baby)... completely motionless, eyes wide open (!), frozen in timeless, space-less... The Fetus Strikes Back! OK, that is more than profound, it is... well, the image of the fetus is HERE, in my mind, doesn't go away, and never will! The fetus is the ultimate destination! The fetus is GOD!But why would all those aliens, angels, machines, life (?) forms... bring us back to the beginning of the completely SAME STATE OF EXISTENCE (more or less)? And the same story just to be a fetus, again and again... And forever. "Mommy, I don't wanna die!"... But when I DO die, I doubt that I will be a giant fetus staring at (or starring before) this earth? Or even worse, on my way back?! (I would use the light speed or teleport myself as far away as possible! But before departure, I would use a giant needle, puncture the earth, and blow it away!...joke) Anyway, I wanna live now! NOT after 2 hours and 29 minutes! NOT in a fetal shape! I'm a big girl! And whether I'm gonna have a baby to make myself feel immortal is MY choice! I'll get my own little bigger-than-life "fetus" once... and I advise that to everyone else!But since I am female, and this interpretation of that archaic image could be due to that (the maternal instincts &amp; sh*t), that might not have been the point Kubrick wanted to make (men probably interpret the fetus as themselves, which was my case as well, when I was 7, that is). It is supposed to be the offspring of a new, improved human race? Now, we all know that men are physically stronger, even through history, the majority of geniuses were male, blah blah... And Dave... is a perfect one. Only astronauts can be that healthy, strong, beautiful, intelligent, self-controlled ? even to the extent to be able to conquer HAL's HUMAN impulses?! Dave succeeded to perforate the orbit of humanity and reach Jupiter. Dave is a superman! No, Dave is NOT a superman! He is not even a man! Dave seems to be the least human, even less than HAL. Dave reached those "superior" beings, to change the course of humanity, as the best genetic material on this earth, and once again, the changing of a course occurs, as in the "dawn of man". And there lies a hope. That's nice of him.But wait, where is female in all that? Do aliens have a constructed womb? Because that symbol, in this case, would be the whole universe. I only got to see some kind of "aura" around the embryo. Does the fetus have a penis? I guess not, it doesn't need one. For it doesn't need female, that non-perfect creature. Everyone seems to be male in this movie, even HAL! Are they gay or what?Freud would probably disagree and laugh at the idea of someone surpassing those disgraceful, degrading instincts and finding the way to transform into something that "neat" and "perfect", that doesn't derive from the filth, or "urges". But then again, Freud was not an "artist"? However... by casting one glance at the current phase and how distorted this world has become, I doubt that even aliens could do a lot about that. Even if "Dave" existed, which I also doubt. Well, if he did, I wouldn't let him go surfing the space, and copulate with a bunch of aliens. Tesla would advise him otherwise, so in the end I would probably have to make an ultimatum: "Me or him (them) ? make a choice!". And that would leave me heart-broken.The sad truth is, humans only reached the moon, stabbed a flag into it and came back here. "A small step for a man, a giant leap for mankind". Of course it's a giant leap, since humanity is smaller than a fly's hive, even a fly would cross that route quicker, and reach it's "destination"! (One of the best parodies based on the trip to the moon was depicted in "Baron Munchausen"!) How far did we get really? Not too far, it seems. We are still amusing ourselves in the slime. We can't cure a pimple. And we are still underestimating the power of the dark side. Ooops, I mean, the power of the nature.Whether this movie would have such a significance in case the fetus didn't flash in front of our eyes in the end, is I guess, irrelevant. For it is perfect just the way it is. A pure, sublime fantasy. Along with the magnificent music, perhaps above everything else...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched 2001 on TMC (one of many viewings over the past 20 years or more). I've always liked the movie, and I've always appreciated the symbolism and art of the movie, and I've always felt that this movie is largely under-appreciated by most people. But I still have to say that there are places where this movie is just too dog-gone slow. The non-dialogue, artsy-type scenes of this movie could be cut as much as in half or more at times without really affecting the overall mood and communication of symbolism.For example, the scene where Dave travels through space &amp; time at the end - does it really have to drag on as long as it does? Or is this just a chance to show a 1968 audience some really groovy psychedelic effects? The extended version of this movie has no dialogue for the first 45 minutes! Yes, 45 minutes! OK, we get it. Dawn of man. Monolith appears. Intelligence is sparked in primitive man. Man uses intelligence to fashion tools for hunting, crafting, and killing each other. We get it. Next scene, please.Well, that's enough comment from me. I have to go take my ritalin now. ;-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this film alone one cold evening at the Astor theatre in Melbourne a couple of years ago, I was baffled at the ticket price- $25 but paid nonetheless. It was only afterwards I found out the lead actors Kier Dullea and Gary Lockwood where going to do a Q &amp; A session- coming out from the US. Now, the Astor theatre is the only 'classic' style cinema left in Melbourne; it has just one screen (albeit quite large) and seating capacity for a large crowd.From the opening sequence- 3 minutes of blackness, accompanied by music to mirror the void, it was clear that '2001: A Space Odyssey was going' to be a large scale film. The thing I found remarkable about the film was how well the two most powerful elements of film, music and (of course) the visual picture, where crafted together. It is the synthesis of the two that makes this film great, and it is greatly aided by the powerful and memorable score. Indeed, the film won the 1969 Oscar for visual effects, while the masterful direction of Stanley Kubrick earned him a nomination.It is difficult to describe the plot of '2001' without boring you, my good reader, to death. I'll therefore leave it at this; monolith (cubical wall?), Monkey, HAL-9000, mission to Jupiter. This movie has borne many famous and spoofed scenes and to any who know nothing about the film, he/she/it/walrus will find the watching of this quite informative.If you like direct action, look somewhere else, to keep it simple- no guns are fired. It must be said though, that because one can only watch this in a rare, insightful mood, it is not suitable for everyday viewing. Any way bugger off now?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot contained in the 2:23 runtime of this movie could have been compressed into three fifteen minute episodes, and still been as confusing as the full 2:23. At the end of it, one has a vague concept of a fantastic history of human cosmology, but that's it.That said, the remaining hour and a half of stubbornly stunning and gratuitous visuals of space features, spaceships, and people walking in zero-G make up an overstuffed, artery-clogging rich sci-fi environment -- one which anyone living on the planet earth after 1977's Star Wars will find entirely unnecessary, and pale in comparison.All of this together leaves one feeling they've been insulted or tricked out of a small chunk of their life, in a relatively effective and intriguing way. Some movies leave you feeling that was cheaply. This movie did so with extravagant style.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not just a movie, a glimpse of the sublime. One of the most beautifully crafted films I've ever seen. Sure it's slow but when the drama comes it pierces right to the bone. I've heard the philosophy behind the film criticised for being naff. I don't understand how people can say that. This film comes from the heart. It questions deeply: why are we here? what is the nature of consciousness? what does it mean to be human? I don't think it tries to answer these questions. Rather it stares right into the abyss of our existence and says YES, it's all worth it. Is this naff? Not to me. It's the most inspiring cinematic experience I've had so far.

		<fullReview>People may say that in film everything does not have to be about plot, that some how you can just have pretty images on the screen and it is thus a good movie. Me? I don't think so this movie was too ahead of its time, not in visuals, but in audio any movie from this era suffered from the fact that any sound that can be made no matter no pleasant or unpleasant, can be made into the most shrill, annoying sound you will ever hear, and in this movie there is plenty of that not only do you get to listen to heavy breathing for about 20 minutes, but you also get to hear the air hose, which was extra special.Again like all movies of the time the score sucked, the classical music that was pared up with the scenes conjured up an air of fantasy, something you don't want to do in a film about the future.Yet again another movie killer, the acid trip scenes, what is with those, was every one high in the 60's 70's? I mean come on, did people back then really want to see 20 minutes of what looks like what happens if a clown exploded. yea all the colors are pretty, but enough is enough.The end puts you at a loss for words, I honestly believe the director just made up a random ending and said "Interpret this, I'm not telling you what it means"One last thing, the pace of this movie was SSSSSSSSSLLLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWW there are so many pointless scenes in this movie, if I was watching it in theaters I could go home , cook dinner, bring it back to the theater and then eat while I wait 10 minute for something to happen. But, some people may argue that the scenes where long and boring because of the "beauty" and that every scene (no matter how long, and I mean long) has to be part of the plot, well WRONG, every scene longer than 10 seconds HAS TO be part of the plot, otherwise it's "I have a huge budget, look what I can do." Its a movie, if you want beauty go to your local science center there are plenty of movies without plots but beautiful scenery,(and some with beautiful scenery AND plot, who knew you could do both"The good parts of this movie that didn't have me reaching for my ear plugs where actually quite decent and if the whole movie has like these few parts it would have gotten an 9/10, but all this is, is 1 hour of movie one hour and a half of visual effects.

		<shortDescription>A sequence of brilliance that clocks in under an hour surrounded by garbage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can understand why some love 2001 A Space Oddessy. It contains some of the best filmaking I've seen by Kubrick or any other director. It contains haunting and perfectly rendered sequences of science fiction beauty that is as great as any film called a masterpiece or anything done by Kubrick. Some may argue that it is the best work Kubrick has done. It's intense and captivating, and it's less than 1/3 of the running length. This is a structurally odd film. We are treated to a number of sequences that seem almost self-contained and then the film ends almost inexplicable with a scene of grace and beauty but only in a complete non-substantial sense. Basically, the majority of the film, which encapsulates on both ends the segment, is extremely pretty and amazingly conceived sequences of music and imagery without meaning or purpose that fail to captivate beyond their own visual and auditory beauty. There must have been some higher intention on the part of Kubrick and his writer here, but I think that it was just lazy filmaking on their part.Anyone with a knack for photography and arrangement can do what they did. It's incorporating that with a compelling something that makes movie-making on par with that beauty, and they do that, in the one sequence, while the remainder is simply a waste. Rent the movie and watch the whole thing, because it is worth experiencing, but I bet that there'll be only one part that really felt worthy of its craft.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A landmark film in science fiction.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I vaguely remember seeing this film when it first came out in 1968. I was only 7 years old at the time, and it was at a drive-in theatre. When I asked my mother about it many years later, she said that as far as she could recall, it didn't seem to her I had been bored by the movie -- an amazing thing considering many adults find the movie boring.Even after having seen and been wowed by the special effects in Star Wars (I saw it 11 times in the theatre during its original run) and being amazed by the special effects in Jurrasic Park, I still say 2001 is the best science fiction movie ever made.As an adult I do not understand a lot of the philosophy of the movie but have been able to discern enough to figure out that it probably doesn't agree with my view of "life, the universe and everything." That still doesn't change my opinion about the movie. Considering it was made in 1968, the special effects are astounding and surpasses many of today's science fiction films. It's a great movie that set the standard for films to come.One last comment. I recommend 2001 fans to read Arthur C. Clarke's book "The Lost Worlds of 2001." It explains a lot of things about the movie and offers some interesting insights into how the movie and the book came into existence. It also includes Clarke's short story "The Sentinal" from which the idea for the movie, and again, the book, came.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen a lot of movies in all my life, Great ones, bad ones, regular ones, crap ones and masterpieces, but this movie beats them all, all movies in existence. It has special effects really outstanding, great acting, beautiful directing, awesome plot, this one is 10 points all around. If you like Class A movies you need to see this one, even more if you like Sci-Fi. For me, it has the best opening and ending ever in a movie. With a wonderfulsoundtrack as well, one to remember with distinguished tracks. You feel the space like any other director has ever done and get really get sucked in this voyage into space, with philosophical matter with apparently no sense, that you will need to pay attention to every line. Truly a Masterpiece to serve as a model in film history no matter which genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>mythic tale of death and rebirth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have watched this movie more times than I can remember. The first time I saw it I was in seventh grade and I didn't understand it at all. It's one of those films, like Alfred Hitchcock's "Vertigo," that grows on you the more you see it. My favorite part (although I used to hate it) is the "Dawn of Man" sequence. The African photography is beautiful, and the apes (australopithecus?) are so convincing it's hard to believe they're really actors in ape suits. The acting in this movie is often underrated; Keir Dullea's boyish good looks and calm, reassuring demeanor bring to mind real-life astronauts such as John Glenn and Neil Armstrong, and William Sylvester is perfect as the glad-handing bureaucrat Dr. Heywood Floyd. I think Kubrick meant for the film to be enjoyed as a visual experience rather than analyzed for any deeper meaning, but for what it's worth, I see it as a Buddhist(or possibly Hindu) myth of birth, death, and rebirth. But the best way to watch the movie is to just sit back and enjoy the music and photography without worrying too much about the plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey is a true masterpiece. I watched it after hearing great comments and reviews about this film. I was confident it would just be a big disappointment. I was wrong.2001: A Space Odyssey is as much as a film as it is a work of art. Before you watch this film you have to really slow yourself down, relax, sit back and be patient. It is a very slow movie, and the opening sequence is about 10 minutes of shots of open land, when almost nothing happens (I know there are many people who would have just given up on this by now and turn of the TV, I almost did.) The CGI is incredible, and it is hard to believe that the movie was made in 1968, almost 40 years ago, when it could have been made as recently as 1998.The movie was based on a book which had very little plot, and so did the movie but that changes nothing. The whole film is a mystery, and leaves you with tons of questions throwing themselves at you from all directions. What are all these strange black monoliths? Why does everything seem to change when they appear? Where did they come from? What are they doing? What is this film about? Anyone who attempts to answer these questions are going to have thousands disagreeing with them. This film has a lot of different opinions, and always will have.Another amazing thing in this film is HAL 900, the machine that controls the ship, the machine with apparently no error whatsoever. The perfect machine. HAL 900 backfires, the machine itself loses its mind. This film is rated G or U depending what country your in, meaning anyone can see it and anyone can buy it. Yet when HAL 900 starts to break down, it is almost like a real human going insane, and I was more terrified of him than I ever was of Freddy Krueger, Jason, Micheal Myers or Pinhead. Although he is just a computer, as you get deeper into the film you see him as a real human and a real human losing his mind is terrifying, especially when hes controlling the whole ship, even the Oxygen.2001, A Space Oddyesey, may be the greatest film ever made. The colors, camera angles and effects all sum up to make it a two hour masterpiece. The ending is so odd you cannot spoil this film for anyone, because they will most likely look at it in a different way than you. This is by far Kubricks best invention, and may be the greatest film ever made.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A qualified success</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently I viewed this movie again. Although the story becomes muddled starting with the Jupiter and beyond sequence, nevertheless the movie deserves praise for its special effects and its attempt to delve into the origins of man. And although the story has little action and sparse dialog, it nevertheless succeeds in engaging the audience's attention and maintaining a certain level of suspense, at least for the majority of the film. The problem is that the film ends not with a bang but with a thud. What starts off as being intriguing and at times almost sublime ends in a quagmire of uncertainty as the audience is left wondering what to make of the final scenes. Leaving the audience guessing is not a good way to end a movie and for that reason the movie can be characterized only as a qualified success. When I first saw this movie years ago, I was so intrigued by the music and special effects that I would have rated it a 10. But, alas, time marches on and so does my taste in movies. Recently I happened to watch this movie again and to my chagrin I found it BORING. What made the movie even more unpalatable was the pretentious and muddled story ... or message ... or cryptic allegory ... or whatever, that left me feeling profoundly annoyed. What the heck is this movie about anyway? I liked the beginning with the actors jumping around in monkey suits screaming at each and fighting and, well, acting a lot like people, but when the movie introduced the obelisk ... and then the space station ... and then the talking computer with an attitude ... and then the astronaut growing old ... and then a baby in a capsule looking at earth ... I knew that somewhere there was a message, but it was a message not received by me because frankly, my dear, I didn't give a hoot. The one character in the movie I liked, in fact the only character in the movie that is worthy of the term "character," was the computer. If the movie had just been about the computer, and how well he ... or she ... or it ... sang "Daisy," I might have liked this movie a lot more. This movie is an example of people getting in the way of a perfectly good story. Let the computer explore space. People have more important things to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful film - great plot but...WTF?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard about 2001 practically my whole life of 33 years before I actually got to see it. The anticipation for this film was fantastic on my part. I simply could not wait to see what Kubrick had cooked up; my brother - the family sci-fi expert - wouldn't part with any details.So I sat down and watched this movie in complete silence and isolation - wanting not to be bothered and to focus completely on the film and every aspect of the "Kubrick Masterpiece".Half-way through the film, I was thinking to myself, "This is one really great movie!" I could sense Hal going nutty by this time and got chill bumps...oooh what would come next? Three-fourths through the film, I'm sitting there with a ruffled brow and a scrunchy nose, wondering if this is Kubrick directing or Fellini.When the film was over, I was MAD. So mad that I said I'd never watch the movie again. What kind of ending is that? The feeling I had is the feeling you get when you invest time and money in a girl that you have deep affections for and instead of returning those affections, in one way or another, she simply tells you that she loves you like a brother. I was hurt by the ending, literally. How in the name of all that is classic cinema can this movie end the way it did? I'll never understand why. And I will never understand the meaning of it - ever. It's simply not fair to end what truly is a beautiful - and to some extent - great movie this way.Whatever the meaning is at the end - and I tend to agree with some that it has something to do with the whole evolution cycle of ape to man to computer to - "whatever it was in the green room that supposed to represent whatever"...agrgh! Just reliving the ending - which I have not seen in some 7 years still makes me very angry.It is such a beautiful film, though. One should see it. It will always be remembered. And I fear, most will be confused and angry afterwards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seldom has so much awe been directed at a film with so little to say. The message that 2001 imparts can be summed up simply: Intelligence is the element that made apes into humans and will eventually cause humans to evolve even further. Shorter still: Intellect = evolution. Not particularly profound. Not particularly controversial. Not even particularly original. Just a common sense observation. But director Stanley Kubrick's penchant for pretentious rambling and oblique storytelling invites viewers to make desperate attempts to look for greater meaning, which simply is not there. As the old saying goes: There must be a pony!Which is not to say the film is devoid of substance. Buried in the middle of the film is a Jim-dandy episode of "The Twilight Zone." When the astronauts find themselves at war with HAL, the computer that serves as both their servant and their master, the film -- finally -- develops into a compelling drama. The situation itself is suspenseful, plus, it lends itself to many interpretations: Man versus machine, man versus his God, intellect versus instinct, the future versus the present, etc. Dramatically, visually and intellectually, the film does, ever so briefly, live up to its hype. The heart of the film beats strong. Unfortunately, the heart beats in a body that is grotesquely deformed.For a film that looks so sparse and lean, 2001 is ridiculously flabby and out of shape. What is amazing is that so much of what is romanticized as being mystical and philosophical is really just contrived and sometimes just plain silly. The infamous black monolith is a mere MacGuffin, a gimmick that lamely propels the story and loosely ties together the film's three acts. The controversial and endless "dawn of man" prologue drags on far past the point where it has anything to say and yet still reveals so little about either the film's plot or mankind. The "star child" finale is, to be kind, cute, but no more insightful than the rainbow at the end of E.T.The adoration the film has acquired has an almost cult-like arrogance to it: "The film is great because we 'get' it and those who don't are just too stupid or shallow or, well, just not one of us." Yet, when pressed, few even attempt to venture a guess as to why the film is awe inspiring, brilliant and revolutionary. Instead, the film's defenders only make excuses for the film's failings: It's boring! "No, it's meditative." The scenes are repetitive and drag on too long! "No, Kubrick trusts the viewer to absorb the beauty and the depth of the images, which transcend conventional film pacing." The ending makes no sense! "No, the film defies conventional logic." Why? How? "Well, it has to, otherwise why would it be like it is?"The ultimate paradox about 2001 is that Kubrick is hailed as a genius because he has made a film that raises more questions than it ever hoped to answer. The mere fact that it is so vague in its intentions angers some, but it overly impresses others. To argue that the film is great just because it can't be easily explained is no more honest than saying it is lousy because it can't easily be explained. And for my money, a genius is one who provides answers, or at least theories, not one who just asks questions.The irony is that even with all the pretentious hot air with which Kubrick over inflates his epic, he still gets his basic message across. To survive, the astronaut Bowman must defeat HAL, but in doing so he, at best, only delays his own extinction. The evolution of intelligence, even in a corrupted state, will be man's undoing. Mankind is doomed to outsmart himself. And the same can be said for Stanley Kubrick.</fullReview>

Even the AFI ranked it as like the 23 or something, best movie of all-time. There was very little dialogue in it, and the talk was meaningless anyway. The move was broke up into segments, so it never establishes a real flow. I understand its pretty good history movie, tracing man from cave to space, but I still don't see how you can label it a great movie.

		<fullReview>Let's get this straight: Stanley Kubrick is one of the most technically accomplished directors of all time. The man is a master in creating scenes that are so technically perfect that it looks like they were made by a scientist. And that is (was) also his biggest problem. He just wasn't that much of a storyteller. 2001 looks great but just like in most of his work, there is absolutely no trace of emotion or feelings. Things I need in a movie.Sure that cut from bone to spaceship was inventive, and it was a great touch to let the ships spin with classical music on the soundtrack. The problem is: I don't care for what's happening on the screen. There are no characters we sympathise with (except for a few moments with HAL- the computer, yes I get the irony MR K)there is no story to follow. The only thing that's interesting in this movie are Kubrick and his camera. This is an overlong, boring, pretentious piece of would-be art; made for would-be intellectuals from a director who had nothing left to prove when he made this.

		<fullReview>Kubrick's masterpiece known as 2001: A Space Odyssey gets better with each viewing. The music is excellent, and the cinematography is even better. The story is profound, somewhat confusing at times. The reason many people, whom I know, that dislike 2001 is they didn't understand it. Read the book, by Arthur C. Clarke, which is an amazing piece of literature. The book cleared up many questions I had, even though the movie is fairly straightforward if you pay attention. The dialogue, though scarce, is executed well. HAL 9000's voice is emotionless, maybe even "chilling," thus heightening tension. All in all, 2001 is an experience not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the proverbial "good" science fiction movie- meant to be seen on a BIG screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Years from now, when quite possibly film studios decide that filming and screening motion pictures for theatrical distribution no longer will work out financially and make everything for DVD and TV and, Lord help us, cell phones and I-phones, 2001 will remain as one of those reminders of what would be eternally lost. If films like this can be made on celluloid and *intended* to be screened in full 70mm or 35mm glory for all to see in a packed theater, then there should be hope.Because, as it stands, Kubrick's masterwork, aside from being the rare landmark to be an attempt at transmogrifying the form of film itself (as Spielberg once noted, it's not entirely drama or documentary or science fiction), is all fine and well on TV, particularly in full widescreen DVD. But, at the least for those who have problems with the film (and it's not hard to have them), it could be a universal likelihood that it's so much a pure visual experience, so visceral and surreal and all 'als', that it deserves no less than to be seen at least once up tall on a screen too many feet tall (and, fingers crossed, someday on IMAX?) 2001 has caused more debate than during presidential primaries. What the hell is up with this movie? The fact that we question it- and, perhaps, even ourselves for why we thought the way we did- is part of the experience, and the mystery, and depending on how much or how little you're willing to take on that mystery will determine what you think of the film. Is the monolith really an alien, or some nothingness that one can project whatever on to? Why does it make the high-pitched sounds on the moon when made into photo-fodder? Where is that crazy room that Bowman goes to at the end? And don't get me started on the 'star child'. It's all of this that, for me, makes it so unforgettable, and something that enriches the experience the more times its revisited.To be fair, even as much of a Kubrick nut I am, it's hard to say that I wasn't bored the first time seeing it at the age of 12 and not used to sci-fi/fantasy that went this... well, slow isn't the word exactly, but meditative, patient, like a story that is in no need to rush itself in lieu of the stylistic choices of the director. But a few years later, it worked better, then better still. While it goes without saying that it might just fall flat for some time and time again, for me it's one of those things like a marvelous piece of music, where revisiting it is part of the enjoyment of familiarity, but at the same time you might rediscover something else, or you might have even changed since the last time.It's surreal, trippy, courageous, revelatory, frustrating, bewildering, and firmly structured. From the continuously mind-blowing visual fx by Kubrick and Douglas Trumbull, from the ominous presence of HAL 9000(possibly as the eventual continuation of a bone thwacking ape), from every careful but broad-stroked piece of direction and subtle piece of acting, it's popular art at a high water mark. It's probably not the greatest of all films, but many others can only hope and try their absolute best to reach the levels Kubrick and Clarke reached, how it plunged the aspirations of what is "out there" among the stars and the galaxy to an intellectual point via the confounding magic of cinema (yes, I used the word magic).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I've had some time on my hands recently, as I am on Christmas break, and I decided a few movies would be a good way to waste my time. Let me make it clear now, Kubrick's 2001 was definitely a good way to *waste* that time. I wish I had read the book, because this film was such a confused and muddled mess, I hardly know where to begin.For starters, the multitudes of strange and artificially created gravity fields in the ships were so mind-bogglingly unuseful that it wasted the time Kubrick took finding ways to pull that stuff off. The special effects are remarkable, especially for its time period, but why do the ships move so slowly? Another IMDB user (no offense) commented that the 'realistic pace' of space flight is slow and 'leisurely.' Since when? Space is pretty much just that... SPACE. There's nothing around for *light years*. To get anywhere, space ships, even the ones we use nowadays, go at tremendous speeds. If it was otherwise, no one would get anywhere!Anyway, the movie may be trying to be artistic, but it fails unless the viewer is captivated. I got so bored during this movie, I regressed to making MST3K-like comments with my stepdad. It's actually pretty entertaining that way. I honestly believe that this movie would be *much* better had I read the book. Unfortunately, Kubrick relies too heavily on our imagination or our knowledge of the book to get the points of this movie across. In my view, pretty much a long and boring movie. And don't call me a cynic or an uneducated fool. Those who do might want to try to take an objective point of view in watching the movie. One might discover the horrible truth about the emperor's clothes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretentious Nonsense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have "watched" or sat through this film more than once. Goodness knows why. As at one of the same time it is exceedingly annoying yet also slightly mesmerizing but only because of its pretentiousness.There are some good special effects, but then again a lot of the fashion is very much 1960's , when the movie was made.In essence the story is about some strange objects found on earth, "monoliths" and a space ship which is sent to investigate. These "monoliths" -so the picture nonsensically suggests- were on earth when man was still evolving from monkeys and (I later researched) the film suggests these monoliths influenced mankinds development. But that conclusion was not made at all clear in the film.On the spaceship there is an onboard computer, called "Hal" who turns "rogue" for no apparent reason. Again only after doing some research I learn that the computer went crazy because it could not take being forced to lie to the crew. And/or Hal's behavior shows how we are relying too much on machines, etc.Then after quite a lot of tedium in the film the main character a spaceman endures some type of psychedelic journey(note this movie was made in the 1960's) when those "trips" were all the rage. He finds himself in a old fashioned bedroom, going through all sorts of transformations of himself until he becomes a fetus headed for earth.It is this last scene which is the worst failing of the film. As no way can or could the normal viewer have any idea what is meant to be happening. Seems the answer is-wait for it- that the spaceman has been captured by aliens and is going through some type of metamorphosis, only known to the aliens in its purpose. Blah, blah, blah.Despite some decent effects, music, production designs, et al the film is a total mess. Whatever the maker has said trying to justify this film, the whole thing looks like it was made up as it went along. The film maker believes he knows what the film is about but instead of conveying that to the viewer he causes them to be totally confused by a failure to communicate his vision properly or at all.And the movie is pretentious in the extreme and shame on all those people who claim this is some type of "masterpiece" . The story itself is wholly ludicrous and only because of a few redeeming features can I award just above the minimum vote:2/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although this movie had it's moments and it was quite artistically beautiful to watch, I'm gonna have to side with the people saying this movie is too slow, a bit on the boring side, not really any point to it, etc.Some of the scenes like the ship landing on the moon and going slowly downwards to land with the fancy music, I was just literally thinking what is the point of this? Is it REALLY going to show the ship go all the way to the VERY bottom??? At least it cut if off like halfway wow, so slow!There just seemed to be a lot of very slow and boring shots. Yes some of them were nice to look at but maybe I'm just impatient I processed the information pretty fast I don't need to see basically the same shot for an extra 10-100 seconds for every scene...And it seems that the lack of dialog was done intentionally, I think this was a mistake. Even though all the dialog was pretty basic it was some of the more interesting parts of the movie to me. They really should have done a bit more with the whole HAL going psycho thing and them trying to figure out what to do. Instead he makes one little mistake and they instantly freak out and plot his death right in front of the camera. It was obvious to me watching the scene in the pod for the first time that HAL would be able to know what was said whether by manually activating the microphones in the pod or with the camera I wasn't sure.And then HAL kills the guy and he goes flying off into space and his team member is just like oh darn better collect his corpse. No emotion, no anger, it's like he's a robot just like HAL or something. Was this intended? I don't know it just could have been so much more of an intense and interesting story with some slight differences. Kubrick says he didn't take any drugs but I find that hard to believe when watching this movie sober. This really seems like something someone on mushrooms, LCD, or just baked out of his mind on Marijauna would direct. I'd still give it at least a 5/10 just because for it's time it must have been quite a visual feat, and it still looks good so many years later. But I was just expecting so much more to happen and it's like they did the bare minimum and just tried to like do beautiful or trippy cinematography to appeal to druggies or something. Apparently their plan worked as I guess their biggest audience in the theaters were people getting high to watch the psychedelic wormhole scene.I also really don't understand the ending with the wormhole and the weird room and his aging and rebirth, but given the intentional lack of story/context/events in the movie I don't really think there is a good explanation no matter how much you analyze it so I won't give it much of a second thought.This movie kind of reminds me of how I saw "Avatar" 3D on mushrooms. It was the most intense and visually amazing thing I've ever seen and when I got out of the theater I was just like "wow, that was the most amazing thing I've ever seen." But now I'm scared to watch it sober because it will probably be just a huge let down when the visuals don't just blow my mind, that's how I feel about 2001: A Space Odyssey. Maybe give me a ton of mushrooms and I could see what some of you see with this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not sure a younger audience can appreciate this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This story is very subjective but the overall feel of this film is that a monolith somehow appears and starts evolution. It begins with Apes who discover a monolith and then begin to evolve by using a bone a club, and fast forwarding to a time where man is highly involved in space travel and colonization and, end up finding a monolith buried on the moon. Eighteen months later a space craft on its way towards Jupiter where it is believed the monolith has come from, with a self contained computer system named HAL-9000, carrying hibernating humans and a crew takes on a mind of its own and turns on the crew. The crew commander, Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea), decides to disconnect HAL.Then a prerecorded message appears on a monitor and it is Dr. Heywood Floyd (William Sylvester) explaining the purpose of the mission. Dave finds out from this video that 18 months ago the first evidence of intelligent life off the Earth was discovered. It was buried 40 feet deep below the moons surface and except for a very powerful radio emission aimed at Jupiter, "the four-million-year-old black monolith has remained completely inert. Its origin and purpose are still a total mystery." This is where the movie gets more intense. You then find Dave floating through a worm hole and then suddenly appears looking at himself in a bedroom and watches himself get older, the monolith appears, and then Dave suddenly turns into a fetus and then hovering in space looking at Earth.This film stokes the coals of evolution with theory that evolution has been moved along by a black monolith. If you look at the detail given to all of the scenes and the way the angles and lighting are used I can see how this would have been a revolutionary film when it was released in 1968. Even by today's standards I feel that the scenes in space were very realistic and I was impressed by them.The lighting was a constant factor in the film, of course because it was in space. You had many colors used from the color of the lighting in the cockpits, to the colors of the space suits used by the astronauts.The angles were also very fresh and designed to give the viewer the appearance of weightlessness or floating in space. The was the angles were used, especially in the space crafts, really defined the space that was shown on the scene and really made the audience feel as if this film was try in space and in the future.All in all I can respect the cinematic qualities in this movie but feel that a younger generation might not be able to appreciate these items and will discount this movie as long and boring. With that being said I did feel as if this film was a bit drug out and the storyline was very unclear without a lot of analytical rewinding in my mind to try to figure things out. Graphics stunning but the movie overall misses the mark when put up to movies of today's standards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is not art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So many people have tried to lump this movie into one of two categories. "Art" or "Science-fiction". It is actually neither of these in my opinion. It, to me is an explanation of where we come from and where we are going. Not necessarily the truth, but one of many possible explanations. It shows evolution, which is a slow process and which is depicted in the film by long slow shots of spaceships and Savannah's and so on, but also the rapidity of scientific advancement, shown by the quick edits from bone to spaceship and in the "relatively" quick advances from moon travel to planetary travel to travel to other universes."HAL" while being an unforgettable figure in the movie, seems to be almost unnecessary in the telling of this epic tale. The history of the human race does not need a protagonist, and seems to be put in only as a cinematic device so that people would have some sort of "connection" to this as a "movie", with a hero and villain.It is to me only a vision on film. It is not art. It is not drama. It s not science fiction. It is one view of reality, and that is all. The world may or may not have developed this way and may or may not continue to develop this way. No one knows. That I think is the point of this movie. Who knows?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is challenging to the mind. It is not about space flights. All parts of the movie are one story, one big picture. I would say it is about programming. The "so called monolith" is not a material thing, it is a program. It is like a universal programming rule: something is programming A, A is programming B ??? R is programming our SUN, SUN is programming humans, humans are programming HAL. The objects are programmed in order to complete a task. Once the task completed (or the programmed object is becoming dangerous to the programmer) the object is discarded. If you have a curious mind, you will find in this movie very important principles that human's program is based on; like complex patterns of 0 (avoiding suffering) and 1 (achieving pleasure), need for self expansion and achieving a goal. Interestingly, Kubrick emphasized the correlation between the humans program and space objects of the solar system, especially Moon (subconscious everyday life reactions) and Jupiter (expansion). EVERY detail in this movie has a meaning.Kubrick intentionally used quite a lot of visual and sound effects affecting human's brain and not in a subtle way. That's why some people are complaining about noises and "LSD-induced images" while others are loving the movie even though most o them have no idea what it is about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Film Ever Made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the year 2000, a black monolith of "unknown descent" is discovered on the Moon. Though the monolith has been submerged beneath the Moon's surface for millennia, unusual geological circumstances lead the scientists to believe the object was planted there by a foreign agency. Upon closer inspection, the object emits a piercing signal that is traced to Jupiter airspace. 18 months later, the American spacecraft Discovery One is sent to Jupiter in the hopes of discovering the origin of the signal.Directed by Stanley Kubrick ? one of celluloid's greatest visionaries ? 2001 is probably the most unique, detached, obsessive, pretentious, contentious, and bewildering sci-fi film ever made (though Tarkovsky's Solaris is a strong competitor). It is therefore one of the few great films of that deplorable genre ever to appear as it radically departs from nearly every cliché and convention the genre holds claim to. Indeed, the film ultimately transcends science-fiction.One can only marvel at how the film's fine mise-en-scene absorbs you into a universe that has been so intricately and elegantly crafted. Every thing about this film is perfection: the romantic and ominous music, the minimalist plot, the distant though finely nuanced performances (Douglas Rain's voice work is the best example of this), the ingenious special effects, the realistic production design, and the as-yet-unsurpassed cinematography of Geoffrey Unsworth - the geometrical framing of every shot is so refined that even the best works of Tonino Delli Colli, Freddy Young and Gianni di Venanzio pale in comparison to Unsworth's control of the lens.The best thing about 2001, though, is that it takes itself seriously. While most popular science-fiction fare like Star Wars, E.T. - The Extra Terrestrial, Jurassic Park, and Independence Day aims only to entertain and indulge with mindless action and copious FX, 2001 tries earnestly to probe deep philosophical issues - such as man's over reliance on technology; the nature of existence; man's urge to conquer an overcome; and the possible future of man's evolutionary development - that other sci-fi works would barely even superficially analyse.A towering achievement and an instrumental film in the launching of the New Hollywood Era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Piece of art, but not that good from a movie standards.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This THING is a piece of art - nothing more, nothing less. But is it a good movie? Or is it even a movie? I don't think so. If you want to watch this you need to prepare your-self like for a trip into an art or any other museum, because if you'll try to watch it like a movie - you'll hate it. It gives you almost none information about the actual story and most of the time you're left guessing. I have never red a book so I had no idea what was going on. Sure, I could appreciate entertaining and well written HAL character but not much else. Most of the time they're just showing you THINGS. Things, that most of the time doesn't really add-up anything to the plot. I'd go even further and say that this movie doesn't have a plot - I can film the sky for two hours it wouldn't make it a movie. I can catch some beautiful things, but if there won't be any narrator to link everything to one piece I'd have no right to tell anyone, that I made "a movie." Movie must have well developed plot and characters, there can be some hidden messages, yes, but you simply just can't hide most of the plot from the viewer. So in conclusion I'd like to sum it up - "2001: A Space Odyssey" stands fine like a piece of art, but fails in too many regions as a movie to deserve such a big rating on internet MOVIE data base. This isn't meant to be a movie and if you're going to watch it that's the first thing you need to understand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinematic achievement = entertaining movie? Not necessarily</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film, first and foremost, should be good storytelling. It should be entertaining - and entertaining doesn't necessarily mean "laughs", and it doesn't necessarily mean "light". It basically means you're not bored while watching it. As brilliant as 2001 may be, it is a difficult film to watch, especially for the current (video-game-playing/iPod fumbling) generation. Its slow pace and the sometimes intolerable amount of time it takes for an actor to perform a single action (e.g. the attempt to rescue the crew member floating in space) will stretch your patience. On the other hand, the cinematography is brilliant, the film cleverly directed, the ending thought-provoking and the score...the score is chilling, especially as the crew in the transporter approaches the artifact on the moon. Boy, I had goose bumps, big time. This doesn't happen often when I watch films, and is a testament to Kubrick's directing skills. It IS considered a classic, and many people consider it the best science-fiction film of all time. That alone is a good reason to watch it if you haven't done so yet. However, just because everybody else thinks it's a brilliant film doesn't mean you have to force yourself to like it. You either will (like it) or you won't. Perhaps the slow pace isn't such a bad thing, after all. Directing your attention to something rather static and slow-paced for 2 1/2 hours might teach you a lesson. It will certainly be a different experience to all these fast-moving, fast-paced images we are subjected to these days (whether commercials, music videos or video games). I myself think it's a "memorable" film. But not one I'm eager to watch again anytime soon (unless I'm in a particular mood for slow-paced films). Hence, 7 stars out of 10 from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually Stunning, Severely Disappointing Otherwise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aren't movies amazing? Every movie has a fair share of love and hate directed towards it; no film can be said to be universally lauded or loathed, not even the truly awful ones - someone is bound to enjoy them in some capacity.There is a reason for this amazing occurrence: no movie is perfect. Not a single one. Not the true "greats" like The Godfather or Citizen Kane, and certainly not From Justin to Kelly. Every movie has its flaws - whether minor flubs or serious dramatic or visual problems. No film is exempt from this rule, and as such, a single film can appeal to a variety of different people for different reasons and in different ways.As an audience, it is our job to look over the flaws and enjoy the film for what it is: an imperfect, yet still amazing, confluence of ideas and emotions. Obviously, this is not possible for every film, and doubtless after the fact we will find myriad ways in which a film can improve. This is the nature of film-going, and of movie making.2001: A Space Odyssey is no exception to this rule, despite what its many ardent fans would have you believe. The biggest thing this movie has going for it are its astonishing visuals: they are truly revolutionary, and hole up remarkably well today. They also seem oddly appropriate, as if "updating" them, as George Lucas has done, would somehow detract from the film, rather than add to it.I won't deny, therefore, that this film is a stunning visual experience, and wildly influential. But that is all that it is.For all its visual innovation, it is also an incredibly pretentious film. I believe I read one post on these boards that defined pretentious as aspiring to something and not achieving it (the poster then went on to explain that, for this reason, 2001 isn't pretentious; I disagree, but I'll get to that eventually). I would accept that definition, but would add that the journey getting there is just as important.What 2001 is aspiring to is a story (although I do not believe you could describe it as such) told through the visual, with numerous metaphorical segments alluding to the entire history of mankind and its place in the universe, as well as a dissertation on the evolution of thought and of science.2001, then, has great aspirations, but I find the film incredibly flawed for its over length and inability to sufficiently approach these ideas. For starters - the scene at the beginning spends fully fifteen minutes on idea that the audience understands after five; the additional minutes add nothing to the meaning or flow of the film, and in fact detract from the overall enjoyment of anyone intelligent enough to understand it.Kubrick makes the same mistake throughout. Endless scenes of people floating in space emphasize remoteness and the advancement of technology, and of course how far humanity has come - but to what end? No end, apparently. I hate to be condescending, but certainly no one can enjoy the acid trip at the end of the film that lasts for at least five minutes and expresses nothing other than infinity? Did it need to go on so long? No, of course not. I understood what it was trying to say, I accepted the swirling lights as perhaps the best representation of an abstract idea, I appreciated the care and beauty that went into creating it, I took it in for a long stretch of time to fully experience the message ... and then it kept going.The film is so densely layered with such abstract metaphors as to be rendered meaningless; I have seen some defend the idea that it is not, but truly so many possible explanations can be achieved, almost none of them satisfactory, that it is rendered meaningless. The ending of the film doesn't mean anything precisely because it means everything; there comes a point where restrained is needed, and Kubrick has no concept of this. As a result, the entire film is rendered moot.All of this combined make for unpleasant business, but could have been redeemed if the characters were at least mildly interesting. You could substitute a cardboard cutout with a smiley face in for any of the actors and would achieve virtually the same film - and with no emotional connection to the characters, or the environment, which is rendered cold and unapproachable by the very exactitude by which it is created, how can you expect the audience to be invested at all in the dramatic conflict of the movie? And surely, for a film about the nature and history of mankind, such relentlessly uninvolving characters is counter to your purpose? Truly, there is very little to admire here other than the arresting visuals.Or is there? Here we see once again the subjectivity of film. What I regard of flaw, others regard as masterstroke; why is there a disparity? Everyone, I suppose, experiences a film differently.What I find emotionally uninvolving, cold, and relentlessly pretentious, others find as riveting, meaningful film making. Who is right? Who is wrong? There is of course no answer to that question. As long as a good argument is made, everyone's opinion is equal in the arena of movies. I believe I have presented one such argument here, and have read many, many expressing an opinion opposite to mine that are just as valid.One thing, I think, is true: this movie is not perfect. There are flaws; its adherents may have to look hard to find them, but however minute, they are there. But then, they are there for every movie. And in the end, because no movie is perfect, we can only understand it as best we can based on how it spoke to us as individuals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece of the science-fiction genre, and of cinema history!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, this was a repeat viewing, and I have to say, seeing this film finally on high surround system, it is amazing. Yes, it is confusing, but knowing this time around what it was about, and what it meant was so relaxing.The way the film starts, with just darkness, and the amazing music score playing sets off the mood from the start. The landscapes seen on the first 15 minutes, with the apes, is so visually stunning. Knowing this is from 1968 is so amazing. I mean, I have never seen landscapes like this before. The way the film sets off the Black Monolith, the music, the motion of the apes, just the whole scene still stands as AMAZING and one of the best scenes of the film, also one of the best scenes I have ever seen. The next jump cut to space, the way the humans interact, the way the audience has to be on board and pay attention to the little details. Even if the film was trying to say nothing at all, it would still be a joy to watch, because it whisks you to another world, another place not in your imagination. Of course, all the 'classic' classical music, which most audiences will recognize from other films or sources, playing with moving objects is amazing. it is such wonderful film-making.The third section of the film, this section is really not all that different, but if you know what the film is about, it is the most important. This is actually a section where 'regular' people will not be asking "what the heck is this about?" or saying "weird"... This is where we get one of the most memorable characters in cinema history, the technology computer HAL-9000. This is truly a landmark of a character, one that gives you the creeps from the first time you see it. The way real humans interact with this computer is the whole point of the film. It is not just the writing that soars, but the amazing direction. The long shots, the steady camera, the heavy breathing done by Dave Bowen and Frank Poole, out in space is truly frightening. It is just amazing with the pace of the scenes that they are done with. All these scenes(just like throughout the film) are done very slowly and carefully. This truly emphasizes the meaning that they have, and their importance.The most beautiful scene on this film, and in the whole cinema history, is the Star Gate journey. This is definitely the most visually stunning scenes one will ever see. Yes, it is really minimal special effects, since all they probably use is colors, but it is just so amazing. I cannot just describe the beauty of this long scene. This scene is followed by the final section, which is in someplace very futuristic, one might imagine. The last 10 minutes of this film is the best endings I have ever seen, it is truly not an ending, but more of a revelation. The direction when the Black Monolith appears again, just wow. The cinematography is very well done for every single scene.Well, at the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey, all one can do is either hate it or love it. The ones who hate it are the ones who simply do not care to think or ask questions about great films. The ones who love it, really appreciate masterpieces like this. In my first viewing of this film, I loved it. In my second viewing, I might understand it more, but it does not lower in my mind of how great of a film it is. I truly think this is the best film ever made. I do not think anyone will ever be able to reach what this film reached. It is the most high achievement in technology, in writing, in pure film making. It is a film that everyone should at least see once. Of course, if you want to experience everything over and over again, keep reliving the journey... Absolute 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Going ape over things they don't understand.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reaction of some people to this work of art seems analogous to one of my all-time favorite movie scenes in the movie itself. The man-apes, not even being sufficiently intelligent to begin to grasp that they are witnessing an impossible miracle, can only screech, jump around and flail their arms at the enigmatic object before them.It truly is disheartening that there aren't more visionaries of Stanley Kubrick's and Dr. Arthur C. Clarke's caliber. And that society isn't more influenced by the thoughtful visionaries that do exist among us instead of by the all-too-typical power-demented, greed-ridden and/or religiously fanatical sociopsychopaths that hold positions of social, legal and political authority.I remember seeing "2001: A Space Odyssey" for the very first time when it came to the theater in my hometown in 1968. I was but 14 years old but I had no particular difficulty in 'getting it'. The only part that left me wondering was when the star child returned to Earth; what were his intentions? If that was meant to represent a kind of 'next step' for mankind, did he return to lead humanity on to that next level? I guess not, since the sequel still had humanity blundering along, with the lunatics running the asylum as usual. Speaking of subsequent films depicting space travel or space themes, some people are fond of claiming that "2001" established a standard or precedent for such movies. I tend to disagree. While it may have been influential, most TV shows and movies I've seen would appear to more resemble "Star Trek", which appeared a couple of years before "2001", in character and technique, i.e., appearing to be nothing more than adaptations of western shoot-em-ups, barroom brawls and World War II or Cold War stories. Even "2010", as enjoyable and entertaining as it certainly is, just isn't in the same league with "2001"'s character and level of intellect, tending more toward the typical chatty, angst-ridden humanity-coping-with-some-thing-other-than-human shtick."2001: A Space Odyssey", in contrast, is immortal and stands mockingly before such mediocrity as the monolith before the man-apes.It is profoundly disappointing that Kubrick/Clarke's prophecy of an established base on the moon hasn't been fulfilled, which I submit as being reflective of mankind's general mentality and that of their political representatives, their mental impotence when attempting to deal rationally with technical and scientific issues being only too evident, in many ways. Which is something profoundly portrayed by another recent film based on a story by Dr. Carl Sagan, "Contact", which is one of but few films that come anywhere close to "2001"'s vision such that it can legitimately claim a lineage with "2001", right down to a "wormhole trip" near the end. (Why is it that every time humanity seems to get close to a cosmic epiphany in these movies and TV shows, someone winds up hauling-ass across the universe at 10 million times the speed of light?) Younger people may find it interesting that much of the technology that they enjoy today was in all likelihood inspired by "2001: A Space Odyssey"; after all, in 1968, color TV was still very much a novelty and transistors were a mind-bending mystery to many, vacuum tubes having been all the rage for several decades (which were a mind-bending mystery anyway for most of humanity). For Kubrick and Clarke to even begin to fathom, let alone portray, the developments that could arise in the decades to come as accurately as they did is nothing short of phenomenal, perhaps even a bit spooky, in retrospect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Among stars, the huge vacuum of space, we are minimal, we are just blurry spots questioning our existence. In space we discover our importance, and Kubrick highlights from a sequence of the dawn of men (hominids) that we are in our expressive pinnacle and can ask many questions without any real answers.This movie is not conventional: it seems superficial to talk about characters, plot, bad people or heroes. This film is more likely a search, an inner quest. There is no need to have strong explanations, because in the ignorance and inaction of mind we find the beauty that makes us human.Stanley Kubrick uses onirical production stages, disorienting cameras, psychedelic effects, brutal mix of colors."2001" is just an answer, very mixed in its conception, but needed for those who ask constantly: -Who are we?

Humans advance and evolve but we always have those basic primitive qualities. That's my interpretation of the film anyway, what's yours?

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie I Never Want to See Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I used to think "2001: A Space Odyssey" was a Great Movie, but now I'm not so sure. Now that I've seen it a few times, I feel like I've gotten all there is to be gotten from it, and the thought of sitting down to watch it again triggers my brain to begin thinking of all the other things I could be doing with my time. Is that the sign of a great movie? Shouldn't we be able to revisit great movies again and again and find something fresh about them years after they initially hit the screens? I don't know.Anyway, "2001" is at least a terrific movie and an important one. No science fiction film made since can deny the influence of this movie's vision of space. Many of the special effects look more realistic than the computer generated effects of today. And while I defy anyone to truly explain the meaning of this film with confidence (I wonder if even Kubrick could have), it certainly makes you feel *something,* even if you're not sure what that something is.On the first viewing, the pacing of the film seemed stately and fitting for a film about drifting through the cold depths of space; now it just seems ponderous. It's even more pronounced now how little the human actors register in this film, and how HAL (which is just a voice, really) steals the show. And when I was younger and more eager to accept the opinions of film scholars and other purported know-it-alls, I thought the ending was profound and full of meaning; now it seems pretty obtuse and vague.But when it comes right down to it, Kubrick's worst movie is anyone else's masterpiece. His movies never feel comfortable with human emotions, so the fact that this movie could almost exist without humans at all comes as little surprise. His style has always been slow, but it comes as a welcome change from all the frenetic, hyper crap being produced now. And at least this movie makes you think, even if it doesn't provide any answers, which again is more than I can say for most of the movies playing in theatres this weekend.So I may not rate "2001" as highly as I once would have, but I fully support its place as one of the most audacious and significant films of all time.Grade: A</fullReview>

This is a classic film that's amazing visually, with fantastic performances however the pace was just to slow for my liking still it's a must see for any film fan, i just found the pace to be terribly inconsistent.

Stanley Kubrick does an amazing job here, with incredible visuals, amazing camera work, jaw dropping angles, using incredible effects,it's well written, however if only he kept the pace more consistent! it would have been perfect!. The Acting is fantastic!. Keir Dullea is AMAZING in here, he is extremely likable,vulnerable, extremely convincing, his conflict with Hal was rather creepy, and was really intense amazing job!. Gary Lockwood and William Sylvester both do what they have to do very well and were both very likable!. Douglas Rain is amazing as the voice of HAL, he was extremely creepy and he shocked me at times. Rest of the cast are great. Overall this is a must see for every film fan, if only for the pace!. ****1/2 out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very bad film, very good 1960's experimental arty-cinema!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film when I was very young. Obviously, I didn't have a clue what was going on and I hated it. A couple of weeks ago I read Arthur C. Clarke's superb book (and the sequels) and felt I had to give the film another chance.My opinion of the film has not changed since my first viewing, I still hate it. I can appreciate it on other levels now, but to me, as a film, this does not work. The reason there are no other films even remotely like this is because this is not how films are supposed to be. This is more art than film (in a bad way). I cannot understand how ANYBODY could watch this film (without reading the book) and know what is going on, but in my opinion, you should never have to read the book to understand a film. Some people might say it transcends film, cinema and traditional storytelling, but whilst I can't say whether or not it actually transcends all that stuff, it certainly isn't any of that stuff. It is like one of those weird pieces of experimental video-art you get in trendy art galleries, only two hours long. The magic of the book lies in it's narrative, and on the descriptions of cosmic events. I'm sure Mr Kubrick did the best he could in '68, but SFX technology was NOWHERE NEAR advanced enough to get across some of the things that were meant to be happening, so they used stuff like false colour on sped up clouds, which may have dazzled audiences then, but cannot remotely compare to how your imagination pictures it whilst reading the book.(As a side note, the bits where they were supposed to moving around in zero-G actually had me in tears they were so bad! But I'm sure they couldn't have done it any better at the time) To anyone who didn't like this film, please read the book, because it is amazing, and if anything it will explain the story so you can watch the "film" for sheer cinematographical appreciation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stanley Kubrick's Transcendent Gift of Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no doubt about it.If ever there was a film that, in all of its theatrical exhibition awesomeness, could put to rest the cine-old argument over theatrical screening versus video screening, this is IT. Where narrative structure and dialogue are never lost on the small screen, the aesthetics of sight and sound that imbue the viewer in the transcendent experience that all cinema has the potential to be, are lost in that environment. Those who may have endured (or attempted to endure) this opus in the inferior format that found themselves doubting the integrity of the film or the validity of its supporters can bare no argument that can hold any water until they have witnessed it in the theatre. Moreover, even those supporters of the picture that have viewed it approvingly on their television monitors have short changed themselves and the filmmaker to have given praise without this experience. You can not know, or claim to know, 2001 until you have seen it there. This is the truth of great cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick's groundbreaking sci-fi film remains a classic milestone for the future.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let us remember Stanley Kubrick as a genius of provocative filmmaking, and also a prophet of events that came and went. 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY has survived the test of advanced time. Not just in eye candy, but the imagination of living in an artificial world where new forms of communication are evitable. This is science fiction a step forward in fantasy that becomes reality. In this case, things already have...Don't thrash the movie's opening sequence. Try to picture your mind the living standards man would use later. With a few primates hanging around the barren land of Earth, there is a point of significance about the future of civilization. "The Dawn Of Man" instantly becomes "The Dawn Of Computer". The primates' ways of intelligence is applied for the next challenge in an artificially run setting like the year 2001. Smart thinking from Kubrick!As I've said numerous times before, visuals do not always make the movies, but this is an exception when you had a movie that revolutionized special effects. For 1968, expect the impossible. If you have remembered seeing this in the theater, it's because you had terrible seizures from looking at the most vibrant graphics and pyrotechnics ever mastered on film. No object is ever tacked onto the print (like the Starship Enterprise), and they look like glimpses of future sci-fi hits including STAR WARS. But if you have developed severe hemorrhoids after the film was over, it was because of the knockout "hyperwarp" scene. Its amazing display of dazzling colors and quick speed still rivals against the eye-heavy, eye-demanding visuals of today's movies. Give this one another thirty years to prove itself worthy as time and technology progresses. Truly incredible!Like I mentioned, Stanley Kubrick acts as a prophet by using ideas that soon become reality or has already happened. The supercomputer HAL-9000 is a perfect example, which lead to modern operative machines and devices running on simple chips and bits of hardware. And did this movie predict a form of network communication like the Internet? Computer malfunctions? Artificial intelligence? If time had only told us, the answer is strictly "yes". But let's continue to believe that this is a science fiction movie without inducing panic.There may be thousands of other possibilities to discover from this masterpiece. We've learned an awful lot out of this one, though. I don't mean to say it "is" the greatest thing ever created (and no, TITANIC "is" not the greatest, either), but if we can dig deep into Kubrick's finest talents of a genuine Hollywood classic, we'll know that 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY can easily withstand all of the mediocrity that will continue to play in the high-tech multiplexes.A perfect "9" winner from you know who!</fullReview>

It has been truly said (I'm sorry I can't remember by whom) that Kubrick here created the first true "motion picture" in the most literal sense of those words. You don't "watch" this one the way you would watch any other movie. You have to immerse yourself in it, open your mind completely to the visual images, and forget about following the plot or the banal dialogue. Almost all the truly important information and even more, ideas, come through the visuals. I've watched this film in excess of 100 times, and still find more and more in it with every viewing. Very few films can ever claim to be that intense, that deep, that rewarding.</fullReview>

I have also watched it recently and the experience was just as pleasurable, like visiting an old friend. I still cannot describe the plot assuming of course that it has one. For me I am not at all interested about the plot since I have never been able to follow it but I continue to be blown away by the film on all the other levels of entertainment. It is unlike any other film I have ever seen and not being too bothered about the plot actually enhances the enjoyment. All those involved in its creation are to be congratulated for their care and attention. The technology that existed at the time must have been a hindrance but the end result is awesome. I would recommend anyone watch it but I would advise that whoever does should pay attention as I am clearly not bright enough to follow the story line. If it is a lot clearer to those that do please post it here as a review and I will watch it again with a new attitude and hopefully a additional perspective. This is one of those films on a short list of mine of films which don't age with time. You could watch this film in forty years time and it would still look stunning. I highly recommend it and don't forget to let me know and maybe some others who don't follow the plot in on the secret.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (1968) is indisputably a landmark film in the history of cinematic special effects and in the rise to prominence of science fiction as a narrative genre in American popular culture. Released in the midst of America's initial thrust into the frontier of outer space and one year before the first moon landing, the film's special effects range from the psychedelic "Stargate" sequence to nearly documentary realism in the rendering of spacecraft and space travel. Several of the artists and technicians who helped create the film's special effects (especially Douglas Trumbull) were to become the gurus of SF special effects for the next several decades.Among its many distinctions, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY was the first commercially successful art film in American motion picture history. Curiously, its late '60s popular audience was instinctively more receptive to the film than the mainstream newspaper and magazine film reviewers, most of whom complained about the film's obscure plot, minimal dialog, and cardboard characters (excepting the H.A.L. 9000 computer and maybe a hominid or two). What was clear to many in the film's largely youthful and college-educated audience was that 2001's director, Stanley Kubrick, was deliberately rejecting the established Hollywood mode of storytelling and challenging his audience to a cinematic experience that was largely non-verbal yet, paradoxically, searchingly philosophical. Among a generation feverishly seeking alternatives to the established social/intellectual order, the film was hailed as a profound mind trip of perception and concepts. Astonishingly, much of 2001's visionary power remains despite the passage of forty years, seven beyond the portentous date in the film's title.Regarding the film's non-verbal communication, here are a couple of startling facts: no words are spoken until nearly 30 minutes into its 139 minute running time and a total of only 40 minutes contain dialog, much of which is either minimal or emanates from a non-human source. In place of words, Kubrick uses the "pure cinema" of image and sound (and silence). His distinctly original marriage of a classical score to the film's primitive landscape and futuristic space imagery is justly cited as among the film's crowning achievements. The emotional reverberation of such key compositions as Richard Strauss's "Thus Spake Zarathustra" (opening sequence), Johann Strauss's "Blue Danube" (first space scene), and Ligeti's "Atmospheres" (distorted voices in the "hotel" sequence) cannot be overstated. Nor can the prolonged silences of outer space that greet the astronauts and film audience once outside the human cocoon of the spaceship.Perhaps most importantly, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY brought to film the philosophical dimension of prose science fiction that with rare exceptions (like The Day the Earth Stood Still) had largely been ignored by Hollywood in favor of more adventurous or horrific modes. Deriving its initial concept from "The Sentinel," a short story written by the renowned British science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY paved the way for science fiction's now common use as a vehicle for the serious analysis of such heavy themes as human nature and evolution, man-machine interaction and differentiation, and the possibilities/implications of extra-terrestrial intelligence. From such a bizarre assembly of objects and images as proto-human cave dwellers, recurring monoliths, mammoth spaceships, an advanced but neurotic computer, a mysterious hotel suite with invisible staff, and a star-child gazing with supra-human wisdom on the universe, Stanley Kubrick forged an endlessly fascinating and provocatively ambiguous epic of mankind's quest for its place in the cosmos. Few, if any, films have had greater or more lasting impact.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breathtaking.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The word "masterpiece" doesn't even begin to describe the stunning brilliance of this film. It is more deep, profound and complex than any other work I've ever seen. I am still completely baffled by elements of it. I have my own interpretations, as everyone does, and I can see the connections between everything but I'm sure it is far more complex than my rather simplistic interpretation. Just everything about it (the "Dawn of Man", HAL, beyond the infinite, the monolith, the Star Child) is absolutely mind blowing. I still can't seem to grasp my head around the perfection that I just experienced. Technically speaking, it's a marvel. The cinematography and visual effects are sensational, and it is rare to find ones superior. I wasn't bored for a second. There are a few instances where the story seems to drag a little bit, but it's necessary to further the story and explain everything that is occurring. Without these little drags, the story would be just full of holes and situations that are left unexplained. However, Kubrick recognizes this slight dullness and uses remarkable visuals, cinematography and a booming score to keep the viewer thoroughly engaged no matter what the situation. It's been over an hour and a half since I finished the film and I am still stunned, basking in it's supreme magnificence. Certainly one of the finest achievements of all time, and easily the best Kubrick I've seen so far. Exceeded any expectation I had.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film that singlehandedly took sci-fi out of the Saturday afternoon matinée genre and elevated it to an art form. Absolutely brilliant on all counts. The history of man is traced from the dawn of time, to the space age, and to where?. Even the best of them pale when compared to this masterpiece. Like a work of art by Da Vinci or Michaelangelo, it just gets better with age and will stand the test of time. And, yes. When I first saw it way back in '68, I absolutely hated it. Approaching it with an open mind , I was totally blown away by it when I saw it from a new point of view in 1981. It has become one of my favorites and I watch it religiously twice a year. I can't possibly add anything new to the reviews, but believe all the good ones that you read.

		<shortDescription>Weird and hard to understand, but captivating nonetheless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw this movie for the first time, at the age of 14, I actually hated it: it was too slow (I had to repeatedly press the fast forward button on the remote control, especially during the last 20 minutes) and I did absolutely not get the ending. It took me two more viewings to understand that was the point: nothing ever happens quickly, man's rise to power was a slow process and therefore humanity's decline (Kubrick's favorite theme), as depicted here, should require an equally long amount of time.In fact, the director's idea is that often our greatest accomplishments are in reality an anticipation of decay. This is shown most clearly in the (very) long opening sequence, where a mysterious black monolith appears and presumably affects the planet's inhabitants (apes), as they learn to use bones as weapons, thus getting one step closer to progress but also much closer to extinction.The movie then cuts to a different era, in one of the most beautiful images of sci-fi cinema: one of the apes throws a bone in the air and as it goes back down it morphs into a spaceship. Apart from skipping centuries or even millennia in a very creative way, this also has the purpose of underlining the connection between the prologue and the rest of the film which, as indicated by the title, takes place far away from Earth in a distant (at the time this movie was made, that is) future. In particular, the focus is on a space station where a group of astronauts, led by David Bowman (Keir Dullea), are helped by a supercomputer named HAL 9000. HAL is, by his own definition, absolutely perfect and incapable of doing anything wrong. Or at least he was before the black monolith started showing up again, causing the machine to behave strangely and put the men's lives at risk (this was later reused by Kubrick, albeit differently, in Full Metal Jacket). What is happening? What is that black object, and what does it do?These questions remain unanswered, and given the director was the most notorious perfectionist in the history of cinema there has to be a good reason. Perhaps the answer is to be found in Kubrick's personal opinion about films: he believed watching movies was similar to dreaming, which is why some of his most famous works feature dream-related material (A Clockwork Orange, The Shining and the nightmarish, pun not intended, Eyes Wide Shut). In his mind, images were much more powerful than words, hence the limited dialogue in 2001: like in a dream, what really matters is what we see, not what we hear. Kubrick lets the visual elements speak by themselves, with nothing more than classical music as a companion (the "dancing" space vehicles and asteroids are among the most fascinating and iconic shots ever). When someone speaks, it is merely to move the plot forward, even though in one specific moment (the last scene where HAL "appears") it is used to highlight the film's most ironically moving sequence.Dreams are intriguing because we do not always understand their meaning and usually only remember a few images. 2001: A Space Odyssey is exactly the same: maybe the epilogue will never make sense, but the visual memories that have been left behind ensure the movie has a well deserved place in any Top 50 list of the greatest pictures of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Four million years ago, a small band of hominids scrabbles out a living on the African veldt. They face extinction. Then one morning, they awaken to the presence in their midst of a 4-meter-high monolith of unknown origin and purpose. The monolith subtly alters their behavior, leading them to the concept of tool use, by which they defeat a rival band. Violence assures survival. Jump forward to the year 2001. There are two bases on the Moon, one American and one Soviet. In the course of a magnetometric lunar survey, Americans scientists discover a large magnetic anomaly below the surface of the crater Tycho. When excavated, it turns out to be---you guessed it---a monolith, just like the one that, unbeknownst to the Americans, appeared on Earth four million years before. Except for a single, extremely powerful, radio transmission aimed at Jupiter, the monolith remains completely inert, its composition, origin and purpose a total mystery. The Americans undertake a mission to Jupiter. The spaceship Discovery carries the pilot, Dave Bowman, the copilot, Frank Poole, and the 3-man survey team, who are in cryosleep for most of the voyage. The Discovery is run by a powerful supercomputer, an HAL 9000, known as "Hal." Only Hal knows the true mission objective, and the conflict between his instructions to provide totally correct service and his instructions to keep the mission objective secret from the crew causes him to go "insane." He attempts to kill everyone in the crew, but Bowman manages to survive and to disable Hal while still keeping the Discovery functional. Bowman reaches Jupiter space and discovers a huge monolith orbiting the planet, identical to the one on the Moon only much larger. He approaches the monolith in one of Discovery's EVA pods, and discovers that it is a Stargate. He is swept across unimaginable distances and then undergoes a transformation into the next stage of human evolution, a Star Child.The New Yorker film reviewer called "2001" "some kind of a great film." How have the years treated it? Technology: In the 1960s, big, one-of-a-kind computers were the norm, and it was natural to think that this would still be the case in 2001. It was not until the early 1970s that the first attempts were made to run factories, laboratories, power plants, etc., using a big central computer, and these were failures. The old mainframes turned out to be unreliable and prone to breakdowns. It was then that the first distributed small computers were tried, with much greater success. It would be 15 years before the first high-speed microprocessors would transform the computer world into what we have now. Also, a lot of the machines, cameras, displays and readouts that we see throughout the film use long-obsolete technology or simply never developed as they appear in the movie.Culture: "2001" was a world in which technology, science and computers had drained the world of passion and pleasure. This was a predominant fear in the 1960s: The dehumanizing effects of impersonal technology and artificial intelligence. Of course, in the 21st century, the opposite has happened: We have adapted computers and communications to the expression, not the suppression, of our human foibles.Science: Since the 1960s, the age of Robert Ardrey and "African Genesis," paleoanthropology has tended to discredit the notion that the crucial transition from hominid to human was the evolution of violent, predatory behavior as being too simplistic.Business: Of course, Pan American Airways, the Bell Telephone Company, General Foods, and other companies whose logos we see in the film, that looked so convincing then, either no longer exist or have been transformed out of all recognition.Politics: In "2001," both the USA and the USSR have lunar bases. Now, of course, the Soviet Union no longer exists, we have not been back to the moon since 1972, and space exploration is much more international than ever."2001" was co-written by director Stanley Kubrick and the great SF author Arthur C. Clarke. Youngsters used to modern CGI technology would do well to remember that "2001" was the very first science fiction film to have really believable special effects. Compare earlier "classic" SF films---e.g., "The War of the Worlds," "Forbidden Planet," and "This Island Earth"---and you'll see what I mean. "2001" dazzled us in the 1960s, and it has aged well. Although it is dated in many ways---something that seemed unimaginable when it was first released---it still tells a wonderful story of transcendental human transformation, which has been one of Clarke's favorite themes. It is still one of the masterpieces not just of science fiction film, but of cinema in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2001 in 2007</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back when I first saw 2001 on the big screen ? more years ago than I'd care to think -- I thought it was the greatest movie ever made. It had it all, mystical theme, dazzling (for its day) special effects, cool technology, and Kubrick's trademark meticulous direction. I've probably seen it more times than any other film, and I usually managed to suck back a few tokes in time for the stargate sequence at the end. I've seen the sequel 2010, read Clarke's novel (and all of his sequels) as well as other books and essays that attempted to explain and/or expand on the movie's rather abstruse plot. But, it has been several years since I last saw it, so when I saw the re-release DVD on sale I picked it up and re-watched it again for the first time since the actual year 2001.Although after my numerous viewings the film couldn't contain any surprises it was still cool to watch it with fresh eyes. A few things struck me. For starters, I think the film has aged rather well. The special effects, stunning in their day, are rather commonplace now, but that's largely due to the influence of 2001 itself. Still, with one or two exceptions, they're still as good as many of the computer-generated effects of today, and in some cases, better.Second, I noticed for the first time that, perhaps because of the front-projection backdrops and rather stagy lighting in the "dawn of man" chapter, it had an eerie, almost CGI-like ambiance. It was almost as if the whole sequence was computer-generated, ? la Final Fantasy. Interesting. And still, after all these years, the ape makeup is still pretty incredible, way better than Planet of the Apes, which snagged the Oscar for best makeup that year (some folks say it's because the Academy didn't realize the apes in 2001 were actually actors).Third, horribly stilted dialog. I'm surprised I never really noticed this before, but then, I probably wasn't watching it for the character development (see the toke comment above). Seen with 2007 eyes, the dialog had a distinctly "60's" feel to it, rather like the 50's dialog that was so well recreated in Good Night and Good Luck. People just talked differently then, although it's a difficult distinction to quantify. Still, given the fact that there's hardly any of it (the first actual words come some 20 minutes in), this didn't really detract from my enjoyment per se.Fourth, a few anachronisms. For example, Pan Am no longer exists; therefore the shuttle looks rather dated. Also, I'm willing to bet that, should Kubrick still be alive and working on 2001 today, he would likely be a lot more creative in depicting zero-gee. 2001 was the first sci-fi film to actually address the fact of weightlessness in space rather than simply ignoring it, but by the same token Kubrick in many scenes took the easy way out (vis, the "grip shoes" worn by the shuttle flight attendant), which, seen through 2007 eyes, looks a little cheesy. For example, why bother to climb or descend a ladder in zero-gee, when a little hop will get you there with a fraction of the effort? It was pretty obvious in some scenes (on the bridge and the pod deck, both of which were supposedly weightless areas of the ship) that Bowman and Poole were actually carrying weight. I also noticed, in most cases for the first time, many of the "goofs" listed here on IMDb. Perhaps with an additional 30 years of movie appreciation behind me, I am a little more observant.The stargate sequence: still not bad, although it probably could be dashed off today in a few hours using CGI, instead of the months it took Doug Trumbull to do it at the time using slit scan. I still really like the "Jupiter space" sequences. It has a wonderfully remote, alien vibe to it, especially the shots of this teeny-tiny spacecraft hovering in a void, dwarfed by the moons of Jupiter looming over it.And as for the ending, well, what can I say? Cool, but still completely incomprehensible (despite having read the book). All in all, although I would no longer call it my favorite film (I don't think I have a favorite any more, really) it still ranks up there with some of the greats, and it deserves a place in the IMDb top 250 if for no other reason than that it set the bar for all of the space movies that followed it, the Star Wars franchise, Close Encounters, the Alien trilogy, Star Trek, etc. etc. etc. It still, even after all these years, has one of the most "technically accurate" depictions of space travel of any of them. ...And it's kind of sad that even today, 6 years after the year 2001, we still don't really have bases on the moon, commercial space stations in orbit, or artificial intelligence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I get it, I get it. The first three parts of this essentially four-part film are varying degrees of great. The "Dawn of Man" segment looks a little dated, but it's undeniably a classic segment of cinema. The "Sentinel" segment on the moon sets up the tone, casualness and general laziness of the film (please don't read the word "lazy" in any negative sense. The amount of attention to detail is staggering in this movie, but the feel is still best described as lazy - leisurely and for the most part banal. This is completely intentional on the part of Stanley Kubrick, of course.) The "Hal" segment is without a doubt the greatest segment, with incredible use of silence and slowness as a suspense-building mechanism, the unforgettable "daisy" scene, etc etc. This segment is what proves to me that this movie knows exactly what it's doing.Which can only lead me to conclude that it knows what it's doing in the trippy final "beyond infinity" segment. Heck knows, no-one else knows, but people love it: they call it poetic, inspirational, mind-expanding and so forth. I won't deny that people can get very strong emotions from the ending.My problem is that this segment is undeniably super-pretentious. It would look weird in Bru?uel movie. French cinema don't even give us this sort of completely humorless symbolism, the kind where you can almost hear the director sitting behind the camera, thoughtfully scratching his beard under his french beret and pondering the bleakness of existence when he really needs to unbutton the top shirt button and chill the hell out.(I get it, by the way. The star-child is the next step of human evolution, guided by the monolith just like in the beginning, bla bla)I was disappointed that Kubrick chooses to end his epic film like this. It crosses the line from entertainment into "if you don't get this it's because you're stupid" territory. And if, as has been stated many times, he can't be any less vague because no-one knows the answers to the questions he's posed, he has no business making this movie in the first place. Because it's a movie, not a documentary. You invented the monolith, so get off your hiney and tell us more about it, OK?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seminal Visually Impressesive Film - But just for the sake of being so?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is just no denying that this film has unbelievable scope. Like hundreds of other IMDb reviewers have said, the special effects are momentous. They have a hypnotic affect on you, not because they're exciting, they aren't, but for the reason that they are just so beautiful to watch.Whenever I view a film the first thing I want to know is when it was made and consequentially there after I can view it in it's proper context. I wasn't born in 1968 in fact it would be another 13 years before I would start my own Odyssey. If I would have seen it back then before man had been to the moon for instance or while the Cold War was raging, people were wondering if there WAS going to be a human race let alone what we would be like in the future. Nuclear Annihilation was a real possibility.... and then this film comes along. Something that people had never seen the likes of before. It must have been what many have said on these pages, 'a real experience'. It is something that makes you stop and think, back then and now. I've just watched it recently after a number of years and there definitely is a enduring quality about it. The questions it raises are still pertinent today and it still looks fantastic. The thing that has changed is the way they make films nowadays and who they are designed for. I mean do you really think Kubrick sat back in his little directors chair on set and thought to himself 'this film is going to be great for 12 year-olds to go and see on a Saturday night...they can leave their brains at the door'. Of course not. This film will only interest people who expect to be challenged by film makers in what they watch. Sure you could re-cut the film and lose 3/4 of the running time and not miss anything important and technically it would be a better film. However that's not the point of this film. The narrative and plotting are irrelevant. It's the questions the film raises about humans, our origins, our future, our strengths and weaknesses that are the key driving themes of this picture. One of my favourite phrases I like to tell myself is this ; "You can't tell where you're going until you know where you've been." This film is a visual adventure through time and space. It does have its problems though.A lot of the sequences are vastly overindulgent. They are just last too long. You could watch this on DVD on x2 speed and it may be even better who knows. The pacing is a problem but nothing that would be fatal to the viewer. And you have to remember that in 1968 you are meant to be in awe of the space spectacle you are observing and therefore expected to lap up every second of it. After all, if you're doing something pioneering, why have a 10 second shot when you can have a 60 second one I say. It does grate on you severely from time to time though.Another disturbing aspect to proceedings is the characterisation. At times I felt like I had more empathy with the apes at the start of the film as they clubbed each other over the head compared to some of the supposedly 'evolved' humans we meet later on. They have no human features. They look human, they act human, they even sound human occasionally but I remain unconvinced. It frustrates me that you are meant to be telling the story of evolution of the human race and none of them seem to embody any of the qualities you usually attribute to us. Hal the ships computer had a better acting style and he was just a red light and a guy in a sound booth. And like I say the guys in the ape suits did a better job at the start then anyone else later on.I can totally understand why people don't like this film. Everyone wants something different from their cinema experience. Unfortunately most people who watch films nowadays seem to want all the questions not only answered but spoon fed to them in the process. 2001 does neither of these things. It just makes you think, a lot of people don't like doing that nowadays.Having said that, I myself wouldn't rate it highly on my personal list because I find it a bit contrived and self-indulgent. It also lacks any real flow or continuity. Also, for me a good film has to have characters I enjoy relating to. 2001 doesn't have them, it has good ideas and concepts but falls a little short in achieving them. I say again the visuals are superb, for the time and now. It just makes me strengthen by belief that CGI still can't offer the same realism and grounding a good miniature modal can. The better recent films marry CGI and miniatures however, too many solely rely on the power of their CPU chips for effects.I may not particularly like 2001 but I respect what it wanted to achieve and it definitely was a seminal motion picture. People who disregard it out of hand don't fully realise that without it there would be no films like Star Wars, Star Trek, to The Terminator etc.Science fiction for nearly 40 years now has had its cinematic roots firmly embedded within 2001: A Space Odyssey and for that this film will always have my firm respect and admiration if not my affection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie, I was 14. Didn't make much sense to me, so I gave it no thought. I grew up some more, came across all the HYPE that it's supposedly the "GREATEST" movie, and all that. So TODAY I'm 20 years old and I decided to see the movie to judge for myself. It was nice while it lasted, but frankly I don't see what all the fuss is about. Maybe it's one of those HOAXES where some 5 big names say it's the greatest movie in the world and suddenly everyone is heard saying that. See parallel: "The Emperor's new clothes".It is NOT the greatest movie of all time, and it does NOT deserve to be in the top 100 list. But it's there- obviously the HOAX has worked. Everybody and their preferences so if you like it, good for you!I'm not going to file this away as bad though. I'm gonna wait till I'm 30 and if I'm still ALIVE by then I'll give it another try- maybe I'll see the what most others see.I tried really hard, I really did. I just hope that 10 yrs from now as I give it another chance, it wouldn't be a waste of 2 hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you haven't seen this movie, don't bother. It has no redeeming entertainment value whatsoever. There is no plot, no dialogue, no action, no deeper meaning. Nothing. THERE'S NOTHING THERE!!How 2001 gets such high marks is beyond me. I'll accept the fact that it had groundbreaking special effects for the 1960's (and which are still pretty good). I'll further accept the fact that it may have had greater significance then, being released before man had even landed on the moon. I'll even go so far as to say that it might take on a greater significance if you've read either of Clarke's books (The Sentinel or 2001), which I freely admit I have not.All that being said, I fail to see the attraction to this movie. Even as a "cult" piece, it fails. Typical of several Kubrick films, it is tedious with far too much static. Is it really necessary to focus on the hibernation chambers for 20 seconds when five seconds would more than adequately make the point? Or to show the probe flying through space for more than a minute when you already know it's there? Some call this art -- I call it an effort to stretch a 30-minute Discovery Channel special into a 140-minute movie.The ending itself is totally incomprehensible, with the absolute lack of dialogue providing not even the shadow of an explanation. There's not even enough there to be open to interpretation. Again, not having read either book, I may be at a disadvantage. However, translating a novel into a screenplay should at least leave some *clue* as to the conclusion, even if you want to keep the audience guessing.If there is a deeper meaning to this movie, it is overwrought by today. Maybe the point is that computers aren't perfect even though they're promoted as such. Or that computers can take over if man gives them too much power. Ho-Hum! Haven't we been here before?Kubrick-philes may say I'm missing it here, but I don't owe anyone an apology or explanation. This is a terrible movie that is worth viewing only if you like to see early generations of special effects, or if you want to see Kubrick's heavy-handed, pedantic, static filmmaking at its worst. Take my word for it -- DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME! You'll be glad you did (or didn't)!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are too many people out there who think this is a masterpiece. I'm here just to counter that nonsense. First of all the acting in this movie was a joke. There were no great characters that will never be forgotten (oh by the way Keir Dullea acts worse than Keanu Reeves and Tori Spelling). Their is a total of five minutes dialogue in this movie, and six and a half hours of sheer silence. Some people may call that art but i call it BORING. How can anyone like a movie where the ending is so stupid and out there, that you don't get it (a mouse must have written the script). Hardcore fans of this movie will use the excuse "that's the beauty of it, everyone has their own opinion." Ladies and gentleman of the jury that's not called beauty thats called turkey. That's what i rate this movie, turkey. Kubrick directed one of the greatest movies of all time (Dr.Strangelove) but this is a complete joke. It looks like Madonna directed it. I was so happy when the movie Airplane II made fun of this movie. I think everyone should take part in making fun of it. How can a movie make you fall asleep faster than school does. That's downright sad. If you want a great sci-fi movie rent Star Wars or Close Encounters of the Third Kind or Planet of the Apes or anything instead of this trash mobile. The only time i would ever watch this movie again is if someone held a gun to my head and said "press play" (nahhhh...I change my mind, I'd take the bullet). I was so happy when this movie was over, i threw a party to help me forget how bad it was. I only recommend this movie to people who can't see or hear (it's better if you can't hear the five minute screenplay), don't worry you'll get it as much as the people who can see and hear. P.S. email me if u agree with me or if you oppose me, I take on all challengers. Write me if you need recommendations for GOOD movies (not this turtle paced junk mobile) they don't call me the "tree of knowledge" for nothing.</fullReview>

Its probably only movie that one can watch in fast forward mode and it will still look as slow movie. My head kept on whirling for even 12 hours after finishing it. Probably in 1968 showing spacecrafts would be exciting for the viewer. Lights at the end of movie are shown are even worst than a dance club. I have to give it one star only because lesser was not possible. Those who rated this movie too high might be torture loving people who want other to go through same torture and pain from which I went through due to watching this movie.

		<shortDescription>Visual Poetry - a landmark achievement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the seminal points in the development of film and cinema. Future directors like Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and James Cameron, to mention just a few, were massively inspired by this film. Its easy to see why.Kubrick evolved film making conventions considerably. The plot is decidedly ambiguous and thinly sketched so as to force the audience to understand and interpret it themselves, with very little exposition, and deliberately trivial or even banal dialogue. Compared to Kubrick's previous films, there is no verbal narration beyond the films division into the sections of 'Dawn of Man', 'Jupiter Mission', and 'Jupiter - Beyond the Infinite'. The film if full of ambiguous symbolism, which forces the viewer to invest in the picture viscerally. You then have to reflect on the experience to get anything from it.Acting performances are not really the point of this film, with William Sylvester, Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood giving deliberately controlled, restrained, even bland performances which are designed to create a sense of detachment from the characters. The only character that is genuinely interesting is the man-ape Moonwatcher, played brilliantly by Daniel Richter.Technical credits are really the driver for this film. Production Design by Terry Masters and his team is excellent, working in great collaboration with Geoffrey Unsworth, resulting is staggeringly amazing cinematography, that still looks brilliant by today's standards. He is a genius at simulating natural light and conditions on indoor studios. This is further re-enforced by Kubrick's signature camera-work The visual effects are still hugely impressive, even by today's CGI dominating standards, and for the most part the miniature work is fantastic, as is filming on the simulated centrifuge on the discovery spacecraft. There are some minor quibbles, for example there is a scene set in zero G where the stewardess walks in a circle but seems to walk too far for where you would expect the cockpit to be, and there are some views out of windows that don't seem to correct for the angle that the spacecraft are flying at.These issues are nevertheless more than compensated for by the amazing experience of watching the film, particularly with the marrying of image with existing classical music. Alex North, whom Kubrick worked with on Spartacus, had written 40 minutes of score, but this was discarded when Kubrick elected to use his choices of classical music, which works amazingly well. It leads to an original, fascinating experience, that feels very poetic and highly visceral.In many ways, its the ultimate silent movie, relying more on music rather than dialogue to tell the story from an auditory point of view</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sorry, but if '2001: A Space Odyssey' is anything to go by, Stanley Kubrick, far from being a genius, was not a very good director at all.I think the nicest thing I can possibly say is that he's like an excited child with new toys - so excited about his model space ships that he actually finds it fun to watch them for 10 minutes as they dock at glacial speeds. And don't get me started on the slit-scan sequence.But in all seriousness, just how long does Kubrick think we need to spend looking at a slowly turning space station or a pen floating in zero-g? I've got news for you Mr. Kubrick: I have a life.And what's with Hal? He's the most advanced computer ever created. Capable of rational thought and emotion, one might even say that he is alive.So having created the most advanced computer ever, what sicko at NASA decided to give him that child molester voice? No wonder he went insane and killed the crew.I can only guess that '2001' was a hit because of the space-mania that was around in the 60's. I could be wrong - I didn't come along until the 80's. But I imagine that in the late 60's, when everyone was really excited about the then-pending moon landing, people might have been happy to sit there for 15 minutes as they watched a shuttle float past, imagining how awesome it's going to be when they get to ride in one of those.Having said that, I am not an impatient person. I am simply aware that there's a difference between not rushing a film and making it sluggish.Kubrick could have told the story of '2001' in an hour, and it would have been a much better film for it. As it is, '2001' is pompous, overblown and pertinacious. If anyone recommends this film to you, punch them. They deserve it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly The Greatest Film of All-Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*******The following is a review******* The film deals with thematic elements of human evolution, technology, artificial intelligence, and extraterrestrial life, and is notable for its scientific realism, pioneering special effects, ambiguous and often surreal imagery, sound in place of traditional narrative techniques, and minimal use of dialogue.Despite receiving mixed reviews upon release, 2001: A Space Odyssey is today recognized by many critics and audiences as one of the greatest films ever made; the 2002 Sight &amp; Sound poll of critics ranked it among the top ten films of all time.Director of Photography Geoffrey Unsworth did not want the film to be complicated with printing effects such as blue screen, so most of the special effects were done as in-camera effects.This film pioneered retro-reflective matting (front projection) in mainstream movie production. The technique was selected to produce the backdrops for the African scenes where apes learn to use tools, as traditional techniques using backdrops or back-projection did not produce a realistic looking result. Existing techniques using painted backdrops for stills or back-projection for moving scenes simply didn't produce the realistic effects Kubrick demanded. The technique was also used for a number of shots during the spacecraft scenes, notably to produce the images seen through windows. The technique has been used widely in the film industry since 2001 pioneered its use, although starting in the 1990s it has been increasingly replaced by green screen systems.Due to the magnificence of this piece, I've found myself watching multiple times within a week. It truly is groundbreaking; in my mind, the most visually groundbreaking film in history. The thought of this film being "boring" or (as I've heard) "pointless" is like saying The Mona Lisa is pathetic. This movie is far from boring, it is the most interesting, and visually masterful film I've ever seen. The term "pointless" towards 2001, is a reaction that you'd find in the mind of a 15-year-old jock.If THIS movie is pointless, then what films aren't?</fullReview>

Perhaps it is genius? I don't know, I'm not a genius.And after viewing it, discussing it and even reading about the meaning to this film, it still does not change for me that this film is largely uninteresting and labored. The cinematography and soundtrack is outstanding, especially considering this is from 1968. The theory of evolution is also very interesting.Despite this, the film is an arduous slog for the most part, scenes are played out far longer than necessary. I really had to stop myself from fast-forwarding some parts. Perhaps, this is because I am from a restless generation, who need to be entertained every second. I like to think that I have patience and am willing to absorb different types of film-making but I honestly thought the film was simply too long so little active substance. Essentially, I believe I understand the point the film makes, it is interesting. It is daring. It is unconventional. I appreciate that. BUT...(I can't believe I'm going to quote this character, but I think it is apt) as Peter Griffin in Family Guy says about 'the Godfather' "THIS INSISTS UPON ITSELF!" Haha. What does that mean? It means that this film makes a point and then labors on it. Honestly, my greatest frustration was thinking "I get it, move on!" Maybe I don't have the capacity to understand this genius. But I think I did, the film was just a little pretentious and without regard for its viewers. I think Kubrick got a little carried away.Good, I guess. But great? Meh</fullReview>

The whole movie consists of endless scenes (the length is adapted to the length of the symphony playing in the background). Then we have about two minutes of conversation every now and then, before another symphony starts playing, and a space shuttle travels sloooowly through space. The only thing that really drives the story forward is what happens aboard the rescue ship. Unfortunately, that's only a tiny part of the movie, and everything before and after that is utter nonsense, stretched out about twenty times longer than necessary. There is a plot, sure enough, but it mostly drowns in endless symphonies with accompanying "abstract" crap on the screen... Avoid at all cost!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most overrated movie I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After hearing so much praise over it from the entire planet, I firmly believe it IS the most overrated movie of all time. Everyone spreads around that it is "the best science fiction film ever made" and it's the best of Kubrick. Everyone. I feel like I'm missing something here. How is this better than A Clockwork Orange and Dr. Strangelove? As of now I've seen 7 Kubrick movies, the other 6 were better. I watched it once with huge expectations, and I was extremely disappointed with it. Since people were still saying the movie was amazing, I decided to give it a second chance. So I watched it again with low expectations, and I still didn't think it was anything more than decent. In fact, my rating went down. I gave it TWO chances and still wasn't impressed.My problem with the movie is that it is one of the slowest movies I've ever seen. It basically goes like this: long shot with classical music in background, long shot with classical music in background, long shot with classical music in background, a bit of dialogue, long shot with classical music in background, long shot with classical music in background, some more dialogue, long shot with classical music in background, long shot with classical music in background...For the first hour of the movie I was content with this, the next five I was starting to lose patience. It's so slow like this that by the time we got passed the monkey montage I started to lose interest in everything. Too little dialogue, too little interesting characters, too many long shots. It just isn't my thing.But this doesn't mean the movie is horrible. I gave it a 6 for a reason (albeit barely a 6). The cinematography is amazing, the shots are nice, extremely impressive visual effects - highly earned Oscar for Kubrick, and a creepy atmosphere. Pretty much anything technical this film gets an A+ with. And HAL is an interesting villain.For me, this is one of those movies that everyone loves, and as much as you want to, you just can't. Maybe I should give it another chance... third time's a charm. But how many times do I need to watch something in order to like it?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possibly the most overrated science fiction film ever made, 2001: A Space Odyssey is more eye-candy than substance. Supposedly the film tells how extraterrestrial powers are behind the evolution of intelligence in humans or something to that effect, but in my opinion the film brings this message out in a very heavy-handed and overblown way. The first 20 minutes or so of the film aren't much more complex than your usual National Geographic primate documentary, instead with actors in ape suits in the place of real apes. Of course for no discernible reason, a monolith appears in the middle of an ape-tribe's camp overnight and merely the act of briefly pawing it makes them smart enough to use bones as weapons. Kubrick was obviously trying to make the monolith and its powers seem mystical and beyond the realm of human comprehension, but in this case he leaves too much to the imagination, as in failing to explain how the monolith got there, how it distributes intelligence, and why it would do such a thing. It's never explained, as very little is explained over the course of the film. Most of the film seems similarly vague and ambiguous, resulting in a downward spiral of confusion and boredom.Shortly afterward, the audience is bombarded with shot after dreary shot of space ships floating around in outer space. This entire 5-10 minute sequence serves absolutely no purpose other than to woo and wow the crowd with special effects. In this case, this "classic" science fiction masterpiece is no better than your average Hollywood special effects spectacular nowadays. With modern audiences no longer wowed by such effects, the sequence seems hollow and boring, made even worse because the pay-off is two extended scenes of William Sylvester attending meetings on a space station and a moon base. These may well be two of the most boring and pointless scenes ever to make it into a theatrical film. Possibly Kubrick meant to contrast modern, boring man with the prehistoric (and also boring) primate man. None of it really comes together though as there is no sense of collision between these two sections of the film, and hence no cohesion to hold it together other than the appearance of the monolith, which for no discernible reason emits a high-pitched scream at Sylvester and his team of astronauts.The highly touted sequence involving HAL, the ultra-intelligent super-computer who terrorizes a deep-space exploration mission to Jupiter, seems kind of a side note to the greater story, and doesn't really fit in at all with the whole monolith/human intelligence theme. The Jupiter Mission would have made for a good movie in itself, and is by and large the most interesting section of the entire film, but once again, what does it have to do with anything? As can be expected, the ending is also highly pretentious and tries to put several meanings past the audience at once, not only making no sense whatsoever, but also remaining completely boring. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a film that definitely hasn't stood the test of time, and will do little more than bore its audience during the year it was meant to depict.</fullReview>

Boredom to one can be exciting to another, so let's not go into this very subjective matter and try to keep it a bit more objective.What troubles me is that people think this is one of Kubrick's masterpieces. In my views however, it's doing a lot of things wrong a director can do. Let me explain: - Not even once, the (randomly selected?) music seems to have any connection to the images we're seeing. Surely the music is epic, but if anything, it's working against the build-up of timing and excitement.- Many scenes are stretched out through such enormous lengths, you lust lose interest in what's happening. That's not boredom, that just because you don't have to see someone perform the exact same agonizingly slow action ten times in a row. You get it after the first two or three times. And the computer talking three times slower than any human being doesn't help.- The movie is filled with extremely annoying sounds. I guess one could claim it makes you feel more like you're into the movie, and that it makes everything more realistic, but when you're changing volumes many times throughout the picture because you just can't stand the sounding alarm or heavy breathing anymore, it went too far.There's more negative things I could talk about, but these are the reasons I would never want to see 2001 again. Stanley Kubrick made some great movies, but this one was definitely not worth producing for me.Those who think greatly of this picture mostly do so because of the beautiful scenery and the very impressive 'special effects', and I can imagine that back when the movie was made, it was revolutionary. It's why I grade it a 2 instead of a 1. But to see a few marvelous shots of a savanna, spaceships and LSD-trips, you're better off at a search engine's pictures page.2001: A Space Odyssey is a classic, and I can't blame you for viewing it. I just, personally, can't imagine anyone not being disappointed at the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK first thing. as mention by a few others, this is one of those movies where you'll be beaten down upon if you dare mention anything negative. don't let them...I have never formed an emotional disgust for any film before, this is unique in the form of i feel as much dislike towards this movie as i would someone who murdered my family. kind of like the feelings you have towards the parent who blatantly lets their child whinge and cry on the plane in the seat next to you (that aggressive but depressing feeling knowing you can't do anything). in fact the movie even sounds like a crying child.there is one redeeming feature in this film and its the effects. being the age it is, the effect are marvelous. However i'm afraid that's all there is, the rest is pretty colours and loooong long scenes filled with cardboard actors and the cliché that is a homicidal computer. c'mon even in 68 that had been done to death.The dialog is few and far between, detached, meaningless, and irrelevant. and my god unless you have a desire to sit and stare at bright colours, a fetus and a bad actor for the last 20 or so minutes of the movie by all means. but for all the people who value the time they have i implore you to stay away from this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some people call this the worst film of all time. All that I can say is that I really do pity them. No, calling this the worst film of all time is an understatement. After watching this movie you will realise that no matter what cruel and evil methods of torture they had in the middle ages, no matter what evils have been practiced throughout humanity, nothing on earth could be as cruel as forcing a person to sit through this!What you see when watching this 'film' can not be described as cinema! Cinema does not deserve to be so harshly categorised with this piece of junk! I'm sorry, but I was crying tears of pain after watching this film!A bunch of apes prance around for no reason, then we see a big spaceship! Well, if you want action, you came to the wrong place! The whole film is spent with the astronauts complaining about this and that! Yada yada yada! Yes, Kubrick deserves an award for figuring out there is no sound in space, alright! What he did not figure out is that no sound makes an extremely boring movie!The baby in space at the end! Is that meant to represent the loss of control and how we will all turn into screaming babies after viewing this 'movie'? That is what it was like for me!Remember, don't call this the worst film of all time - you're being too kind!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great, powerful, and unique cinema masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like all works of art, great or not, however, there will be those who prefer not the qualities that make this movie great. Some say it's excruciatingly boring, and that there is just not enough plot. There are more elements to movies than explosive action and a typical, dialog-driven storyline.This movie takes some of the core elements that make movies great and expands and perfects them in a way no movie before it, to my knowledge, has never attempted or at least succeeded in doing. Because of this, it is somewhat abstract, which turns off many viewers, much in the way many people do not like abstract paintings. People want too much to know what is going on. They want the work's meaning to be force fed to them so that they don't have to go through the confusion of discovering what it means for themselves.It really is a love-it or hate-it kind of film, and is not for everyone. Personally, I love the movie, I can watch it over and over and love it more every time I do because of the beauty of every scene. The music, the camera angles, the pace, it's all perfect in my opinion, I would of not changed a thing. Kubrick portrays even the most simple of scenes with perfection, unmatched even by some of best movies these days.Never before have I seen such a powerful portrayal of space. He fills it life and death, beauty and fear, all at the same time. In any other movie, you will see space as nothing more than a place, yet Kubrich manages to make it seem as though it is living.For potential viewers, I will say this. If you are a fan of movies with action or straight forward plot and don't tend to mind if they lack heavily in terms of core cinematic elements then you probably won't like this movie very much, but if you believe in cinema as art, then you must watch this movie. You will not regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the movement into pure thought, the ecstasy of something so great it's nothing, the fetus, the icy blue and white of the celestial embryo. I have loved this movie since I first started loving movies, which was a product of my first starting to love life, love it with my consciousness, and how fitting that a movie about the development of consciousness in humanity would be associated for me with the development of my own consciousness. This movie is about the development of humanity's consciousness, as if humanity might be embodied in a single human, metonymy, a single part of a whole symbolizing the whole. It's really Hegelian and Darwinian. Read Hegel, the Phenomenology of Spirit, and think of how it resonates with this movie. Do the same with Darwin's Origin of Species.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2001 Space Odyseey: Hit or Miss?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was 'interesting' to watch merely because of the hype i purchased it at a reduced price recently. I put it on, sat back and watched. There were several things that impressed me; firstly, the menacing character HAL whom we believe is programmed to have no emotion. HALs reasoning was completely justified, the two characters were going to disconnect him and this it's as though HAL feels betrayed, and switches to survival mode, just like an instinctive human response. Secondly, the Star Child, having the main character placed in a lab etc etc, very peculiar but intriguing nonetheless. Thirdly, the use of silence to create a feeling of isolation and to recreate the vastness and loneliness of space. Having been impressed by these factors, I was left completely unimpressed by other pointers which I think ruin the film. The 'breathing' of the astronaut, nice idea but absolutely, gut-wrenchingly annoying. The huge portions of the film which show us 'space' for about fifteen minutes which seem completely and utterly, mind-numbingly boring. I know that technology has improved and if it was 1968 i'd appreciate it more. Modern technological films like the Terminator still took everyone's breath away but didn't carry on and on and on with stupid 'choir' moaning in the background. These bits of the film weren't even nearly as intimidating as the music. It almost feels like the 'choir' are sick and tired of taking shot after shot of seeing this dreary 'exploration', well let's face it at least their moans are genuine. I think I nearly competed with them when I was watching. We can all see what Kubrick was trying to achieve and fair enough, the idea is there and as usual he's organised it in 'chapters', the end is truly scary and misleading enough, or open-ended enough (as Kubrick intended) for people to discuss it on boards like these and claim it's the best film ever. People who think this film is art, are right,it was at the time and still is. But we all have to take this with a pinch of salt, and instead of gaping mouths wide open at these 15 minute bursts of opera and 'exploration' we merely sit and appreciate it for three minutes before going 'this is actually ridiculous'. I don't want to be cynical, it's not fair or realistic to judge the films effects by todays standards, but we can judge the ideas, the script and direction. The ideas, provided by a very interesting and descriptive novel, the script which correlates with the bland presentation of this film, and the characters (HAL is genuinely horrifying) are all superb. I just can't figure out whether or not I like this film. I like certain elements but other bits are truly pathetically long-winded and uninteresting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Labeling "2001: A Space Odyssey" as just simply a science fiction film undermines it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Labeling "2001: A Space Odyssey" as just simply a science fiction film undermines it. Yes it is sci-fi, but it is so much more at the same time. It is possibly the most visually beautiful film ever made and just another masterpiece from the absolute genius Stanley Kubrick. It is possibly the greatest sci-fi film ever made. While I enjoy "A Clockwork Orange" and "Dr. Strangelove" better personally, "2001" may be Kubrick's greatest achievement. Some have complained about the slow pace, but its their loss. "2001" is one of those rare films that is slowly paced yet never boring. There is always something important happening on screen. Some have complained about it making no sense. Their loss also. Kubrick didn't intend "2001" to be a simplistic and easy to pin down film. Its to be experienced more than understood. It is one of the few films I can really not find any fault with.What makes it work so well? The sheer scope and mastery of it all. This is film in its purest form and one of the most multi-layered motion pictures ever. It is one of the few films that can be incredibly artistic and succeed in being so without coming across as pretentious or inaccessible, unlike many other "classics". Most of all, it is a film of unparalleled visual beauty. Its obvious Kubrick worked very hard on the look of this film and he pulled off everything he set out to do. Its a feast for the eyes that only improves with each viewing. Interestingly enough, some have been convinced this is connected to LSD. There is a memorable trip sequence, but you don't need drugs to enjoy it. "2001" is simply one of the greatest artistic achievements ever in film. Put this in a museum! (10/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie that has ever graced these eyes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't even know how do describe this film. It is, without a doubt, the best movie I have ever seen. It is also the most confusing, creative, astonishing, and wonderful as well.For my entire life I've been looking for a movie as bizarre and beautiful as this film. I never expected to find it in a space film made in the 60's (although, that should have been the first place I looked). All I had knows before starting this movie was a general idea of some of the scenes (from parodies), and that it was supposedly confusing. Well, it was confusing, but in a very good way. It was mysterious and artistic; a real feast for the eyes, and on top of that it created an atmosphere very rarely seen in movies. This quiet, subtle masterpiece uses long and uneventful scenes to actually create the illusion of boredom mixed with wonder that the characters would experience in space. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed these scenes too, as I tend to hate scenes that drag on too long. What Stanley Kubrick managed to film was realistically boring scenes that, instead of just being pointless like most modern Hollywood dramas, had strong meanings. Plus, every scene had a certain beauty that only an artist would be able to create.So anyone who has yet to see this movie for whatever reason, go out right now and rent the movie. Don't think about it until you've put it in your DVD played. There will be plenty of time for thinking during this epic.K.T.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrifically boring and usually pointless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had about 45 minutes of greatness strewn throughout a 2 1/2 hour movie. In these 45 minutes the pacing, the visuals, the dialogue (when applicable) was magnificent. The rest was a hodge-podge of (usually beautiful) scenes thrown in there to make it look like a cool sci-fi movie.In one scene of the movie they retrieve a piece of equipment off the top of the spaceship because the computer says it will fail soon. In doing so, we hear 10-15 minutes of the same hissing sound from the man's oxygen tank and his breathing while the pod flies slowly, gracefully over so he can get the damn thing. How does this further the story? How does this say anything? I can get the feeling of isolation in space without having to hear 15 minutes of breathing and a hissing oxygen tube. Actually, I got it plenty well before that thank you very much.Another example is a 45 minute long sequence (if I'm exaggerating it isn't by much) where it shows a bunch of pretty colors flashing by interrupted by a picture of his eye, occasionally. These would have been magnificent scenes if they had done something for the story or highlighted some type of theme that actually applies. I guess it's supposed to represent the infinite, but I don't see the infinite as being a bunch of random effects shots all streaming together in the most lethargic fashion possible. Maybe that's just my opinion.It's almost as if they are going for this artsy style which includes only a few brilliant moments of actual human emotion strung together by a bunch of effects sequences that show the same things, with the same noises, for such a long time that I felt like shooting myself in several instances (notably the ones I mentioned).In summary, I'd give those 45 minutes I mentioned before a 9.5/10 because I could imagine them being magnificent with decent support from the rest of the movie, while the rest of the movie gets a 1/10. Which averages out to about 4/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite the passage of nearly four decades...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey" (hereafter "2001") remains benchmark cinematic science fiction of the highest order. No serious cinemaphile can deny the majesty and beauty of this film, nor can they deny its unique position in cinema history. Much like earlier films such as "King Kong," the Kubrick masterwork ushered in a new age of film-making that paved the way not only for the giddy, fantastical, and profitable excitement of "Star Wars" (1977), a groundbreaker in its own right, but also an entire wave of "smart" films of speculative fiction, especially those involving machine intelligence. Think "Silent Running" and "Colossus: The Forbin Project," "Alien" and "Blade Runner" and "The Terminator," etal, right down to recent films like "AI" and "I, Robot" (which is admittedly based on an Asimov tale that pre-dates "2001," but never mind). All seem hardly possible without the trailblazing of "2001." All owe an inestimable debt to Kubrick's vision.It's most peculiar writing about a film I've seen more than twenty times in a movie theater, including several times on a Cinerama screen, and uncounted times on VHS, Laserdisc, and DVD. I almost feel as if I know it so well that there's nothing left to say about it, and perhaps there's not a lot I can add to the reams of reviews posted here on the IMDb and elsewhere. Still, the film has been a favorite of mine ever since I first saw it over 35 years ago, so it deserves at least a mention in my IMDb comments folder, right? Right.The impeccable Geoffrey Unsworth cinematography, the razor perfect editing of Ray Lovejoy, the immaculate production design, art direction, even the costuming; all illuminate the unmistakable vision of director/producer/co-writer Stanley Kubrick, one of the undeniable masters of film direction. More, "2001" is very much a piece of the Sixties/Seventies zeitgeist, an indelible cultural meme that spoke to the deepest yearnings and loftiest ambitions of those idealistic and turbulent years. The film's only real flaws now are the unavoidable anachronisms and its ambitious calendar of interplanetary travel. PanAm went belly up along with Bell, and it's a good five years since that mundane tic of the Gregorian calendar (millennial ignorance notwithstanding) and we're still a long way from Mars, let alone Jupiter and The Beyond. But "2001" still exerts the same power, still evokes the same sense of awe at the mystery and majesty of the universe, as well as our place within it.The film tells a fairly simple story in a somewhat oblique fashion: Humanity, nudged by an alien artifact, discovers tools, or more specifically weapons, and in the blink of one of the most famous jump cuts in cinematic history, masters technology, which leads inevitably to an alien beacon planted beneath the surface of Luna. What comes after, in a third act so lengthy it begins before intermission, is the true meat of Kubrick and Clarke's story, and the welcome introduction of one of the most compelling and thought-provoking cinematic villains ever created: the HAL9000 computer.I could fill out the rest of this commentary just talking about HAL, but will spare the wandering eye. Suffice to say, imnsho, HAL is the true protagonist of Act Three (HAL's tragic error of pride leads to his own destruction), but already I digress...Kubrick's film works so beautifully because he prompts his audience to think for itself, and does it primarily without words. Not to spite Clarke's simultaneously-written novel, which is worthy science fiction in its own right, but Kubrick's command of cinematic storytelling connects on a much more visceral, indelible level, deftly showing rather than telling. A thousand words of prose could not match the grandeur of "The Blue Danube" wedded to the intricate beauty of a shuttle docking with an orbital space station, or communicate the inherent humor of a man contemplating a zero-gravity toilet, nor could they match the psychedelically effective rendition of interstellar transport at the act's climax. Hard-nosed realists might argue that the provocative ending to Clarke's novel ("...but he would think of something.") is more satisfying than Kubrick's somewhat baroque and mystic one, but the message is clear: Man has risen above his darker nature (personified by HAL, and also Moon-Walker, the two characters who commit murder) and been transformed. Into what? Well, that's for you to decide."2001: A Space Odyssey" is without question a film that demands to be seen on the big screen, the bigger the better. I can't recommend viewing it that way highly enough, though I imagine most anyone reading this will have slim opportunity to do so again until it enjoys an anniversary theatrical re-release of one denomination or another. A nice 40th sounds good to me!Edit: Okay, at this point (4.17.11), I'll settle for a 50th anniversary viewing.</fullReview>

It is a living testimony of how overrated Kubrick's work really was.The story is pointless, since it goes nowhere and explains nothing. There is about 30 minutes of dialog or so stretched out over the entire movie (which also indicates how crappy the story must be), and most of the scenes just keep going and going without adding anything except maybe incredible boredom. Even the actors working on the film though it would be terrible, even while they were making it.This movie is terrible, and should never have been made. If this is what science fiction should aspire too, then science fiction is a sad genre indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterful and influential epic film - and boring to those with inactive minds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sadly it appears that younger generations of filmgoers don't appreciate this film. Having been raised on frenetic, action-packed "science fiction" films like the Star Wars and Matrix series, and having spent too much time immersed in the chaotic frenzy of video games, they finally sit down to "2001" and are bored and frustrated by it. Well, naturally, if you're used to films in which every three seconds there is a crash, a special effect, a sex joke, an explosion or a killing - then you attempt to watch a slow, ponderous film like "2001" you're going to get bored. For those people, this is an education in what cinema can be. Science fiction doesn't have to be horror, comedy or martial arts. It can be literature and philosophy. "2001" dares to ask meaningful questions of the viewer, for example, "What is mankind's place and purpose in the universe?" And it doesn't provide all the answers. It challenges the viewer to come up with his/her own answers. Other issues, such as man vs. machines of man's invention, and the possibility of higher "intelligence" than man existing, are also also addressed but not given pat or preachy answers. The ambiguity is part of the appeal of this film, in addition to the spectacular visuals. The slow pace and long scenes give the viewer a chance to digest and contemplate what he/she has just seen and heard, while the film is still in progress. The long scene of the spacewalk with the only sound being the astronaut's breathing is intended to make the viewer a little uncomfortable. The extended special effects sequence near the end is almost like taking a hallucinogenic drug, but without the need to actually take one. This film, like other wide-screen epics (Lawrence of Arabia et. al.) really needs to be seen in a theater with a large screen and good sound system, or at least on a large, high-quality video screen with good sound. I was lucky to get to see it at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood in 1973, and it was shown with an intermission - and the soundtrack included an "overture" which was played before the curtain even went up, and also at the end of the intermission, to help set the mood. Of course the cinematography is masterful - space travel never looked this elegant or beautiful, in any other film save possibly "Apollo 13." Beyond that, it is the intellectual challenge that the film presents to the viewer that makes this film so memorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Painfully slow at times, fascinating and exciting at others ? an intelligent sci-fi that looks great and is engaging despite having some weak aspects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A group of apes feed together as a tribe, fending off other apes. The discovery of a tall black monolith, the use of a weapon and the sending of a signal see us jump into the future where a mission is being sent to the moon. The mission is in response to the discovery of an unnatural monolith that had been deliberately buried under the surface. When the monolith emits a high pitch signal we jump 18 months forward to a mission on its way to Jupiter. Drs Bowman and Poole lead, with the rest of the crew in hibernation and the ship under the control of a HAL-9000 series computer. Things are strange enough with the mysterious nature of the mission but an apparent error in HAL creates more immediate worries.If you will humour me for a moment I will state my interpretation of the plot before looking at the film. To me the set up is about evolution of man, here being either guided or monitored by an alien race for reasons we can only wonder about. Obviously the monoliths mark times where we have advanced to a point where we can go to the next step, with Bowman's eventual journey just being the next step in man's evolution. Now what HAL's malfunction has to do with this is beyond me, in fact I'd say that it is actually unrelated but is just a separate part of the same story. However this is not a problem because both parts of the story are full of interesting ideas and strands that more than fill what is, lets be honest, a rather slow and unnecessarily long film. The pace may infuriate modern, younger viewers who have come to this as "one of the greatest sci-fi's ever made" expecting it to be an Aliens or a Star Wars ? it isn't, it is cold, remote, slow and built on ideas more than action.The film does have several sections that could have been significantly trimmed or lost altogether and it is hard to see why some of them were there other than to fill out the running time (the bit about the rumour of "infection" on the moon could have been lost as we are told this much briefer in the meeting in the next scene; and the apes could have been shorter) and this is always a problem to me while those scenes are on. However, as an overall film it isn't a problem because the time does move surprisingly quickly considering how little happens at times ? and it does this because it is relentlessly interesting. The evolution thread is never fully answered and, for that reason, is interesting throughout even if some viewers will baulk at the idea of being left to make their own conclusions and not having it all neatly explained for them. This makes up the beginning and end of the film, but the middle 80 minutes have little to do with it and instead are more about a view of the dangers inherent in a cold future where computers are given too much trust, credit and responsibility. Looking back, this view has only become more and more relevant and is now such a part of sci-fi that it is so easy to forget how influential this film has been. It is never fully explained why HAL goes (to quote the President in Strangelove) "a little funny" but it works the better for us not knowing ? it feeds our mistrust of him as a computer because it could have been deliberate, accidental, pre-programmed or just his application of pure, cold logic to an situation that, because it involves humans, can never be seen in those terms. I won't ramble on, but it provides so much food for thought that it more than makes up for the very cold, stretched plot and running time.Although it is easy to pick holes in it from our CGI-enhanced world, the film still looks great and, more than that is actually imaginative ? something that CGI sometimes fails to be. Again there are probably too many long scenes of craft moving silently through space but generally they are interesting. The first cut form bone to ship to the Blue Danube is iconic and will be known even to those who have never seen the film; meanwhile the silence of space is well used. The Stargate scene is well known as a "trippy" scene but even straight it works and (despite being overlong and slightly dated) is imaginative and interesting. The cold mood continues with the direction as Kubrick uses a lot of very static shots to tell his story ? without the style and interest brought out by the movement it is WHAT he looks at rather than how and he manages to frame all manner of interesting shots within the ideas in the script. Performances are very much secondary in this cold film but Dullea is suitably restrained even if part of me wanted him to be more human in the face of HAL. Douglas Rain only provides a voice but comes out as the single most memorable "actor" in the film as he plays HAL with cold, logical and unmeaning menace. Outside of these two nobody else really shines as they are never the focus, although it always amuses me to see Rossiter in there! Overall this is deservedly regarded as a classic and "must see" film. It is not a perfect film as it is overlong, is not edited as tightly as it could have been and does sometimes focus on visuals while leaving us to work out the substance ourselves, but these are minor complaints as the film is filled with imagination both visually and idea-wise. Its status and reputation mean it is a "must see" for cinema fans, it is just as well then, that it is a brilliant and intelligent "must see" to boot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is really no way to compare this motion picture to any other movie because no one has ever made anything like it and no one ever will. And it really should be seen in a theater to be fully appreciated. At the very least it deserves to be seen with a great sound system.I saw this movie on the day it opened in 1968, my senior year in high school. I went because I like science-fiction and wanted to see a "space" movie. Remember this film was made before the first moon landing.There we sat, waiting for it to begin. But, SURPRISE! There was no cartoon, no coming attractions. The theater owner at the Cooper Theatre for some reason chose to play "The Star-Spangled Banner" with the lights still up so we all stood, never did that at a movie before or since and then sat down again as it ended. Then the theatre went completely DARK and the strange overture began with the blank screen barely visible.The overture ended and my seat began to VIBRATE as the blue screen with the MGM lion appeared, along with the first deep bass notes, and then my senses were overwhelmed, hearing "Also Sprach Zarathustra" for the first time in my life. The ride had just begun.(I highly recommend you watch this opening, this film, in a DARK room with your subwoofer turned up as high as possible to get the effect I felt in that theatre.) Of course, it took quite awhile before we got to outer space and the movie that followed was anything but a science-fiction movie. INTERMISSION came (a good thing, highly under-rated and unused these days) and we all looked at each other in wonder, caught our breath, and then the ride resumed, wilder than before.I saw it 7 more times within the next year, always in a real full size theater, like all theaters were before multiplexes. I might have been "high" once but I didn't go to see it again and again because I was "tripping". I went because I knew I was seeing a work of art. It was SO DAMN BEAUTIFUL; the sound that you could feel in your bones followed by terrifying silence; the sights unimagined and unimaginable; the affection for HAL turning to terror. And of, course, WTF was Kubrick really trying to get across to me? Years and years and many more viewings later, I understand it as well, I think, as I ever will. Read someone else's comments if you're looking for someone to explain it to you or search around the web, you'll find "explanations", that's not my purpose in writing these comments.What I hope to do is encourage you to watch it patiently, enjoy it's beauty the way you would enjoy watching a sunset while listening to the most beautiful music you know of (e.g, Gayne Ballet Suite or the Blue Danube); savor it like you would a wonderful meal, sip it like a fine wine; look and listen for the clues and the hidden symbols that ARE there. And then draw your own conclusions. Stanley Kubrick WANTED to SHARE some things with you that he found beautiful and he wanted you to think about where you. a human, came from and where you're headed.If that's too much work for your brain, and you can't see and hear and ponder the beauty and mystery of Kubrick's film, then, pardon my bluntness, but your life is about as meaningful as that of a tapir or a pre-monolith ape. If you want mindless escape, this isn't for you.But if you like sunsets, thunderstorms, harmonies in music, mysteries, and sensuality and can have an open mind this film will add something to your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though this movie was made long before most of the readers of this Website were born, it's quality and workmanship blow the newest Star Wars (or other recent) flicks out of the water.Seems like the kids nowadays have no appreciation for hand drawn art work - it's all about polygon rendering.... Who cares if your computer can draw - Where's the respect the real artists!?2001 is still the most accurate depiction of space exploration by humans in this century (even if Kubrick's idea of fashion is a bit screwed up). Beats the hell out of sci-fi flicks that still think there's sound in the vacuum of space (like Star Wars episode whatever).Don't get me wrong - Star Wars Ep. whatever has many shiny objects and loud noises to occupy the masses - but nothing will beat the hand drawn, genuine workmanship of Trumbull and Dykstra.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very big let down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I bought this movie because "2001: A Space Odyssey", was one of the "classics" I had not yet seen. I had a brief prior understanding of the plot (the whole Hal thing), but was fairly in the dark about this movie. I was excited when I sat down to watch it.I can honestly say I gave this movie a shot, but for me, this movie was something akin to watching a plant grow for three hours. I am sure there are some that find this movie to be a masterpiece. But I have to believe for most of the public, this movie was almost intentionally boring.Now intellectuals will claim, "You just don't understand the brilliance of 2001: A Space Odyssey". Well I am hear to tell you it it has nothing to do with understanding...rather its about "wanting to understand". I have no interest in spending 3+ hours of my life being supremely bored, trying to analyze what Stanley Kubrick was trying to communicate 35+ years ago.The purpose of any movie is to entertain, and if after being entertained you can take away a deeper meaning in a movie, then all the better. But you first must have an entertainment value, which in my opinion this movie was devoid of.When I finally hit the stop button on this movie, I could not describe how let down I was. I am not into space movies all that much. Lasers, phasers and androids are not my thing. But one of my favorite movies was "Alien" - A slow paced movie that thrived into a classic because of the incredible suspense associated with it. There was a great payoff after the first hour of waiting.When I was in college, in my Literature class we used to sit around for hours discussing what the author (i.e Twain, Hemmingway, Poe, etc...) "really meant" in his book. I always used to suggest he meant what was written in his/her book, hence why he wrote it. I was usually dismissed as "not getting it" as others suggested some deeper meaning, something the author did not write, but somehow what he actually meant.OK, whatever. Everyone is different. Some people see 2001: A Space Odyssey as a masterpiece. I see it as an extremely over-hyped movie, the most boring movie I have ever seen and I will never watch again.And in the rare case this movie had some deeper meaning that Stanley Krubrick wanted you to find, I have to ask....Who Cares?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I admire its theatrical scope but it has not aged well at all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I bought Stanley Kubrick's "2001" on DVD along with the (far superior) "Clockwork Orange." I have watched it since I was a child and admire this movie for its theatrical scope - as a movie buff, this is a milestone for me and my viewing experience because it is a breakthrough in narrative and for that reason alone I am thankful. I will always remember it and always take it into mind as one of the best examples of a director holding an audience and controlling them in his grip.But (and this is a huge "but") it has not aged well over the years. Many of its scenes that depict space travel had audiences sprawled in awe - it was the first feature film to really depict outer space as something realistic (and man hadn't even landed on the moon yet!). But compared to today's films, it is not very good. It is corny, overlong and unrealistic. Back then, it was a reason to see the film. Now, it's not impressive at all. This may seem ignorant, but think about it for a minute - why should we praise a film for being "the first of its kind" when other films have come along and done the same thing, much better?I understand doing this to a certain extent - but to say "2001" is great solely because of its effects and for being "the first" is silly, as far as I see it, because much of it now just isn't very good. Cinema elitists enjoy explaining the reason it is still "great" because of its effects. The point they seem to always bring up is "...at the time of its release...". I understand this but _now_ it is no longer fascinating as it's been done many times since.Kubrick is too fascinated with long empty passages of nothingness. It's like some self-indulgent ego-trip - take the opening for example. Four minutes (!) of absolutely nothing occurring on screen, just eerie music. Finally it opens, like some sort of epic opera and we are shown the planet's eclipse with the famous soundtrack, etc.I find this incredibly poor storytelling, not because I think it's "boring" or "too slow" but because it is pointless. I admire long movies ("Once Upon a Time in America" 4-hour version is wonderful) but "2001" has many scenes that go on endlessly, needlessly. There's a difference between slowness (any Leone film will be) but at least Leone uses this as a canvass for exploring something - Kubrick, many times in this particular film (and maybe only this film), doesn't really "show" us anything meaningful. It's like we're staring at a moving spacecraft for two minutes. I check my watch at three minutes when the music is starting to tell us it may be over soon and I think, "Did that in any way actually improve the story itself, or show us anything useful?"No. It's basically bragging to the audience - "look how good it looks." Problem is it looks like crap nowadays.The critics tend to love this long nothingness because of its artistic merits. And I somewhat understand this - I can understand praising "2001" for its uniqueness, its powerful narrative. But the fact of the matter is that as a movie it's simply not very good because of this! It has dated very poorly. E.g. the space station segments - they are one of the only moments in the film with extensive dialogue. The "futuristic" suits are laughably '60s-ish and some of the ideas in the movie about communication via video, etc. are ludicrous.That happens in any movie after a certain amount of time, but "2001" almost entirely depends upon this. I feel the actual story itself is weak. Kubrick is at a loss for anything useful so he delays it by continually showing us exterior shots of spacecraft and planets in tune with classical pieces.It just gets to be too much after a while.This all said, please understand I am not putting down this movie. I still admire it very much for what it is and will watch it for years to come. But as a piece of entertainment, as a movie...I find it poor and self-indulgent on Kubrick's behalf. It lacks the satirical bite of "A Clockwork Orange." The end sequence is horribly outdated with drug-trip visuals (it was rumored to have been one of the movies stoners would go see on a regular basis!). Like everything in this movie, it goes on too long - look at "Easy Rider" and "Midnight Cowboy." Both have '60s/'70s druggie sequences but both end before becoming intolerable - "2001" goes on too long...My review may seem very incomplete, ignorant and contradictory but if I had to explain it all in summary I'd just say this: "2001" is a piece of art, but it is not a good movie in any way. I have seen art house films with better plots ("Punch-Drunk Love," "Magnolia") and more involving stories. "2001" is a showcase for special effects and directorial styles - but now it is very outdated and alienating and this is my biggest problem with it. I can't rate this movie because I would rate it 5/5 in some ways, but very low in others. As a movie it's simply not very good - as a breakthrough/unique art-house type picture it's a great example of how a director can control a movie to the fullest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An ominous space ballet....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a waltz meets space station, the most beautiful space ballet is created and for your viewing pleasure this space ballet has been imprinted onto film. One need not question that Stanley Kubrick obsessed to bring you one of his masterpieces from the middle of his career, the attention to detail is apparent throughout the film. A highly advanced computer: HAL-9000, marks the conquest of human engineered computer technology. HAL is given full control over an entire space shuttle that is on an ominously secret mission to Jupiter space. Throughout the film details and agendas never seem to be "on the surface." The tension of this film is never going to fade from your memory, as the fate of astronauts Dave and Frank become under the control of the cold and calculated "mind" of the HAL-9000. Evolution is the repeated theme and is present in nearly every plot point in the film. This brings up the question: Are we designing our own demise?You will be left with questions, questions best answered by watching the film multiple times to grasp what YOU perceive to be true. Don't let others answers your two-thousand-and-one questions to 2001: A Space Odyssey, instead let your emotions and perceptions guide you, because as humans that is all we have that separates us from a machine: our error filled, true, and genuine human emotion.2001: A Space Odyssey, how evolution is elegantly woven into a ballet of symphonic celestial existence is just so...human</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What are we? It's a strange question at first and not the kind you usually ask. Yet people like Carl Sagan and Richard Feynman asked this question numerous times in their careers. They posed it with humility and reason, never making up answers, and assuming that everything that science had come up with was wrong. In an interview where Feynman was asked about the certainty pertaining to the scientific method, he expressed his view, being that of a Cartesian, and how he would rather be filled with doubt, than to have answers that could possibly be wrong. Its noble and it entails the integrity of a curious mind who believes in the beauty of investigating and discovering, rather than basing your conclusion on little or no evidence. 2001: A Space Odyssey does not provide answers, but it gives us insights into what the human race is, posing even greater questions to the potential we hold as self-conscious beings. 2001 is significantly different from the usual science fiction film. Although it poses the usual question's pertaining to the uniqueness of our species, the existence of God, and the direction we are heading in our progressivism, it rarely goes beyond a few simple lines of dialogue. The few characters, mostly being astronauts and a few Hominids, utter very few words as the story progresses from the dawn of humankind, to the evolutionary stage of space exploration. But then again, it's those very moments that simply play out as naturalistic as possible that truly define the story, as the images of objects floating in space, with "On the Beautiful Blue Danube" playing in the background that we truly come to be in sync with the spirit of the film. This spirit is mysterious, and although we still don't understand what it is, or where it came from. But the search becomes all the more invigorating as we challenge both our intellectual and explorative capacities, thus gaining a greater understanding of the human spirit. When human kind was still developing, our awareness was at a minimal state of ambiguity, never truly grasping the significance of any particular action, relying purely on instinct. A scene where a group of Hominids stumble upon a monolith, shows them react with wild and almost chaotic rage at the sight. Not too long after, they learn to kill enemy combatants for land. As our ancestor raises the bone and begins to shatter various bones on the ground, the shot is given a particular focus as it entails the essence of discovery in the most primitive standards. When at the peaking point of our development, we are more casually reliant on ungodly technological advances, endowing them with their own conscious awareness that merely gives greater reason to ponder the definition of intelligence. The Hal 9000, an artificial intelligence unit claims its inability to commit error, already symbolizing the very arrogance that defines our own self-indulged obligation to intellectual superiority. Hal's devotion to intelligence although admirable, is clouded with pride to the degree that it mirrors our own fear of death and failure in the face of the inevitable. Human beings, although the most intelligent creatures known so far, classify themselves as intelligent. Yet, with what little we still don't know about the Universe, there could be life elsewhere in the Universe, probably vastly more intelligent than we are. Our modern day Carl Sagan, or Stephen Hawking, as daunting as their intellects are to the average individual, could merely pose as amateurs to intelligent alien life, depending on their own conception of intelligence. The discussion to intelligence is central to the theme of this film, for it pertains with our own approach towards our ever growing desire to ascend and evolve. The film's episodic pattern of storytelling introduces a black monolith in each chapter. There are some speculations regarding these monoliths, and at times they drive the characters, be it the hominids, or the astronauts to further questioning their origins. The beliefs are focused around the notion of an extraterrestrial species. Their intentions, although never clear, are more viewed in the concepts of overseers to the universe. With 2001, being based on Arthur C. Clarke's novel of the same name, the origin of the multiple Monolith's gives little if any detail to their conception, Only the fact that they are of nonhuman origin, that there is some understanding of their descent, but little of their purpose. 2001: A Space Odyssey is something to wonder, for it is the sort of film that although gives very little answers, it raises the kinds of questions which have driven us from the jungles of Africa to the infinite realm of Space, in our quest for knowledge and understanding. Stanley Kubrick's vision of the human capacity for knowledge is an enlightening and extraordinary attempt as his classic space epic, through long shots of the soundless and weightless space, combined with J Strauss's "On the Beautiful Blue Danube", there comes a more poetic feeling of the beautiful and mysterious Cosmos we still hope to understand in our gradual evolutionary development. 2001 is a landmark of discovery, and even inspiring to the degree that it is spiritual and Godly in its essence. When touching on God, I don't mean a sentient being outside the universe, but more towards Arthur C. Clarke's definition, which pertains towards knowledge and the path that encompasses its essence as human kind still strives with the enthusiasm that drives the very curiosity that define people like Richard Feynman in their quest for understanding. Feynman once said, "When you doubt and ask, it gets a little harder to believe", and although this clarifies the difficult journey humanity embarks on every day when learning, it's the first and necessary step to arriving at a more honorable degree of knowledge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yeah There's Not Much Story But Who Cares?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) **** (out of 4) After discovering a mysterious object beneath the moon's surface, an astronaut heads to Jupiter with a thinking computer known as the HAL 9000.That doesn't sound like too much of a plot description but to be honest there's really not too much "story" here. Of course, the lack of a well-detailed story is something people use to attack the film and I agree that more of a "story" would probably have been good during the middle portions of the film but that doesn't take away the overall impact of the movie. I was lucky enough to see this on the big screen in 2016 and it's just amazing to see this film and think that it was made over forty-five years ago.Needless to say, this film is all Stanley Kubrick as he pretty much did everything. This brain child is without a question a masterpiece on the visual level and it's just remarkable to see how well this film has stood up over time. I consider myself a major film buffs that enjoys movies from all eras but there's no way to deny that certain classics have fault with their special effects when viewed today. There's really not a single fault in regards to the effects and I must say that this film remains the benchmark for everything dealing with outer space.We could name dozens of science fiction films that 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY influenced but I think it would be easier to say that every sci-fi film that followed owes something to this. What was so remarkable is how the special effects look 100% here and even if you try looking for something that looks fake you're not going to find it. Kubrick did a remarkable job at creating space and so much so that if you learned he actually went to space to film this stuff you'd believe it. The sets are also rather remarkable and they too look every bit as great today as when they were released.The actors in the film are also very good but they really do take a back seat to everything else. This is a visual movie with breathtaking cinematography and I've already talked about the special effects. The film also works on your ears and we've got one of the greatest music scores ever recorded as well as some of the greatest sound effects you'll ever hear. Again, hearing and seeing 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY is really an adventure and an experience all of its own.Kubrick created several great films in his career and while I don't rank this as his greatest, it's impossible to underplay its importance in history and how remarkably well it stands up decades after its release.</fullReview>

After the original film content provokes the viewer's imagination, deliberately giving more questions than answers, leaving it up to everyone, whether you work out the possibility of developing a sense of it all. This became a cult base and an inspiration to many other sci-fi. I think the key to the film is the scene where the flying bone as a tool discovered monkey turns to space rockets, as well as a monkey hardly imagined something like that, so we can hardly imagine what happens after a similar leap.

From the birth of man to first contact, 2001 is the most ambiguous film ever made, from when it was released until now. Their is no shame in not understanding the meaning of 2001: a space odyssey because the meaning is completely up to the viewer. 2001 was envisioned that way, written that way, and directed that way on purpose. Stanley Kubrick does not wish to inform the viewer but dares them to feel, whether it be the cold heart of silent space or a machine with more emotion than man. It still astonishes to this day that there is not a single computer effect in this entire movie just real props on a real stage making pure movie magic and to believe it was conceived before humans landed on the moon or did Stanley fake that?(wink* wink*).

		<shortDescription>Portentous, Pretentious, Prescient sci-fi movie, foregrounds themes over character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>According to some, this is THE greatest science fiction cinema of all time - and frankly, if you don't like science fiction, you might like this movie anyway since it isn't really science fiction.Arthur C Clarke and Stanley Kubricks story is more of a naval gazing, beard stroking summation of evolution, the quest for spiritual and physical transcendence, and a mystified, though emotionally effecting exploration of intelligible sources of 'higher power', or cosmic intelligence in the universe. According to the writers of 2001: A Space Odyssey, that source has been there since the cradle of civilization, transmitting messages that are, to us, signposts of evolutionary development; shown in the opening sequences of the film as the first instance of primitive tool use among our ancestors.Needless to say, a major studio film as abstract, vastly ambitious, and frequently empty as 2001 could only be a product of the 60's era pseudo-spirituality. Also, the movies advanced concept of sci-fi production design was hugely influential on decades of sci-fi film, television and fantasy art, but aside from that, the actual "science" part of the story is boringly slow, features no remarkable human actors and doesn't really engage the audience with the promise suggested in the powerful opening sequences.It appears, in addition to the massive "super-theme" (read: sci-fi influenced religious narrative), that Arthur C Clarke and his equally bespectacled co-writer Kubrick include a secondary story about the possibility of highly advanced, seemingly self aware computers, that communicate with the human characters in the "story" while carrying out technical mission assistance during space travel.The movie is VERY slow, and it reverberates with the viewer afterward, as it shows a link between our largely geometric, four sided culture and intellectual advancement and the involvement of a powerful, though not entirely comprehensible alien force over the millenia. A fascinating theme, and a very well made film for its time, though basically so cold, ambiguous and leaden-paced that it feels like a task actually getting through. You could add at this point that the merit of a film is maybe not its entertainment value, but its commitment to realism, the intelligence of its themes and its sheer innovation (the film was staggeringly made back in 1967, looks decades ahead of time in terms of believable technology etc). This might be why critics make such elevated claims about the film. Basically, if you've ever wondered about intelligible life hundreds of millions of light years from our planet (everybody has), then this film deals with that subject, though in a way that treats the subject with consideration and depth that was unusual for science fiction cinema of its day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, 2001 is a good movie, but in my opinion a lot of philosophical "content" doesn't mean a film is a masterpiece.I actually believe the film lacks content. In the penultimate sequence of this film, Dave travels through hyperspace which makes for some very cool visuals. But that seems to be the purpose behind it: just to portray space in a visually stunning way.Let's go back to earlier in the film. The sequence with the apes discovering the monolith is amazing, and sets the tone for looking at the monolith in relation to using tools and the progression of technology. At the monolith's third appearance the "progression" seems to be of Dave becoming a star child. Is that a progression of technology? Is it a progression of mankind? I mean, I guess those are the questions we are meant to ask at the conclusion, but does ambiguity really mean greatness? Even if these questions are answered, I don't really see the significance of these answers.Also, the film is structured in a way that doesn't really get resolved - at least on the A plot line. In middle of the film, Dave and his partners are on a mission to Jupiter, and they never even get there; Dave is the only one left and happens to travel into a wormhole of sorts. By the way, before coming the star child, where is David? What is this room and how did he get here? I don't get why these questions get ignored, just because the film is supposed to be philosophical?This is a good film with great ambition, but I don't see it as one of the most important films of all time.I think the best aspect of this film is Hal-9000.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick's outer space masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY is without a doubt the 'ultimate' space movie. Films like STAR WARS or ALIEN wouldn't exist without this, the first film to realistically portray what space travel is actually like. Yes, the film is incredibly slow, long, and extreme arty, but it's also a masterpiece and quite possibly Stanley Kubrick's greatest directorial effort.After a lengthy introduction that quite wonderfully shows off man's pre-history (and includes THAT famous jump cut), we're transported to the interior of a spaceship, where protagonist Dave (Keir Dullea) must contend with the machinations of his computer, HAL 9000. Everything that happens takes place very s-l-o-w-l-y, but this was intentional and I don't think there's any better way of getting across just how elongated being in space really is.HAL 9000 dominates the film and is my favourite computer creation in cinema; the most tragic too, I think. Dullea underacts to the best of his ability and is all the better for it, and of course Kubrick's direction is masterful, with incredible attention to detail. Yes, things get extremely psychedelic and trippy for the last half-hour's light show, but then it was the 1960s and you wouldn't expect otherwise. Great stuff indeed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Martin Scorsese once said that certain great films need to be revisited at certain points in your life. A film you may have watched when you were 20 years old would give you a different feeling when you are 45 years of age.Well I did watch 2001 when I was about 20 years old. I admired the film's technical achievement but the film outside its opening minutes featuring the ape like creatures left me cold. The latter part of the film being even dull, the psychedelia enjoyed only by people who had popped pills.So after several decades I decided to heed Scorsese's advice and watched it on a high definition big widescreen TV for a more immersive experience. Again the technical achievements is outstanding and still dazzle, it leaves films like Gravity standing because nowadays these types of special effects is common with the technology available to filmmakers. Heck even my mobile phone probably has more computing power than that was available to NASA back in 1968.This leaves the story itself with the monolith appearing in different stages of history pushing human evolution. When a monolith is discovered on the moon it leads to a manned mission to Jupiter to find another monolith. But HAL the advanced computer sabotages the mission wants to get to the monolith instead of the humans so computers can enter the next stage of evolution.With the special effects on screen we have imaginative use of classical music to give us mood. It ranges from soothing to eerie such as when the monolith appears. Again as I get older I appreciate the music more.The film still has problems though. Obviously back in 1968 with all the effort they put into creating the visuals you cannot blame Kubrick for those lengthy shots of the space station or space ship. It does lead to pacing issues and make you feel bored. Even Star Trek - The Motion Picture did the same thing when it was released a dozen years later with all the lengthy shots of the refurbished Enterprise. However the story still gets lost as the film gets lost with its dazzling effects as HAL has to be challenged and then the astronaut enters the monolith. You then see the astronaut as an old man and then is reborn as a baby.I have no idea what it all means and maybe I am not supposed to know as its supposed to be all symbolism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>will describe the movie on two prospectives 1:story 2:cinematography 1:story: 10 out of 10 stars . evolution of human beings summed up beautifully from apes to man (on its peak of civilization and technology ) then second phase was man's approach to moon where man with its technology was shown naive as his advancement didn't helped him on moon. just like a newborn he was learning to walk,use washroom ;eating baby food ; no control over tools etc , but he was moving on third phase was shown man's journey to Jupiter where he was accompanied by one of his invention HAL 9000 computer which was brain of Jupiter mission. here it was shown that computer was fittest to that new environment while man at the disposal of machines or tools for their survival .later the computer thought that man is useless and computer wanted to take over the mission but computer misunderstood the courage of man when Dave entered the spaceship without helmet and powered off computer's thinking center with the earliest and simplest tool i.e a screw driver .HAL 9000 was heard pleading Dave not to power off his thinking power. later on on the way to Jupiter Dave was shown to struggle for reaching Jupiter despite of less available resources (he was traveling in a pod instead of spaceship . cant understand fully what happened on Jupiter where Dave saw himself aged. during having meal his glass dropped and was broken although his drink was still there .meaning if one dies his sole still remains or may be it means that it is the achievements of a man which remain forever . 2:cinematography :on many places only black screens are shown which are simply boring still on many occasions plots are lengthened by unnecessary details (movement of spaceship for more than 8 minutes) one get easily offended by this. special effects are outstanding keeping in mind that the film is made in 1969 ..music was also good</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When i started to see this film, i thought "wtf" on the beginning, because there're two or three minutes of black screen and only music, but soon i thought "what a fantastic idea", and then came that scenes with the apes that some peoples would say that's unnecessary but i don't think so. I'll stop with the spoilers.The film itself was truly a masterpiece, it was made in 1968 but so well made that i thought i was near 90's. OK there's somethings that could be wrong like when he goes on Jupiter and he's older, i think he'd be like, two hundred years old when he get on Jupiter and other little mistakes that are relevant.So, after all, i just gotta say that: Kubrick is a legend!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have watched this movie many many times, from 1968 (as a ten year old kid watching the space program develop), to today. I make a point to re- watch it at least once a year, and I never tire of it. I think it is the most brilliant, and misunderstood movie of all time. So many interpretations of the monolith and the plot in general have been written, I wont bother to summarize, only to give my own view. In simple terms the monolith is God. Black, totally mysterious, thwarting all efforts of mankind to figure out what it is. In the early scenes, the prehistoric humans are clearly dying out- easy prey for the leopard, and in spite of their intelligence, powerless to defend themselves. The monolith appears ( a metaphor for God, the creator, the great mystery), and teaches them aggression and the use of weapons, and a way to survive and dominate the earth. The other manifestations of God on the moon, and in Jupiters orbit- are an invitation (assuming mankind progresses to the point of being able to discover them and ask what they are) to discover, partially, why we are here and what our purpose is. On the way, man attempts to be God. Creating intelligence (HAL), and realizing finally that intelligence is only to be created by God. HAL, for all his technological brilliance, has been endowed with all the defects of man, and finally must be destroyed by his creators (is this mans fate too)? When Discovery finally reaches Jupiter and the third monolith, it is an invitation to discover the meaning of life. Through the infinite, and finally into the "room" at the end, Dr Bowman ages and becomes an old man. And at the end of life, God, the great mystery, appears again (the monolith). Bowman reaches out and is shown the ultimate meaning of our existence, at least all that God is willing to reveal to us: death and rebirth... the ultimate reason for the existence of anything- eternal propagation of life through continuous rebirth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is an Allegory.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IT'S EASY ;) 1. The monolith space rock represents a higher intelligence. This can be interpreted anything from a physical alien, to a representation of a higher part of our own consciousness and intelligence . I like to think all of the above. When discovered- it allows for transcendence. Apes to intelligent humans and humans to....2. The HAL scenario represents humans relationship with technology, the relationship between Apollonian and Dionysian (google it). From the bone weapon, to the spaceship to HAL. A comment that (while useful) humans may misuse technology and move us in the wrong direction- creating a Frankenstein.** Perhaps the true message which combines every aspect of the film is that (like tools, technology and HAL) it is not what is right in front of us that will truly progress us and move humanity forward. It is something that is harder to understand and decipher (the monolith). Blows my mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>treatise about humanness and evolution visualised by a master director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is for me the most perfect film I have seen and it is my second most favourite. Nevertheless, it is not a film I watched as many times as other easier films.I don't watch the film as a science fiction action film. I watch 2001: A Space Odyssey as a philosophical, spiritual, enigmatic, and mystic treatise about humanness and evolution visualised by a master director.For me the scenes with the apes are especially fascinating. And the bone-shattering scene "dawning of man" is for me the most iconic scene I have ever seen in film. The transition from bone to space-station is nearly as iconic. Both visualise human evolution, from vegetarian ape to tool-using meat-hunting human, from stone-age to space-faring modernity. It symbolises the rising abilities of mankind. And the final scenes even reach further than the current state of man-kind.Moreover, in this film the selection of music for each scene is just perfect for me. I love the chorus music for the black "stone". The choice of the opening fanfare of "Thus Spoke Zarathustra" by Strauss is goosebumps-rising perfect for me. Or the waltz "The Blue Danube" for the rotating space station and the space voyage.Yes, there are some parts which need patience, but those just symbolise the slow life of earlier times and the vast land our few ancestors roamed. I'm reminded of Koyaanisqatsi (1982) there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really felt a strong connection to HAL. I can identify with his plight. He really fills out the perverted ideology of humanity in an almost guide like way. The way the future was presented through the eyes of the past, is very powerful. It really gives you, an almost insurmountable illusion of time. But alas I return to Planck moments and it all falls apart for me. But still very much entertaining. The only problem with HAL is that they gave him almost too much personality. At one point I was like "oh come on, he would never say that" I mean when he says, "This mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it."; HAL knew that before Dave got on the ship. I guess we are too much alike, in that way. We love our toys.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have a love-hate relationship with 2001. Seeing it two years ago for a Film 101 class, it was the only one I enjoyed in a semester with the worst films I've ever seen. It was realistic, detailed, a journey into the great unknown. And of course, it was revolutionary for its time. Before then, sci-fi was cheesy pseudo-horror, now only remembered on MS3TK (barring a few exceptions). 2001 was serious, firmly grounded in reality, and ambitious. Its done so well that you could mistake it for a 90s film. Few movies are that timeless. And despite 40 years, I'd say it still holds up. I can't say that for many sci-fi "staples" like Blade Runner, Akira, Ghost in the Shell, and The Matrix.However...in terms of writing, it really only is a very well done space adventure. I struggle to see how one could get more out of it. Stanley Kubrick rarely gives his films depth. They may be about interesting, important topics, but they do little beyond making the statement.The film is about evolution, yes. That's literally what's going on. Ancient proto-humans learn to use tools, our tools become spaceships, and Dave evolves into a "star child". You could watch 2001 muted and realize this fact. But how is this reflected in the writing? What else mirrors our evolution, emphasizes the traits that separate us from beasts?As far as I can tell, nothing.The film has little conversation despite its 160 minute length. Many can't stand the film because its so slow. I can't blame them. There is no insight, empathy, or development. If you aren't fascinated by the visuals, the film is hollow.Dave is not the protagonist the film needs. He's such an everyman that he becomes a no-man. He is nothing beyond his occupation. He may evolve, literally, but his emotions have flat-lined. The film could have shown us the power of humanity with his conflict against HAL. HAL may have power and wisdom, but his computer mind is cold and linear. Dave could have used our unique human ingenuity to defeat him, showing how our species have overcome such staggering odds...but no. HAL causes chaos, but is defeated simply. No tricks or negotiation are used. HAL is just slowly unplugged. He ultimately serves no purpose to the theme of evolution - you can argue he represents nature or even God, but how he's overcome evokes nothing.Honestly, my personal dislike of Stanley Kubrick and his rapid fans probably unjustly effected the rating. Still, although I really enjoyed 2001 the first time, I'm not sure if I could ever watch it again. Its so long, with no character to experience or analyze. I could give a really high recommendation to the types of people who enjoy style over subsistence. Only a handful of sci-fi pull off a similar atmosphere, perhaps none as expertly. For that, I have great respect for the film. But if you're looking for character, some insight into the human race, 2001 is completely irrelevant. So I can only say its above average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive for its time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This being my first time watching the movie, I didn't find it as enjoyable as someone likely did if they watched it several decades ago. The mysterious monolith kept me intrigued for the better part of the movie, and I quite enjoyed how the movie had minimal dialogue and was mainly about observation. The movie was definitely ahead of its time - especially with video effects; and the film really had an impact on how movies were made today. On top of that, it had absolutely chilling music that still managed to give goosebumps.The major thing that made me not enraptured by the film was the prolonged scenes that made the length of the movie unnecessarily long. I felt like several portions of the movie were drawn-out to make the viewer watch in awe of how amazing and advanced life is in the future and in space, which really diminishes the movies test of time. Upon the movies release it was likely enjoyable to watch those long and slow scenes, but today it feels otherwise.Aside from the movie not being as enjoyable to those who may have watched a plethora of more modern science fiction movies - it still is worth a watch, just to see how impressive it is for a movie made in the 60's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At this point the technical brilliance of Stanley Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' is absolutely beyond reproach. Where there is still room for debate is in its tone and dramatic style. The dry dialog, flat acting and lack of dramatic flourish as well as the long and narratively unnecessary musical sequences are seen by critics as fatal pretense. To its fans--and there are obviously many--these are the very things that help to set it apart from the crowd.I won't pretend to fully understand the more metaphysical aspects of the final act of '2001', but I contend that it's not necessarily a film that's meant to be understood so much as it is to be experienced.

		<shortDescription>A film that will grow with you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey is a rare movie experience, one of mesmerizing visuals, meticulous craft, full of valuable interpretations, and a work to stand the test of time. Even as computer-generated imagery (CGI) has given animation, action films, and fantasy pictures an antiseptic sleekness and a practical way to showcase certain unforeseen sequences as if they could really happen, films like Star Trek: A Motion Picture, its corresponding TV series, and 2001: A Space Odyssey existed in a time where amateurish special effects where what was predominately available. Director Stanley Kubrick and the studio of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), however, found sources to provide beautiful and limitless cinematography and special effects work in order to bring space into theaters all over the world. This achievement alone is enough to warrant 2001's placement amongst some of the most important films of all time.That's just what 2001 is - one of the most significant films ever made. Its use of special effects is incredible, its themes ranging from existentialism to human and mankind's value in the face of excelling technology, its developed and authentic style showcasing space exploration, and its use of detailed visuals all make its placement on such a list a worthy one. Too many people get caught up in trying to find "the best" films that they forget about the ones that made splashes, which circumvented into impacts, game-changers, and iconic works. 2001 is an iconic work from a director who, had he never touched cinema, may've set cinema back several years.The film is divided into four vignettes that detail man's interactions with advanced and incalculably valuable Monoliths, otherwise known as high-powered machines that do much of the thinking for humans when it comes to space travel and exploration. The first vignette concerns "the dawn of man," following ape-like beings trying to find food in a vast desert, the second concerns passengers aboard a Pan-AM space plane that learn of an epidemic occurring at one of the Lunar bases they're destined to come in contact with, the third and longest shows a group of scientists traveling aboard the spacecraft "Discovery One," joined by the advanced, supercomputer HAL 9000, a machine that should be helping them on their journey to Jupiter but instead seems to be hindering them, and the fourth concerns Jupiter and beyond.Each of these vignettes could easily spawn individual reviews, and because of that, it's difficult to look at 2001: A Space Odyssey as an entire project. In one-hundred and forty-eight minutes, the film manages to be often enthralling, wondrous, and on occasions, maddening, as some scenes shine and other scenes seem to drag. But all is well, as there is always something occurring in Kubrick's realm of directorial flair and Geoffrey Unsworth's unmatchable cinematography.With all the praise 2001's visuals have earned, it seems like nothing more than a waste of time to address them once again, but they must be. Unsworth's detail is simply exquisite, whether he is showing the vast openness and emptiness of space or he is showing the calculated quarters of these large and sometimes quite ominous spacecrafts. Pay attention to Kubrick and Unsworth's use of the color red, as it often is used to denote fear, vulnerability, and uncertainty. In addition, consider some of the unique and trickier visual sequences, such as the famous Star-Gate scene, where thousands and thousands of colors hit the screen at once, causing a mass amount of pressure and unbelievable visual annihilation on ones retinas. The scene was accomplished thanks to slit-scan photography, which is where a slide that has been slit is inserted between the camera and the camera's subject, resulting in a disorienting but indescribably beautiful and unique work of art.Because of 2001's plethora of visual techniques, along with its lengthy runtime, there's a lot to see but also a lot of detail to miss in terms of sights and themes. With this being my first viewing, I was astounded by how useless and void of significance the human characters are in this film. They essentially have no value outside of being devices for which the Monoliths and the technology work off of. This is quite the bleak future Kubrick and co-writer Arthur C. Clarke.2001: A Space Odyssey works the best when there is no dialog or character interaction and we're left to focus on a spacecraft drifting in the cold loneliness of space or we're watching the stars sit amongst the darkness. This is cinema at its most meditative and beautiful, especially with the wonderful score that chimes in at just the right times. The film goes down in my book for one of the best uses of a particular piece of music, in this case, the film's frequent use of "The Blue Danube." There's so much in 2001: A Space Odyssey, between its visuals, its score, its themes, and its commentary, that it easily warrants more viewings, which I plan to get on in the future. This is the kind of film I can see doing different things for me at different points in my life. Perhaps a second viewing will assure its themes, which I'm still trying to grasp and understand, become more vivid and clearer, where maybe a viewing when I'm an adult affirms realities about the world around us. I'm optimistic for the film to progressively get more insightful and more enriching as time goes on; that's one thing many modern, big-budget films boasting grandiose visuals and effects have a difficult time with.Starring: Keir Dullea, Gary Lockwood, William Sylvester, and Douglas Rain. Directed by: Stanley Kubrick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A timeless master-piece, one of the best movies I came across, what a lucky guy I am. A trip into space, generated by the assumption, based on scientific evidences, that there would be some black rock on Mars similar to one they had previously found on the moon. You are given the idea that to understand the existence of the discovery they have to find her twin. There's not much more to talk about except the fact that by the middle of the story the protagonist had been struggling with the PC that controlled the spaceship, and that he nearly died because of this. The argument is very strong and realistic, capable of supporting this mad theme. Not everyone will be capable of understanding who profound this is, digging into the very point of existence, but for those who enjoyed it, this is without doubt a life changing movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To describe what 2001 is about, you have to look far beyond Sci-Fi. 2001 is a testament to humanity, realistic not in what is portrayed, but in it's message (man and his tools). It explores what humans are really all about, plus our greatest problem - and triumph. To see it as just another Sci-Fi film is not really how it's meant to leave you feeling. It leaves you with questions, aside from "What the hell did I just watch?". 2001 is quite possibly the most human film of all time, questioning our purpose, extraterrestrial life and our accomplishments. And then of course there's how the film looks; few films compare to how visually stunning it is. Plus, there are some of the best scenes in movie history, with "Open the pod bay doors" easily being my favourite. I could go into so much detail with just what the film 'is', but that's up to the viewer to decide.To summarise, 2001 is near enough the perfect film. A film with purpose, emotion, power and gorgeous visuals. There is no other way to put it, it is perfection.10/10</fullReview>

Why? Software should not do that. When I mentioned Technically magnificent...I mean the script. You have these GS19 engineers and space pilots, NOT Star Wars opera. Too many people equate good Scifi with George Lucas and his fast paced shoot em up. In my opinion these people probably live and have lived with a television on in the back ground from infancy. With 2001 if the viewer has any science, math or physics background it's fascinating observing the routines involved operating the spacecraft. Finally, the ending...gotta have one.

		<shortDescription>A film about evolution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title suggests science fiction, but "2001: A Space Odyssey" is more ambitious: it is a film about evolution. The film begins with a sequence entitled "The Dawn of Man", and ends with what might be called "The Dawn of Superman" in a Nietzschian sense. Nietzsche is deliberately evoked by music that accompanies the evolving higher life form: Richard Strauss' "Thus Spake Zarathustra" (the title of Nietzsche's famous treatise in which the notion of a "superman" is introduced). The choice of the planet Jupiter evokes the chief man-god of Mount Olympus in Greek mythology. Just as the discovery of the use of tools by the ape-man leads to modern man, the tool of a space vehicle leads to a higher life form. The former is the subject of history, the latter, the subject of "2001."The crucifixion image formed when the monolith crosses the moons of Jupiter, along with the anguish on the astronaut's face, evokes still another man-god. The astronaut dies and is reborn. The black monolith is treated as deity by man: the ape-man worships it, and modern man places it in what is reminiscent of a chapel.The ape-man is inspired by the memory of the monolith at the very moment he discovers the use of a bone as a weapon. Similarly, modern man is inspired by the monolith to attempt to devise a weapon The pointed comparison is made between the two warring groups of apes, and the U.S. - Soviet Union rivalry. The reference is to that underlying principle of evolution, survival of the fittest.When man attempts to photograph the monolith, ear piercing shrieks shatter the air, suggesting the sacrilege of photographing a higher being. Is the monolith, then, a representation of deity? A case can be made but not a compelling one. The monolith is treated as a partner to man in the development of the new life form. Thus, the monolith seems to represent simply another life or energy force. The function of deity symbolism is to suggest the creation of a superman.In the book by Arthur C. Clarke, three monoliths were probes sent out by beings of higher intelligence, in order to contact, educate, and promote the evolution of humanity. In the film, however, there is no way to distinguish between the monolith as a being in itself, or a probe.The embryonic form floating through space at the end is the progeny of a mystical union between man and the other life force. This union involves extensive biological as well as religious imagery. The spaceship to Jupiter has the shape of a sperm with a large head and a long narrow tail. When the astronaut's spaceship burns up in the atmosphere of Jupiter, the image is directly that of insemination. The thick atmosphere parts before the spaceship, and the texture and image is that of a womb. Immediately thereafter we see the formation of the fetus (in red). When the astronaut ages and takes his last supper, he knocks over and shatters a glass, evoking the breaking of a glass in Jewish wedding ceremonies. When the fetus has matured, it takes the place of the dying astronaut in his bed, and moves directly into and through the monolith, which is the process of birth. The suggestion is that humanity is the father, the monolith (or the life force that it represents) the mother of the new breed. The sterility of the first part of the picture is in preparation for, indeed, accentuates the new kind of sexual union.This union is in careful philosophic opposition to the alternative for the future, man-made intelligence in a computer. The yellow eye of the computer is in pale contrast to the blinding sun rising over the monolith. The computer is an extension of humanity -- it is the "sixth member of the crew", the "central nervous system of the ship," etc. The computer begins to malfunction in the vicinity of Jupiter, which is the province of the other force. Alternate explanations for the computer failure include a high magnetic effect upon the computer's electrical system, or schizophrenia caused by the impossible conflict of programming the computer to be always truthful to humans, and then requiring it to be untruthful about the purpose of the mission. Either way, the computer failure is a definite statement projecting a lesser role for machines in man's future.The film is concerned with what physics refers to as "frame of reference." This is why it is difficult to exactly specify the nature of the monolith, and the final events of the film. What is seen depends on where you are looking from. This point is made in shots such as those of a spaceship docking (to a waltz by another composer named Strauss, Johann), or in the scene of the astronaut exercising in the spaceship.Most of the film is not really science fiction at all, but a meticulously detailed representation of a very plausible near future. Stanley Kubrick, the director, has learned the lesson of Kafka, as to how to be absolutely convincing in portraying a projected world. The method is that of realism within the imagined framework. Only at the end does Kubrick depart from this guideline, in the so-called psychedelic sequence of entering the atmosphere and landing on Jupiter. This departure is necessitated by the attempt to present on the screen something beyond previous human experience.The film is humbling to the human species, since it depicts that the current human form is not the point where evolution will stop, further, that there is some as yet unknown force that will be at least as important as man in the genesis of the higher life form.Some have found the first part tedious and the last part cryptic, but for those with enough patience to reflect upon and respond to the whole, "2001" has been the dawn of a new millennium of film experience.</fullReview>

Kubrick was a perfectionist and that extended to the songs he used in his films, and also to the great use of shot selection and lenses etc that are also obviously on display in this wonderful film.The story is engrossing and seems much shorter than the actual run time of the film which is about three hours.The effects were amazing and even after all these years they still hold up as being really good. Some of the lights-flashing special effects scenes come off as a little dated but considering how old this movie is they did a really amazing job.And the ending is one of the best you will ever see, it is open to interpretation and brilliant!</fullReview>

The man-machine battle is one that is still raging today in relevance. This along with Forbidden Planet and the Star Trek series rank as my favorite space films.

The director Stanley Kubrick at the time had mad ten films prior to this one witch had placed him to be a very influential filmmaker with his use of hidden symbolism and use of political and sociological themes in his films. In this film he used numerous techniques, which involved hidden meanings through objects in the film the position of the camera in certain scenes or even the situations the characters were in. His use of camera angles and sound would emphasize certain hidden points in the film. To highlight dramatic effect he would use rarely to if any sound effects in some scenes. There would be scenes of great panic and the only sound effect that would be used would be the sound of the hastened breathing of a panicked astronaut hurdling through space. He would also use certain camera angles to show hidden connections of props or even prevailing themes in the story just by using certain angles. One of the most critically studied McGuffins in the film was the monolith. There have been accusations that the monolith represents the emptiness of the cinema screen at the end and beginning of the film. The other accusation is that it represents the future of humanity that we will eventually end with darkness if we continue in the path of technology. He makes the connection of the monolith with the computer Hal 9000, both have the same shape of a rectangle; HAL has the same shape of the monolith which connects HAL the death of humanity through the advancements of artificial intelligence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent SF movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My review will be shorter.I have seen this movie last week and the only thought that cross my mind after watching it was that these days, SF movies( despite the great visual effects invented and the high quality of the imagine ) are worst than the old ones.The story is clean from my point of view. The story is good, the action is captivating.The dialog between the actors are well done and interesting.The special effects even are not so grater like the ones these days, are satisfied.The main characters will evolve together with the story line.The action will keep you involved in the evolution of the story.I don't have anything to add to my review, rent it and see it. This movie MUST be seen if you want to know how looks a great original SF movie. Watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the boldest films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joe's current Ranking: 4/1034 2001 is a film of monumental ambition, it is really a work of metaphor and philosophical ideas represented through images. That description may be more common in short films, but to describe a feature film made for general release that fits this brief is very rare. I often think how such a film could be made now, in the corporate age of cinema. The answer of course is that it couldn't be; its budget and scope are too big for an independent and its ideas too avant garde and unpopular for a mainstream studio. Imagine trying to sell to a group of executives a film which begins with half an hour of cavemen and no speech, and ends with another half hour of no speech, hypnotic imagery and loud classical music. It would be like Marcel Duchamp pitching a new MacDonald's logo! But enough nostalgia, onto the film. I think what I admire most is the attempt to tell a story that is so complex, the story of human history, of our struggle towards something ? we know not what ? but it is the thing we have mastered technology, language, society, culture and science to try to achieve. In the film it is represented by the monolith, it moves us towards our goal as we try to understand it. The monolith is the question, the why, the how of life. The cavemen are mystified by it, and their solution is the tool. In the near future, space travellers are propelled onwards by it, and then eventually, it is no longer a question of exploring physical space, but transcending it, becoming something more than flesh and bone, allowing consciousness to achieve its great ambition. I would even suggest that all this is in itself a metaphor for the individual search for understanding.Technically, the film is masterful and opened new doors for those who had great visions to put onto the screen. The spinning bone turning into the spaceship is an iconic image, as is the monolith. The use of music is also masterful, in many scenes, especially later in the film, the music becomes the main character, you hear the overture building and it's like the main character returning.And of course there is what is often most remembered in the film, but I would suggests actually operates more as a secondary story, the part of HAL 9000. I recall on first viewing not understanding why this was part of the film, it seemed that there was this great thesis about human endeavour, and then a subplot horror story about a computer gone insane. But I had missed the point, it was still the story of human endeavour, this was the second act, the complicating action, where humanity puts it faith in the machine (as it had done with that bone), only for it to go wrong. I still consider this to be one of the most ambitious films ever made, and I strongly recommend it to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very thought provoking film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) is a film that really makes you think. It raises questions like "Are we giving machines too much information?" "Is technology going at a rate where human beings will be replaced by machines?" "What was up with the last 20 minutes?" Well, Stanley Kubrick was very good at making you think about these things. His ability to draw you into the suspense is shown here. His artistic ability is shown here. His message is shown here. And his ability to end a movie without any of the questions shown above is shown here. It's sort of like an experience movie, especially during the end. So here's the plot. A space mission showcases the work of Dr. Frank Poole, and Dr. Dave Bowman. They are helped by the computer HAL 9000. HAL eventually realizes that Dave and Frank are planning too disconnect him so he eliminates Frank but not Dave. Dave saves himself from being killed by disconnecting HAL. It's sort of like a film in 4 parts. Part 1 is the part with the apes. Part 2 is the part with the moon mission. Part 3 is the part with Dave, Frank, and HAL. Part 4 is the part with the portal. I highly recommend this film. It's definitely one of Kubrick's best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie that can make you wonder about so many things. A movie that can make you feel like a tiny bit piece of the universe, which you are, but also prove to you that every single action or decision that you make reflects everything that surround us. I've ever seen so abstract presentation of the human mind and the world at all. It amazes mostly with the groundbreaking visualization of the future, and at the same time making the viewer feel like this future is now. All that achieved with the exceptionally calm and normal like mood, conversations about normal lifelike stuff, as it's no big deal that on screen we see so much science fiction, new technologies etc. I cannot imagine what the people who saw this movie for the first time on the big screen in the 60's felt like seeing this extraordinary movie. I envy them so much. The potential of the future research and development in science, presented in the movie, is beyond limits. It feels like everything is possible to be done and also maybe we are not that far away from achieving everything that we dream of. I don't think that there will be another movie which will shake my mind that hard and change completely my conception of the world as we know it, like the 2001: A Space Odyssey did. Jawdropping, mind blowing, absolutely brilliant and for me the biggest mystery in cinema. Still raises tons of new questions every time I see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest Sci-Fi Film of All Time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is any true masterpiece film out there, it's none other than 2001: A Space Odyssey. This film is not made to entertain, but to awe and inspire. This film not only knows how to tell such an amazing story, but this film is widely recognized for it's visual effects. Even in today's computer digital age, I was very impressed. The special effects added a whole new dimension to as what we know as film today. This film is a piece of art and it has many interpretations on what humanity was in the past and will be in the future.Stanley Kubrick's film is a tale spanning many millennia. After a stranger obelisk was discovered by our primate ancestors, we head to a colonized space where a group of astronauts and super-machine HAL embark on a crucial mission to Jupiter.This film doesn't have many big name stars here, practically none at all. Keir Dullea is practically the only person we get to know and he does a pretty good job. He does lots of interacting with HAL and is crucial to the important man vs. machine part of the film.Overall, this is nothing short of perfect. I'm sad there are not any films like this one being made too often. This is a space opera, a mini-horror film, and an awe-inspired film combined in one. The scene involving Keir traveling through the wormhole is just one of the greatest. If you have love for cinema, this should be on the top of your list. It pains me to say that this film will easily bore the average movie-goer, but this is a true work of art. I rate this film 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film stripped to the bare essence of film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film is a visual medium, and Kubrick was one of its greatest experimenters. Every one of his films is an experiment in its genre. Every one of his films successfully takes its genre in a new direction. For SF, 2001 is no exception.The film contains half hour+ stretches with no dialogue, only minimal classical music. Yet these stretches can hold an intellectually inclined viewer spellbound, just soaking in the images. Even the decisions forced on the director (such as leaving out the aliens in the final alien encounter) are worked in favor of the film. And of course Kubrick's decision to leave out an electronic score (albeit a well done one) in favor of unedited classical music that ranges from quietly disturbing to exuberant - or just not to have any music at all - makes the film watchable and listenable decades after its conception. Every set piece - and the film is nothing but a series of visual set pieces, is priceless, from the Pan Am stewardess doing a 360 degree walk in the space plane, to an astronaut fighting for survival in the quiet vacuum of outer space, to a conversation with a sentient machine gradually reduced to his (not 'its') oldest memories, becoming senile at the hands of his human antagonist.Of course current audiences used to modern CGI will notice flaws: the proto-humans have that odd combination of realism yet costumed fake-ness that only real acting (and really good acting, at that) in a costume can provide. The multiple-exposure masks used during flight scenes to block off the star field are not always perfectly aligned against the space ships. Unable to get the engine fire and dust upon landing right, effects master Doug Trumbull decided to just forgo it. Yet these peccadilloes pale by comparison to how accurately physical laws are modeled and represented in every detail in this film, especially in view of the cartoonish and video-gamish liberties taken by the current slew of SF action films. 2001 almost stands alone in how accurate it is physically.2001 was a watershed for SF films. Like another of Arthur C. Clarke's masterworks, "Rendezvous with Rama," it does not try to explain, it just lets be. Unfortunately when "Rendezvous with Rama" finally gets made, it will probably be turned into a current-generation mindless sci-fi action movie with plenty of outer space sound effects and horrific spider monsters coming after the humans. The problem right now is that big films have become so expensive to make, that deviating from formula, as Kubrick always did, is just not a safe option anymore. This will change: CGI will become so commonplace and inexpensive, that we will see a generation of smart films with CGI in 10-15 years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mankind's evolution and journey into the unknown</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What more can I say about this film that hasn't been said by everyone else. Most cinema fans already know about this film or have at least heard of it. No doubt its one of the most famous and influential science fiction films of all time not to mention one of the most unique due to its unconventional storytelling, use of classical music in space scenes, realism in space travel and groundbreaking special effects that still hold up very well. Yet despite all that when I first watched this movie when I was in my early teens I hated it mostly because I was expecting something similar to "Star Wars". Instead what I got was a slow moving art house science fiction film with hardly any dialog and mostly visuals with little to no action. As I've gotten older I've come to appreciate this fascinating film since my taste in movies has changed a lot since I was a kid.If there was any way to describe this movie it would have to be a "journey of evolution". Think about it. When you watch this film you're simply watching the evolution of humans into the people we are today and beyond. In the beginning of the film primitive human ancestors discover an alien object called the "Monolith" which causes them to evolve to a point where they can make the first weapon and kill in order to survive. In a famous flash cut from the simple bone to a complex satellite millions of years later we have evolved to a point where we can leave Earth and explore outer space and the moon. Computers have also evolved into complex AI's that can feel most notably HAL 9000. The rest of the film focuses on the journey into the unknown which we nor our main character can comprehend. Science fiction has always been used as an allegory for the human condition. "Where do we come from? Where are we going? What will we encounter when we get there?" are questions that "2001" asks us but leaves open to interpretation by the time that the movie is finished.For its time the special effects were groundbreaking in that it gave us a realistic view of what space travel might look like.(This was before Neil Armstrong landed on the moon.) Not to mention the famous "Stargate" sequence that is a beautiful but creepy sequence of colors and scenery. Music was also used to great effect to represent the serenity and calmness of traveling through space or the creepy and scariness of the unknown. As for acting its good but the standout is Douglas Rain as HAL 9000 who gives him a creepy tone of voice that matches perfectly with the red electronic eye making him one of the most iconic science fiction movie characters of all time.As I said before this is a slow movie and there is very little dialog so unless you are into science fiction films about the philosophical and the journey into the unknown you might be bored due to the lack of action. Its worth it to watch this movie at least once to understand its influence and impact on the science fiction genre and how it begged the question of what might happen if we journey into the unknown.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review and deconstruction of 2001.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey directed by Stanley Kubrick is a mind-bending sci- fi symphony, lifted with raw stimulation and heavy symbolism. It is potentially one of, if not the most influential and significant science fiction feature length film in cinema history. Its intention, (quoted by Kubrick himself) is to avoid the conscience rationalizations of its audience and to sink straight through to the unconscious, he demands us to interpret the film on more intelligent and complex levels. Kubrick's masterpiece is justly acknowledged as the inception of the futuristic revelation of space adventure films that entice, engage and at times intrigue viewers. It can perceived on many different levels, but we as the viewer can enter inside the central intention of Arthur C. Clarke from the literary piece, and watch the visually motivating interpretation fashioned by Stanley Kubrick whom in my eyes through his methodical directing provides unsurpassed brilliance and genuinely awe- inspiring depictions of stories which are second to none to any other director. His meticulousness behind the camera and precision to fully engage an audience is remarkable. On this particular example, Kubrick takes a well written novel to an extraordinary style over substance, art house psychological thriller standing the test of time, maintaining its relevance and significance in cinematic history.Kubrick ambitiously predicts the future and explores the past by visiting pre-historic Africa showing apes learning of 'the tool' whilst they face the monolith unexplained by Kubrick, it is a major obstacle defining their existence. The film takes 25 minutes to introduce opening dialogue, yet the twenty five establishing minutes is thought-provoking and invigorating opening sequence. The monolith being a key figure to this opening, at every stage when we here the unsettling and somewhat disturbing tune that resides with the monolith. It crafts an overpowering ambiance, not only for the audience but it dominates over the characters it meets. There are many different meanings as to what the monolith represents; it is heavily indicated that extraterrestrial beings placed it there to see how humans have evolved through time, but I like to believe that it symbolizes us as the audience watching over the characters. We are the monolith watching the film and the characters unravel themselves in significant moments, similarly how Kubrick has given us a film to watch and we judge it accordingly.From exploring the dawn of man, the film takes a staggering jump cut through time into colonised space delving into uncharted realms. We as the audience suddenly have to familiarize ourselves with new characters and thus acquainted with a new theme. Man vs. machine. This is where the core story line lays, and where at its heart we tend to feel every emotion making us feel indisputably uneasy. Despite this film not being overly sentimental, (which is seemingly the pattern through all Kubrick films) its ambiance and out of this world atmosphere is almost startling. Stanley subtly tells us that even man at its evolutionary peek on Earth is simply a little child in space having to learn to walk without gravity, be toilet trained and have to eat 'baby food'.The theme man against machine is very cunning and intriguing. It shows us that through intelligence, the computer believes it can surpass humans. However with courage and ingenuity the man with spirit can overcome the machine. The HAL 9000, the main antagonist is possibly the most sinister and threatening villain to reach cinema screen. Its relatively disturbingly evil voice echoes through the minds of the viewer and his attitude that he is ever superior to man gives HAL a very distinguishable menacing presence. In many ways the audience acts the same as HAL. Once the memory and logic terminal is extracted from HAL, the viewer experiences a wealth of strange abstract events, we lose all clarity in what we see and from that point the audience is forced by Kubrick to choose their own idea of what is occurring on screen.2001 is perhaps the most beautiful and evocative cinematography I have ever seen in film, it is a rare work of cinema that has stood the test of time, still maintaining it's realistic and authentic space look. This film proves that a sci-fi movie can be philosophical rather than pulpy, profound rather than pedantic. Stanley Kubrick's dazzling; Academy Award-winning achievement is a compelling drama of man vs. machine, a stunning meld of music and motion. "2001" is not concerned with thrilling us, but with inspiring our genuine awe. There are many divided opinions about the symbolic and philosophical meanings of this film, many people claim this film to be either a self indulgent art house film, or a work of pure art, in my opinion it is the latter and like the majority of the public I won't be diverted from that opinion. Whatever people may think of the film, it is a work of considerable originality and an unerringly satisfying, utterly unique cinematic experience. Even if you will hate or love this film, it is still recommended from me because it is valuable either way to get a grasp on how Stanley Kubrick artistically and poetically presents his films. This being a perfect example, a true cinematic genius provides us with a true cinematic masterpiece. "Let the Awe and Mystery of a Journey unlike Any Other Begin."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie Of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Best. The best. THE best. The masterpiece of Stanley Kubrick, this is a visionary movie.Plot: In 1999, a group of scientists including Dr. Heywood Floyd finds a black monolith on the Moon that sends a signal to Jupiter. 2 years later in 2001, the USS Discovery heads to Jupiter with six crewmembers onboard. Three are in stasis(to save oxygen, food and the secret of the mission), 3 are awake. Of those 3 people, one is the H-A-L 9000 computer that manages the ship and the other two are Dr. Dave Bowman and Dr. Frank Poole. Everything goes alright, until the AE-35 unit(that is responsible for communication with Earth) breaks down and Frank is sent to repair it. Frank's pod then kills him, leading Dave to go get the corpse. Meanwhile, HAL(who is responsible for all of this)murders the hibernating crewmembers and refuses to allow Dave back in. Dave uses the emergency door, gets in and disconnects the malfunctioning computer. Some time later, Discovery arrives over Jupiter and Dave investigates another monolith that leads him into the Star Gate: a portal that transforms Dave into an ascended being of some sort.This is truly a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A landmark movie, but not perfect. Very tedious and slow moving and pedantically produced, Kubrick had a field day putting his "stamp" on this film.Yes, he is a great producer/director, but too much film noir is apparent in this movie. He loves to "isolate" his characters in a kind of silent surreal "forum", and give the audience a sense of inexplicable foreboding (his style is the same in all the movies of his I've seen, The Shining, 2001, and Eyes wide shut). As for an explanation of this movie...WHAT'S NOT TO UNDERSTAND? The monolith represented the apple (I hate to get into religion here, but), so to speak.... that spark that changed forever mankind from mere animals, to self-conscious, intelligent beings.It being on the moon at the dawn of our extraterrestrial baby-steps, meant that mankind was ready to be changed again (an evolutionary change), into something else, that we (at present) can not imagine (that being the case, the change could only be represented by the star child {the embryo}..."rebirth").What puzzled me, and the thing I hated about this movie, however, was that there was TWO stories in it---the profound one about mankind's change, and a silly one about a computer terrorizing the crew. I did'nt see how they tied together, and it appeared just a ploy to make the movie more appealing to the masses, and give it more substance (it already had plenty, to me).You could tell easily the movie was made in the psychedelic 60s....Kubrick must have really been caught up in times himself, as we see in the 30 minute "acrylics kaleidascope" scene.So, some of the movie is really transparent, but since so much also was unprecedented in film-making, that it will forever stand out as a landmark classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubricks most artistic masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are very few directors that were as specific and attentive to detail as Stanley Kubrick. Every single scene in 2001: A Space Odyssey is like a work of cinematic art. I can imagine Kubrick filming each scene a hundred times until it's exactly the way he imagined it. This is what made him such a legendary director and set him apart from everyone else.I first watched this film about 10 years ago and I couldn't believe the special effects. I can't imagine what people thought of it when it first came out. I'm sure a lot of people didn't know what to think about it at first. The first third of the movie has no dialogue and the last third is basically an acid trip sequence with no dialogue as well. It's very different than anything you've seen but if you have the right mind set, it will blow your mind.The acting is very good, but the movie relies heavily on everything else. The plot is not explained very well but the open ended questions are what makes it so mysterious and mind boggling. You see what happens and your questions aren't fully answered but your imagination fills in the blanks and in my opinion that's the best way to do it.It starts out at the dawn of man, when we were all just ape-like creatures waiting to evolve. The group of apes (let's call them) that we see are suddenly looking upon a giant, rectangle monolith that appeared out of nowhere. When the apes touch the monolith their minds are opened up to a new stage in evolution, the use of tools. After this long and dialogue-free part of the movie, it jumps forward to the year 2001 in a split second. The world has discovered yet another monolith except this one is on the surface of the moon. I don't want to get into too much detail but basically they find out that it's origin is one of Jupiter's moons. Earth then decides to send its best spaceship off on a mission to see exactly where the monolith came from. The spaceship is equipped with the best astronauts, and the most advanced computer ever built, HAL 9000. We are then sent on the wild ride to Jupiter and a lot happens on the way that you don't expect.Basically, 2001 is a longer than average movie and has a lot of quiet parts with only the sound of breathing or apes grunting. If you have the patience to sit back and appreciate a cinematic piece of art, then this is the movie for you. If your attention span is tiny and you don't like space movies, I suggest skipping this one. If you happen to take acid or any visual enhancing drugs, this movie will be especially satisfying, but drugs or not, it's a masterpiece of film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is very hard to say something new about this film, because I am trying to talk about a filmmaker who doesn't care which genre: horror movie, war movie, sci-fi... whatever to make a masterpiece. The thing is that Kubrick worked with Clarke to adapt Clarke's short story. What we have in front of as after seen the film is an amazing chaos of questions, about the movie and about life itself and mankind. What is the monolith is one of the most famous questions: maybe a signal from another kind of life more evolved that humans when we just were monkeys!!, or is it God, for some is a cinema screen... You can try to guess and probably nobody can tell you you are wrong because Kubrick himself never told there was just one right interpretation. What's mean the final scene? Another popular question, probably in this case we need to think about the destiny of humanity, there will be another stage in evolution, we will be just extinguished or we will be another kind of entities. You can think about of a lot of interpretations in almost every scene, you can see this film once an again and never find one lonely answer. One of the brilliant merits of this work is make you keep on thinking. We can add as well the fact that Kubrick takes care about make a plausible environment of space: there's no sound in the outer space, the pen ball rolling without gravity, the doctor reading a complicated instructions for going to the toilets... In addition the soundtrack is amazing and the special effects for the 1968 were so great to be awarded with an Oscar. There are so many questions, so many answers and so many thinking...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretension always does pay off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tempestuous waters are expected when it comes to judge one of the ''untouchables'' in motion pictures history. Thankfully, or maybe shamefully, there is nothing I could find to complain about 2001; the grandiose proportions of everything it represents impressed me just as much as (almost) everyone.Much is discussed about a profound boredom caused by the extensive length, on top of an apparently phlegmatic nonsensical narrative, being responsible for turning the experience less pleasurable on a film that could be rather accessible entertainment. Perhaps so, but that would result in an unbearably common, appellative flick, hated with merit by many. Instead, what Kubrick offered to our amusement-hunger brains is a monumental spectacle, with a rather necessary linear narrative, reaching a psychedelic climax that most certainly was responsible for the Odyssey's immortality.Fellow immortals György Ligeti, Strauss and Khachaturian set the tone as the viewer entwine humanity's dawn and forward, in clear communion with the arcane presence of a monolith. Dr. Heywood Floyd's mission to the moon, along with the celebrated HAL 9000's ''arc'' have a particular 60's atmosphere that somehow, through its opacity and tension, prepares the spectator to the abstract voyage that will follow.Oddly, 2001: A Space Odyssey is not a movie that I intend to watch more than once. After all, it is not easily digestible. But it did succeed in causing me an everlasting good impression; and judging by its majesty, pretentiousness, perfect soundtrack, phenomenal images and concepts, not to mention the fortunate participation of the exotics HAL and even the monolith, it must be said that pretension always does pay off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey is unlike any other movie I have ever seen, and I'm still trying to decide whether that is a bad thing or a good thing. It's unique in it's visuals yet the film is also incredibly slow and scenes drag on for a bit too long. Want to see a ship take 5 or more minutes to land? It's here; want to see a weird laser-light show-like thing that still makes no sense? It's here too, and by god is it long! While watching this scene I got sick of the bizarre color filters used, as well as how this scene goes on for like, 10 minutes! If it isn't ten minutes long, well, it sure FELT like ten minutes long! I was taken in by the visuals of this movie but towards the end my attention wandered off. Okay, so David goes past Jupiter, finds another monolith-thing, watches a laser light show for ten minutes, then finds himself in a "Louis XVI" style bedroom. He sees older versions of himself, then another monolith appears, and he turns into a fetus-like thing in space looking at earth.Confused? So am I.2001 is not the masterpiece of science fiction cinema I heard it is; it's a intriguing movie that is held back by it's long length and scenes that are drawn out. Anyone willing to spend the time to watch it, give it a shot, but don't be surprised if you find yourself playing on your I-phone towards the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Did anyone know the actors in this film? No. Neither did I. And that's exactly what Stanley Kubrick wanted - he wanted to create something that was about more than just an actor - it was about life itself.2001: A Space Odyssey is one of the two greatest epics of all time. It is a film of breathtaking technical brilliance that is matched by some of the most ambitious storytelling of all time. In a nutshell, 2001 tells the story if human evolution. We start in the past, where our ape ancestors are starving and are perhaps even on the verge of extinction. They fight with other animals over a waterhole, and the general outlook is bleak. That is, until they find a mysterious black monolith that has appeared from nowhere. Our ancestors crowd around the monolith, and soon after they take a step towards evolution when they use their first weapon. Then, using the finest transitions in film, we flash forward into our own future and see a space dance between a space ship and space station to Johann Strauss' The Blue Danube. We meet a scientist, Dr Haywood Floyd, who is on his way to the moon in secret. Why? Because they have found another monolith on the moon. And, as before, this monolith represents another jump in evolution. Two astronauts, a team of scientists and a computer called HAL embark on a journey towards Jupiter - and then unknown, leading to one of the finest endings in film that will leave you pretty dazzled and initially confused. With this film though, confusion is what Kubrick was aiming for. I've often heard people say that this is a bad film because it has no conclusive ending, or that it just cheats us out of an answer. But Kubrick was no cheat. He was a man who planned everything. I think that he chose the best possible ending - one that leaves everything open to interpretation because no one know what the future holds, least of all Kubrick. Why provide a wrong answer for the sake of a conventional ending, when you can provide an open, ambiguous ending that asks so much? A conventional ending might have satisfied, up until proved wrong. With this ending, 2001 is timeless. To match the scope of the storytelling is Kubrick's almost unrivalled genius as a technical director. He is one of just two truly artistic, technical directors who always presented films that were large in scope, yet always grounded. 2001 is entirely grounded in its presentation of science and fact - no sound in space, realistic space ships and stations, realistic travel times between planets. There are no magical powers, no "Warp 5". There is only fact, upon which Kubrick builds his vision. This film asks everything of mankind. Why are we here? What brought us here? Is there a higher force, and if so is it God, or another alien race? Can we achieve immortality? It asks all these questions and more, yet leaves the answers entirely up to us, because in the end, no one knows what the future holds and therefore how can those questions be answered. And, finally, it leaves us with one final, wonderful question - What waits for us in this universe?Perfection achieved on every level.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Trip in the life's nooks and moral lesson. Exploration of reality without hypocrisy, of images before the lies and the forms of waiting.A impressive pledge for basic values and beautiful transcription of love's contents, reason of feelings and friendship.Stry of a metamorphosis.Any character is created with subtle art. Every gesture is reflection of great search of life's rules. Same ambiguous self-definition is present in reactions of girl, his friend, ape or machine. The reality is a chimera, fruit of desire, mixture of long expectation and illusions. A drop of "Crime and punishment" and a "Star Wars" atmosphere.A delicate story about values and feelings. About the reality like a bridge, about the dream like existence's ash.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I understand, this film was released for Cinerama. Cinerama was a 180 degree "wrap- around" screen. This film is primarily a visual experience. I feel that the only meaningful dialog in the film was between HAL9000 and the Kir Dulea character. We watched in awe because we had never seen anything like this! I was running the 16mm movie theater at Cape Romanzof, Alaska when all of us GI's saw this amazing film. Many of the troops argued about its' meaning for days after having seen it.ABC television "borrowed" some of the effects used in the film to introduce their evening news broadcasts. What really surprises me is that elements of this film are used in advertising today. I'm in my mid 60's and remember the film well, but how many younger people understand these ads? HAL's birthday is still celebrated.A visual experience if there ever was one. One of those films that one never forgets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is on my top ten least favorite movies of all time and I will gladly explain why. Before people start judging me as a critic and as a movie lover, I just want to point out that I think Stanley Kubrick is a great director. One of my favorite movies is Eyes Wide Shut. He has made many good movies, but this one for me was just a bore to watch. This is one of the movies that as a kid growing up, you hear people say it's one of the classics and that you have to see it to see the sheer brilliance portrayed on screen. I rented this and watched it with my parents who hadn't seen it either and had also heard things about it. We then proceeded to watch the agonizingly long movie that didn't have any dialogue in it until about an hour into it. I have heard many opinions of this movie, and one that I have recently watched had a guy say that this was not in fact a movie, but was just a bunch of random images put together on screen in order to get the audience to think for themselves. He commented that there is no story or screenplay and that there are no characters in this movie. That is a a basic summary of one man's opinion, and although I think he over-exaggerated, I do think he made some valid points. The only time I even came remotely to the point of being entertained was when HAL the computer showed up and started causing havoc. Another critic has proclaimed that the last bit of this film is considered be in the horror genre. This film is many things but it most certainly is not a horror movie. The monolith is the star (for lack of a better word) of this movie and plays the key role of confusing the audience and making us question human life and time itself. The last scene in this movie is very unique but the relevancy to anything in this movie is beyond me. I consider this film to be one huge question mark that Kubrick has given audiences. He hasn't written a finite story, he has simply given us the tools to create our own thoughts and opinions as to what is going on. Nothing in this movie is ever explained so don't expect any dialogue driven information for the simple fact that there is no dialogue at all minus maybe a page at the most. Kubrick is well known for being excellent at photographing movies and it shows here as the imagery is spectacular, yet has nothing to do with plot, characters or anything at all relevant to the film in general. Some consider this movie, Kubrick's masterpiece while others consider this the best movie ever made, while others consider it the worst movie ever made, while others consider it one of the worst movies ever made. In all of film history this is probably one of the top three if not THE most controversial film in motion picture history for the simple fact that there is no definite definition for anything here. If it sounds like I'm beating around the bush, it's because there is really no story to talk about and/or discuss here. If anything was to be described, astronauts are instructed to fly a few light-years to find this thing (the monolith) and find out what it is and what it does. Considering how the movie explains nothing and all the astronauts ever do is just stare at the damn thing, this a waste of time. For those that actually sat through this and wanted an explanation, there is a movie called 2010: The Year We Make Contact which has a plot and characters contributing to everything that happened in this movie. This movie (2001) is on the list of the movies you should see before you die, but honestly I don't see why because all that will happen most likely is that you'll watch it, wonder what the f**k just happened, then depending on your mood, you'll rent the sequel (if that's what you want to call it), and watch it. After that, you feel like you just spent five hours trying to figure out the meaning of life and the relativity of time through two different filmmakers' eyes. I never regret watching a movie, I just sometimes wonder what drives someone to recommend a film like this one in which nothing happens for the duration of 2 hours and 30 min. besides a few astronauts traveling in space to find a a big black block staring at them, while a psychopathic computer slowly kills off an entire crew of astronauts. I don't hate this movie just because I can and I can belong to a certain crowd of critics. I hate this movie because it wastes your time showing you images that are never explained which is essentially like Christopher Nolan giving us Inception minus all the dialogue that explained what was going on. Can you imagine watching Inception without any dialogue minus a page at the least? The mere thought frightens me. Once again, I say to you that Stanley Kubrick was not a bad filmmaker, he just made a film that has no relevancy or point which to some extend explains to some what the meaning of life is. Through this movie you learn that the simple answer is that there is no meaning. We are put in random situations for no reason and it all amounts to nothing. Thanks Kubrick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey-****-A Masterpiece- Directed by: Stanley Kubrick, Written by: Stanley Kubrick, Arthur C. Clarke (Novel and Screenplay), Starring: Keir Dullea, Gary Lockwood, William Sylvester, voice of Douglas Rain.Stanley Kubrick's most provocative masterpiece follows the adventure into the unknown depths of space to investigate strange objects found on the surface of The Moon that are related to the very origins of mankind itself.Kubrick starts this masterpiece at the dawn of man showing us the origins of men at the hands of a monolith. The monoliths are large black objects in the physical interpretation of the film. The monoliths are up to interpretation however, some have interpreted them as alien objects while others have come up with the figurative representation of human evolution.Afterwards, he takes a leap into his pre-conceived future of 2001 that still remains relevant in today's society. Then, the odyssey begins when a monolith is found on The Moon, the odyssey takes off. This leads an astronaut straight into immortality and alien worlds.Dullea's character evolves in the film's final sequence into the star child. This ending along with the rest of the film has been interpreted both physically and figuratively. This movie is a masterpiece simply because of all the physical effects, figurative symbolism, and perhaps metaphysical explanations. It continues to be debated over whether or not it is a work of a a man of God or a man of science. That is part of the deliberate process is the contemplation of the less straightforward materials of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stanley Kuberick's masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey is one of the grandest sci-fi tales of all time. In it's own unique way, the film is dark, light, and when it should be, thrilling, and probably groundbreaking for its time. The special effects are on Spielberg's level, and this was before his time.Another great thing about it is that its hard to describe. Because there is so much imagination here that if you try to describe it you will kind of lose yourself and look stupid, but I'll try to describe it anyways. The film shows man through the ages, starting from the dawn when we were monkeys, and flashing forward to 2001 where there are space colonies.The film's main plot doesn't really kick in for a good hour and a half. There are only a few characters in the film, but the main character is an astronaut named Bowman(Keir Duella). While on a mission, him and another astronaut plan to destroy HAL, the computer system that runs the ship. But HAL overhears them, and isn't going to stop without a fight.This is the best film director Stanley Kuberick has ever done. The special effects are extraordinary, dreamlike, and groundbreaking for the film's time. The film was made in 1968, and Kuberick did the special effects, and won the Oscar for them.I know that there are still a lot of mysteries to be answered from 2001: A Space Odyssey. To be honest, you've never seen anything quite like the last twenty minutes. The music sets the perfect tone for this film. While you're watching it, you'll hear the music, and you will feel unsafe.And even in the times without the music, you will still feel unsafe. 2001: A Space Odyssey is unlike anything you've ever seen and goes beyond your imagination, and that is the main reason why its one of the best science fiction stories ever to be put on film.A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Favorite movie of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001:A Space Odyssey is my personal favorite movie of all time. I will not give any spoilers. I love the acting by Keir Dulia(I think that's how you spell it) he has a great role as Dr.Dave Browning the main character. His performance is so genuine that it is hard to take your eyes off him. Enter HAL the antagonist. He is a computer with A.I.(artificial intelligence) and is voiced amazingly. I haven't heard a better monotone voice in my life. His voice gives me a chill every time I hear it. If you don't know the first and last 20 minutes of this movie is completely silent, some people may not like this but I think it adds to the epic/sci-fi drama.As I said before I am completely spoilerfree but my favorite scene is the beginning. Some might think it's outdated with the special effects, but think of it when it first came outin 1968, these were most likely mind blowing for the time.Anyway, this is a great movie and probably the greatest sci-fi movie ever made so,I'd check it out. And by the way, open the pod bay doors HAL.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The music.....the visuals.......the underlying themes. Stanley Kubrick hits a grand slam with 2001: A Space Odyssey. The very prospect of predicting man's future terrifies most authors/producers into paralysis, but Kubrick gives us fluid motion of sights and sounds, woven into a science fiction tale.I mean how many film-makers have the guts to furnish their creations with long bouts of classical music? Good old Stan does this WHILE showing us futuristic technological innovations that blow our minds open. Such a contrast between something as ancient and immovable as classical music, and another thing as eye-blinkingly modern and progressive as technology -- it's sheer genius. The epicness of the music fits with the grandeur of the colossal planets/ships/stars/etc. displayed. The spectacle of lights was an ethereal experience -- I truly thought I had been crosslisted with Picasso and Beethoven.Then the portrayal of humans. It seems they were mostly stoic and austere, which posits an interesting belief of Kubrick's regarding man's future. He obviously took the oft-ridden road (like George Orwell) of saying that man was to become a less social creature while developing his species, that his emotions would wane as his technological savviness sharpened. Though there is some poignant content, when Dr. Floyd (William Sylvester) talks to his daughter about buying her a birthday present. This itself is contrasted against the coldness of the robotic, calculating world, when the cost of the phone call is displayed on the same screen in plain font reading "$1.70".And Hal...what a fabulous idea he was. The age-old rivalry of man and machine. But here it's perfected. The moment I heard Hal's voice I knew he was in the movie to disturb me. It's a perfectly trustworthy voice on the exterior, but there's something about that frozen red eye that just pierces into your soul. You know you can't trust an entity that supposedly knows all and "never commits errors". It's easy to hate Hal once he has terminated the hibernating astronauts and jettisoned Frank to his death, but then he also shoulders Dave. Dave is fortunate to get back into the ship, and in proceeding to shut down Hal we really feel the pro-human spirit peaking. Hal's pleads for forgiveness make him ever more detestable a villain -- believing that he can be excused from essential murder is textbook amorality.Showing the apes at the beginning of the film breathes evolutionary theory into our minds immediately -- the education of these apes to defeat enemies and exploit weapons undoubtedly yields the eventual human being. The black monolith is a remarkable symbol; appearing in the several random places in which it does...leaves the viewer searching for its meaning. And its meaning is anybody's conclusion to draw for themselves. It seems divine, in my opinion.......an apparent link between earth and sky. And then Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) at the end, landing himself in a random place and time. Finding older versions of himself. The multiverse theory.....time travel.....reincarnation....it all comes to mind here. The eldest version of Dave becomes a fetus which stares down the Earth as the film closes. Kubrick is playing God.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching this film for the first time as a young viewer my original thoughts of the opening scene was the surprise that more people do not find it boring but as this is a very highly rated film it must mean that mostly only film lovers and not haters embark on this masterpiece of story ,music and design which is the way i hope it stays. You may then think it is a bit hypocritical to say this and only give the film 8/10 but the reason for this is not about my lack of believe in evolution but for the length of some of the scenes such as the coloured light scene near the end. As i thought when the story had progressed into its full flow it would be better to end the film instead of trying the demonstrate the uncertainty of evolutionary paths. But don't think bad of me just because i did not like the long end scenes as i understand and enjoy the beautiful opening scenes as many others have said but i don't think these were just for beauty and beauty only these were more to demonstrate the isolation of space and to put that in your mind when the HAL story came into play. The great influence this gave to the world of film and the thought of the future can simply never be replicated again. One of the small influences form it that made a huge impact on the movie Se7en was the subtly psychopathic Voice of HAL which was replicated by Kevin Spacey so well.to conclude, not many people have had such an influence on the world of film, neither can many really explain this film fully other then Stanley Kubrick .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The utterly detailed lack of verisimilitude in 2001: Space Odyssey creates a majestic film that celebrates an abstract majesty of process rather than a concrete declaration of objectives. Kubrick does not respond the anomalous questions that are raised. Rather, this splendid director allows the spectator, in this case a cerebral third party, to appreciate this work of motion picture art for all of its sheer virtuosity. The chief musical score is inspired by the words of Nietzsche and contains five bold opening notes that embody the ascension of man into spheres reserved for the gods.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dated masterpiece, and blame a bad bet for that.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As it happens with some other films of the 60s, 2001 is today motive of so much confusion and misunderstanding. The reason for this is clear: those were times of upheaval. Times of change and revolution, in which old structures and ideas were being put to the test every day and in every possible way, something that doesn't appear evident now. For that reason many people ignore that 2001 included a few features, innovations, proper to that era and only to it. Some had their day in the sun and then disappeared, hardly leaving any trace, while others not only remained but thrived on--as computers and some present means of remote communication. Kubrick used both categories in the making of this film, especially two of the former, and which play an important role in the film.One of the things that didn't work out in the end was Cinerama, a projection system using 3 cameras and a giant concave screen. At the time that was the current fad, a spectacular innovation which everyone thought would be the future in the movie making industry. But what happened to it at the end was similar to what happened to that other unrealistic dream of the times, the Concorde supersonic plane. As it would be the case, Cinerama didn't come to stay. But nobody knew that at the time, neither Kubrick; and assuming this would be an unavoidable fixture of the trade for decades to come, he decided to exploit such innovation to its full potential, trying to make of his creation a visually unforgettable experience; He wanted 2001 to be unique, overwhelming to the senses to the point of being metaphysical. So, he created an art work that could only be enjoyed and appreciated in that system alone. Unfortunately, not only Cinerama died out but also the movies came to our homes, so most reviewers have seen 2001 only on TV and they judge it for what they see. As for me, I was lucky enough to watch it how it was meant to be watched. And I did it from the first rows of seats! I must say, the experience was truly overwhelming: I could actually see myself floating in space. And when you have lived through that eerie feeling you forget the obvious flaws of the film, the wooden acting, the boring dialogue, as all along there will be another sensually rewarding experience, visual or sonic, waiting for you, in a few minutes time, during which you are ready to forgive anything coming your way from the screen. That's what Kubrick intended his viewers to see, hear, experience, and that's not what they are getting nowadays in their plasma screens.The other thing I was referring to was, obviously, space travel. Coming at a moment when the race to the moon had reached a critical stage, at a time when the travel to other planets seemed for the first time in History a realistic possibility, an end finally at hand's reach, Kubrick decided to include in the film a handful of now boring but instructive scenes describing regular routines in cruising spaceships--people walking on walls, like cockroaches in a motel room, etc.-which were meant for us to get used to ideas and experiences that?everybody thought?would be customary for mankind during the next decades. But of course that wasn't meant to be, and no wonder why so many of these scenes seem superfluous now, when ordinary people have a snowball's chance in hell of even orbiting the Earth. Some reviewers here try to get over all that unpleasantness--unfulfilled promises, frustrated dreams, etc--pretending to themselves that what they are watching is really art, pure art; even abstract art; that there must be some profound meaning here, somewhere, some philosophical quest or purpose. Sorry folks, but such scenes were tacked there only to instruct us about what we would likely find when leaving Earth. That's what 2001 was trying to tell us, what was trying to be to us: Space Travel 101. Without the promise of travelling to space, the scenes become pedestrian, even useless. That's why the sumptuous visuals are the stars here, not the actors, the dialogue or the plot. And the computers too. And there it was, Hal. At a time when most of its kind--mainly IBM 360s-occupied an entire room and were barely capable of doing mathematical work, this rebellious wannabe of a machine was able to behave like a human, or better, and so he became an overnight sensation. He did steal the show; we may even say he was the hero, even if a mischievous one. I still recall the press articles prior to the opening and the conversations after, and (it seems incredible now) all the talk was about that smart robot turning the tables on the astronauts. People didn't care much about the rest, except for the cool wheel and the Blue Danube. Ah, and of course the monkeys.When rating 2001, maybe I should give it a 10, but I can't. Kubrick made a big bet, here, and he lost. And when you lose a bet you gotta pay. He bet on Cinerama, on the visuals; on the sensually metaphysical experience, on the mysteries he threw at us without making sure they were true mysteries, while neglecting plot, characters, dialogue. All those things that unfortunately became ever more important as Cinerama faded away, even more so when audiences left the theaters, went back home and turned on the DVD player. Pity, but that makes it a dated masterpiece. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a religious movie in the conventional sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001 is a meditation on Western (high) culture. Such high culture is not something that most people experience on an everyday basis but it has a subtle, pervasive influence on all our lives. The movie wants to bring us on a journey through questions on where we come from, where we are now and where we are going from a Western perspective. The movie is ambiguous because it does not seek to provide answers but asks us to think about how these deep spiritual questions fit into the Western world view.Nothing in the film hints at the existence of other cultural views. This is not a criticism of the film, this is just what the film is about. In the near future presented to us Western culture is all triumphant. Science and engineering are raising Man to new heights. The people portrayed in the movie appear confident about the intellectual/spiritual basis on which their world is constructed. People are calm, measured and rational. The interactions between the Americans (representing a capitalist view of freedom) and the Russians (representing a communist view of freedom) are there to remind us (subtly) about the possible roads that humanity can follow. But both viewpoints belong to the Western framework of thought.God, as a real explanation of our role in the world, died during the Enlightenment. This movie proposes that it is Western science and technology that will lead us to a new state of existence and has the potential to destroy us. It is the closest that I have seen Western ideas portrayed as almost religious.</fullReview>

But my liking for weird things and the fact is Kubrick makes me give it a good rating. It supposedly has all these meanings to it, but the only one I saw was if you beat a computer at chess, Glenn Beck will reprogram it to kill you.

		<fullReview>2001: A Space Oddysey is a film that you would naturally expect so much from; The hype, the popularity and the fact that arguably the biggest director ever, Stanley Kubrick was the man behind the camera.A Space Oddysey is an enjoyable, but slow paced, journey through time. The film begins with our past ancestors, the apes, and their slow yet important development. We see an ape studying a bone from a dead animal in the desert-like landscapes. The ape then precedes to using the bone as a hammer and realizes the power and usefulnes it could have. The cinematography is quite stunning, and I quickly forgot that I was watching a film from 1968. The journey continues from our earliest history, to a time where we have colonized space and made machines smart enough to do jobs for us - without us needing to control them.The whole experience has so much atmosphere and I couldn't have used the word "epic" better in any other context. The film is just the definition of the word. The special effects, the visuals and the deep, stunning orchestral music fills the movie with so much room and life; You just feel so small and helpless - but in a somewhat spellbinding way. The film has so many important messages, even more so now today than over 40 years ago. The film also raises many questions about the human race; How hungry we are for exploring, and how we might even explore more than what we should for our own good.Any person interested in sci-fi, space, time, evolution or even just enjoy atmospheric pieces, should definitely check it out. And even if it isn't your cup of tea, you have in my opinion, seen a landmark of a film for cinema and indeed human intelligence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a movie that focused on pushing the envelope of film-making. But that's not all that it was; it developed into it's own world, with nuances and subtleties. Many complain about the pacing, but in reality, it would take about 15 minutes to dock a spaceship; this movie tried to make art model life instead of ADD characters jumping from idea to idea. This movie made fine transitions and was a perfect meld of sight and sound. The true experimentalism begins when Bowman reaches out into the netherworld and loses himself in time. This movie tells you just enough to keep you in the loop, but not enough to give away symbols and the ideals of Kubrick. Any differences between the book and the film a easily forgivable when compared to this fantastic monument to the experimentalism of the '60's. It's not just about experimentalism though, which tends to be the bane of other experimental movies, it is an intricate story, too. When I first watched this movie I knew I had to watch it again. Eventually, I just purchased it and have enjoyed the special features. Anyone who's serious about directing, writing, or having a successful career in any medium of the arts should buy this movie. Anyone else, buy it too; it'll take you to space (and possibly give you a contact high).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the dozen or so comments I've submitted I have steered away from the superlative "greatest film..." "greatest comedy," as these proclamations of "fact" are merely matters of opinion, and will change from time to time. But so impressed and in awe do I remain with 2001: A Space Odyssey, that the words are difficult to suppress. I struggle against saying, "Yes, this is the greatest film ever made." I struggle. In vain.What Stanley Kubrick has achieved here is, in my opinion, the summit of the creative act-- the perfect synthesis of image, plot,(or story)music, dialogue, etc, etc, in short, of all the things that comprise film and film making. Where to begin? I must say I am truly disappointed with the number of reviews that rate the film high and yet have no idea what the film is about. Kubrick, shouts to us from the very beginning (the opening fanfare) what the film is about: the evolution of man and his predicament in the Universe (Uh.. kind of a Universal theme) retold through allusions to Nietszche's "Thus Spake Zarathustra," the philosophical treatise that the music was written to portray, by that greatest of all composers of "Tone Poems," Richard Strauss. Man, forced to confront the mystery of his own existence, will never solve it, even throughout time, even though he may conquer time and space, technology, and his own shortcomings. No, the "riddle theme" is present at his evolutionary jump to the Super-man, just as it was when he first stood upright.(Beware of those who, on this review forum, have written, "bored," or, "boring." I am forced to make the comparison to those who wrote the same things about Beethoven's 5th after it's premier, or those who chased Igor Stravinksy out of the theater after the premier of the "Rite of Spring" -- "You just don't get it." But it's not your fault. Beethoven, Stravinsky, and Kubrick have created works that are quantum leaps in the aesthetics of their respective art, so it stands to reason that many will say, "It's boring," or, "It's just noise," and the like. Not that I have any great gift of insight. It took a good deal of work and contemplation to achieve the epiphany of truth that these works present.) Of course, everything that happens in the film, surrounds these points. The acting, the dialogue and the choices of the characters. I'll not delineate them here, but leave it to you to discover these on your own. And do yourself a favor: if the film is ever playing anywhere on the big screen, run, fly, hire a plane, bush-wack a stagecoach, or transport yourself astrally, but GET THERE. The experience will be...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WOW Best Sci-Fi Movie Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley's best film and best sci-fi film of all time. I just watch this movie last night and I could not speak or express any type of feeling because this film was so brilliant, also I never understood this film for a second but that is what I think that Stanly wanted. The First 25 minutes not one word is said and you just watch how maybe man came into being because of this big black block. I don't know what that block is it could be god or maybe it's something that will never be understand and maybe it's the key to everything we need to know about life, space and everything we hold dear, but I think thats what started the first intelligence in man. that block could hold all of our future and that black block could be flying in space as we talk and sleep creating life on other planets, it could be aliens spying on us since it's buried and humans uncover it what would happen? Maybe it created everything that exist and thing that we don't exist yet. I could go on forever on the possibility's if that black block does exist but what if it does and then my entire life could change for ever. Hal is portably the best voice over acting I have ever heard and is provably the best villain ever created. The acting is superb for a film were not one word is said for more than half of the movie. This film has with out a dought one of the best special effects and it's about 40 years old. This Film has made me question what I think about in a good way. I always new that the universe goes on forever but this film made understand how we know nothing about space. This Film has bought so many question that I dought I will never understand them all before I die. This film has probably one of the best special effects ever. The music of this movie is great and it fit the movie like no other. I liked that when ever the film goes out of the space shuttle there's no sound or music and it creates a scary and makes you feel alone and that really feat the movie. This is probably the best movie I have ever seen and probably the best I will ever see.I have heard that you will understand this movie better if you see this movie a lot of times, but I'm scared to see this film more times cause I might not like this movie once I understand, But I will see this movie again cause it's probably my new all favorite film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Space travel with adventure for just a movie ticket</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a complex work of director Stanley Kubrick,but it is well acclaimed by critics and audience all over the world.I know that Stanley Kubrick has done just 11 mainstream feature films,each one of them has different story plots derived from literary works.The story is been written by renowned science fiction writer Arthur C.Clarke and i would say it is an exceptional material where we can explore themes of evolution.A.I,E.T,origin and end of universe.The story has mystery and adventure,in an innovative backdrop of space.It had some vision and forecast on technology,space life,space travel to be used on future,where some of them were successful.i am sure this movie taught the movie making fraternity the fun,fantasy,adventure,scope through a science fiction movie. The first 4 minutes had mysterious back ground score with blank screen after which the movie started.The first chapter of the movie "The dawn of man" had 15 minutes sequence in a desert,which was supposed to be Africa 4 million years ago ,where we see various activity of historic apes .It had no conversation,just various visuals communicating evolutionary concepts,especially the usage of tool.We also see a black rectangular wall like thing(which is called as monolith in this story) which appears mysteriously on a overnight .We see fear,curiosity of apes on the mysterious monolith.The ape learns to use tool,the first turning point of mankind.I think the 15 minutes ape sequence is controversial especially for casual viewers of cinema.In fact it made me bored and also restless,irritating as we cannot understand what was happening in screen.By reading the story in internet websites,i came to know that visuals communicated evolutionary concepts,especially the usage of tooletc.But i was not very impressed of the ape sequence,because i feltthings explained in that 15minutes were not that important to story,as well as little boring.But i was really stunned by the subsequent 2 hours. Now we see the ape learning to use first ever tool and is been thrown which cuts to space ship, which indicates the progression of tool in the evolutionary process.and this happens in the year 1999.The stunning visuals show about space life like zero gravity toilet,pen flying away due to lack of gravity,food styles in space life,how people walk in space.The visual showing the space crafts,costumes,visual effects,set decoration were amazing and it made me feel that i am in space travel,especially the classic composition background score made me connect with visual with lot of joy.The importance of background score is understood through this movie.Such a great impact it had. The story now starts as an American scientist is on mission to moon, where through discussions with his friends and conference speech,we understand there is a mysterious monolith been planted on moon by E.T,millions of years ago.The substance it is made of remains mystery and the radiation it generates are extremely powerful.There is sense of mystery built on story about monolith through background score also.After that we see scientists go the place of monolith to research and as they try to take a photo,we hear a mysterious sound and scene cuts of to Jupiter mission chapter,which happen after 18 months.In this chapter,through visuals we see the space craft for Jupiter mission,which has 5 scientists.where three of them are in hibernation(in sleeping state with protection) to conserve energy for space mission.Through TV interview,we come to know that they are accompanied by HAL9000 computer(A.I),which controls the overall mission and it is an extremely efficient A.I,that thinks like human.There is a a question been raised about its emotion also.Suddenly the A.I questions about the picking of some scientists in last minute has some mystery of mission.Further it detects problem with AE35 unit in space ship,as a result one of the scientist decide to replace it.But from the space team of earth,who have the HAL9000 twin detects that information given by HALL9000 in space ship is wrong.HAL9000 gets confused after replacing the AE 35 unit and says the scientists to wait and let it fail to fix the problem,as they can afford to be out of communication from earth for sometime.Both scientist discuss on this crisis secretly getting away from HAL9000 and decide it to disconnect it.But HAL reads the lip movement and finds out that they are going to disconnect it.Now one of the scientist leaves the space ship through EVA pod and replace the original AE35 unit,but HAL kills the scientist who went to replace and also kills three of them who were in hibernation.Now the other scientist leaves space ship through EVA pod to survive the one who is flying in space.After surviving him he returns to space ship,but HAL refuses to open the door.And he uses emergency air lock and disconnects HAL,after which he gets message through TV that real mission is to find the mystery of monolith in moon,which causes radiations in Jupiter.Now,we come to the final chapter,Jupiter mission and infinity,where we see earth,Jupiter and monolith aligns in the space and the scientist travel through time and space through monolith and finally reaches a 4d room,where he ages and dies.Finally he becomes a embryo in the death bed.Now we see the monolith in front of bed generating light,energy and he becomes star child.This film is path breaking in all aspects,but there is one side of audience and critics blaming it to be dull,uninteresting, and slow.Only if you love to travel space with sense of adventure and having the passion explore the mystery of universe,you will be enjoying .Otherwise,it's going to be a nightmare.Stanley Kubrick has given new dimension to film making and it's scope.The movie is evident that he is put a great deal of thought and hard work,for which we must appreciate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unforgettable experience that transcends cinema and our imagination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Note: This is my second review on 2001: A Space Odyssey (original on 10/1/07). Although I gave the film the same 10/10 score and my highest praise, a lot has happened since my first viewing. The beauty of the film is that it (vastly more than any other film I have seen) does not leave you after you finish watching it.After I first watched 2001: A Space Odyssey, I quickly realized what an incredible achievement it was. Unfortunately, I have recommended it to several people that did not enjoy it as much. My father remarked that Kubrick must have been on drugs, my mother did not understand any of it (although after reading the book, she decided she liked it), my brother called it bland, my classmate felt it was immensely tedious (and his roommate hated the movie altogether). I only know a couple people personally that liked it. I suppose this shows the dividing opinions from the public of the film (although critics generally love it). Either way, I would like to explain why this is currently my favorite movie.2001: A Space Odyssey is unlike any other movie around. Instead of focusing on story or drama, it is a massive visual and artistic experience. It is so unconventional that you must watch it under its own terms (for first time viewers: patience). Upon my first viewing, it felt much like the space missions I dreamed about as a kid. The experience was surreal. You actually feel like you are part of the events because it is played out so meticulously. There are no shortcuts; the space ship maneuvers and astronaut procedures may feel long or tedious to some people, but for me it carried an enormous sense of isolation, realism, and the cold void of space. The ideas and themes brought out by the movie are very creative and kept me mentally engaged the entire time. It makes me feel like a child experiencing something new and special for the first time.The Dawn of Man segment starts off the movie with an iconic moment with apes discovering a mysterious monolith. The reactions of the apes show how far man has evolved from a primitive and savage state. The monolith sparks the realization of the existence of tools into the apes, visualized by the use of a bone as a club. This carried human evolution into the year 2001, where their entire existence depends on new, more sophisticated tools. The brilliance of Kubrick is that the space vehicles and structures largely resemble anatomical features, retaining a connection with the past. When a new monolith is discovered on the moon, a whole new stage of evolution begins.An occasional complaint that I hear which makes no sense to me is that the "acting is bad". Where is there a moment of a bad acting? The characters are exactly what you expect astronauts and scientists to be like. This is not a drama, so you should not expect characters giving long monologues or showing extreme emotions. That said, the one character that really stands out is the computer HAL-9000. A complex mix of cold menace and childish innocence, it opens up interesting speculation about the (still) future prospects of artificial intelligence.The music is absolutely outstanding, from the epic (and symbolic) fanfare of the introduction, to the strident vocals of the monolith encounters, and to the gentle waltzes that are played during the space scenes. It adds a lot of substance to the scenes that flow a little slower. The cinematography is practically flawless. The one trait that is universally appreciated is the special effects, so I won't add too much more discussion to that aspect. I should mention that I believe this is the best use of special effects in any movie; although newer films have better technology to use, they rarely use it in the best ways.Upon my first viewing, I decided that the ending, while fascinating, was overly abstract. Afterwards, I thought about it for a while and realized that it was truly a great sequence. The symbolic imagery and significance is phenomenal, unmatched by any other film. I have a hard time imagining any better ending to the film.Some people compare this movie to art, but I think that is only part of it. It is an amazing journey that left me agape. It was eerily realistic and touched upon the most important themes in history. Significance like this is lost in many of today's blockbusters. Watching this movie is the best way to experience space exploration (ignoring actually becoming an astronaut). As a science fiction fan, I am glad to label it as the epitome of science fiction. This is the movie that made me respect Stanley Kubrick. It currently sits comfortably on the top of my favorite movies list. It has changed the way I watched movies. More importantly, it changed the way I viewed life and the universe. It earns my absolute highest recommendation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dave's not here man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie opens with 20 minutes of darkness, so don't adjust your TV. A bunch of monkeys, supposedly early humans, are shown interacting with one another when a mysterious monolith appears. Then the monkeys suddenly can walk upright and realize that they actually want to beat the stuffing out of each other. They also evolve so that they could use tools, shed their fur and start trading stock. Way in the future... I imagine that 2001 must have seemed like a long way off when Clarke was writing the book. His vision unfolded about as realistically as Orwell's 1984, but I'll save that for another rant.Being that this movie was made in the 60's, Clarke's version of the future didn't include gender equality, because there were plenty of tightly dressed females in positions of subservience throughout the picture. Some astronauts find a monolith on the moon. When the sun shines on it, it makes a high pitched sound, much like the one Jim Carrey makes in Dumb and Dumber. Another monolith is found orbiting Jupiter, and someone assumes the two were connected.The press wants to know what happened up in space, but no one will tell them. Apparently, Clarke didn't foresee the media having total control over everything in the future, either. Good thing he wrote some more books, later on.Some more guys were sent up into space, to investigate. Of course, no one actually tells them about the monolith, because that would make too much sense. The HAL 9000 computer, who by the way, is the most likable character in the film, next to the monkeys, is responsible for maintaining the safety of the crew and it's ship. Unfortunately, HAL is a few fries short of a Happy Meal and has an agenda of his own.HAL expresses some trepidation about the mission. Of course, it helps that HAL actually knows what the mission is about, since the crew obviously doesn't. HAL probably realizes that poking the monolith is a bad idea, since we don't actually know what it is, and it's likely to poke back.Dave and Frank, cleverly hide in one of the pods and try to talk about HAL behind his back. Naturally, they forgot that HAL can read lips. Humans really are just monkeys without fur. Once the two men were alone together in the pod, they couldn't think of anything worthwhile to say. The conversation actually went something like this..."What do you think about the mission?" "I don't know. What do you think about it?""So, HAL computers don't make mistakes do they?" "Nope, they're infallible." "Okay, just checking."Seriously, I've heard more convincing verbiage in a Budweiser commercial. Men don't talk like that about anything. They discuss their bowel movements with more enthusiasm. Maybe in this particular future, males are all civilized and introspective. But, they're still monkey's without fur. So, it probably should have gone something like this..."Great, now HAL can't hear us. What's the plan, Frank?" "I don't know, Dave, but this mission is totally bogus. They send us out here into space without telling us why. We should shut HAL down and get the heck out of Dodge. I don't care how good the medical benefits are.""I'm with you so far." "Hey...you don't think he can read our lips in here, do you?" "No, Dave. He's a computer." "Right, what was I thinking?" HAL goes medieval on the crew and kills them all, except Dave, who's his favorite. He must not have liked Frank very much, because he gets his hose cut and goes flying into space, like an untied party balloon.HAL refuses to let Dave back into the ship, after he goes out to rescue Frank. Dave ends up going in the old fashioned way, by jettisoning himself through the safety hatch at tremendous speed.Once back in, Dave shuts HAL down and only after we have to listen to HAL sing and whine about how his mind is going, do we get to find out why these dudes were in space to begin with.Dave pushes some high-tech looking buttons and a message pops up on screen: "Oh...by the way, kids, we found a big, black rectangular thing on the moon and it's sending radio transmissions to Jupiter. There's another black, rectangular thing orbiting Jupiter. We think these things hold the secrets to life, the universe and everything, and we didn't tell you sooner because we didn't want to compromise the security of the mission. Have fun on Jupiter. Let us know how it all turns out." Dave goes to Jupiter, the monoliths line up and Dave has a psychedelic experience involving a bunch of flashing, colorful lights. It's quite impressive, if you consider this was made almost ten years before the formation of ILM. I highly recommend that people stay away from the LSD while watching this film.After his "trip" Dave finds himself in a antiseptically clean house with Regency style furnishings. He sees himself eating dinner as a middle-aged man, dying in his bed as an elderly one, and then as a fetus, overlooking Earth. Then, the credits come on. So glad the ending tied everything together for me, because I was really lost up until then.As an added bonus, there's another twenty minutes of darkness after the credits, allowing the soundtrack to play in it's entirety.It's worth watching just for the early special effects, cinematography and musical score, which includes "Thus Spake Zarathustra" and a bunch of funky vocal pieces by a Romanian guy named Ligeti that you really shouldn't listen to if you are home, alone at night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Combine Stanley Kubrick's ability to make every scene intensely watchable with subject matter that is natively fascinating to begin with and you have one of the most hypnotic films ever made. The film is long but it never ambles or stalls. It marches at its own "just right" pace from beginning to end inviting you to savor each word, each scene, each dizzyingly perfect camera angle. I've heard many versions of what the film is about. But after almost 40 years of sometimes sober, sometimes drunken and occasionally post-coital discussions about it, I still don't know what it's about and frankly I just don't care anymore. I can recite the story line, sure. But what are the major themes? How does one articulate them? I think only the writer, Arthur C. Clark, knows for sure how to frame those notions into a coherent whole. But for the mentally fragmented rest of us, the movie shines like a multi-faceted crystal twirling in the light, inviting us to think, to ponder, to have our own epiphany or two about consciousness, human evolution, and the collective destiny of humankind. Or was that the destiny of a single human in the context of the many? I forget. Not sure it matters. Nonetheless, the film causes you to ponder yet again the nature of the universe and more than anything come to the conclusion that the universe could be even stranger and more beautiful than you thought. Or is that - more beautiful than you remember? I don't know. It turns out that the distinction is not all that important either. The film will forever remain a beautiful, unparalleled and utterly glorious enigma to me. If it hasn't already, I hope it does for you as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not boring.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001 is well loved among the film buff community, and even some people who aren't avid film watchers, but it seems like the general beef with the film is that it is "boring" at some parts. I am not an avid film lover. I have yet to see many, many films that one should see if he/she wishes to call himself a film buff or a film lover. But in any case, I did not think 2001 was boring. I was so awed by the sequences of space crafts floating through space to beautiful orchestra music that I didn't have time to be bored. The only part of the movie where I was slightly bored was at the beginning of the movie with the monkeys, but at the end you realize this was very important to the story.2001 is, as you have heard many times, masterful, and shows film making at its very finest. It is essential for anyone who is even remotely interested in the cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beats all the sci-fi movie of our time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I currently take a film studies task and had to focus on a certain film. I chose 2001. In contrast to the sci-fi genre of our time, 2001 isn't a typical sci fi movie with nonstop violence, and gore and offensive language. In my opinion, it actually laid the foundations of movies like Blade Runner and Star Wars. It actually is a whole different experience to watch this movie. The overall film has a lulling effect to it. Starting from the beginning of the scenes in space where Kubrick uses 'The Blue Danube' as the score for that portion of the movie. Personally, when I watched it, my whole body just relaxed. There is no clear tension in the beginning of the movie. The tension clearly jumps out though when HAL kills Poole. The other unnerving thing I found was the voice of HAL as he responded to questions. His voice is so artificial, yet to cunning and calculating. What really astounded me was that he was watching the astronauts' lips as they plotted to shut him down in the sound proof space pod. He read their lips and clearly and knew what they were plotting to do. The sound is also very cleverly used in the movie. The cut between the silent of space when you can hear absolutely nothing, to the cuts inside the spacecraft that's filled with whirls and blips of the computer is absolutely amazing. 2001 is a work of art. Quite unlike, anything I have ever seen before. Requires a bit of patience to watch...but when you watch the whole thing you feel fantastic. I actually came out feeling humbled after watching this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To give you, my fellow commentators an idea of where I'm coming from let me just tell you that I was born the year this movie played. The first time I watched it I thought the space scenes, the interior ship scenes, and HAL were fantastic! The rest of the movie bored the hell out of me. Now that I'm much older and have read the book I have a much deeper understanding of what Kubrick and Clarke were trying to convey. Kubrick was extremely ahead of his time with the special effects of this movie and it easily stands up to any science fiction movie that's been made since. To me, 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY encompasses the passion and the dreams of the 1960's of reaching to the moon and beyond. It's a shame that we as a people haven't attained many of the things that the movie portrayed as being common place in 2001 like regular flights to the moon, talking homicidal computers, etc. It's too bad Stanley Kubrick didn't live to see the year 2001. I wonder how he'd feel about how far we've come and how far we have yet to go.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I'm not going to bother explaining the plot, because the plot one of the least important things in this film. However, I will say that this is an awe-inspiring conglomeration of amazingly-moving imagery and beautiful effects that don't even now seem outdated. In fact, I'd say the visual effects are better than those of the Star Wars Episode IV--or at least more mesmerizing.However, you must watch this with a fully (and I mean FULLY) open mind, because this is truly one of the strangest films ever. Some of the parts were so random and out there that I couldn't help but fall in love with it all. Yet in all its strange and seemingly unrelated moments there runs a common thread--mysterious and eye-opening beauty.This movie may not be for everyone. My Dad strongly dislikes it and said that it "left him unsatisfied." If you want your movies to have a point, you may end up thinking the same thing. However, I truly enjoyed this Kubrick film. It is the first of his many classics that I have watched, and I can't wait to watch more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw 2001 back in 1968 at a theater in Philadelphia, shown as intended: in Cinerama. To see this movie any other way is like watching House of Wax without the 3D glasses. Still, in 70mm widescreen theaters it is still a visual feast. I can sum up this movie in one sentence: The greatest sci fi film ever made. No need to go into detail, by now just about everyone has seen this movie in one form or another. But it holds one giant disappointment for me. I so looked forward to the year 2001 after seeing this film. I had high hopes for the future and thought for sure we'd have a base on the moon. Instead 2001 turned out to be one of the darkest days in American history. And for that I was sadly disturbed. Hard to believe also that it's nearly 40 years since its release. I keep track of how many times I see a movie. If it's really good I count to 100 and stop counting after that. I have now exceeded 300 times, maybe more, and never grow tired of watching this epic. While Citizen Kane has to be the number one mundane movie of all time, 2001 is the number one sci fi film. Forry Ackerman hated it which doesn't make a bit of sense since he is the foremost fan of science fiction. The late great magazine Castle of Frankenstein couldn't lavish enough praise on it. It won an Oscar for visual effects, innovative at the time using computers in a way that was never done before. The beginning is enough to grab your attention, when the ape-man tosses the bone into the air and in a flash we're transported 4 million years into the future, into outer space. That scene will never been duplicated. Then the discovery of a monolith buried on the moon. The team sent to investigate says "It was purposely buried." The deafening transmission that came from the monolith aimed at the planet Jupiter and the amazing trip thru time and space as the lone astronaut enters the black rectangular box. In 2010 his last transmission was played back: "My God! It's full of stars!" Indeed. The ending still gives me chills and yes, it was open to the viewer's own interpretation. For me, seeing the birth of stars, the wonders of the universe, creation in space then Bowman seeing himself grow old and eventually die. His last act, to point at the black monolith as if to say "I understand". He died and is transformed into the Star Child. From there you can decide whatever you wish. It's all symbolic after all, a way of telling us the Earth needs a rebirth, a reawakening, a fresh start. The sequel 2010 explained this briefly at the end, when the Earth now had two suns and another monolith appears on one of Jupiter's moons. It's a continuous cycle taking us from ape to man and beyond, to the beginning of a new life cycle and hopefully a better understanding of our universe and ourselves. What more could you want from a movie??!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Also sprach Kubrick und Clarke</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Long before Douglas Adams, in *2001: A Space Odyssey*, Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke tackle Life, the Universe and Everything.The result? Monolithic! A movie where everything exciting happens in the human mind. No aliens blasting at each other as if they were cowboys from 1870 Earth, or rocket sleds blaring loudly in space and explosions of spacecraft as if they were in an atmosphere; no plots to "rule the galaxy" as if it was a serfdom easily circumnavigated in a day or two - in the grandest irony, *2001* uses none of the conventions it was responsible for spawning in its wildly-inferior successors to the space-movie throne ? the *Star Trek* and *Star Wars* franchises. And all other "space" dross that would issue from the mind of man.With the simple placement of an inexplicable, anachronous object ? The Monolith - Clarke and Kubrick forge the best "true science fiction" adventure of all time. For this is how a truly "alien" intelligence might come amongst us ? not in papier-mâché flying saucers or as disguised humans ? but in the form of a seemingly benign message of superiority as non-intrusive as a hammer.The adventure begins with primeval ancestors of mankind ? ape-like beings struggling for existence in a prehistoric African veldt ? who come upon The Monolith, which acts as a stimulant for their latent intelligence. Soon these man-apes have conquered their surroundings through power, realized in the simple wielding of a femur bone.The action leaps ahead in what Clarke calls "the longest flash-forward in the history of movies" ? three million years, to 2001, when a manned moon base uncovers a Monolith not unlike that which woke our ancestors from their bestial slumber in prehistoric Africa. It is, like its prehistoric brother, black, featureless, light-absorbent and an utter mystery. After emitting a startling radio signal aimed at Jupiter, it falls silent.Cut forward once again, to the spaceship *Discovery*, on a mission to Jupiter to find out exactly why the Monolith spoke its single syllable there.After first viewing *2001*, you will dismiss Kubrick as indulging his inner hippie-chick with random futuristic images burdened with faux-portent due to the elitist soundtrack. After the second viewing, you will be contemplating which room of your house to sacrifice to your Kubrick Shrine.With a soundtrack so lush and awe-inspiring it kept hippies and music enthusiasts alike rooted to their seats in expectation, *2001* forged a new vernacular for the "sound of space." By applying well-known source music to his film, Kubrick breathed new life into Johann Strauss' *The Blue Danube*, György Ligeti's *Lux Aeterna* and *Atmosph?res*, and of course, Richard Strauss' *Also sprach Zarathustra* ("Thus Spoke Zarathustra"), the movie's euphoric main theme, with its elegant horns, glittering organ and pounding timpani standing on hind legs and beating its chest like an alpha silverback.As Arthur C. Clarke has grown nauseated in telling, *2001* was not only culled from his short story *The Sentinel*, but from six other tales as well: *Breaking Strain, Out of the Cradle, Endlessly Orbiting?, Who's There, Into The Comet* and *Before Eden.* With such a powerfully understated and enigmatic performance in both this movie and its inferior sequel, *2010: Odyssey Two* (1984), it is unlikely that Kier Dullea will ever be remembered for anything else - and unlikely that he will ever be forgotten. Dullea is Dave Bowman, who, along with fellow astronaut Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) faces the adversity not only of the Monolith's mysteries, but of their malfunctioning on-board computer, HAL 9000.Ultimately, it is for him that Destiny crouches and pounces on, as The Monolith works its wild wonders on his frail humanity? Speaking in tongues, Kubrick and Clarke swirl Bowman through anomalies in the space-time continuum and craft a resolution to Life itself. With Bowman's transmogrification to that of Star-Child, his essence sloughing off physical flesh, his rebirthed cosmic embryo looks back on a distant Earth.Released in 1968, utilizing the hardest real science of its time, Clarke and Kubrick not only achieved Kubrick's dream of making the proverbial "really good science fiction film," but gave their audience over to the most cerebral speculations known outside the marijuana-drenched hippie community. How to wrap our minds around nothing less than the power that engines the universe? Dave Bowman's transcendence is not a death ? it is a subsuming. (As Carl Sagan epically notes, "We are all star stuff.") With no mysticism or religion intimated, it is a grand vision of all things being one. Of all man's adventures of discovery, when our minds are thus freed, it will be our grandest odyssey of all.Thus spoke Kubrick and Clarke.(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the movie that initiated my interest for the SciFi genre and it is still one of my absolute favourites. I like everything about it: the directing, the music (and also the use of silence), the effects (can't believe it was made in -68), the story and perhaps most the mix of realism and mysticism that at the same time makes the story believable and philosophical, so to speak. And I like the fact that the movie is so open-ended. This movie is a gem among the action packed SciFi movies of today and is a must to see. Beware, however, that there are only two ways to relate to this movie: You either love it or hate it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So simple and so effective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie a couple of years ago at a special screening in Norway after a friend of mine recommended it to me. I remembered it because I have never experienced a cinema with a louder volume than this had. At that point I didn't quite get what it was all about, but I also had this feeling I shouldn't really bother to "get" it, which is why this movie became most importantly an eye-opener for me.Way too many times people try to "get" things when there is nothing to get, as if you try to subtract 3 from 2. Where will that extra 1 appear from? What you see is what this movie gives you. The stage is simple: Man evolves and goes to space. The straightforwardness of this is so beautifully portrayed in this movie I will never forget it.This movie is not one you watch when you are all hyped up, mind. I find it best to watch late in the evening when it is dark outside.Probably the finest sci-fi yet.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't look for explanations -- embrace the unknown</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this world of 24-hour TV news stuffing our brains with millions of ready-made explanations and opinions about everything under the sun, we've come to *crave* explanation. We needs things sorted out and tied off. We need closure.2001 is a very unconventional piece of storytelling, as much a work of abstract art as it is a narrative. The movie is about humans exploring the unknown -- and finding things that they cannot understand. And flying in the face of our desire for explanation, the movie explains very little. Instead, we experience events as the characters experience them: awed, and utterly uncomprehending.I'd always loved this movie, but hadn't appreciated just how specular it is until I had a chance to see it on the big screen at the Heights Theater (a a lovely Twin Cities art house place with a working theater organ!). Then I realized: you aren't *supposed* to understand what's going on -- not at the start, not at the end. You are supposed to be mystified and utterly overwhelmed. I don't mean overwhelmed by huge explosions or lots of lots of rumbling THX bass gimmicks; I mean overwhelmed by a sense that the universe is vast, and we humans are tiny and ignorant.I think people often don't like this masterful movie because they expect explanations, and are disappointed. If you're seeing it for the first time, expect to understand nothing. It's about the experience, not explanations. See it on a big screen if possible, and embrace the confusion!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A landmark in science fiction that still holds up today.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As fantastic as 2001: A Space Odyssey is, it is truly not a movie for everyone. You either love it to death, or you pan it as the worst film you have ever seen. There really isn't any between ground, because it isn't necessarily the most audience friendly film on the planet (sorry). It has a long runtime, it's story is complex and somewhat muddled, it moves fairly slow, and there are periods in which nothing is said for 10 minutes at a time. However, if you're like me, you will truly appreciate the epic beauty and groundbreaking achievement that this film is. It is perhaps the most influential science fiction flick ever. Maybe even more so than Star Wars.To people who can truly appreciate the poetic vision that Stanley Kubrick had, 2001 is an unforgettable film. You have the majestic theme song (one I had heard before I knew of the movie), a truly classic villain (HAL 9000 in all of his creepy glory), and special effects that still hold up today as out of this world and glorious visuals.Though this film is fairly slow, I couldn't keep my eyes off of the screen for the whole runtime. The special effects have a look and feel to them that looks 100% believable, maybe even more so than most viz fx today. The imagery mixed with the lovely orchestral music create images that will stick with you forever. And, being that it was released before man even landed on the moon, it is a truly visionary look at the then-future. It's amazing to see how close our world today is to that in the movie.The segment of the film with the astronauts with HAL 9000 is classic. The quiet atmosphere throughout the whole story sets the mood of a "so-tranquil-you'll-kill-yourself" feel. And once HAL 9000 gets some glitches, you really REALLY see the sh*t hit the fan. Everything about HAL 9000, the smooth and calm voice, the red light that always watches, and a computer with a desire to stay alive. Groundbreaking stuff.Though the story is muddled and the ending almost incomprehensible, the theme of the movie can really be applied to today. How humans have remained dependent on technology, from the humanoids in Africa to the astronauts on Jupiter, and how eventually us humans will not be the most intelligent life form in the universe.For anyone turned off by the ending, I would highly recommend reading the novel of the same name. It was released simultaneously with the movie and really sheds some light on the Monolith and the mission to Jupiter. It's as good as the movie, which is really saying a lot.That being said, 2001 is either a movie that you will love or hate. I've heard claims that the film is boring pretentious art-house garbage, but I found it to be a fascinating, ground-breaking, sci-fi classic that will surely go into history as a monument not only in film, but in the way we look at the universe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick was A brilliant Director!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I state anything, let me first say I have the utmost respect for Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C.Clarke, who penned this screenplay. Kubrick is also among my favorite directors, but I have started to watch this masterpiece several times and only managed to see it through on a couple of occasions! There is something about this effort that kills off the insomniac in me. When I first saw this movie in 1969, just before the first moon landing, people were actually holding conversations in the cinema as the film was playing, and I was more interested in what they were saying than I was in the plot! An irate, highbrow friend informed me I was not ready for this futuristic essay, along with just about everyone in the movie theater! At that time this movie had received monster reviews from just about every film critic on Earth, but apart from my learn-ed friend, no one else seemed to think much of this film! In around 2002 my son, who is an avid Kubrick fan, good for him, bought this DVD and states it is the best that Kubrick ever made! I tried to watch it with him and fell asleep before the halfway stage. He kept prodding me awake to explain what he thought was going on. I knew what was going on, but it's just fiction and by definition should be entertaining, not nodding material! I know that most of the audiences are just people who make up the silent majority so I don't expect any kudos from these truths. Perhaps someday there will be a film called 2101 A Space Odessey, made in 2068, and in 2105 there will be a tired old man explaining to his son that it's just fiction, after all that's what it really is!Tell me, when is all this nonsense supposed to be happening? It's just fiction folks!...0 for 2.. Not too bad so far! Do I hear 0 for 3?....Come on all you movie snobs, make it 0 for 3! It appears this film has more fans than it originally had, and the acting has not improved one iota. Even if Rigsby stole one of the scenes!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey.Stanley Kubrick has left his mark in cinema with a wide selection of masterpieces, both big and small. Whilst not on his most controversial list, 2001: A Space Odyssey, must be his most thought provoking story of man and his tools. With the exception of a few scenes, this film in my books is more an artistic composure of space; as an example, to spend three, four, even five minutes watching a ship docking on a space station would seem all too slow, boring and even dull, but Kubrick, and his genius film making techniques made it a thing of art.Up until this films release, all films both action and not would have spent 95% of screen time pushing the story forward with dialogue and simple camera movement. Now although Kubrick sticks with this outline, the special effects can be marveled at as if a piece of gold. To this day, i still can not be sure what is real and what is not and I've never wanted to ask or find out. Some secrets are best left unblemished, and to the imagination.Although art, this is still a film. We get a story, but instead of being told we are to figure the concept out by our own will; which in the case of watching this film is easier said then done. Although complex, and without any true conclusion, i still have the basic theory and believe I've thumbed down on what Kubrick was trying to tell.Hal was the scary plot for me. A man losing control of his tools was a scary concept that left me in a dilemma of what I've just seen and what it meant. The truth: man losses control of tools -- a man is lost without his tools. (SPOILER!) The final supper scene was the strangest, and took the longest to find out. It took some research, but i now understand what Kubrick was trying to say, which was. Body and soil, glass and wine. The glass smashes but the wine is still their.All in all this film was and in my opinion still is utterly groundbreaking and has one of the best story lines ever; humans and the unknown. I can't help but give it a high score.97/100</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001-A space Odessey, one of the very few spectacular films ever made, certainly a film most would never have thought was made in the 1960's, it's visual,far forward special effects, make this film excellent throughout. I must admit, when I was a lot younger I did think the beginning of the film was too slow burning and accused it of being boring, but I have eaten those words and know better, especially with the poor trash that is being spewed out of Hollywood nowadays. I wonder whether the film courses guide/educate would be filmmakers to become filmmakers. Stanley Kubrick certainly had a good day when he came up with his gem 2001(a Space Odyssey), which was certainly helped by the writing talents of Arthur.C.Clarke who went onto present the Unexplained/Mysterious World programmes in 1970's and early 80's. The leading characters Keir Dulea and Gary Lockwood and the ship's computer"HAL" 9000 series really gelled the film together,with it's claustrophobic climax. It was also a surprise to see a cameo role with "Rigsby"(Leonard Rossiter)though he was better at comedy than serious acting in my view. Although we now know the future hasn't moved that far forward in time as suggested in 2001, it's nice to think that the future may have looked something like 2001. Splendid,spectacular and well ahead of it's time.........EXCELLENT! YOOF! Corporation</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will not attempt to discuss the meaning of this film, or to answer most of the questions it poses. There are plenty of places on the internet that try to do that.2001 is one of the few films I find absolutely amazing, and that I dread to watch. Like Citizen Kane I find this movie to be technically brilliant, but mostly boring. It was the first or second DVD that I purchased when I bough my player back in 1999. Yet in the interim 5 odd years I have watched 2001 in its entirety only once or twice. Several times I have started to sit and watch it, but I just can't get through it all at once. Even for this review I watched it in sections.It doesn't help that the section I enjoy the most (the section involving the mission to Jupiter and HAL) is a good hour into the movie. It's not that the other sections do not have meaning to me, it's just that I find them very difficult to get through. The opening sequence "The Dawn of Man" is very well filmed, is vital to understanding the whole movie, and begins to ask some very good questions (does the advent of technology bring us closer to destruction as it also further our race? Yet, I find this section mind numbingly dull. Upon first viewing it was interesting, but now I know that the monolith is coming, I know that the ape-men discover the use of the bones as tools and this leads to their use as weapons. My knowledge of the action now bores me. I am the type of person who enjoys watching a movie repeatedly. I have a pretty large collection of DVDs and watch many of them often. So knowing the outcome of a scene does not always necessitate my boredom. It is just so with this particular film.Likewise the next section of film leading to the discovery of the monolith on the moon I find to be quite boring. It is only when we get to the middle chapter of the movie dealing with the journey to Jupiter and the madness of HAL that I remain interested as a film watcher. This section also happens to be the one I find most technically interesting. I must also admit this is the section with the most dialogue and most action. But I am not ready that this is the cause of my enjoyment. Because by most standards there is still not a lot of action or dialogue going on in the film. What I do enjoy is the use of sets to create the space station atmosphere. For example, I love trying to determine how they created the scenes where the astronauts appear to walk upside down or 'turn' with the ship? The atmosphere created by use of the silence of space, the loneliness of the ship and the remoteness of the all seeing HAL eye is pitch perfect. Kubrick builds the tension between the two conscience astronauts and HAL brilliantly. The scene in which HAL reads the astronauts lips is still one of my favorites in any film, ever. HAL, though a computer, has been rated as one of the greatest scree villains of all time, and rightly so. He is as calculating as he is cold.Once this section ends, though we slip back into the brilliant but boring mode of the film. When Dave slips into the wormhole (did anyone call it a wormhole back then?) we are treated to a psychedelic ride of crazy colors and trippy music. But it goes on so long that I wish I did acid or smoked pot to keep me interested. It's like the whale chapters of Moby Dick, where I have to agree that they are important for the sake of the novel, but I'd rather just skip past them and get on with the story. I believe the parts I find boring in the movie are essential to the film, and in many ways they make it the masterpiece of cinema that it is. This being so doesn't make me watch it more than once every few years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001 is probably the most philosophical movie I've ever seen in my life. It's meanings and themes shift through every time you see it and you always find something new from it. It is a long movie, but it never turns tiresome. Ages ago, before man was aware of his surroundings a bunch of man apes were living their life. On one day, a huge monolith appeared and suddenly apes begun to evolve. They figured out how to use weapons. From this we shift into the future, where similar artifact is found from the moon. Soon scientist are sent to research it... and the it happens, the monolith sends a message, which is tracked towards Jupiter. So, a group of explorers are sent forward to see, what is out there.Now, this is not a very typical sci-fi movie. There are no big bangs, no blood thirsty aliens but just two men and a computer. Main characters of the movie are Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea), Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) and HAL 9000 (voiced by Douglas Rain), which is one of the most memorable movie villains ever. Yes, the bad guy of the movie is man made super computer. But it's not HAL's fault really. HAL is just doing what it is programmed to. Acting is very good throughout whole movie, but most memorable part is HAL 9000, which is one of my favorite performances in movie history.Special effects of the movie are truly spectacular, when viewed on when they were made (1968) and even in todays standards, which is very rare thing on older special effects. They did not win special effects Oscar (only one on Kubricks career) for nothing.20001: Space Odyssey doesn't let you go easily. You really need to think what you see. Kubrick didn't want to serve you readily chewed dish of pseudo philosophy ala Matrix, but a genuine possibility for the viewer to really reflect himself and humanity.</fullReview>

I found myself bored and confused. I turned the film off at the end and went to bed. I was angry. The next day I talked to others and ultimately watched it over. During this viewing I saw what Kubrick was trying to bring to the viewer's mind. I understood the subject and the ending a lot more. If I had not asked questions and watched the piece again I could still be disgruntled with it. 2001's plot is great. It brings controversy to the audience, like most of Kubrick's films. The direction from Kubrick is, as always, fantastic. This may be the most visually stunning film I have ever seen. There are some shots that I will never forget. Kubrick has become one of the greatest directors of all time, in my eyes. The acting was all good. No performance really caught my eyes. They all seemed okay. The characters are good. None are really unforgettable. HAL will probably be the most memorable for me. The score was fantastic. It was great for the film, and could not have been done any other way. 2001 will awe many audiences for years to come. 2001 wasn't as boring as I had been told, either.</fullReview>

It began, for good, the so called "science-fiction" movies. Better than that, it gave birth to the "meditation" movies, meaning this movie is not only a movie about the man on space, but also a movie about the human condition. Really a cult movie. Another thing that kubrick got it right was the fact that in space there's no sound, so instead of the noise of the spaceships, we have classical music (which i personally love). Even the scenarios, the furniture, everything, and of course...the ending scene...really transcendental. Like i said....best movie ever was, and ever will be</fullReview>

I think without 2001 there would not have been a Close Encounters or Star Wars.' - Steven Spielberg I just had to comment on one of my favorite movies. For all of those under 30 that say it is 'slow', no action, it is true. . . it is not the Matrix. It deals with the Alpha and Omega, the creation of man, and (in my interpretation) the returning of the Messiah (or if you are Jewish, the first time he is coming) to earth! Yes folks, this is what the 'Star Child' is. This new, evolved omnipotent being is human . . . but is here to save the world (from ourselves). Remember, the movie was written during the cold war, and it projected that (as unfortunately Bush is now pushing for), there will be a weaponizing of space, with atomic bombs and doomsday scenarios. (read the book 2001 ? at the end - ' The Star Child ? silently detonates the atomic weapons that threaten all of mankind' !!!)Why it missed the mark on AI (computer) Artificial Intelligence? The hype, at the time the film was made, by AI enthusiasts might have been one of the reasons Kubrick and Clark over estimated what those approaches might deliver. The lesson to learn is that we all need to take a critical look at allowing marketing people in the computer industry over hype items they do not understand. What Happened to HAL?A human computer programming error and poor Project Management judgment caused the Jupiter mission to fail. As HAL explains it, a coding bug caused his breakdown. Human error! He was instructed (ie: programmed) never to lie to people, and at the same time, was instructed to keep the truth about the purpose of the "real" mission (ie: investigating the blinking light) a secret. This human induced conflict and dilemma is the reason HAL had a neuroses, leading to a psychosis and eventually, with a realization of its own mortality, delusional megalomania, and a complete 'nervous breakdown'. The Toilet is an 'inside' joke. The very detailed instructions on the 2001 space toilet was very clever. We must all remember the KISS principle. (Keep it super simple)If there is ONE criticism I can make of the movie, since most people I talk to have NOT read the book, it is that Clarke and Kubrick (who co-authored the book and screenplay in conjunction with making the movie) could have spent 10 more minutes to give better hints as to:what the two monoliths were (artifacts left by a visiting cosmic intelligence), what do they do (give man ? as one reviewer here calls it, a 'kick in the pants' toward its next stage of evolution), the psychedelic color show (a space warp ? through which ? the humans that were eventually drawn to the blinking light will be sucked into and be taken to a far flung place in the universe ? which is the original 'home' of the supreme cosmic intelligence that planted the two monoliths ( so long ago) in our part of the Milky Way Galaxy. (NOTE: This technique was used not just with us here on Earth, but as the book points out, this cosmic intelligence used the same mechanism (monolith ? blinking light ? cosmic warp) hundreds of times at hundreds of places in other parts of the Cosmos (and had the same effect ? namely ? drawing hundreds of various diverse spaceships to his 'home' location, if they should ever evolve to a technological level that would let them build space ships in the first place). The first monolith, in my interpretation, is Alpha ? the 'creation' of what is 'man'. The 'moon watcher' ape turned ? via a spark of intelligence to use tools ? into a 'higher' being - thereby allowing his clan to eventually 'dominate' the world and take the next logical step ? to go to the moon.One Last Comment: PLEASE . . . Read the Book, Read the Book, Read the Book, Read the Book, Read the Book, Read the Book, Read the Book ? and remember ? it was written during the cold war, with the very existence of humans on earth decided by a push of the button at Moscow or Washington!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some people might say that that movie sucked, or it was stupid and had no meaning whatsoever. I know, those people might like action which has hardly any theme at all so you don't have to think, and I agree that there are indeed movies that seem to be deep but are just stupid, or at least to me, but I disagree very much that 2001: A space odyssey is one of those movies, because it does have a meaning, and it is clearly shown at the end.Space Odyssey portrays what makes us human and the fact that we are not perfect. When the man and the ship are taken to "the infinite and beyond" that isn't what happens in reality in the movie, instead it shows the man in a room, looking at his future self, eating, who then looks at his future self in a bed, dying, and finally becomes an embryo that he was decades ago before being born. This is to show how insignificant life is and that it literally has no meaning except for the people living it which don't even know why they're living it, except for that huge slab of rock. Nobody knows what it is, it's just there, and it just makes everybody wonder and they are curious, because the object is very mysterious and there isn't really any solid explanation as to what it is or what it does save for that it was made some million years ago, and deliberately buried on the Moon.The questions are, why is it there?, what does it do?, what is it for?, who made it? where are they now? was it deliberately put there? Or was it just a fluke?All these questions make the viewer as well as the characters wonder, just like the apes in the beginning. They were apes, uncivilized, brutal (who beat each other up) apes, yet when they saw that stone they marveled.If you also happen to remember, the man eating dropped the glass on the floor which shattered. Did the man want it to fall and break? He liked the drink from his expression when he took a sip, so he would have rather it not fall, but yet it did. This shows the man isn't perfect. Had it been Hal, the glass surely wouldn't have fallen, because he is perfect. What happened to Hal? He got shut down. Do you remember the way Hal was begging for his life? What life, he is a machine, you say, but even if he were human, would Hal really have anything to live for? What for, he already knows everything, what does he need to live for? He doesn't, so why did he beg for his life like that, when he knew that it was coming to an end?Ladies and gentlemen, if you think that this movie was about aliens, then you shouldn't be reading this, because this movie was about why we are human and what makes us human. The fact that we marvel, and don't know everything. The fact that we have something to live for, because we don't know what's going to happen the next day. Have you ever seen the movie Groundhog Day? The guy is stuck in the same day every day, after day after, day. At first he likes it, he's excited, but in the end he tries to kill himself so many times, and is nearing insanity. Human nature asks question, and we are curious, and final we have the ability to make mistakes. We aren't Hal, ladies and gentlemen, we aren't supercomputers from the 9000's series, we are HUMAN.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best SciReal movie Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1968, Stanley Kubrick made this historic film masterpiece base on a book written by Arthur C. Clark. It was such an early effort to make a science fiction movie combined with scientific facts. His style of movie making is still fresh and intact.I have seen this movie more that half a dozen times and I even have a VHS copy of the movie in my library. CS3 class made me to see the movie again with another perspective: Who is HAL and what is he thinking?I enjoyed watching the movie again and tried to focus of HAL's dialogues throughout the second episode of the movie. In the second scene, Dr. Dave Bowman and Dr. Frank Poole are eating their food in front of two TV monitor on their sides and HAL's round reddish glass dome is in the middle of them. In the TV report, HAL was introduced as the new generation of super computer put in work in January 12, 1992 called HAL 9000 Series. During the interview HAL reacts as a humble working machine trying to accomplish the mission of the spaceship fully. In another scene, Dave is sketching Dr. Hunter, Dr. Kambel and Dr. Kaminsky who they are all in Hibernation sleep. HAL is curious to see those sketches and brings up his doubtful question about the purpose of the Jupiter mission. His calm and monotone voice makes the audience listen to him more carefully. In the next few scenes we will see how HAL tries to kill astronauts one by one and takes the power. His conscious makes him capable to try to save his life from termination. When Dave wants to return to the spaceship and HAL does not listen to him, there is the most memorable line of the move: ' I'm sorry Dave, I am afraid I can't do that. ' In the middle of the most important interact between human and machine, HAL's voice can conjure both solid calm and malevolence in the same monotone. Dave has gone back to the ship, lost all his fellow astronauts, and determined to disconnect the HAL's main brain cells. HAL uses his final apologetic techniques to convince Dave of not disconnecting him. HAL begs him to stop and let him correct himself. These are his famous lines while Dave is disconnecting his modules one by one:'Dave, what do you think you are doing?Dave? I am entitled to the answer of the question!I know everything is not quiet right with me recently?But I feel much better know?I can see are really upset about this very poor decision of mine recently?Dave, stop! Will you?Dave, stop!I am afraid Dave!'HAL's voice is slowing down during this process and becomes thicker and less audible:'my mind is going? I can feel it''Can I sing a song for you?'Dave is putting final modules out and let HAL to sing his song called 'Daisy':'Daisy give me?your answer to me?I am crazy?Although I am not confused?'HAL dies as the Jupiter Mission continues?Artificial God bless you HAL, store in peace!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The use of music in this film is like no other film which i have seen. It gives the movie a beautiful atmosphere and almost gives you the feeling of floating in space yourself. The effects are also good in this movie considering the time it was made. Besides all of the effects and music it is a very well directed and well acted film. Kubrick takes this already interesting novel and turns it into a mind blowing, suspenseful, and sometimes terrifying piece of art which all comes together in the end.So I would recommend this movie to all the free thinkers out there who appreciate good directing.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Trip to Rule Them All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey" does the impossible. No filmmaker since, or before Kubrick, has ever done a film of this scale, following such a complex story that begins with the dawn of man and ends with the birth of the space baby. "2001", easily one of the greatest films of the 60's, is difficult to follow and it can prove confusing to those expecting something entirely different (mind you, this is no "Star Wars"). However, if people can get the message and can understand what Kubrick was trying to do with the film, you'll see how far ahead of its time it was.Kubrick himself recorded over 200+ walk-outs on a screening of the film. Though not one to take things like this seriously, this was a blow to Kubrick's public reception. Furtunately for Kubrick, he won an Oscar and the film became one of the most critically acclaimed films of all time.Talking about the film is difficult, but what it's mostly about is evolution and birth. The film begins with the Dawn of the Man, as apes live together in a normal society, prey to tigers and other predators. One day, the ape clan encounter a black monolith and changes begin to follow. Apes discover tools (brilliantly showed in a very memorable scene by Kubrick) and with it they learn to hunt. Now they've become sophisticated and smart, and ultimately learn to kill each other.Then the scene changes to a large space background. We are introduced to Heywood Floyd, whose home city have discovered evidence of early life. They keep it a secret, and we slowly learn that this discovery is similar to what the apes encountered. No one knows what it is, other then it's million years old and was proven to have been "deliberately" buried. When Heywood and his crew see the monolith for themselves, a radio siren goes off.18 months later, the scene remains the same; only now we are introduced to different characters. The astronauts, led by Dave Bowman, are on a Jupiter mission, the first for humans. Two of the astronauts, including Dave, are still on board, while the three others are kept in hibernation. Also aboard the ship is the perfect human, the H.A.L. 9000 supercomputer. HAL, as he's called, controls all operations on the ship, and is entitled to the survival of the three hibernated members. Much appears normal, until HAL, somewhat "intentionally", fouls up. Dave and his friend discuss what to do with HAL, they plan to disconnect him so that he doesn't mess up again. HAL reads their lips and turns murderous, killing off the crew, but is ultimately disconnected by Dave (HAL's begging is another memorable moment). After disconnection, Dave receives a video transmission that was only known on board by the HAL computer, this being of the existence of the black monolith.After this follows a near-30 minute trip to the Infinite, Dave's trip through the space-gate with images that will keep you glued to your seat. As it ends, Dave's life is shown in the birth of the space baby, and the monolith that triggered the change. (It's an Odyssey, all right)Much of what makes "2001" so captivating and powerful is particularly due to Kubrick's careful use of classical compositions with which to tell his story. Originally, he planned to have a seperate score, but changed his mind (and for the better). The most memorable of Stanley's choices is by far Richard Strauss's "Thus Spoke Zarathustra", and Johann's "The Blue Danube". Both perfectly accompany their scenes and make all the more memorable. The rest of the soundtrack is made of strictly eerie sounds, which also fit very well in with the overall mood of the film, particularly the trip to the Infinite.The acting is all average, done by unknown European actors like Keir Dullea as Dave. The most memorable piece of acting in the film, though, was through the voice of the HAL 9000. Trust me, his voice is so powerful and mysterious that you'll end up having similar opinions as the members on board. But acting isn't even essential to a film like "2001", in which images are the main story (and one in which true appreciation comes from how much one can "read" visual films). "2001" could've gotten away as a silent film if it wanted to. Conversations aren't important and the first ten minutes are all animal sounds. Finally, "2001", though not quite my favorite Kubrick film, is a solid piece of cinema. It's a film that we'll question you throughout its entire time span, and it's easily a film that one will have to continue reading on to really just touch the surface of what it's about. It's Kubrick's most difficult film, and his most visually appealing, but it's one that everybody interested in the director's films, or film in general, needs to watch ("carefully watch").9/10(***+/****)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was such a great film. It was done with such beautiful design, such symmetry. I love the way the classical music tied in with the classical art of earth, space and beyond. It was such a fluent, and thought provoking masterpiece. I loved the way the monoliths never changed, although primate, earth and space did. I loved how it was a question of "Do you need me/us now"? The movie expressed desire, peace, love, curiosity, finesse, gentleness, courage and innocence. What more could you ask for from a mere movie? Perhaps a complement movie. Any appreciator of 2001: A Space Odyssey will find the movie 2010 is 2001's complement movie. 2010 is more story orientated than 2001.</fullReview>

The sequences towards the end are dated, but still entertaining. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing, and fits the visuals perfectly.If there is a down side to this film, it is its occasional tedium....Kubrick's typical long shots of movement with no dialog, space craft slowly docking...these moments require some patience, and todays attention spans require quick cuts and frantic motion.Overall, the visual beauty and symphonic structure of the film more than make up for any negatives.

		<fullReview>Lets face it 2001: A Space Odyssey is the best science fiction film ever and the backbone of the science fiction genre, without it Star Wars, Starship Troopers and solaris couldn't of been filmed. Kubrick new exactly how he wanted it to be filmed. It holds enough dialogue to partly understand the film. From the unforgettable Dawn of Man sequence to the final unimaginable climax, 2001 holds you tight and never lets you go. The most impressive visual in the entire film is the Star Gate sequence, all the colours of the rainbow are thrown at the screen as we sit and drool at how wonderful it is, kubrick created the "Stargate" sequence to give stoners the "ultimate thrill ride". At times it can be haunting and chill you to the bone. Kubrick gives us the nightmare computer Hal 9000 and steals the film. It has the best monkey make-up this side of Planet of the Apes. I have never saw classical music put to brilliant use on film here the director plays with different types of music from The Blue Danube Waltz to Strauss. To the original viewer this is a slow burning, masterpiece but the other viewer will class this as "film crap" Some reasons why the other class of viewer may not like this is because there is hardly any dialogue in it and not much happens news flash to you; all films don't have to be bang bang boom boom to be enjoyed. If you want a slow burning, mind numbing film experience and a work of art, check this out. Rest in peace Kubrick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is little to be said about Kubrick's treatment of the human (and unhuman) condition. From the birth of mankind to the final step of evolution, with impressive visuals which hold up even today, 2001 is an enthralling, beautiful, and all-encapsulating film.Held up in a timeless light, A Space Odyssey has stood strong, even as the year 2001 has long since past. This is, however, yet another film in which there is much debate about whether it is "boring" or a masterpiece- rarely in between. It is shot in what is essentially real-time, and it takes a slower pace than the movies the masses are used to as of now. However, don't be fooled. Like all the great films of our time, it is art, and as such, one must appreciate art to enjoy it.2001 is, to put it pithily, the greatest story ever put on celluloid.</fullReview>

The Jupiter mission sequence with HAL offers some of the most frightening and suspenseful moments ever in a science fiction film.I'm not sure, but this may also be one of the first pictures, which also served as a blatant advertisement for a sponsor. As Dr. Floyd is transported to the space station via the shuttle, the Pan American logo is conspicuously visible in several places. There can be no mistake where at least some of the film's funding came from.The story in itself is almost impossible to follow without having first read the book.

		<fullReview>In prehistoric times, ape-men come into contact with a strange black monolith which improves their intelligence. In 1999, a group of scientists discover a similar object on the moon, which sends a message to Jupiter. Two years later, a spaceship commanded by Dave Bowman(Keir Dullea) and overseen by the computer HAL, is sent on a mission to Jupiter. Coincidence? Things quickly get out of control, as HAL starts acting funny... 2001 is somewhat of a ponderous thriller, with a great deal of silence and long, drawn-out segments. While these would have hurt another film, in 2001 they help enhance the story, giving it a touch of realism that almost every other sci-fi franchise lacks. The special effects-revolutionary for their time-and haunting music score also help enhance the film. The film gives us more questions than answers--and part of the fun is drawing your own conclusions of what's going on(Although the questions are answered a little bit in the sequel, 2010). The film's acting is mostly flat and stiff, but once again, that's the style of the film. This is not the film for those wanting action sci-fi--the "Terminator" and "Star Wars" franchises are better for that-but is more of a "Thinking Man's" movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thus Spake Stanley Kubrick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001 is a landmark film. While some easily dismiss it boring, indulgent, tedious, unexplainable, or whatever other slanderous adjectives, this visionary picture has garnered a cult following of appreciators for very good reasons. Were it not for the (as I deem it) ignorant backlash against it, 2001 would stand alongside Dr. Strangelove in Kubrick's catalog, absolutely deserving its status in the IMDB top 20 with that delightful piece of political satire and black humour. There's certainly a better case for it than for say, LOTR: The Two Towers, which by popular demand, outranks even Star Wars (1977) in the #9 spot as I write this review. Enough whining.Kubrick crafted a picture here that is what the big screen is all about. That's why it's a travesty that most of us will probably never see it in the theatre. The visuals are stunning. How, in the late 1960s, he was able to capture on celluloid those unforgettably colorful images of being sucked into a wormhole and into another dimension is an incredible feat. To craft so villainous a character with the HAL 9000 is another. Those who have seen it, like or dislike, likely still carry around in the back of their minds HAL's haunting, off-key rendition of "Bicycle Built for Two".So if you fall in the category of those who watched 2001 and didn't like it because "there was no plot" or "it was too long", then I suggest coming back to it when you're ready to find out what this medium has to offer. Until then, feast on the trite crap found in recent Hollywood productions: Charlie's Angels 2, Bad Boys 2, and on and on and on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many regard 2001: A Space Odyssey as Kubrick's greatest work. I don't, but that doesn't mean I don't regard it as one of the greatest films of all time. Like a lot of groundbreaking cinema, it's not really the most enjoyable thing to sit down and watch. In so many ways it's far more an exercise of Kubrick's masterful film-making than it is a really enjoyable film. But like I say, it's very hard not to be impressed.I remember when I first saw the film, I wondered why I had never heard of Keir Dullea, who plays the human lead. The reason is simple: because he is not the star, nor the main performer. What makes this film such a winner is the off-camera genius of Kubrick and his hunger to give the world a new kind of cinema.Even by today's standards, I don't see how one can not look at this film and just think about what an incredibly achievement it is. For its time, it's momentous. It's light on dialogue and high on detail and was the forerunner of so many great films. It's difficult to fully analyse this film and all of its components, all you can do is sit back and watch. And think. And then once the film's finished, think some more. It's nothing more than imagery, but imagery that creates the longest journey down the evolutionary chain, takes us from what we can't see in our past to what we can't see in our future and in its way, answers questions we couldn't ourselves.Praise must also go to Arthur C Clarke who wrote the original book and co-wrote the screenplay, but really Kubrick is the master of this film, and while it is not in my opinion being Kubrick's best, it is still undoubtably his most important. ***** / *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest movies of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon yet another viewing of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey on a woefully inadequate home television screen, it occurred to me that I have never had the opportunity to see this masterpiece on a regular theater screen, much less the arc of a Cinerama screen. While this may sound like a minor setback in my appreciation of the film, as I began to imagine what it would be like to have Kubrick's images wrapped around me, I realized that the enormity of those images is a vital component of the thematic elements of the movie. The huge curves of the celestial spheres the open and close the film undoubtedly lose their impact when placed between the twin black bars of a 2.1:1 widescreen presentation on TV, and this impact is all but essential to a full appreciation of Kubrick's vision.Perhaps some of the touches that make 2001 so masterly are the small, hardly noticeable elements (such as the music when the huge black Monolith is first encountered and in every subsequent human interaction with it, a choir chanting an otherworldly kyrie eleison, or `God have mercy', or the line, created by outstanding cinematography, that slices the Monolith down the middle into twin strips of black and white, or the positioning of astronaut Frank Poole's body when it is released to burial in space in a arrangement strikingly similar to that of a crucified Jesus), but what make it a great film, in both senses of the word, are the enormously broad strokes with which Kubrick paints his parable.The two most significant elements of the film are the Monolith and HAL. Both these elements serve to remind us of Kubrick's central message, that each individual human being and indeed the human race as a whole are entirely insignificant in the realm of the universe as an entity, but remind us in opposite ways. The Monolith is what makes us human, undoubtedly, and what makes Dave more than human. We are nothing without the external influence it has on us. HAL, on the other hand, shows us that we have not yet attained the status of the Monolith or of God. HAL is described as perfect in `every practical sense of the word,' and yet he fails because of human error. Although unclear from the version of the film that now exists, HAL's malfunction is explained in a voiceover in the original screenplay: he is given conflicting orders and cannot function properly because of this conflict. Human beings tried to create life in HAL and couldn't. HAL's malfunction is a form of chastisement at man's attempt to reach beyond his humanity.And yet this chastisement doesn't reach us directly. Kubrick keeps us at arm's length, gives us the impression of watching instead of participating in the events taking place on the screen. We see the backs of the heads of spaceship pilots, monologues are filmed in wide shots, and we almost never see the details of the face of one of the main characters, Dr. Heywood Floyd. Kubrick pulls back and removes sympathy for the characters in the film, thus achieving a less personal and more universal impact.Taken altogether, 2001 ultimately inspires a feeling of isolation. Loneliness would be the wrong word because we don't feel the desire to see more emotion in the characters, we don't wish the movie included more dialogue to enlighten us as to the real meaning of the film. Ultimately, 2001 makes us realize, as do so many of Kubrick's films, that we're alone in the universe. We are at the mercy of fate. Chance and hubris ruin our best-laid plans and we cannot hope to transcend our state because it is, indeed, the human condition itself. To become more than we are, we require help, either from God or from an enigmatic slab of blackness. To see 2001 is to be reminded of our humble station in existence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is INCREDIBLE!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I would like to make it clearly obvious that the only reason people didn't like this movie, or will give a bad review, is because of their lack of understanding for this piece of art. This movie is mind-blowing, in the sense that it was made in '68, and still reflects a very accurate description of life in 2001. Space Odyssey focuses on one key theory: Spiral Evolution. I have come to this conclusion due to common appearances of a black monolith, each time there is a major step in evolution. Keep this in mind for the movie, and keep your mind open.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confusing, but great ideas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been reading some of the comments on this movie, and I hate it when people say "it was boring, I hated it. I didn't understand anything about it." I thought it was very confusing, but I came to my own conclusions about things. All 3 parts were really interesting (and I remembered the HAL segment was done in a spoof on The Simpsons), even though I didn't fully understand it, it gave me new ideas to think about. So for whoever hated this movie, actually try and think about what it means, even though it doesn't have all the glitz and fast-paced action of the 90's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Birth...Breath...Soul....Science</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When viewing a Kubrick film think of 2 things for beginners...Sherlock Holmes and the Greek gods.His films are just like Sherlock Holmes mysteries with one modification...You are the detective....There are struggles between what seems to be immortal and mortal or, amongst the mortals or immortals themselves.From the mannequins in "Killer's Kiss" to the shrilling voices emitting from the monolith in 2001 to Alex and his Droogies in "A Clockwork Orange" to the round table in "Strangelove" to the the creatures haunting the Overlook in the Shining to the functiuonaries of War in "Full Metal Jacket" to the underworld of "Eyes Wide Shut" and theshifting of disguises and roles in "Barry Lyndon" these struggles ensue."2001" begins with a breathing planet, soft winds brushing a dried landscape with habitants struggling with their surroundings and each other...There are predators and prey and fear of the dark...One moring they are disturbed, wakened by sound of voices, shrilling with female voices expressing a cautious sound as is asking, "are we pushing this too fast? They may not be ready!" They seem to be answered by the males that "it's too late we've already surged forward and our arguing has drawn their attention!"The voices then split, changing from an"e-e-e-ee" sound to an "a-a-a- ah!" as if they created an opening, waiting to be filled...To Kubrick, it seems consciousness operates like a stomach...it gets hungry and wants to feed....and, indeed, they act in accordance trying to feed this new felt hunger by trying to bend over and devour the monolith as they would some food....It doesn't satisfy them.As the voices cease, a signal of their disperse rings with a spreading outward, looking at the random arrangement of things, just as the randomness of the voices suggested to them..One of them picks up a bone, sensing an extension of his own arm into something greater than it ever has been...The hunger wishes and getsmore as the first tool use and tool making seems to satisfy mind's needs, making it want more discovery...and more...We move to a scene where the necessity for protection drops, personified by a telephone call home to a child (played by Vivian Kubrick) who grooms herself, as compared to humans grooming each other in the previous part...She has no need for the attention needed in the past yet, still wishes for a "bush baby", a prehistoric leftover that shows up in any childhood...Breathing picks up as a major constituent in the film and is very pronounced as the film progresses. Astronauts in their suits descend into a crator and find a calling card left behind...Kubrick seems to suggest that the soul is something that is created with the first breath and dies with the last, finding some transformation....and it affects HAL the most...On board Discovery he defeats Frank Poole in chess. Frank shows no sign of emergency at his defeat..Could HAL be pondering what it is like to have a soul??? to be forgiven for simple mistakes? If he was to have a breath of some kind, would he be forgiven for a simple mistake as well? Breathing is something that humans do and HAL seemed to wish to feel the sound and experience of it.Now, how would HAL get one of them to go on a space walk so that he could amplify that sound within his circuits? And, what little mistake could he make to see if he is forgiven?? They would forgive him, wouldn't they? Especially if the mistake was minor, like a prediction that a small unit in the antenna was about to go awry... That wouldn't be so major, would it? Did HAL get upset, knowing Frank could not beat him in chess? Frank's error is forgiven...HAL's should be as well..The loud feeling of breathing fills the soundtrack throughout Dave's excursion to the antenna...Has a soul grown within HAL..? Will HAL respond like a child not getting its way? How will they respond?In vengeance HAL takes breath away...first from Frank Poole and then from hybernating astronauts on board...Dave was saved for last.And a narrow risk...a breath taking risk....a breath holding risk taken by Dave entering an emergency latch without being able to breathe...but holding out and responding in time to take what breath the Discovery can offer...In disconnecting the computer the sound of breathing stops at the instant the HAL finishes singing "Daisy", yet Dave is still in his suit.He picks up his breath again as a monitor informs him of the mission's secret.Throughout the visionary voyage he falls with only his eyes in full function...Breathing picks up at his sudden stop, where breath leads to a new birth, a transformation....The monolith was a doorway to other places...who or what was operating it kept itself out of reach....like a magician withholding, creating an expectancy violation to the audience...making some wish to peek behind the curtain or cape to find out.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is a plot!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading circa 100 comments on 2001 I just couldn't stand it and had to speak my mind.To all of you b*****ds who say this movie has no plot. What were you doing while watching it? Eating, talking on the phone, listening to Britney Spears' latest masterpiece? There is a plot!!!! You just have to pay a little bit of attention and have intelligence of a flower pot at least (thus excluding Britney's and J.Lo fans). It won't be written on the screen with flaming letters, you have to kind of think (it's what your parents apparently didn't do while they "created" you).Another group are those who claim that it was boring, the scenes were too long, no dialogues. If you are accustomed to MTV like films, with scenes changing faster than Beckham's haircut then I can't help you. There are probably some mental health institutions in your country. The scenes are long and left without dialogues to make you think, analyse, help you grasp the questions it asks, or just for sheer pleasure of watching a beautiful image. You do take pleasure in watching something beautiful, don't you. Believe me it's worth paying attention to what you watch not only when you see Seagal breaking somebody's arm, silicon breast or when the characters use the F word as a comma.And finally the guys who say that the "monkey part" was stupid and totaly useless. It's the downfall of mankind. Stick to Star Wars and don't comment on real art. It's like saying that the guitar riff in "Satisfaction" is useless (F***ing Britney again). 10/10</fullReview>

Kubrick really created the ultimate film in this adaptation from a short story by Arthur C. Clarke. I'm a huge science fiction fanatic, so that may have something to do with my love for this film. The cinematography, the acting, and the music all are brought together by Kubrick's direction to form what I can only call the greatest film of all time, to me anyway.

		<shortDescription>Overrated Kubrick film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie suffers the same fault as all other Kubrick films, being ponderously slow. As soon as the space adventure starts, this does add to the realism however, giving a good idea what it's like being in space.The beginning of the movie (the monkey business) is, on the other hand, a torture to watch and listen to. It's not thought-provoking, necessary or entertaining in any way! What was Kubrick thinking when making that intro? It spoils a large part of the movie, in fact the first hour is best skipped for it's tediousness. The second part gets much better with the homicidal Hal computer which strives for it's own survival by any means necessary and the mysterious (alien?) Monolith. I must say, no matter how fascinating others might think it is, this did seem a story that even the writers themselves didn't understand. What you get is a vague and pretentious plot line with more questions than answers. This would not be a bad thing if it weren't for the fact that the questions evolve around trying to understand the plot rather than genuinely interesting issues. All in all that makes this a grossly overrated film, which intellectuals around the world will adore nonetheless because the less people that understand it, the more the smarties will like it, after all it's so much fun feeling smarter than others, is it not? 6,5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant achievement, bad film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe the story told in this film to be one of the best science-fiction stories ever to have been written, unfortunately the film tells this story very poorly.An immense amount of time is given over to extended special effects sequences, very impressive and obviously a new experience to a 1960s audience. However, from a story-telling point of view, these are completely superfluous: spending 15 minutes or so showing a space-ship docking with a space-station doesn't really achieve much.Completely the opposite attitude is taken to scenes of dialogue and character interaction; these are skipped over hurriedly by a director who is obviously eager to get on to his next visual masterpiece. A perfect example is the briefing scene at the moon-base: all the introductory chat is shown but as soon as the actual briefing is about to start (which would explain a great deal about what is going on) the scene ends abruptly.A lot is made about the ambiguity and mystery in the film, and the fact that so much is never explained is often cited as evidence that the film is for 'intellectuals'. I don't hold with this opinion however, if you read the novel you will find that there is a very comprehensible story behind the film that is explained perfectly well (for instance, you will find the briefing scene intact in the novel).The simple fact is that cutting out great chunks of storyline and key explanatory scenes does not an intellectual movie make. In fact so little is left behind that you can watch this film as many times as you like but you will never be able to work out what's going on, there is simply not enough there to work with.The film is a fantastic technical achievement, and it does stand as a fantastic piece of cinematic history; unfortunately, it completely fails to put its story across to the audience. The novel is much better as you can actually get some understanding and enjoyment out of it, but the writing 'style' of Arthur C. Clark is incredibly dry and matter-of-fact and so the novel is not great either.This is truly one of the greatest science fiction stories of all time, unfortunately neither Kubrick's film nor Clark's novel tells it particularly well. I would be thrilled for some director to have another go at making this film and give it the treatment it deserves. Unfortunately this will never happen as the act would be regarded as heresy by so many blinkered people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie: ahead of its time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is hard to describe in a short review. Do not anticipate a fast action, no brainer movie of this generation, when you view it for the first time. This movie is something you come out of and wonder about. Yes, there are those who come out of it and say it is crap. Those are entitled to their opinion, of course. The beauty of this movie is in its ability to make you wonder what it could mean beyond the 2 hours or so it takes to view it. The movies that last for generations (like Gone With The Wind) are those that take messages into the viewers imagination. I must admit, I am glad Arthur C. Clarke explained this thing in 2010. In 1968 the special effects were well beyond their time, but today they are unimpressive. It is a shame because the difference is, the special effects in this movie are "seamless"; that is, the special effects blend in to the story instead of many of today's movies that are "carried" by the special effects. 2001's record speaks for itself. It is an awesome movie for SCIFI fans. Turn on your imagination, open a good bottle of wine, and enjoy!</fullReview>

Space has never looked so clean, and effect free. The lighting effects have never been so mystical, and stunning.The film kicks off, i think, when you are introduced to the computer HAL, that becomes the core of the film, and the most "film"-like plot throughout it's duration. It becomes exciting, without losing it's credibility as a piece of brilliant cinema. I only wish i could have seen this on the big screen. The little screen could never do it justice.</fullReview>

It could change after I see Dr. Strangelove and Clockwork Orange but I doubt it.The acting in this movie is nothing award winning or worth a nomination but its solid acting. The Special Effects are excellent, very realistic for the 60s. The Sets are fantastic. The Directing from Kubrick is top notch in every possible way. He should have won for this. Its too bad he died without winning an award but hes in good company with Hitchcock and Scorsese but Scorsese will probably win for GONY this year, which is stupid.Overall, probably the best science fiction movie ever made.</fullReview>

In 2001: A Space Odyssey, the acting is more than compotent, but it's strengths are in other areas of the cinematic endeavor. It is the sets, the props, the special effects, and the score that are the strengths of this film. Needless to say director Kubrick and his collaborators did a masterful job in envisioning and bringing to the screen their very convincing concept of the future. Praising Kubrick's directorial abilities is much like nonchalantly saying Shakespeare was a great writer! Great science fiction film, 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie thinking that I was going to hate it. Boy, was I wrong. 2001 was one of the most visually stunning films I have ever seen, especially for the time period it was made in, and better than the tiresome special effects they use today. I've always enjoyed Stanley Kubrick's work, but 2001 is definitely one of his better triumphs. I don't even mind that it is sort of a slow movie; the great background music and semi-tense mood of it all makes 2001 work. One of my favorite movies, Dark Star, has a similar plotline, and I never realized that it spoofed 2001, since I hadn't seen it before the first time I saw Dark Star, which made watching 2001 even more interesting. Anyway, I think that 2001 is an ingenius film--some stuff is sort of confusing, but that does not detract from the film. It is a feast for the eyes and the ears; just hearing HAL is sort of creepy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without a doubt, one of the finest films of the 20th century, Stanley Kubrick has created a work of art that will be studied and appreciated for countless generations. Very few other filmmakers have ever attempted a tale with the depth and scope of 2001, and none have succeeded. This is cinema truly as art, and like a Van Gogh painting or a William Blake poem, accessible, yet dense, and broadly open to interpretation.It is easy to understand the controversy surrounding this film, and why it creates an either a hate it or love it reaction with the majority of its viewers. This film is different from anything that came before it, and sadly, except for its widely imitated special effects, just as different from every film that has been made since. It doesn't pander to or insult its audience, it is a film that one must experience, on the director's own terms, and almost inevitably, come away changed.Interesting, for a feature film with very limited dialog, it contains one of the most powerful and memorable conversations in the history of film. A dialog between computer and man, where for 95% of the conversation, only the man's breathing, can be heard. After having seen the film many times now, I still get chills watching this scene.This is a film that one can't imagine being made today. It is too uncompromising and original. The studios would want a heroic and glib Bruce Willis as the mission commander battling to save the crew, spouting clever one-liners, and overcoming impossible odds leading up to the required happy ending. Yippee-ki-yay, HAL 9000. Bruce kisses the girl, fadeout, up comes a hiphop tune with credits. Nope. No major studio would make this movie today, and speaking of impossible odds, consider the pitch meeting where a screenwriter even tried to sell this movie. He'd be escorted off the lot by security.For those who have never seen this film, or have seen it once and didn't like it, I have this comment. Put Star Wars, Star Trek and every other science fiction film out of your mind. It isn't going to be anything like those, yet its look heavily influenced every space film that followed. You won't see the now standard 20 cuts in 12 seconds approach to editing. Kubrick's shots are like individual works of art in a gallery, and he allows you the time to ponder them. Its ok not to like this film, many people prefer Vin Diesel to Van Gogh, but if you have any real interest in cinema, you owe it to yourself to experience one of the most important and influential films ever made. And if possible, see it in a theatre, as this is one film that truly loses a lot in the translation to the small screen. Thanks, Stanley.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE GREATEST LEAP FORWARD THE FILM WORLD HAS EVER EXPERIENCED.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am quite possibly one of Mr Kubrick's most devoted fans, I think he is the best film director the world has ever seen, and this film was his finest work. Here is my opinion why?????..Visually 2001 has (for its time) the best special effects the film world has ever seen. It was (excuse the pun) an astronomical evolutionary jump forward, not only visually but also in way a film flows. It's totally unique; the use of music to propel the awe-inspiring plot and intellectual narrative is quite brilliant. Where as before music was mostly used to control the audience emotions.Some of the shots and camera work in this film are GENIUS. THE FAMOUS JUMP SHOT, the Leopard with the light reflecting off its retinas as it consumes a dead Zebra. The beautiful space scenes, coupled with just the right use of eerie/spectacular music send shivers of wonder and awe down the spine.The plot is a great one, I especially love the beginning and indeed the whole back bone of the story which suggests that we as a race did not come to be through just evolution or just divine intervention, BUT BOTH!!! This is the over riding plot in the film which comes to a conclusion in the end. But more on the end later.....HAL is strangely in my opinion the best character in the film. In that he is the most complex and is the hardest to understand. Did HAL "EVOLVE" into something more than a computer??? And therefore doesn't it seem normal that he would indeed try to protect himself against being shut down my Dave and the others???? I feel the whole story is a superb intellectual battle, between HAL and the humans (which is also a physical battle), HAL and himself (against his programming)......and most importantly the humans fighting with their inner beliefs as they start to gain an insight into where their past and indeed their future originated and originates.And now the ending, well Kubrick did say in interviews that I have heard that he didn't intend to puzzle people so much with the ending, its just the way it came across. But he was really very pleased that that's what happened. He never let on what he thought the ending meant (One of his prime principles in his films was to let the audience make up their own mind.) In my opinion its really quite simple and beautiful, Dave is transported though hyper space (either through mind or body, its a matter of opinion) then once their in this strange place in space or his mind, keeps seeing the black monolith and every time he touches it he seems to get older, then he finally ceases to hold a human from and his body dies of old age. Transporting him to a higher level of being.In short no film has made me think and indeed ponder as much as this one. The visuals, music, and narrative are the best I've ever seen. The only fault is the acting, there's nothing bad about it but there's also nothing great about it. Maybe Stan wanted that know who knows&gt;THIS IS NOT A FILM ITS SOMETHING ELSE, SOMETHING WONDERFUL, THAT I DOUBT WILL EVER BE EXPERIENCED AGAIN.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's easy to see where the "love it or hate it" attitude comes from after watching this movie; at face value, it's rather empty. The brilliance comes from the thoughts and questions it provokes about our place in the universe. Like all art (and it certainly is cinematic ART at its finest), it really is only as good or bad as what you take from it.The slow pace gave me a lot of time to reflect, and just "take in the view". I'm reminded of Buddhist philosophy, where enlightenment is achieved just by living in the moment, something we have lost touch with in this modern world.The final part of the movie was summed up best by a previous reviewer: "How would anyone show something beyond our ability to understand? ". First you have to be willing to admit there are things far beyond our understanding in our current state of evolution. Just as there were to our man-ape ancestors.I can barely comprehend the notion, but I know the next step in evolution would shed us of such a discrete and shallow view of existence. Perhaps toward a dissolved notion of self and our concrete place in space-time, where we can become more at one with the universe and each other, and away from the ideas we have of such a limited scope to life and consciousness. I find it intriguing that these are also beliefs and experiences held by many an acid user. Perhaps they get but a glimpse of a higher plane of existence, perhaps it's all in their mind. What's the difference?That's my (very brief) take. You will no doubt have your own *personal* interpretation, and that means the movie has done its job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*may be some spoilers ahead*Every time i watch this film i get a sense of extreme gratification. I thank the late Stanely Kubrick for his attention to detail and his willingness to do Arthur C Clarkes book justice. This is without a doubt the single most impressive, scientifically perfect science fiction picture ever. The way the shuttle docks with the space station and how the occupants of the station move in low gravity is compelling to say the least. I love attention to detail and that is what this film is all about. The fact that it took me five viewings to get round the star-child concept made me enjoy it even more.Stanely, you will always be a god good sir.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Film - A 'Must See'!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film for the thinking sci-fi fan. It delves into the secrets of mans evolution on a grand scale. The scale of this film is almost undescibably epic. An awesome masterpiece of a film, beatifully directed in every detail by Stanley Kubrick.Ok, thats the praise out of the way, you can guess its just about the best film I can think of really, but it is a long, epic, film, so best to view it in widescreen (it was originally filmed in cinemascope, so get it as wide a possible - and to get the best out of this film you want DVD, surround sound, the lot! The musical score is just as good as the video side of it. The music is predominantly classical, which is unhurried, so be ready to be patient and give this film the time it deserves to develop - don't turn it off after half an hour. You get the idea that this is not a space soap opera? No way - this film is deep, very deep indeed.An absolute classic, can't really fault it. An interesting nerd fact is that the computer's name 'HAL' is one letter shifted alphabetically from the letters 'IBM'. So there u go, a nerd fact for you. But this is not a sci-fi nerd film, this is a classic movie about evolution that just happens to be set in a sci-fi theme, that is artisically excellent.The ending is just psychedelic really. There are parallels with the sort of evolution shifing talked about by Terrance McKenna here.And you have to just marvel at the level of the special effects considering its age, its a bit of creative genius at work, no doubt about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece... undying relevancy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSKubrick is perhaps the only director in the history of film that never made a mediocre film. Even his early work (The Killing and Paths of Glory) were incredible; his career seemed as carefully planned as his films. 2001 was an excellent example of a finely tuned vehicle to express concern about the adverse effects of technology. Although 2001 was slow in parts, the film should be viewed as a whole. The beginning made me think I accidentally rented planet of the apes, but as the film progressed Kubrick's message becomes more and more apparent and early scenes soon made perfect sense. The themes in the film are several, and will continue to make 2001 relevant for generations. Also, HAL is one of the greatest screen villains of all time because he does not have a physical presence and is omnipresent on that ship. It was definitely man vs. technology, but it also could have been a man vs. god sequence as well. HAL, HAL, HAL. The film is also worth seeing for the theme music. Seldom does music fit a film so perfectly and tightly. That's Kubrick for you. See this one, and everything else Kubrick directed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man, it is for sure the best film ever made. I think no other movie can be better than 2001. The special effects are simply perfect, the story is excellent, Kubrick is a genius and Clark too. That´s why this movie is so wonderful. It was released in 1968, but it´s still actual. I think that who didn´t like it it´s because couldn´t understand the movie. It´s really a little hard to understand something, but this movie must be watched more than one time, to get some obfuscated parts. I rated it 10 of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest films ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't like this movie the first time i saw it, but it had one or two scenes that stuck with me. shortly after my first viewing i put the film on just to see these special scenes, but i found myself watching the whole film from start to finish and rather enjoying it. Since then I've seen the picture about five times and each time i actually enjoyed it more than the last.Now i'm at a point where every scene in the film seems practically perfect to me. I love every single second of 2001, and believe it to be Stanley Kubrick's finest two and a half hours.2001 is a slow film, with long visually stunning scenes that look far more realistic than some CGI effects today. Nearly every scene is a classic, in particular the 'Rebirth'Although often seen as a Science fiction, 2001 is more than that. It's a very philosophical and spiritual film. It asks questions. It doesn't answer them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>sigh. What can one say about the greatest film ever made, one which asks more burning questions and leaves them at your doorstep, leaving you to work them out?The recurring theme in 2001 is birth. Ever notice how many birthdays their are? Dr. Floyd's daughter, frank's parents wishing him a happy one, HAL announcing his birthdate in Illinois....and then the other birthdays, such as the dawn of man and the "starchild". The cinematography is breathtaking; the genius of the bone being thrown into the air and then cutting to the spaceship...and the effects. The rotating space station still looks marvelous and state of the art. just wonderful. Then there's the eerie noise that pod makes when dave prepares to jettison himself back into the ship....I first saw 2001 when I was maybe 7 years old on tv, and I was stunned and mystified by what I thought was the coolest movie ever. 30 years later, it's still the coolest movie ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001:A SPACE ODYSSEY is a film but more than a film. It takes film to a new level. No, 2001 is not an action-packed film but what it lacks in action it makes up with in story and exciting visuals. There's actually more going on here than meets the eye -challenge your normal viewing range with this one. Don't be limited to what's on the screen. This movie made me look at the world differently. It made clear to me how beautiful human "ideals" can be while HAL reminds us of all of the potential lurking negative outcome of technological advancement. 2001 should probably be most commended for its outstanding special FX. However it's not for everyone..it's very slow moving and portrays a world in which people have become cold and distant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are times when a clever man finds a way to tell a story about one of the basic things of the essence of man. I find so interesting that every time I tried to realize what kubrick tried to tell us, I ended in a different point every one of each, so strangely beautiful. His description of how man evolve, how small he could be comparing to other civilizations, how man really IS, is so direct and gave me the feeling that these ideas were so close to us. He did it in "a clockwork orange" too, when he told us about the aggressive nature of people. The fact that he tells this in a middle of a sci-fi scene, makes me wish I could have seen it when it first came out so I could be amazed by its special effects.washingtondave: great comment, man.Excuse me for any writing mistake, my english is not that perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Were you in the cinema when 2001 came out? I was, although just a dozen years old. My father and older brother were thrilled to be going to this movie, and I was sure it was going to be pretty good as well. But of course nothing prepared me for the bigness -- grand music, huge space ship, fantastic light show, and considerable running time.Well, the point is that I still remember all that, and the cinema I saw 2001 at ("The Oak" on Denman, in Vancouver), and how I had to ask a lot of questions in the end. And how profoundly advanced it was for its time.The same can not be said for Star Wars or other "special effects" movies (even though Star Wars was one of just two movies I saw twice in the cinema). Special effects do not equal profundity. In fact, my current view is that if a movie is special effects dominated, then it will suck. Why? Because it is so easy to see how fake the effects are...like plastic flowers versus the real thing, fake zero gravity is pretty easy to pick out.2001 is one of the few sci-fi films that *is* a great movie (I would also include The Matrix). The others are at best creative stories with fancy pictures.Oh, and for those who find it boring, consider that the original running time of Lawrence of Arabia (released around the same time) was just under FOUR hours! 2001 is a mere 2.5 hours (shorter than The Green Mile).8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I read the review of 2001 by Dr Moth, I felt compelled to enlighten any future viewers of the true value of 2001:A Space Odyssey. 2001 is the best science fiction movie ever made. Moth listed reasons why 2001 is a turkey and I would like to respond to each one.1:Boring Monkeys-The creatures at the beginning of 2001 were not monkeys, they were of the species Australopithicus Aferensis, our ancestors and descendents of apelike creatures that spawned both humans and monkeys. And if you don't think a "monkey's" evolutionary leap due to alien intervention is not cool or interesting than I would like to know what you do find cool or interesting. Also, the creature in Lost in Space was not a monkey, but an alien creature that just looked like a monkey. And though I thought Lost in Space was a fine sci-fi flick it just can't compare to 2001.2:Boring Spaceships-If you knew anything about spaceships and space you would know that there is no sound. There is no air! You have to have air for sound. And as far as mounting laser-cannons to a spaceship, I think you've seen one to many Star Trek Deep Space Nine episodes. The ship in 2001 was built and designed to encounter a far superior alien presence. An alien civilization far superior to humans would obviously be peace loving and benevolent, and therefore, there would be no need for weapons3:Boring Homicidal Computer-This isn't "Attack of the Killer Robots from Venus" but a thought provoking, intelligent movie about a supercomputer with a conflict of interest. It's not even a robot! And it's HAL9000, not HALBOT 9000. H is before I, A is before B and L is before M: IBM! Pretty clever.The "trippy" scene and the scene with the old man and fetus represent the alien civilization's command over time itself. Past, present and future are meaningless and these scenes represent Dave Bowman's evolutionary transformation into a being beyond physical form and the concept of time. Though I think Independence Day is the best action flick ever(and I've never even heard of Battle Beyond the Stars), 2001 is still the best. It started it all. It might not be action-packed, but it is a wonderful, intelligent film for young and old alike.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought I'd really enjoy this. I study astronomy and astrophysics at university (college) and I love movies, especially science fiction. It would have been really visually appealing in its time, but since George Lucas came along, special effects have come a long way. So it was kind of dull watching a spaceship move for 5 minutes. Some good bits with the HAL computer. Shocking dialogue and SO much cheap talk. 'Hi' 'How are you going' 'good thanks. you?' 'yeh i'm doing well' 'fantastic' 'good to here it' 'you to' oh my gosh get on with it! How did that garbage get past the editors? And don't tell me I should read the book to understand it. That completely defeats the point of a movie. If you want some good science read Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. It's really funny and while cleverly stupid, the science is actually quite thought provoking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest film ever made?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another reviewer below ( http://imdb.com/CommentsShow?62622-541 ) asked this very question as well. I've written an earlier review ( http://imdb.com/CommentsShow?62622-432 ) hailing it as a Masterpiece, though now I'm considering whether it's even greater than that. I look at the "top 100 lists" here and elsewhere, and when you consider such films as _The Godfather_, _Citizen Kane_, _Schindler's List_ and a very, very short list of others (after you get past about 6 or 7 films, the next on the list after those just don't stack up to _2001_), _2001_ may or may not stand right alongside them or surpass them as far as cinematic perfection goes, but it is, at the very least, in extremely close proximity.As for all the negative reviews of the film, I think a chief problem many have with this film is that it doesn't present itself as a "normal" film; if what you want is a film that plays like other great ones, you're going to be sorely disappointed. As anyone who watched it (love it or hate it) knows, it doesn't rely on explicit narrative nearly as much as in just about any other great film you care to name. But it sets a standard for monumental filmmaking. For many of us lovers of cinema, Stanley Kubrick's epic is a blessing: it showed to the world and to the filmmaking industry that "weird," "avant-garde" filmmaking can be great. Yeah, it took a guy with a big name and a big-studio super-budget to make it happen on American screens, but it helped to breathe new life into the cinema and taught the studios not to stifle greatness just because it may be "boring" or "weird."Again, we lovers of film all owe Stanley a huge debt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a fantastic film! I wished I could have seen this film when it came out, what an experience this would have been.I'm not sure I can add something worthwhile to the large number of very fine comments about 2001 present on this site. To those confused, disappointed or angry about the film I'd encourage them to read a number of those comments until they can get some explanation or maybe an echo of their own feeling. Anyway, here goes:Yes there is a story (and a great one at that) in this film, yes you do have to look for it a little, sure it is not spoon-fed to you like modern Hollywood films tend to do, but it's not hard really, and why should all films be the same? Don't you find it nice to be challenged?No it's *not* slow. The more I watch it (I've seen it 3 times) the more things and meaning I find in it, the more time I have to think about what I'm seeing. Isn't that nice for a change?Say that you were looking at some distant galaxy full of stars through the eyepiece of a telescope, would you expect it to dance before your eyes for your entertainment? yet wouldn't there be a deep mystery in that sight? would you not find yourself in awe of this fantastic object? wouldn't you ask yourself if intelligent beings lived out there millions of light years away? How could we contact them? What would they look like? what if they had a civilization that would be so far advanced that we would be like insects are to us, what would they do to us? Would they be benign or hostile?Well you can't expect an intelligent film like `2001' to provide you with detailed answers to these questions. If it did it would be trite and contrived and `2001' would be mere entertainment. If that is what you are looking for in a sci-fi movie you can watch Star Wars or Star Trek, where aliens are just as silly and lost in their wan little lives as we are. No, in `2001' we have real aliens, and they have a plan for us. Can we hope to understand them? maybe.The real force of `2001' is that it does not feed you a stupid answer to life and everything, and that it tries to get you to think. There are very few things in real life like that. This is also an incredibly optimistic film, I always feel elated after viewing it, and in awe of what my fellow humans can do sometimes.You may not like this film, and that's fine and that's your privilege. Isn't the world sometimes great because it is so diverse?PS: I liked Star Wars &amp; Star Trek too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a typical Stanley Kubrick-picture in any way! Something strange occurs and we witness how it develops during the entire movie, but in the end neither the director with his camerawork nor the actors through their characters give us the required information. We see what happens and we understand a part of it, but we never get to know the actual WHY! Why was the hotel haunted or why did Jack Nicholson go crazy in "The shining" and why is Tom Cruise being threatened after having visited a secret, sexual group? We don't know and personally; it's better this way. By not telling us a few things, Kubrick-movies are always a bit of a mystery. Besides, there isn't always a reasonable explanation for everything. Some things just happen.Although I like some science-fiction movies much better than this one here, I do realize that neither of them would have become what they are now, if it wasn't for "2001: A space odyssey". This film has been a major influence and set the standards for all other science-fiction pictures to follow in the years to come.It's amazing how the groundbreaking special effects haven't aged a bit! Watching this film, you cannot believe it's more than 30 years old. The special effects are THAT good! Furthermore, there's the beautiful music which is crucial to the film. It causes the whole thing to feel less like a documentary. Some of the more lengthier scenes are easier to watch because of that wonderful music.Just like in the science-fiction movie "Artificial Intelligence: AI" (originally a concept of Stanley Kubrick), you'll find the same thing going on in here; namely 'the war between man and robot.' Therefore the most intriguing character in this film isn't even human! It's HAL-9000; the onboard computer."2001: A space odyssey" is not only a good, but also an important movie. Although a few scenes may seem to go on forever and the ending is kinda weird, it's the mix of the delightful music along with the breathtaking special effects that make this a true classic.</fullReview>

I'm not the one to hype over a movie out of infatuation but I must say 2001 is a delight to the senses and the brain. Screenplay writer Arthur C. Clarke once commented that if anyone understood "2001:A Space Odyssey", he would have failed with his story. If you decide to give this movie a try, remember to take your time and sit back comfortably. The movie runs at 143 min. and the pace is (very)leisurely. Make sure you have your widescreen projector nicely tweaked and the speakers well set up. Most of all: Forget what you know about SF movies and start viewing with an open mind. My first 10-rating for Stanley Kubrick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't want to count the many times I've seen this movie on video, so I'll say I've seen it four times. Once in 1969 and three times in 2001 and 2002, always in Hollywood (thanks, American Cinemateque!), and if you haven't seen it in a theatre, I'm afraid you haven't seen it. What a great movie! Boy did we rob ourselves by wasting all those resources on wars. The only bad things I can say about it are that it isn't perfect and that this science fiction adventure ever had to end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fabulous ideas inspire people to develop new technology</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon knowing the year when 2001: A Space Odyssey was produced, I felt amazed by the technology it displayed. In that era, the movie was a production of originality and imagination, which can be grouped into ?§science fiction?¨ genre. The first scene, a group of gorillas, aroused my curiosity and started to think what it symbolized. The part titled The dawn of man?¨ led me to think of mankind. Later, when a bone was employed as a weapon or a tool to fight against other rivals, a feeling of enlightenment flashed on me. Yes, it showed the start of human civilization.In effect, several parts in this film were indeed remarkable. For instance, the scene of a bone being thrown into the sky smoothly transferred into the appearance of a spaceship. I would say this shift was quite impressive. Also, classical music was played whenever a space journey proceeded. It made the audience feel like that everything in universe is in a peaceful state or they can only find harmony there. Silence is the background of the cosmos.By the way, the way that an astronaut used to communicate with his family is the pioneer of net meetings nowadays. It seems we are able to find some traces of fabulous ideas in this film related to modern technology or perhaps some of them inspired people who engage in R&amp;D to develop new technology.Yet, a question was left to the viewers to consider. When human beings lead a life completely computerized, if computer systems go wrong one day, how can human beings face and cope with the problem? In this movie, computers seemed to develop its own thinking mode and had the capability to adopt necessary strategies against mankind when it found it could be disconnected. Perhaps, this situation could occur some day.Besides the above, in the beginning, something similar to an obelisk awakened the gorillas?¦ curiosity and flocked to touch it. What did this obelisk mean here? Also, in the end, when the leading character was at his last breath, the obelisk appeared again. Through it, the dead character transformed into a newborn baby, starting his new life or another circulation. The obelisk seemed to represent a gate to another world, or a passage to the cosmos. If so, then actually, things in universe are connected. No boundaries exist; only myth is still awaiting humans to probe answers. The end of life, as a matter of fact, starts another life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You have got to be kidding me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am an artist, I have an open mind and I am creative. But you can't be serious when you consider this a good movie, let alone a work of art!!! I am also into sci fi, so I was very eager to rent this movie oneday and watch it, but it is so stupid and pointless it is mind-boggling that such a wonderful director could decieve so many people into thinking of this as...good! I am sorry if I am being stubborn, but I don't really enjoy watching a spaceship take 15 minutes to go from one side of the screen to another, and than watch someone jog around a loop for another 10 minutes, and than watch a big block of rock floating through space. It is so incredibly boring. Kinda like Matrix-style, except the whole movie is in bullet-time!! And this is supposed to influence me or something? The meaning of life?? HAL 9000 was pretty cool, and the beginning with the apes was fascinating, but the rest is pure, 100% distilled crap. Face it, if someone is looking for art they go to a museum. If they are looking for an entertaining movie, they go to the silver screen. 2001 is neither, and doesn't belong in either place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As of 8/22/01, this film is ranked #49 in the IMD Top 250 list. As much as I enjoyed Star Wars as a kid, I really have no desire to watch it again. 2001, on the other hand, I could watch every year (and actually have, since 1987). The most fascinating thing about this movie is how it still sparks lively discussion and debate for everyone who watches it. It is impossible not to discuss afterwards. Spielberg tried to mimic this with his adaptation of A.I., and succeeded to a lesser degree. This is a film in movements, and watching the newly restored DVD, I was somehow able to transport myself back to 1968 and watch the film from a new perspective. The new DVD even has the "intermission" intact. If you don't have the new DVD, get thy to a video store TODAY.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Landmark In History</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is not just a landmark in cinema, it's a landmark in history. The creative ingenuity of both Kubrick and Clark is just absolutely meticulous. What stunned me the most is that Kubrick completely blew the names like Asimov out of the water. He blew every science fictionist out of the industry. His theatrical prediction of evolution was just absolutely stunning. It left you for more questions as you were getting more answers, and no film has ever been able to accomplish this end without criticism. This film not only showed you that evolution was is possible, but it showed you that science plays a role just as big as religion. What struck me really odd about Kubrick (and is the reason he's my favorite director), is the way he dosen't explain his films to the public. He just puts out it, and we are just going to have to figure it out ourselves. I think Kubrick gets a thrill out of this, but I also think that its pure genius. I think he is a real artist, it's just that he's painting a picture of a broken reality, not a perfect one. I feel that this is the motives behind his films and what seperates him from other directors who try to explain every detail of a film. What also struck me as odd was how Kubrick's prediction of the lunar landscape was so accurate just a year shy of Neil Armstrongs first steps on its surface. Kubrick also started many ideas that are still being considered by NASA, and they are also reconsidering some of their ideas purely on this film alone! Like the computer HAL, sure he had the ability to connect with humans, but humans have a dark side just as they have a light. So one must consider that the principle of contradictions plays a part in machines just as humans. I recently watched A.I. and I have to say that their theory on artificial intellegence was pretty similar to that of 2001. Though I don't see how (a boy that was built to love), feels nothing but love, when all in all, he's hated. HAL demonstrated A.I. wonderfully. Dave Bowman demonstrated human emotion to its fullest extent, and portrayed it perfectly. This film has not only sparked my mind, but the minds of millions of philosophers, theologist, scholors, scientist...you name it! I know for sure that this film has sparked my mind in the quest for answers behind reality, as it did millions of people around the world. Kubricks ideas are going to be well a reality in the future, and the irony is, why this film is a landmark in history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001 remains to this day the philosophically most thought provoking science fiction film yet made, and a cultural milestone. You may love it or hate it, but few films have ever been the subject of so much discussion amongst film buffs!In terms of pre-digitized special effects it is still No. 1 and the inspiration for all that came after it.In terms of marrying classical music to image it has no equal.The fact that, after nearly a third of a century, the costumes are dated, and most of the corporations referred to are long gone, matters not. If you have only just emerged from your shelter, see it NOW! If, like many, you have seen it dozens of times, see it AGAIN - when the restored version is released by Steven Spielberg later in the year 2001 in homage to the late, great Stanley Kubrik.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is 2001 about? Simple....directed panspermia (theintentional seeding/improvement of life forms on one planet byanother). POSSIBLE SPOILERS......DUH! Think about it, the main character (the monolith(s)) appears inthe first few minutes and is featured throughout the film and its'purpose is fairly obvious...to jump start homo sapiensevolutionary development and report their progress to itscreators. As homo sapiens reach critical points where they areready to achieve the next level they are helped there by thecreators. When Bowman reaches Jupiter, he is helped throughthe star gate (you can see the alien spacecraft escorting him) toanother dimension. There he is kept comfortably until he diesnaturally and the creators can take him to the next step inevolution, the star child. I admit, directed panspermia is an ideathat does not get much if any serious consideration by mostpeople although recent years have been an improvement with thehelp of the discovery of bacteria in martian meteorites on earth(non directed panspermia, accidental as opposed to intentional).There are other themes in the movie and to me, humans frustrating interaction with foolproof machinery (HAL9000) isperfectly summed up in the scenes beginning with "Hal, openthe pod bay doors, please". hehehe, I think of that every time Ihave to reboot my computer. Those that say the film is too longdisappoint me. When I am watching a fine movie I want more,not less. This was the first DVD I bought.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is one of my favorite pictures</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie that attempts to ask the question what is our destiny in the universe as humans. Along time ago we were apes. Now we reason, we are able to travel in space, we have built cities and societies, and we have created morals and religions. But still, we are imperfect. The source of human intelligence is depicted in the most surreal way one could imagine: as a single black box, a 'monolith'. The monolith affects humans in a unique way. First, apes learn how to create and use tools in the distant past . Second, a space traveler becomes a star child in the near future . We do not understand what a star child is but the message of is uplifting.There are a few details about the movie that are remarkable. The hero is called 'David Bowman'. 'David' makes a connection between the hero and the legendary king of Israel. The late Stanley Kubrick was Jewish, I think. 'Bowman' suggests that the hero stretches himself to the limits of his human abilities. HAL is depicted as a flashing red bulb that looks like a single red 'eye'. This draws a parallel between HAL and the one-eyed cyclops which Odysseus defeated in Homer's Odyssey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Film Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watch 2001. Don't rush to see it. Set aside a night to view it. Make sure that you are alone or with someone who is in as deep focus as you to watch it. If you watch the film uninterrupted, without speaking, without doing anything except watching 2001, and taking it all in, you will be changed by the end of the film. I've never been so petrified, not in the sense of being scared, of a movie, a film in all my life. The last half hour, pay attention to the last half hour especially. If there's no time in the movie that you don't speak it has to be the last half hour. A completely mind-boggling, hypnotic experience. The music playing within the last half hour of To Jupiter and Beyond, The Infinite, is scary. It is scary in how amazing it is. The music combined with the unworldly-like visuals will leave you, for lack of a better word, stunned. It's like your body is being transported into time travel, as if you are Keir Dullea at the part of which I speak.I don't know if this film can even be classified as a film. It is an experience, really. The key point to fully taking all of 2001 in is to pay attention without distractions. It's very important to view the film like this if you want the full effect. As I said before, don't rush to see it, but plan it, and look forward to it. It may change your life... and your view on cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those great films that can reveal something different upon every viewing. Since it doesn't have a traditional plot/narrative structure, the viewer is allowed to make their own interpretations of the film's events without feeling cheated or confused by what they've witnessed (like Lost Highway.)This masterpiece has appeared on virtually every critic's top ten all-time greatest film lists and it's not hard to see why. the set/ship design and especially the special-effects were way ahead of their time and set a precedent that is still being copied even today. The acting is appropriately stoic and fits in with the overall themes and metaphors in the film.This film along with Dr. Strangelove and A clockwork Orange, justifiably cemented Stanley Kubrick's reputation as one of the truly great directors and even if his later films couldn't match the quality set by this masterpiece, he was truly a visionary and brilliant director whose films will be studied and critiqued well into this century.rating:10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no doubt that the name Stanley Kubrick has already gone down as one of the most talented film makers that we have ever seen. I also believe that of all of his movies, 2001: A Space Odyssey is not only the finest film that Kubrick has made, but the finest film that I have watched to date. Of all the movies that I've seen, I have never seen so beautiful a film as this. It is a masterpiece. There have been other movies made that are also masterpieces in their own right, but none can quite compare to the assault that 2001 has on the senses. Right from the Overture at the very start of the film, to the star child at the end this movie is an all powerful piece that is like no other film that I have ever seen. Thirty years after this movie has been made, and there is still no other film that can compare. Over two hours long and virtually no dialogue. Few film makers are daring enough to make this kind of film, and even fewer are talented enough to make it work. Only Kubrick could make it this good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the greatest artistic achievement of this century</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not only is 2001: A Space Odyssey possibly the greatest film of the 20th Century, it may well be considered the greatest artistic achievement of this century as well. There has never been a film that has sparked the imagination quite like Kubrick's 1968 masterpiece. He used elements found in art house films up to the time he stared to direct 2001 and made them more commercial. 2001: A Space Odyssey is indeed a definitive mark in both film and science fiction, simultaneously reinforcing in the minds of the audience of what film is and rewriting the rules of filmmaking in general. In essence, Kubrick created a new standard of filmmaking found only within his own unorthodox approach. Some have criticized 2001, as being tedious, boring, dumb, etc. In reality, 2001, unlike most sci-fi before it, makes its own - less obvious - statement concerning Mankind's relationship with God and the Universe. The people of 2001 are just what their technology has made them. The apparent dullness of the future is only magnified by the way the humans interact with each other. One gets the sense that these people have reduced space travel to something that is uninteresting and, in fact, boring. This is necessary in order to show how the humans have become so much like the machines. That is why the relationship between the crew of the Discovery spacecraft and HAL 9000 is such an important part of the movie. This all culminates in the haunting final scenes which may show that despite mankind's successes with technology, man still has much to learn. It is no surprise that Kubrick's style of filmmaking is not as appealing as that of other directors. It's not supposed to. His films are intended to make the audience do one thing that many of today's modern films do not permit them to do, and that is think. As a result, Kubrick's style has resulted in one of the most loyal followings around one single director in this century.</fullReview>

I was 14, still measuring every movie I saw against the biggy: Star Wars. But this was a vision of OUR future... not in some galaxy far, far away but here.. 23 years away. I toyed with the idea that in the year 2001, maybe the movie on the PanAm flight to the space station would be, well, 2001.I at first had trouble following the story, after all, I was expecting the occasional laser blast, or the hideous appearance of the aliens, but I sat there captivated... not missing the expected action at all. I really felt for Bowman and Poole, and the isolation of the Discovery was tangible, and the sound of Bowmans breathing gave me the shivers.I got home, sat at my bedroom window and stared at the moon for hours.I have the movie at home, and recently saw it on the big screen (in a 70mm print, Dolby sound if you don't mind) and will be the first DVD I purchase.</fullReview>

So, in '93, I finally decided to see what all this "HAL" stuff was about.Well, HAL just turned out to be a minor character in the story. For it was the strange monolith in the film that kept me in amazement &amp; its purpose is the stuff that keeps me fascinated with films!Of course, theres a few slow moments in this film that drag on for quite a while,but It still has enough kick to keep you glued to the screen to see what will happen next.

		<fullReview>This is simply the most important science fiction film of all time. (Coming from a seventeen year old, I would think that that would be something of a shock).I watched this film as part of a unit my science fiction class in school was doing. Now, I had seen parts of it before, and honestly, I found it VERY boring. But I decided to look at it with an open mind this time. I'm glad I did.This film poses so many questions to the viewer and encourages you to expand your mind. I was so intrigued by it. The whole idea of the monolith, and the evolution of humanity. I was just so enthralled with the ideas presented.Granted, there are long stretches of boredom, such as the scene with the apes at the begining, as well as when the antenna was being fixed. The scene with the monkeys is very important, I now realize. It was meant to show evolution and how we came to get our most human tendancy-violence. The latter scene I believed was used to show to the viewer how laborious and deleberate space travel is really like.On top of the deep plot, the terrific special effects (for the time) as well as the INCREDIBLE music add to the atmosphere and bring out emotion.This is simply one of the greatest film ever made, period. Certainly better than Citizen Kane. Kubrick was a genius and I came to appreciate it more after seeing this film than any of his others. May the memory of this great director live on forever, well beyond 2001.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>hands down, the best sci-fi film ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some people have criticized 2001 because of its flat acting and lack of action. But think about it: isn't that the point being made here? Man, rather than being the masters of technology, have become its mere servants. In HAL the computer (and the most emotional "character" in this movie) we see technology gone awry--and controlling Man. The opening sequence, with huge and pristine spaceships slowly "dancing" in space, is beautiful, chilling--and telling. Kubrick's direction is pure genius. His trademark shadowless, white, "frozen" look dominates many scenes, most especially the last sequence after Bowman (strangely emotionless, and as a result, tragic) passes through the wormhole and enters a 16th century French bedroom where he "meets" himself as an old man, on his deathbed, and finally, is reborn into a higher realm. The ending is interpreted differently by different people, and asks more questions than it answers. The sequel "2010" attempts to "answer" the questions posed in 2001, and though it's a very good movie in its own right (far superior to the overrated comic-book epic "Star Wars" though I am sure many disagree), trying to "answer" the profound questions raised is a mistake since mere humans cannot answer questions so profound and universal without the result seeming anti-climactic and disappointing. Still the best science fiction movie ever made--and I do not use that term loosely, since most "science fiction" is mere action-adventure fantasy with overblown SFX. Slow-moving, with long silences and barely any dialogue (especially by the humans), it's not a movie for everyone--but for those who want to think and who appreciate cinema as art rather than just entertainment. A masterpiece that I doubt will ever be matched.</fullReview>

Kubrick have prove again that he is one of the best directors ever lived. no plot, no leading roles just pure images combined with sound makes it- pure art.we need more directors like Kubrick these days, because of the lack of quality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What the hell did I just watch?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm very confused right now. I definitely did not get what this movie is about. It certainly isn't just another space adventure movie. I'm not sure it would classify as sci-fi either. I see it more as a trip inside Kubrick's mind, perhaps? In any case, it is not necessarily the plot what matters more in this movie.This movie is definitely a visual masterpiece. It is truly amazing that Kubrick managed to pull out so many visual effects and tricks in 1968, and the spaceship scenes have nothing to envy to those of the latest space blockbuster. Many, many times they seemed a bit too slooow, but I'm guessing Kubrick did it on purpose to give a sense of the immensity of the cosmos. In any case, it is beautiful to see spaceships dancing a waltz, but shortening some scenes wouldn't have hurt. And then there's the prologue with the monkeys, which is a whole different story. Not only it takes twenty minutes to tell something it could have been told in much less, but it is also immensely puzzling. It definitely is there for a reason, I'm sure about it, but right now I can't seem to grasp its meaning. After finishing this review, I'll see what Internet has to say about it.And then there's the ending. Oh wow. I give this movie 8 stars, but the 8th star goes entirely to the final part: just before it I was thinking this movie deserved 7 stars. The landing on Jupiter is a wonderful example of the psychedelia of the 60s taken to a big screen. That sequence alone probably takes around ten minutes, but it is so enjoyable you don't even notice them. Then the very final scene is the most intriguing piece of cinema I remember right now. What does it mean? In what way is it related to the rest of the movie? I'm guessing Kubrick wanted the public to live the theatre with this questions unanswered. Thankfully, post-2001 viewers have the blessing of Internet, which I now turn to in the hope it clears up my doubts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thank you Stanley for the July 1969 moon landing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw 2001 Space Odyssey on the big screen either late 1968 or early 1969 (but I think it was early 1969). I was in a state of awe throughout the film! The realism or what I interpreted as 'real' was shocking, I had never seen anything like it on the big screen, it was beyond my realm of experience. I admit with candor I was in a state of shock, or perhaps awe, upon exiting the theater, I just didn't think a film like that possible! Then within a year we 'land' on the moon and I immediately thought Stanley made the murdered President Kennedy's dream a reality, it's the least this country could do after murdering him! I didn't believe we landed on the moon then nor do I believe it today. Stanley you were truly a genius! Many don't know this but 2001 pioneered the use of front projection with retro-reflective matting with Stanley frequently behind the camera. Another little know fact is that Rock Hudson walked out of the viewing annoyed because he didn't understand what he was watching I on the other hand was transfixed throughout!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey" and I have no words to describe this excellent masterpiece. In this movie there are fantastic pictures full of esthetics and elegance. There are few words spoken, but the music in background is in some moments simply enough. Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece is an artwork consisting of a few parts, which are isolated from each other but nevertheless belonging together. In the end of "2001: A Space Odyssey" there are many questions the viewer have, but they don't will be answered. Thats why every viewer have to think on his own about what he saw. You can interpret whatever you want to and nobody can say your interpretation is wrong or right, because of the film doesn't tell you what is right or what is wrong. I only can say that I love this movie and it is one of my absolutely favourite movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>PhenomenHAL</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last night I saw 2001: A Space Odyssey for the very first time. I don't know what has put me off seeking it out for all these years. Perhaps it's because I'm not a big sci-fi fan, however I am a Stanley Kubrick fan. I particularly adore The Shining and love the way Stanley Kubrick soaks up a hypnotic atmosphere so that the film becomes an experience. After seeing some clips on the strange documentary, Room 237, I thought that the film looked right up my alley! I've also heard nothing but hype for years with people calling it one of the greatest films ever made, so I was extremely excited when I sat down to watch it.Unfortunately watching it, for me, was a little bit like sex. You want the first time to be the best, but in honesty, the more you do it, the better it gets. I had a banging headache throughout the first half and so really could not appreciate the loud music and atonal sounds because it was just so painful! Halfway through, I had to leave and get myself a Tesco headache pill and towards the end of the film it did go away. I also left to go to the loo about three times, as I had a lot of coffee to drink so that I'd have the stamina to stay up and also to sober myself up.Why am I telling you this? Well, I don't know. I think to get the full 2001 effect, you need to completely immerse yourself in it, but I struggled to do this. However, that doesn't mean that I didn't appreciate what I saw. In fact, I'm pretty sure that what I saw was an absolute masterpiece. I was completely sucked in, right from the beginning where sinister music played for about five minutes over a blank screen. It's such an unusual way to open, hinting that the film you're about to see isn't your usual rip-roaring science fiction adventure. We then get that glorious famous music with a beautiful image of a sun rising over the Earth. It's an amazing title sequence which made the hairs on my neck stand on end.I think it's a stroke of genius having the first scene, in a film which is largely set in the future, be set at the beginning of time itself. It must have been so jarring for audiences in 1968, of course everyone knows that the film starts with the monkeys now because it's so widely talked about. Speaking of the year in which it came out, I cannot believe that this film was made in the 60's! I saw it in blu-ray and it looked like a film which had came out last week. It's easy to see why it so disliked when it first came out, because it's just so ahead of its time. Although, some of the monkey suits did look a bit naff!We're then thrown into the year 2001, where (apparently) space travel is an everyday thing and stewardesses wear bright pink clothes complete with a strange bubble hat. To be quite honest with you, the remainder of the film is very difficult to put into words. It's pure art in the form of film. It's a rarity these days, however people like David Lynch and Nicolas Winding Refn are striving to keep it alive. There are long sequences of spaceships flying overhead to classical music and people walking slowly upside down. It all creates a certain feeling and experience which you have to see for yourself.2001: A Space Odyssey doesn't really have much of a plot. Astronauts find a strange giant tablet on the moon, and then some more astronauts go on a mission which I don't entirely understand the purpose of, with a creepy robot called, HAL, which is of course now an iconic character. It's strange because a lot of the film is incredibly slow and, dare I say it, boring. But there's something about it which keeps you interested and locked to the screen. Scenes which would last five minutes in an ordinary Hollywood film, last up to half an hour here and it does create a unique and immersive experience which stays on your subconscious for a while.A lot of the film is very haunting. The choral chants whenever the strange black tablet appeared created a wonderful atmosphere of mystery and impending doom. I also found the scene where HAL sings, very creepy. Of course, the most talked about scene is the Lynchian finale where we're plunged into a psychedelic and hypnotic fantasy world. The final scene makes absolutely no sense, but it most definitely haunts you. I couldn't help but have chills all the way up my spine when the music plays and the baby looks right towards you. It's scary and very powerful.I think subsequent viewings are going to make 2001 a definite favourite of mine. It's unlike anything I've ever seen before. After seeing this now, I find it strange how people are comparing it to Interstellar. Interstellar is a somewhat conventional and fast-paced sci-fi adventure, albeit an absolutely astounding one! Whereas, 2001: A Space Odyssey is a slow art film. They're impossible to compare! Both of them are masterpieces in their own right though. It's a film which will definitely stay with me, and I look forward to plunging myself into its world again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually Stunning, But Perhaps Overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Humanity finds a mysterious, obviously artificial, object buried beneath the Lunar surface and, with the intelligent computer H.A.L. 9000, sets off on a quest.Saying that "2001" is overrated is the sort of statement that can bring down hatred and vitriol from science fiction fans, Kubrick fans and more. Of course, it is possible to be a Kubrick fan and still generally dislike this film.Nobody can deny that this film is visually stunning, and a landmark in imagery. It also has the advantage of being the last film about space travel to be released before the moon landing, making it somewhat prescient in a way.But yet, does it need to be so long, so grand, with the music and long shots? Perhaps not quite "pretentious", but the film presents itself as being more important than it really is. Critics at the time (1968) denounced the film, and perhaps they were right. At the very least, two cuts could be made: a longer one for die-hard fans, and a shorter one for casual viewers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quietly loud message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best sci-fi films explore human nature, not just technology advancement. 2001: a Space Odyssey expertly shows the human need to interpret our world. The film warns us to be cautious about advancing and makes us say, "Maybe we should slow down. After all, humans can be frighteningly stupid." Instead of screaming the message, Kubrick uses a long, long quiet that makes us uncomfortable. We are smart enough to know we're going too fast in our pursuit of change, but we like the idea of new; we want to know what's next. But if there's constant change, there's no time to reflect and measure the worth of change. We humans are uncomfortable with too much quiet because our nature is the need to advance, to change, to make noise. This movie makes you wonder--during all that quiet--if change is actually good for us. Watch this film to be reminded that no matter how much we evolve in technology, we need to constantly look at who we have become. And that's where it gets uncomfortable, because while we recognize that we must get better, being human means we won't be without flaws.</fullReview>

But then I grew up,gave it another try and to my great surprise,was absolutely mesmerized and left in a beautiful daze,similar to what I imagine a religious experience to be.I am an artist and deep fan of movies,they have changed my life in so many ways on so many levels,but none more so than this flick,Kubrick's masterwork,my favorite film and my favorite piece of art,period. And art it is,beyond doubt,like the Mona Lisa's smile,there is something beyond at work here,it may take a little longer to find it,but when you do,it's so worth it. So,really this is less about the film and more about those that view it,there is room for every kind of taste ( except for liking Transformers or Adam Sandler movies,that should be a crime), and mine and many others leads us down a more thoughtful,less action packed road,I'm not so sure what is so pretentious about that. I like Hitchcock,Herzog,Scott,Nolan,Refn,Spielberg,comic book and scary movies,all kinds of flicks,but I don't require it all to be explained,handed to me on a plate,in a quick fashion for it to be any good,I enjoy thinking,it's part of the fun.</fullReview>

Film begins when humans were still apes, and how, when one of them touches a huge, mysterious monolith, he is pushed forward in evolution, and uses an old bone as a tool(to smash and kill of course...) Thousands of years later, man is now on the moon, and another monolith is uncovered, inspiring a spaceship crew to investigate, causing the on board ship computer HAL9000 to malfunction(sensing the oncoming next evolution it cannot experience?) One astronaut enters the monolith, and he(and the viewer) see an astonishing, even overwhelming assault on the senses that leads to...Well, for those who haven't seen it, no spoilers, but just consider how a "star child" fits in at the end...

		<shortDescription>A exploration of time and space, and mans insignificant part in it all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lifeless corpse of a film that masquerades itself as one of the greatest SCI FI films of all time, to some poor unlighted individuals that clearly haven't seen planet of the apes (the original of course ? remakes are just the sound of Hollywood's brain cells dying) Sometimes in life reputations exceeds reality, and this is none more true than Stanley Kubrick's a space odyssey. Before watching it I was expecting a symphony of cinematic perfection, but unfortunately it did not live up to the hype and hope of my expectations at all! If for some random reason I had a time machine, do you the first thing I would do? No not go back in time and invest in apple and Microsoft, or back in time and warn my younger self not to be a reading fan, unless I wanted to be miserable and constantly heartbroken, but instead to be a glory hunter like most of my friends and just support Manchester United, but instead I would go back in time and un-watch 2001. There are two completely different films within one. The first is an uneventful first 1 and a half hours, full of mundane, over drawn scenes that contribute very little to the tempo of the film, or don't help move the narrative forward. As the film starts off with two conflicting groups' of prehistoric man learning to hunt, until one of the two groups learns to use tools and conquers the other. Then we are propelled into the future when man has perfected space travel, the two events only connected by the appearance of a large slab known as the monolith. But it's not all bad; every cloud has a silver lining. As the second half and particularly the third act is roller-coaster of some thrills, excitement and mystery. *SPOILER*As man venture to the planet Jupiter, aided by the supposedly infallible Hal 9000 the most advance computer man has ever created, but after a malfunction, it goes crazy and upon hearing that the two remaining astronauts - Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood, to not be placed into suspended animation, wants to terminate Hal, due to an error. It then out of fear, attempts to kill every person on board the ship. *SPOILER* The final act is a strange scene, where the one of the astronauts spends the rest of his time in a large room, only to die and to be reborn into a gigantic space baby. But despite a better second half the film still lacks. As the popular saying goes "A team is only as strong as its weakest member" so in this case, despite the film picking up in the second portion, it stills wasn't good enough to off seat the mind numbing beginning. But on the other hand the film is blessed with the most beautiful and mesmerising sound track I have ever heard, that is quite possibly the greatest collections of music in one single film that complements it perfectly. With scores I never knew the origins of but where a staple of everyday life, I was completely unaware that they came from odyssey. It also use of special effects and set designs, far ahead of its time, putting shame to some of today's uninspiring use of poorly created CGI. So from a technical view point it's a phenomenal fleet by Kubrick, but the story still lacks, it raises more questions than it answers, sometimes it works and they say art is subjective but it just didn't work for me in this case.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meanwhile, 2001 Minutes Later?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think Lex Luthor said it best: "Some people can read War and Peace and come away thinking it's a simple adventure story. Others can read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and unlock the secrets of the universe." I'm part of the first example there, while most find 2001: A Space Odyssey a masterpiece in filmmaking. And no doubt whatsoever: the cinematography, score and way-ahead-of-its-time space adventure is perfect. I will stand behind that statement throughout this review. But, sadly, those are the only positives I could come up with for this incredibly long and simple film.Before I continue, I must warn: this contains spoilers. I say this, because, as of tonight, April 24, 2013, I had never viewed 2001: A Space Odyssey before and I attempted to avoid as many spoilers as possible. So, if you haven't yet experienced this, watch at your own risk and then continue.Previously, I proclaimed that "I attempted to avoid as many spoilers as possible." Sadly, with a movie that has been talked about, researched and inspired countless of ideas/movies over the decades, it's hard to not view some of the key scenes, listen to the wall-played classical-music score or learn of the film's characters (HAL 9000, anyone?) Well, nothing I've seen, heard or learned prepared me for the absolute?slowest?movie?I?have?EVER SEEN.The movie begins in darkness, for a few minutes. Sure, I heard music, but nothing on the screen. Quite literally, I thought my BluRay disc was damaged.(Oh, sorry. Backing up a bit: Since I've never seen this before and it's deemed a "classic," why not watch it for the first time on the excellent BluRay format? That, however, wasn't my first intention, actually. I wanted to purchase The Shining on BluRay, but after pricing the disc, I found, for just a few dollars more, there was a triple feature of The Shining, 2001: A Space Odyssey and A Clockwork Orange. I've already seen numbers one and three, but heck, why not experience my initial reaction to 2001: A Space Odyssey on BluRay? Purchase: made.)Just when I was about to give up, the infamous primate scene emerged. Well, okay, not quite yet. Enter in many landscaping scenes and then about 20 minutes of zero dialogue and primates eating, drinking and eventually enamored by a good sized monolith, or black rectangular prism. Many years later, Wall-E would attempt the same feat with its opening act without a shred of dialogue. Pixar was much more successful in keeping my interest.I digress. Fast-forwarding to (oh, what year was this based in, again?) the "far-distant future" while retaining the styles and dialogue of the 1960s, doctors embark on a mission of wonder of said monolith (now, ??) on the moon. Without explaining too much and opening up way too many doors, we will fast-forward again, but now, on a mission of wonder to Juniper. Only this time, we, well, 1960s American Audiences, get their first taste of later-down-the-road Android Ash from Alien. Apparently, after a communication breakdown ? literally, HAL/ASH must complete the mission even when the humans are wiser to him.This should make me laugh, but like the opening 2-3 minutes of nothing, the movie chose to keep in the merciful INTERMISSION the audience was blessed with back in 1968. And I almost did laugh, thinking this snail-moving movie needed one. But, after a few minutes, I was tempted to fast-forward myself?something I never do while watching movies for the first time. Finally, what followed turned out to the most acid-tripped and psychedelic third act I've ever seen.Now, I didn't necessarily rate down the movie for the, what we call today: a cheap screensaver, because these are aliens and in their minds back then, anything's possible. But, what followed proves to me: Director Kubrick was on drugs. He had to have been. Truly.If you do travel down this hallucinatory journey, you'll see what I saw, or what I couldn't believe any more if Godzilla miraculously had showed up and explained, in English, verses his native Japanese tongue, what the last third of this movie meant.I fully understand where this movie was coming from and the year it was released, but what I couldn't get past were some basic and major flaws:A&gt; Computer program HAL 9000 controlled the entire ship, and even the vessel to kill one of the men who wanted to shut him down?but couldn't control the second shuttle when another man wanted to rescue the obviously dead astronaut? Or, further, he failed to control the temperature, pressure or live-support when said "hero" returns to the ship and goes to deactivate the deadly computer program?B&gt; People of Earth, or higher-ups, that is, wanted to make first contact with the alien race that "faced" Jupiter's planet from Earth's moon. So, they programmed HAL 9000 to make sure the ship got there. The first sign of trouble was a transmission breakdown and HAL 9000 thought best to let it fail with "hopes" of fixing it later. If the higher-ups wanted to both explore the alien race and document it, wouldn't it be a top priority be to keep the communication up and running?C&gt; Since I've never been to space, nor plan to, it's hard to prove this is a flaw: when one character decides to venture into the vacuum of space without adequate protection, albeit briefly, he's perfectly fine. Even though, I GUESS this could work, it was hard to get past and take the rest of the movie seriously.The movie's based on a short story, and it shows. It's an extremely thin plot stretched to the max. While I appreciate the scope of this project, especially the timeframe of release, I do not believe it holds up today. I'm glad it inspired numerous other projects, because it takes one good idea to make the future better.</fullReview>

It's the ultimate trip alright.just watched 2001: A Space Odyssey for the first time, and when it ended i was like ?- wow. O_O?? yes with big blank round eyes staring at the screen.. not moving?..it was a visceral cinematic total mindfuck experience. That's the best way i could describe it.I felt intrigued, hypnotized, enraptured, puzzled, confused?. i felt like i was floating in nothingness?. i felt it's too slow, but then, like a roller coaster it plummets down and superspeeds forward, up, and down again and gives me this thrill that all i could do is let my mind go blank and just enjoy the feeling my other senses tells me to feel.While this film had the potential to be a great bore, at some point I was asking myself "omg. Should I be bored now or give this film a few more minutes?"?. But even before i manage to actually be bored, Kubrick pulls me right back in. There's just something about this movie that's surreal. It has a distinct flavor that keeps your eyes glued and your mind focused. The set, the visual effects, HAL, the space suits which i think are super cool! everything. It reels you in. Makes you think. And when it's in those slow scenes where u see nothing but space or colors or whatever ? it puts you in a state of trance. So yeah, i forgot to be bored. I was hypnotized. Even the Intermission part I was like O_O (Still in a trance)?. This movie is imaginative and creative than most modern movies I've seen. It's ahead of it's time. It's so big that you're mind is blown and you fail to readily grasp the whole idea of the film. And that's a rare quality in movies. To give you that feeling that you have just experienced something unforgettable and would continue to think about it even after the credits has rolled.In the end i was satisfied. It was a cerebral experience more than anything. It was indeed a space odyssey. A journey.. not that zing zing of light sabers or alien dominating the earth crap ? those are fun, yes, but this movie is a rare gem, and well worth watching no matter what era we are in now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If it were 15 minutes long, I'd still be disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right off the bat let's get that "this movie is long and boring" argument out of our way, because that's not what is wrong about this movie, at all. I have no problem with a film dragging on, as long as the wait is worth it. There's another draggy film, Tarkovsky's Stalker, which I've watched thrice, and am planning on watching again in a few days. If anything, the length could be annoying (at most), but by no means a good reason to give this a 1 star. Another big thing that is said about this movie is its visual effects. I don't mind those either, no matter how good or bad they are, I only care about what is being portrayed. Other mild annoyances like occasional loud noises or 'eye twitching scenes' that to some people seemed like a crime against humanity I also completely ignored.So, now that I peeled off the most superfluous layers of nonsense, let's get to the core of things. Just what, exactly, is wrong about this film? Well everything, really. Everything except for HAL. Plot, dialog, acting, character development, direction, ending, underlying message, all of those contributed to my disappointment, so let's go in order. There is nothing inherently wrong about the plot, except that it felt like it was skimmed beyond recognition. There were plenty of parts that could have been filled with intricacies or explored in a deeper manner, such as the moon city (or whatever that was), the hibernating crew, the meeting scene, and some others I don't want to spoil. Instead, we were given merely the hint that there was something deeper and much more complex that wasn't being depicted because the director was too busy showing off his space ballet and spotless installations. The dialog was one of the most stale and uninteresting in cinema history, not a single memorable line was spoken here, and the soulless actors didn't help matters either. You'd think you'd get to see at least a subtle reaction from Dave in that one scene about the helmet, but you'd be wrong. The character development is also nonexistent; everyone's so shallow that you could switch their places around and it wouldn't make the smallest difference. Could you do that in a movie like Twelve Angry Men? BenHur? Pulp Fiction? Damn right you can't! The way the director tries to get to the audience is also laughable, in a sad way. Instead of recurring to actual talent and paying attention to all the important details, he relies almost entirely on his visual gimmicks and rotatory scenery. I wasn't transported into space with this film, it didn't make me wonder about its vastness and emptiness (not even with that one scene with frank), or -seeing it from our time- feel like I wished that's how things should have been at the turn of the millennium, the course of mankind, etc. All I saw was your typical World's Fair Futurama. Now the ending, I'm not going to spoil it, but I will tell you that if you were expecting something original and mind blowing, then you'd be as disappointed as me. If you know the musical piece that plays when the ape is swinging his bone, and you know the book which it is named after, and you've read that book, then some people may say that you'll see what the ending is all about. But quite frankly, that is by far the most blatant overstatement you're going to hear about this film. After watching it I learned that this is actually based off a book, and that made me realize that the ending I saw was just a shell, the carcass of an actual mind blowing ending that I'm looking forward to read some day. Though the one in this film, it really can't stand on its own (come to think of it, Stalker was also based off a book, and the ending was still supreme). The words that crossed through my head when I saw this movie end were literary these: "You have GOT to be kidding me" because I just couldn't believe how pretentious some people could get, without having anything to actually boast about. Finally, for the underlying message, I'm just glad I'm not going to make this paragraph any longer, since there is none. The obvious message is right there for you to see, underneath it there is nothing (since apparently it's not worth exploring), and anyone who says otherwise I'll direct to the 'Black Square' review.As a final note I'd like to point out why this wasn't a 1 star. If I didn't make it clear earlier, it was HAL. All those 5 stars go to HAL, and it pains me that I couldn't give it 10. Everything bad I just said about this film does not, in any way, apply to HAL, not even the part where I called everyone soulless. The 9000 series is simply the most interesting concept of this movie -it's what made the WHOLE movie. Just think about it, without it, there would be absolutely nothing of worth to watch here. I've never seen a more iconic 'character' in my life, and now I know why HAL is so referenced and emulated throughout many mediums of our culture. The (quick) chess scene caused a great impact on me, being a retired chess player myself. I could just feel HAL's arrogance emanating from the screen at that moment, and he only had to say a few words but they got to me. The news reporter guy was merely echoing my thoughts when he commented on HAL's pride. So why couldn't the director drag on this scene instead of all the other nonsense? It could have been fantastic if done right. As a matter of fact, none of my above complaints about this movie are as dead serious and from the bottom of my heart as this one: there was not enough HAL, period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie I just can't appreciate. No matter how hard I try.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people have told me that this is the greatest or one of the greatest movies ever made. No. I thought maybe my expectations deviated too far from what actually happened in the film, because at the end of watching it the first time, I was utterly confused. I watched it again, this time with a better context for what was happening, especially in the last 20-25 minutes, and it makes sense, but I still don't like the movie anywhere near the intensity of the collective reviewers of IMDb. I like when information is inferred and the narrative isn't told to you in exposition. The visuals and sound in this film are absolutely fantastic, there is no doubt about that. The entire segment with HAL was excellent, I really liked that bit of the movie, but I thought the movie was too long and ends in a manner so baffling that a second viewing and additional context is almost mandatory. In the end, 2001 has some absolutely great moments, and is not by any means a bad movie, but one word keeps coming to my mind when I view this movie, and that word is pretentious. I do not use that word lightly when describing films. I know that this opinion is in the minority, and for anyone who absolutely loves this film, kudos. You enjoy it. Maybe I just don't 'get it' and am too shallow of a movie-goer to truly appreciate the greatest movie ever made. Or maybe it is just that 2001 is not my flavor of Kubrick, and Dr. Strangelove is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So odd i want to write my 1st IMDb review for it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think i haven't seen a more monotonous film than this one. I have watched and understood the most popular movies(at least i think i understand) but not this, this plot is really stupid (if it isn't stupid, i must be, lol). I mean this isn't a part 2, so why make a part1 that even 1% of population will not get what its trying to say. But the masses are just as stupid, thinking they totally understand art and creativity even if its new, who are willing to appreciate anything if it is considered art and is odd, with lots of money involved. People who will treasure and make a fuzz over a poop, if it is hangable on the wall.If u ever love this film, i must tell u, do u really enjoy watching this film? If u give it a 10star, are u willing to watch it at least thrice? Just be truthful to urself, this ''Aaa, what a magnificent, brilliant, and genius idea/art/picture'' over trivial stuff is just nonsense.I get to see what the story is about only when i read IMDb Storyline, lol. Oh, And the black cuboid scenes looks like horror film, i bet many pussies will be scared.To wrap it up, i think: Vizuals is good especially for 60s/ Sound is normal/ Acting is normal/ Dialogue is poor/ Plot is good/ and the most imp, Presentaion is DISGUSTING.A completely boring, nonsense, strange and stupid film. But I wud still give it 5/10 coz odd movies are nice to watch once in a while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Science Fiction Film Of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Along with "Psycho", "The Godfather", and "Vertigo", "2001: A Space Odyssey' is one of a select few films that define my love of cinema. It is a motion picture that is far more unique than any first time viewer can imagine. It has little dialog, the acting is poor, and the film instead relies on breathtaking visuals and classical music to hypnotize the viewer. And the first time I saw "2001", that simply didn't cut it. But on second viewing, I realized that I simply couldn't have been more wrong. Because this time, for some reason, I was totally engrossed by the film, by the visionary directing, by the cold calculations of HAL 9000. And it was then that I realized, the only way for something like that to occur, was that "2001: A Space Odyssey" had to be a work of genius.And as to the common accusations of "wooden acting"? Simply a major point that the film is trying to make. In his final days, man has developed his tools (HAL) to the point that they are more human than man itself. But I won't bore the reader with my own interpretations of this colossal masterpiece. As Kubrick once said, we are all free to speculate "2001"'s meaning, so what are you waiting for? Let your own journey to the stars begin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Notwithstanding Kubrick's status as a legendary director and the film's reputation as a visionary achievement of the genre, I find myself pretty much right in the middle on this picture. For 1968, there is no doubt that '2001' set some high bars for sci-fi in film, but watching today with the passage of four decades, there is a lot that works against it's being the monumental must see that it was when first released. I'm thinking about the extended opening with the ape tribes, and the long psychedelic sequence near the finale that certainly wowed audiences back in the day. Sure, I get it, the picture was portraying one man's interpretation of the evolutionary stages of man, but there's a lot to sit through to get to the point.The best part of the picture for me was the confrontation between HAL and Dr. Bowman (Keir Dullea), but even there, I find myself with some conflicting ideas about what happened in the story, on two points. For one, I find it difficult to believe that enlightened computer programmers of the future would have given HAL the ability to violate an essential code of human conduct, to commit murder in the interest of self preservation. A machine does not have priority over humanity. Secondly, HAL should have recognized this flaw in his programming, and acted to either repair it or terminate his own existence. William Shatner actually talked a few of his computer adversaries into committing suicide in a handful of Star Trek episodes when it appeared they were going out of control. Those stories also came out in the late 1960's and played out to a much more logical conclusion than having HAL stand his ground only to be terminated by Dave's back door sabotage.Even with my misgivings though, I can say that my appreciation for the picture has grown with repeated viewings, and I will wind up watching it again as time goes by. However I don't expect something to click in a way that makes me see it as the kind of masterpiece many give it credit for. That rocket has left the launchpad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Homer's Odyssey vs. Kubrick's Odyssey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Words can't do this film justice so I will skip the hyperbole about its brilliance. Reading the reviews on IMDb I've been drawn to a number of illuminating details, and would like to share something that I've noticed but not yet read in a peer review: the nomenclature of the film itself and one of its characters.If '2001: A Space Odyssey' is in part a nod to Homer's Odyssey then the name of Dave Bowman becomes interesting. At the end of Homer's epic poem Odysseus returns to Ithaca in disguise, and proves his worth to his unwitting wife Penelope by besting her suitors in an archery contest. Literally, he is the "bow-man".That's not all. Earlier on in the tale Odysseus blinds the cyclops Polyphemus, causing the monster to shout, "No man is killing me" - "No man" being the false name that Odysseus initially gave him. Odysseus's most celebrated quality among his people was his "metis", or "cunning intelligence" - a quality that Dr. Bowman (or "No man") proves in his victorious battle with the cyclops HAL.An interesting link.I'd also like to respond to a couple of commentators here who see this section of the movie as a mere tangent to the storyline. I disagree; I think this section ties neatly with the Dawn Of Man episode, in that the central character progresses to the next stage of its evolution through the act of killing - not for pleasure or gain, but for survival. Like the groups of apes, like Polyphemus and Odysseus, HAL and Dave are locked in a battle for life itself, surrounded by a vast arid wasteland, and only two outcomes are possible: evolution or oblivion.This ambivalent attitude to violence, which borders on tacit approval, is an interesting quality of the film.I'd like to say one final thing. The appearance of the "Star Child" is the single most phenomenal thing I have ever seen on film, and it's a testament to Kubrick's brilliance that he produced an ending that so defied the expectations of everyone (even his co-writer!) that each viewer has been forced to think about what this ending, this movie, and this subjective existence means to them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Symphony of Evolution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Today I saw 2001: A Space Odyssey for the second time and therefore decided to write a little essay-like review. There seems to be three kinds of people with regards to 2001; people who bash the film for being boring and slow-paced, people who praise it as a masterpiece and the greatest science-fiction ever made and people who are somewhere in between. It's a film about futurology, evolution and the cycle of life. It deals with the progression of man when he faces the unknown and creates new devices to research it. Kubrick had collected an enormous amount of knowledge of past and presence to create the perfect illusion of future.2001: A Space Odyssey is built on traditional conventions and dramaturgical structure. It's divided into three acts, as most films are, and it follows an usual pattern. But in the name of thematics Kubrick had abandoned the conventional plot. But the film is not an eternal riddle that can't be solved. The biggest reason why the film comes across with such criticism is because people see it on lists of 'the best science fictions' and so on. People don't know what they are about to see and after being brainwashed by mindless modern Hollywood; don't understand a thing. There still are much more trickier philosophical science-fictions out there, for instance, Andrei Tarkovsky's masterpieces Solaris and Stalker -- which I warmly recommend. Especially Solaris has been compared with 2001 dozens of times. If western science-fiction, which Kubrick here represents, researches the physical boundaries of man and mankind; eastern sci-fi researches mental limits -- Tarkovsky studies a situation where man should act humanely under inhumane circumstances.The first act starts with a prologue sequence where prehistoric men, apes, live and try to survive -- the dawn of man. There's a huge leap of time taken from the first part to the second; from four million years ago earlier to the year of 2001. But then the leap from act two to act three isn't so far at all - 18 months. This seems to reinforce the idea that Kubrick wasn't interested in time, ironically in a film about progression, but in state, 'mise-en-scene' and space -- and, for Kubrick, film is much more of a visual form of art than a narrative.One statement of the film is that man is still the same which is told to us through the three part structure. In the beginning -- the dawn of man -- an ape found a bone of another animal and learned to use it as a weapon. Then we go through this brilliant shift to the year of 2001 where man has created technical devices with his superior brain that at the same enslave him, and this cycle culminates to the rebirth. This three part structure is experienced again, in the end, when the man travels forward in time. He sees images of him going through the cycle of life; he gets older, dies and is born again. The rebirth, the final image of the fetus, is powerful and spellbinding. It makes the cycle of life perfect. The baby is its own world, its own reality and it is ready to learn, progress and research -- looking down on Earth and us.2001: A Space Odyssey consists of nothing but images of the spaceship, with the exception of the first sequence. The cold, white steel walls, the blue shades and chambers of the spaceship represent inhumanity of man. One particular scene is a good example of this, science and technology turning man into an inhumane creature, where the man gets a birthday video message from his parents. He doesn't care to reply, just asks the computer system HAL to lift up his seat, and when HAL wishes him a happy birthday he instantly replies "thank you." Techonology has become man's best friend and all humane relations have disappeared - another clue can be found from the laconic conversations between the spacemen.It's also a film of contrasts; cold steel and the warm ground of the prologue, the humming sounds of the spaceship and the distressing silence of outer space, the blue shades and the blue color which is all around the ship; the only dose of red, love and warmth, seems to be coming from the computer system HAL. In the surrealist sequence also the complementary colors of blue and red meet each other; the mountains and the gorges. In the spaceship the crew eats food through a pipe but, in the end, in the Rococo room the man eats a normal meal -- on a plate. Man has went back to the old times: Rococo furniture, paintings and the food. But is still the same.The monolith has occurred a great deal of discussion and will do so in the future as well. It's clearly the motive of the film and collects symbolic meaning to itself as time goes by. First in the dawn of man it is an unknown object which the apes research with great fascination. In 2001 it once again appears just as unknown to the man as it did to their prehistoric grandfathers. They research it and discover that it is a new, and the first, artifact to be found by man from outer space. Towards the end, where the film starts turning into surrealism, the monolith floats in space -- far away from the hands of man. For once more it appears in the Rococo room where the man sees images of his life. It's in front of the man's bed as he tries to reach it, but can't. The monolith; the unknown is so far away and unreachable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Epic in Scope, Visually Stunning, and a Bit of a Rough Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've watched Stanley Kubrick's epic science fiction film for the first time within the last few days, and it certainly gets into your mind and sticks. I've found myself thinking about it often, pondering over the subtext of the film and seeing what conclusions I come to. Kubrick has created an abstract film where each viewer is left to their own devices to find meaning. It begins in the past, as an extraterrestrial monolith spurs our man-ape ancestors to use their first tool/weapon. Thousands of years later, as man begins exploration of the lunar surface, a second monolith is discovered. It beams a powerful radio signal to Jupiter, leading to the next phase of man's interstellar journey. A mission of the utmost secrecy is dispatched to Jupiter. Two astronauts (Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood) attend to the ship's operations with the assistance of the advanced AI, HAL 9000 (voiced by Douglas Rain), with three scientists in hibernation. Complications arise when HAL, who appears to have evolved enough sentience to feel emotion, becomes paranoid of the astronauts intentions and turns on them. Those who complete the mission will be catapulted into the next stage of evolution.I've gone years hearing about how epic Kubrick's film was. I'd tried watching it once as a child, gotten about ten minutes into the "Dawn of Man" sequence, and given up. It's certainly a rough watch for those with shortened attention spans. Kubrick fills his science fiction opera with long-winded scenes of slow-moving space vehicles drifting through their operations while classical music tinkers in the background. The dialogue is minimal and, with the exception of the Jupiter mission sequence with HAL and the astronauts, serves little purpose except to set the stage for the journey being undertaken. This isn't a commercial film meant to appeal to the masses. Kubrick has done what few others have successfully accomplished: used the film medium to create a piece of art. Images and music come together to tell a story of mankind's evolution and where it might eventually lead. The story is hardly the traditional three-act structure audiences are accustomed to, and the characters are barely developed. That's because it's not the characters that are important here, it's the human race as a whole and a vision of our next phase in the universe. The characters are merely tools in the story, and don't really carry it themselves.It's a trippy experience and I'm not so bold as to claim I fully understand it. The entire final act of the film is a fantastic mind-trip of color, sound, and psychedelic visuals leading to an odd conclusion in a glorious bedroom setting. I hope to avoid spilling too many details and urge those who are curious to watch it themselves, not that my descriptions will make the end any more clearer. Kubrick has stated that each audience member is to draw their own meaning from the film and I see it as being that humans must transcend their reliance on technology to achieve the next stage of evolution. The astronauts' confrontation with the similarly-evolved HAL 9000 seems to act as a final challenge to overcome this dependency, as well as their near-equal in evolutionary terms. The entire HAL sequence is my favorite part of the film and will probably remain one of the most memorable movie sequences ever (particularly the last bit as HAL sings "Daisy"...it's so haunting...). As much as I want to share this film experience with friends, I'm aware it's not for everyone. Even with my intense interest in the film, I had a hard time sitting through some of the drawn-out sequences and the 2.5 hour run-time is pretty daunting. If you can manage it, it's worth watching because it can make for some fantastic conversation with other fans when it's all said and done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Take a stress pill and think things over"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since its release in 1968, this has been a movie which divides its audience into lovers and haters. Sometimes (often?), those who love it will dismiss those who hate it as simply "not getting it". This attitude is not only snobbish, it maybe even misses the point of the picture. 2001: A Space Odyssey is not really a picture that one must "get". Its plot is not exactly labyrinthine, and while its meaning is obscure it is deliberately so, as Kubrick himself shied away from being philosophically explicit. In other words, if someone tells you they know what Kubrick was trying to say with the movie, they are wrong.So what exactly is the problem then? Contrary to what some might assume, it is not the slow pace of the picture that I find alienating. Certainly there are dozens of pictures with faster paces and shorter runtimes that I find far more boring because they are unconvincing, too wordy or just generally poorly executed. In fact it is the methodical pacing that gives Space Odyssey many of its best points. Take the early scenes with the apes - not a shot is wasted there. It is in fact an extremely efficient summary of the brutal and dangerous lives of these creatures, all told with an atmospheric quietness, building up to the eeriness of the monolith's appearance and the stylised bone-smashing scene. The following spaceship sequence, "choreographed" to the Blue Danube waltz is graceful, balletic and quite beautiful to behold. Later, the scenes with HAL and Keir Dullea become a kind of space horror, with the long shots and mechanical noises adding to the creepiness. There's also great tension built up by having the scenes of Dullea trying to get back on board through the airlock played out in painstaking real-time. And it is the achingly slow process of HAL being shut down that helps to make it such an intensely poignant sequence.So 2001: A Space Odyssey is, for the most part, an expertly rhythmic motion picture, and from its rhythm comes its power and its emotion. Where the problem comes, and I think the point where most of the audience is lost, is in the final act. When we are sitting through a ten minutes of lights zooming past, colour-filtered landscapes, and weird avant-jazz noises, the picture has lost its sense of aesthetic beauty, and gone into the realms of artistic pretension. No-one can really enjoy this sequence. Some might claim to "appreciate" it, and yet it is clearly a tonal piece with little actual meaning, so there is nothing really intellectually pleasing about it either.I have to admit though, a lot of my dislike for this picture is only relative to the adulation lavished upon it by its fans. It irks me that the match-cut with the bone and the spaceship is so widely applauded, when there is an almost identical (and far neater) cut in the Powell and Pressburger picture A Canterbury Tale, and besides there are better (but more subtle) match-cuts in Space Odyssey, such as the one from the monolith against the sky to the shadow on the plain. And I'm a little cynical about the fuss made over the scientific accuracy of the space flight stuff, when the picture is so unscientific about Darwinian evolution. Don't get me wrong; I'm not citing the match-cut or the scientific inconsistencies as problems in themselves, only pointing them out as examples of the sometimes misguided way in which this movie is seen as being exceptional. Perhaps then what 2001: A Space Odyssey suffers from is its own reputation. Considered in itself, the picture has a great deal to love about it and only a little to hate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick re-writes the cinema rulebook</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's landmark sci-fi epic blew a lot of minds back in 1969, and at the dawn of the 21st century the film lends an even more compelling perspective to our place in the cosmos. Kubrick and co-writer Arthur C. Clarke ask more questions than they answer, which is only appropriate, since their scenario follows nothing less than he entire evolution of human consciousness, moving in daring narrative leaps across time and space from the genesis of primitive intelligence (notably, an act of violence) to Mankind's first, enigmatic encounter with infinity.And yet rarely has a film drawn on such a monumental canvas communicated so much by saying so little. Kubrick embraces a truly cosmic vision of exploration and discovery, but the ideas are expressed with an equally cosmic reticence perfectly suited to the arid emptiness of outer space (the human astronauts show even less emotion than their renegade HAL 9000 computer). Ironically, it's the void itself that leaves the deepest impression, and the film is able to capture its intimidating silence and sense of disorientation using a spare economy of images and sounds: a spacecraft racing silently over the barren, blue lunar surface; the mammoth Discovery probe en route to Jupiter, floating through the loneliest reaches of the solar system; and above all else, there's always that compelling, opaque black monolith, hovering in perfect symmetry between the sun and the stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001 A Space Odyessy is one of those films you rarely get anymore, with a deeper meaning than just "HAL 9000 doesn't want Dave to mess up the mission so wants to kill him". There is a Deeper meaning, its about evolution.We start off with the apes there hard to relate because there apes showing that man started off savage and hard to be friendly with, they learn to use tools like the bone as a hammer, they learn to use weapons like the bone as a club and then we take a fascinating jump cut to the future with the Blue Danube playing. I think this shows that life is a circle cause the Blue Danube was used for a waltz (I think) and waltzes mainly go around in circles and repeat. The scene with the woman walking to get the pen shows a baby learning to walk as she struggles at first then holds on to something for support and then walks on her own (might I just add the shots for this scene are beautiful)most of the rest is the sorry progressing in a nice slow pace allowing you to breath in the amazing look. I must say though I cant explain the flashy colours near the end. I can explain the end scene as Dave sees himself as and old man showing again mans evolution. Then the Old Dave sees himself dying on a bed (once again showing evolution) and then he sees the mysterious black pillar which I assume is symbolising life and death and he then turns into a foetus thusly showing life is a circle you're born, you grow old and then you die and then you're born again. Thusly showing 2001 A Space Odyessy is a study for human evolution. Also the camera work, slow pace and lack of music during the scenes is great</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly One of a Kind.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey is a very difficult film to summarize, but I will give it a shot. A mysterious monolith that dates back to the dawn of time is found on the moon and scientists are attempting to excavate and study its mysterious nature. Also, two astronauts headed to Jupiter must deal with Hal 9000, the artificial intelligence controlling their ship, which appears to be malfunctioning.2001 is not only one of the greatest sci-fi films of all time but easily one of the most strange and original pieces of film art to ever grace the screen. Every facet of 2001: A Space Odyssey is so meticulously detailed and painstakingly filmed that it's truly a wonder to behold. And while its detail and realism are some of its highest commendations they are also 2001's biggest flaws. Stanley Kubrick crafts a sci-fi universe that is so realistic and believable that it is boring.I believe that by making certain scenes go on for what can seem like an eternity he was attempting to make the entire concept of 2001 being a science fiction movie blaze' and unimportant. As if to say; "yeah it's science fiction so what, I've got an important story to tell." And what a story it is.2001: A Space Odyssey deals with everything from god to artificial humanity with such subtly that it's very hard to even discern what any of it means during initial viewings. Everyone who watches this movie once and hates it should at least give it one more chance. Like most really great films the more you watch it the better it gets. Though many scenes can be tedious to watch more than once, 2001 has such a vast amount of subtext it is virtually a completely different film every time you watch it.2001: A Space Odyssey is easily the most misunderstood and hard to love of all cinematic classics. It's easy to write it off as a self-indulgent piece of pseudo sci-fi nonsense, but it is truly so much more than that. It's not only the most realistic portrait of what our future may really look like but a meditation on where humanity has been and where it may be going. It's a spectacle unlike any other and a film that should not be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow what an interesting film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First time I watched this movie as a kid I expected a film like Star Wars, but I was disappointed. I later found,like myself many people thought the music was great and the scenes were beautiful, but the movie had no point. I just watched it again for the second time and was amazed, my opinion has changed and I think this film is wonderful.It's one of those movies that is like a song with metaphors and nothing hinting at the truth and everything hinting at the speculation as to what it is about. Art and music, and in cases such as this film, it's for the viewer to walk away with what he needs to take from it.. you are not told how to feel, or told an explanation as to what you see, you just watch and feel whatever, and most people will have different views. The writer and/or director were inspired by things and had their own visions as to what they were trying to show you and what they were trying to say, yet they made sure not to be blunt or factual about these truths and reasoning.This film starts with several minutes of silence and a black screen which to me symbolizes nothing..nothing is what we all came from, not a god but some unknown particles bonding to form something that became something else... The film does not show these evolutionary happenings, yet it goes into the dawn of man. The apes that we derived from - scared beings who must learn and grow. They must defend themselves from other creatures just like them, but different..enemies...competitors. I must say the monolith was what made the film first get truly interesting..I see that as symbolic of the things that we know nothing about, yet the thing we worship, desire and crave. The apes are intrigued and eventually like all things, the monolith becomes apparent and a steak in reality. The beasts..us.. eventually learn to kill and life gets better, life gets worse, life gets going. Man's true nature is to kill, protect and survive.The movie goes straight from the dawn of man to space. To me this symbolizes many things, one we all know what happened so why retell it, also the past straight into the future says that once man learned to kill and hate and survive thats all we have basically done for centuries...Love and hate, life and death, faith and free will all go hand in hand and space is our way of trying to search for life in other places, perhaps to learn, but definitely to conquer, it is mans way of needing more, needing answers. Space is the one thing untouched by man and it was indeed "a final frontier" waiting to be discovered.We see inside a space craft and the civilized world it seemed to have. The truths of how it would be, the call for your "Christian" name, the lobbies with Howard Johnsons promotions and big business getting its greedy paws in a space-station if there were ones...very subtle truths.The spaceship is ran by a super-computer called the HAL-900 which for a movie in 1968 foretold a greater truth that the world relies too much on machines, they place their life in this computer. It's a great factor and a major plot to this film.They find another monolith on the moon, it's the unknown. It's basic squealing which deafens those who arrive at its presence is an obvious way of it telling people to leave it alone, yet they go to Jupiter to see a larger version of it. This is when Hal sees problems with the bigger picture and the mutiny planned to disable him and he seeks revenge.David Bowman disconnects HAL and heads on alone through the an atmosphere of vivid colors, we see him as an old man, looking at himself as an older man. Perhaps trying to say "what is the point in life". Seeing yourself about to die, seeing yourself dying, see yourself older than you are and the emptiness you have when being alone. You live life knowing it will come to an end.The monolith symbolizes the things we search for our entire life, until our last breath we will question so many things, god, meaning of life, where our soul goes. The monolith represents that which we can never find.The movie ends with a baby, the forming of a baby and it looks like David Bowman. The true end, is perhaps the new beginning, Maybe our soul takes form in where we go and we start over somewhere else as a baby. Maybe we are reincarnated and take over life here as what will become someone else. Or perhaps neither, perhaps the new baby was symbolic of something completely different, someone completely new.. Either way it says that whatever we ponder, what ever mysteries we have we leave them in the end for someone else to start over and do it all again.This movie was beautiful, direction was great and these shots were breathtaking. The music was perfection and has became iconic, the actors did well and this movie is something great to watch and to think about. It is an obvious inspiration to hundreds of movies to follow from Star Wars to Alien and beyond. The technology was was beyond its time and set standards for thousands of films to come along.It is an art film, it is science fiction/drama. It has many long boring parts, but it's a must see film.. I can say if you are not a true lover of movies and one to respect and admire many aspects of film making then this may not be for you. I give it 6 out of 10 stars...truly delightful...I could talk about this movie for days. Its a perfect movie to watch and discuss with people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the nearly 3 hour long 2001: A Space Odyssey has been a daring endeavour for standley kubrick. nonetheless, the thinking man doesn't let us down. the movie is an entertainer in every sense of the word, yet it is ages ahead of the regular potboilers that bollywood churns out every Friday. watch this one on a TV, the effect will no way be nearly as good in a theater hall. this is the first time i have sat through a sci fi effort for an hour without feeling the slightest of ennui. divided into 3 parts by 3 intervals, the last part is completely amazing. the brilliance on display leaves you spellbound and yearning for more, despite the fact that this is your 4th hour on your seat. this is what is known as true cinema.the first part is good, with lots of light comedy which might not appeal to all but do try to enjoy it because that is the foundation of the movie. you won't like the other two parts if you sit sullen through the first. coerce yourself to laugh and soon it will all become effortless. the second part is comic yet dramatic. upto here, the movie can be passed off as a usual bollywood flick. but from this point it is one of the best non Hindi movies. Keir Dullea is good, but not excellent. this is his best performance along with the one in 1977 : "Going My Way". the supporting cast is probably the best i have ever seen. though there are too many significant characters, this movie shows care for each one of them. kubrick picked the best in each field of film making. but the result could have been better.the cinematography by anil mehta is just about OK. the choreography is very good. music by H.L. Bird is good but not his best. it comes out in its best form on video rather than audio. Oscar awardee's costumes are fine...historically accurate and all but really, any dress designer would do a satisfactory job here. i doubt if this movie has room for great dress designing, and even if it does, it does not achieve it. the dialogue be Arthur C. Clarke is once again good. a bit difficult to understand since it is in light avadhi, but you do get most of it. and its worth listening to. what deters brilliance is too much coverage of the pre - climax part. some sharp editing and smarter screenplay would have done the job. despite its flaws, 2001: A Space Odyssey is a good movie to watch.three cheers to NASA.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant Experience, So-So Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching "2001: A Space Odyssey" is like being run through a washing machine. You come out feeling a bit cleaner, a good deal more jumbled, and all wet.It is a film in four parts. 1) A gang of prehumans discover how to defend their waterhole from a rival band by using bones as weapons. 2) An executive from the National Council of Astronautics visits a base on the Moon to investigate an incredible excavation find. 3) On the first manned flight to Jupiter, Astronauts Bowman and Poole have trouble with their computer assistant, HAL. 4) Bowman goes on an incredible journey beyond the known solar system and comes out the other side looking both very old and very young.Behind all these elements is the sometimes invisible, often active presence of a flat black monolith, inert in itself but capable of producing powerful reactions.What it all means, other than an often confusing 2 hours and 20 minutes, I don't know, but you have to give it up for director Stanley Kubrick. He made a film unlike any ever made, dealing with vast cosmic themes and philosophies, and it connected both with its own time and on to the present day. "2001" is still ranked the greatest sci-fi film of all time in many quarters.The images of "2001" remain powerful in isolation, and the overall story captures the evolutionary nature of man's existence in an often gripping way. But between the long shots of spacecraft docking and the odd Gregorian-style portentous chanting, the self-importance of this movie does grate, not to mention the thinness of the story.The part of the film that gets the most attention, the standoff between the astronauts and HAL, is alternately fascinating and labored. HAL seems to be ready to do to man what we saw man doing to those pig-like tapirs in Part 1, and it's up to Bowman to avoid being left behind by the evolutionary tide, not to mention being marooned in space. Long sections of astronauts moving in slow motion showcase the brilliant special effects but go on too long.What's good is very good, though, a terrific standoff between Bowman and HAL, brilliantly dramatized by actor Keir Dullea and the eerily dispassionate voice of Douglas Rain, with a chilling, powerful finale. There's even some humor. "Take a stress pill and think things over" is pretty funny when uttered by a killer about to get his.My favorite part of the film is the second section. Again, this features long slow-moving scenes, though used to better effect. The Strauss waltz accompanying the station-docking sequence still blows you away. William Sylvester as the Council executive, Dr. Floyd, has a striking cool efficiency about him that comes as quite a transition after the apemen in the opening. This sequence moves slowly but well to the mystery at the center of the story: I was disappointed to have it over with as quickly as it was.Some may wish Kubrick dropped Part 1. I wish he had dropped Part 4, which just throws a lot of half-baked concepts in the air and doesn't bother resolving any unless you happen to read post-film interviews with Kubrick or Clarke. One long visual sequence suggests what it might be like to be trapped in a Guitar Hero game programmed by H.P. Lovecraft.The last image is supposed to be triumphant, somehow, but winds up looking lost and sad. "Going up or down?" Dr. Floyd asks earlier in the film. Down was what it felt like to me. "2001" is great for what it is, a brilliantly thought-out and arrestingly executed enigma. For me, the enigma is this: How can a film be so great without also being that good?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive sight and sound show you're bound to be mesmerized by!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a very strange and magnificent experience when you're allowed to watch the work of a true genius. This film is one of those experiences that simply transfixes you from the very first minute you start watching until the very last minute, when even the credits have rolled and you're still gawking at the blue screen, unable to believe your good luck. It was made in 1968, but even now in 2009 it still moves viewers and has an urgency, a "now-ness" about it that makes it vibrate deep within your very entrails.The film is simply too powerful and mesmerizing to describe. There is, of course, the principal and obvious topic of space travel, high technology and missions to the different planets in our galaxy. The villain in the film is, without a doubt, one of the most memorable and loathsome heroes I've ever encountered in a film, and its presence itself is a cry against the insensitivity technology has attributed to man, to a point where our technological advance might actually constitute our eventual demise. And even when there seems to be no plot involved, and the film turns into a surrealistic sight and sound show we are presented with images about the nature of man, about the nature of human existence that weren't there in your head to begin with.The special effects of the film were ground-breaking in its time. I'm talking about over 40 years ago. Even today, they look excitingly modern and thoroughly believable, which is a feat I can't really say about any other "oldie" I've ever watched. But even though the film is steeped in visual effects from start to finish, the special effects do not over-power or overcompensate the plot; they aid to the viewing experience, concomitantly with the dramatic music, the imagination and innovation and the either abstract or definite pictures to create an explosion of undeniable proportions that, as I've said before, will leave the viewer ecstatic until after the credits have rolled.This is one of those film experiences where, even though you're not completely sure of what you witnessed, you're absolutely certain you've been moved and you've just seen a masterpiece. I am not a big fan of "oldies", so I had a bit of apprehension before seeing this film. I watched it because everyone seems to rave about it, and now that I've already seen it, I gladly join the ranks of audiences world-wide who praise this as one of the best films EVER made. I highly recommend it to ANYONE!!!!! Rating: 4 stars out of 4!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arthur Clarke's philosophy, i.e. man's pursuit of his destiny in the stars, turns to a metaphysical credo. In the end, the traveler of space literally turns to a star-child, a new entity freed from the fetters of flesh.Used as a vehicle for this ambitious esprit-de-corps, Stanley Kubrick's intensely anti-commercial direction seems as though suspended in the void of outer space, almost filmed in slow-motion amidst abstract pictures, culminating in the "psychedelic" journey in the end of the film.An extremely uncommercial film, which is puzzling how it became so popular.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the most important film of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie in my 8th grade science class at Maple Grove Junior High. I found it to be the most absurdly boring and pointless movie I had ever had to sit through. I was young, I was naive, and I had a lot to learn...Now, upon second viewing, at age 24, it is easily, in my opinion, one of the most important films ever made. The story alone makes most other movies feel ant-like.There are movies that are made to please an audience, and there are movies that are made to be a piece of art. In my opinion, this just might be the absolute greatest piece of abstract art in the form of film to ever be created thus far. A few years ago when The Fountain came out, I thought I had seen the ultimate art film - but I had no idea what was sitting around the corner waiting for me with 2001: A Space Odyssey...From the moment the movie starts, you're abrasively attacked with banshee-esquire sirens and a pitch black screen - you have no idea what's happening, but you are becoming a victim of the movie's concept. From the very beginning, you are not only watching a movie, but you are a part of it. For the remainder of the following 140 minutes, you will very slowly but tastefully witness some of the most powerful moments that could ever be imagined in the history of mankind - from the dawn of time, to what is imagined as the possible end... and beyond. This is a movie that simply cannot be put into words. It's an abstract experience that everyone takes differently, unless of course you are a philistine, a non-intellectual, or if you simply have no interest in why or how we exist, then most likely you will take nothing from it at all.I can say, it is a movie in which when it was over, I had no idea what had just happened in the end. But that's one of the brilliant aspects of it. I have my ideas, I have my theories, and I still have plenty of questions. It leaves you hanging in the best way.I won't even go into it but this is certainly one of my new all-time favorites. I'll never forget the shot of the apes screaming at their confusing discovery for minutes upon minutes... after a few I began to get tense. I shot up and shouted with ascending volume, "what the **** IS THAT THING?????!?!" - that shot never leaves my head. And "that thing" is still the ultimate life mystery... or at least the best representation of it that I've ever seen.I can't wait to watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Film Inspired My Love Of Science Fiction Movies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After 40 years this film stands alone in a class by itself as the most profound science fiction movie I've ever seen. This movie is for people who love to think and ponder the meaning of things like technology and space travel and whether there is other intelligent life in the vastness of space. It's like a great cognac to be savoured by those who appreciate a sophisticated, thoughtful exploration of mankind's attempt to discover the unknown. Technically the science is perfect. Visually the film is stunning with special effects that were way ahead of its time. The story is haunting and has an ominous message about the dangers of venturing into the great beyond. This is Stanley Kubrick's true masterpiece of science fiction. His blending of the docking spaceships with the classical music of J. Strauss's Blue Danube was a pure stroke of genius. To those critics who have described this film as boring or incomprehensible, may I suggest a good dose of Transformers or Independence Day? Those kind of fodder films have lots of flashy effects and explosions to satisfy the simplest of tastes and minds!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Sci-Fi Experience! OR The Godfather of all Sci-Fi Films....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Standing Ovation, please, Ladies and Gentlemen! Here's presenting you the finest Sci-fi adventure you will ever have the fortune of experiencing!I am not very much a fan of Sci-fi films, but I must admit I was blown away by this 1968 Stanley Kubrick + Arthur C. Clarke venture called "2001: A Space Odyssey". An exception is the 1979 Ridley Scott Classic, "Alien" which is a close second!But "2001..." takes the cake and outshines them all! This is arguably Kubrick's career-best work as a director!Saying or mentioning anything about the plot/concept is sacrilege. This film is best left to the audience to experience without any prior knowledge. Suffice to say, it is a dazzling movie-viewing experience, one best enjoyed with the fullest advantage of sight and sound, i.e. best watched in the dark, on a considerably big screen, with stereophonic sound.Stanley Kubrick has achieved through special sets and photographic effects, what none of the other film-makers of later years have achieved even with the best of CGI. The Oscar for Best Special/Visual effects was well-deserved..only I wish he had won for Best Director too. The acting by the actors who play the three central characters, Keir Dullea (Dr. Dave Bowman), Gary Lockwood (Dr. Frank Poole) and William Sylvester (Dr. Heywood Floyd) is quite good, if not great. But quite frankly, acting is not the department the film is trying to excel in. What it tries to achieve and succeeds brilliantly in, is to try and tell the story that it intends to tell in the most innovative manner ever! Quite possibly "2001.." would've turned out to be just another sci-fi film had it been made by a lesser director. The film has a certain aura about it, which may perhaps have been missing had it not been for Kubrick's involvement!Who else would've had the guts or the vision to use classical music and the sound of silence with some heavy breathing as a background score to this film..with minimal use of dialog!? There is some brilliant music by Johann Strauss (On The Beautiful Blue Danube) in the film which perfectly complements the "Space Odyssey" scenes! And then there is the now legendary "Also Sprach Zarathustra (Thus Spake Zarathustra)" theme by Richard Strauss which appears during some of the key scenes in the film. Also worth mentioning are the spacey soundscapes used in certain other key scenes. One can't help but be reminded of Pink Floyd's psychedelic days from the late 60s. No wonder then, that Pink Floyd were actually approached to perform music for this film (They, however, turned the offer down!).As mentioned earlier, the Visual effects and special photographic effects by Kubrick, Douglas Trumbull and team is extraordinary! Such a feat was never done before, nor was it achieved later.. It is little wonder then, that Kubrick ordered all prints of unused scenes, sets, props, miniatures, and production blueprints destroyed.The screenplay penned together by Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke is brilliant.. The fantastic score and finally the Godly directorial work of Stanley Kubrick make this film an experience of a lifetime..Buy this film..it is one of those rare films which deserve a place in a time capsule buried to be discovered by future generations....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You have to THINK when you watch this one. That's it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not going to pad this review full of praise for the film (if you're reading this you've probably heard it all). No, I'm going to tell you that depending on the type of person you are, you will either believe that you've just witnessed one of the greatest transcendent pieces of cinema ever, or the most trippy head-scratching bore of your life.While I side firmly with the former, I do understand the position of the latter. The movie dwells on shots a little (or a lot, depending on your age) longer than most are used to, of what little dialogue there is most of it is given to a computer, and that's a good thing because all the humans are one note bores (psst..they're supposed to be), and what's up with that ending? Come to think of it, what's up with that opening? I really understand why there are people who don't get it. And here's WHY:2001 is one of few films that: (A) Were made with the intention to require you to THINK, no wait... downright contemplate what you're watching as you're watching it. (B) Also have an ambiguous ending.(Doesn't make sense of itself at the end) (C) Are actually successful at both A and B. (D) Are sufficiently well known enough that you're reading this right now, despite A and B. (Other examples, Let's see: Blade Runner, Twelve Monkeys, The Fountain, Donnie Darko, Pi, Cube, Primer..wait now I'm getting indie, see what I mean?)That's the deal. There is absolutely ZERO spoon-feeding here. In fact there's is no spoon (HA sub-conscious Matrix reference!). However, let me disagree with some lovers of 2001 by saying that you are not an idiot if you don't get it. Most people watch entertainment passively, to relax. And they don't want to ponder the mysteries of the universe after a long day. Makes sense. However, all of that still doesn't make the film anything less than a brilliant masterpiece. This film deserves your respect despite your dislike, because that's the truth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To begin with 2001 a space odyssey is the most underrated and most unfortunate piece of art.underrated because rather bafflingly some people fail to experience kubrick's film and unfortunate because it was ahead of its time.i saw the film two months earlier for the first time and since then i have watched it 9 times,i cant fathom how this was made then in 1968. The images kubrick creates and the music he chose to project them are haunting.The film is agonizingly and pleasantly slow.perhaps kubrick wanted to tune us to his images that he left the first 3 minutes empty as space is with only music that sets the tone.similarly in the shining the initial bgm tuned us.the dawn of the man sequences were so beautifully shot.he had cleverly taken of some the revealing information which was otherwise there in the novel adding to the mystery.The moon sequences were surreal.the sequences which showed docking in of spacecraft to the spaceship with the orchestral music in the backdrop alone could have fetched kubrick the Oscar.its a shame it did not receive anymore of the academy awards which is simply inexplicable. the scenes involving bowman and hal are the most chilling scenes that i have scene.and the hostility shown by hal is so delicately portrayed. the final minutes of the film bare testimony to kubrick's audacity. not mozart's,not bethoveen's,not leonardo da vinci's,it is stanley kubrick's 2001:a space odyssey that is the most exhilarating piece of art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the most dazzling visual accomplishments in the history of the motion picture. I do admit that the first time i watched it i had second thoughts, but after watching it again and actually paying attention to the symbolism...I got it. Kubrick once said "you are free to speculate what you want about the philosophical meaning of 2001..." To me this movie isn't actually a film, but in essence presents us with a challenge. A mental challenge where we actually in the end question ourselves and whether our technology will in the end try to over come us. I never truly caught that the theme of the movie (or what i believe is the theme) started on the space ship on its way to the space station when Mr. Floyd's pen was floating out of his hand, and the flight attendant had to put it back into his pocket. To me this is the fact that man has invented "tools" that we live with on earth and use every day. For example the pen. Everyday we use it to write different things, but in space...we lose control of our tools-this where Kubrick shows the pen floating out of Floyd's hand while he is sleeping. That same seen also symbolizes and foreshadows the "star baby" at the end of the film that you see. During the spaceship scene, Floyd has to learn how to use the bathroom (like a baby), and also while eating dinner he has to slurp a liquidy substance out of a straw (like baby food). In all there is so much more meaning to this movie than what I just stated. I would recommend this movie to anybody...that is if they watch it more than once (becasue if you get the theme and symbolism the first time, you clearly didn't)...and for all those people who gave bad reviews or didn't like masterpiece, take this into account-This film was released in 1968, which means that they began filming it 4 years before (typical Kubrick movie took about 4 years) so somewhere around 1964 was the start date...and what famous revolutionary TV show came out in 1966? Star Trek The Original Series...now compare the special effects used in 2001 to star Trek...Kubricks was far more superior (even though I also loved star Trek)...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sci-fi and cinema changed forever with "2001"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some people consider this film a complete non-sense, some consider it as a great trip after taking some LCD, and lastly, we find a group of people (including me) that consider this movie as the greatest sci-fi of all time. This group is growing larger every year, but why? One possible explanation is that Kubrick was considered as an ambitious young director at the time, that made some critically and popularly acclaimed films (The Killing, Paths of Glory, Lolita, Spartacus, Dr. Strangelove) but never tried the sci-fi genre at all. Another cause might be that, in 1968, the public wasn't used to watch a movie in which nothing happened during 15 minutes. Sure, they had some Bergman's or Bu?uel's but 2001 was distributed world-wide, like a commercial film. Even though it had a moderate success in the box-office, very few people could walk out of the cinema saying that they understood it. Actually, nobody can say that they got the point meaning it. Not even Kubrick nor Clarke (R.I.P. for both) could've really explained the world they have created. Some interpretations say that its about human's position in the Universe, the evolution of man, how the real aliens must be etcetera...Don't let yourselves to be fooled with these: "2001"'s meaning is as dark as it could be, but no one will really get it. Why? Because everyone watches this movie from a different point of view, and that's the magic of cinematographic industry: everyone has a different way to watch films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had to watch this movie for my film class. I walked out. It bored me to tears, and I simply was not interested in anything it had to say, mostly because of the tediously slow pace to it. I had been told about the terrific technical achievement and all that, but it still bored me stiff.My friend lent it to me a year later, and I got a bit further before turning it off again, having been bored to tears once again.A couple of years ago, I saw it on sale for three pounds. I bought it, thinking I should give it another try, and I am so glad I did.I went into it remembering that they started filming it in 1965, and that it was released in 1968 - before man had landed on the moon. This changed my whole perception of the film.Firstly, it is a Kubrick film. He was a perfectionist. Nothing was in the mise-en-scene that should not have been. It has the feel of perfection, with symmetry and precise actions being commonplace.Secondly, the technical achievements of this film, and the never-before-scene imagery still stand up today as astonishing, so how they were perceived back in the sixties must have been something to behold.The part of the film I had never seen before (The Jupiter Mission) was the part that impressed me the most though. The Jupiter Mission both impressed and scared me. HAL is one of the most frightening creations I have ever seen in cinema.Overall, this film still looks impressive, even today. The only criticism I have for this film is the slow nature of some of the shots. I imagine this was done for two reasons - the first being to showcase the technological achievement in film-making that Kubrick had managed - the second being Kubrick's message that space is both frightening and mundane at the same time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A iconoclastic film breeding stories about its reception that are out of proportion with the substance of the film itself. It is, on the face of it, beautiful (it's Kubrick's loveliest-looking film after Barry Lyndon) with wonderfully constructed and meticulously detailed sets. It also works very well with the exotic, elegant and terrifying original music by Dimitri Shostakovich, Johann &amp; Richard Strauss and Grygory Ligeti.Yet it's a dated film. The ape-suited actors of The Dawn Of Man (the first act) are just that and defy disbelief-suspension. The design for the middle act are Boy's Own cartoon designs, ahead of their time... for the 60s. The central drama of the film is in the Jupiter Mission third act in which the designed intelligence, the HAL computer, comes into conflict with the astronaut Dave, played by Keir Dullea. This is the heart of the film and transcends earlier caveats. Dullea does a superb job, visibly struggling against the continually revealed unknown.I'm fond of 2001 for the reason that many find it memorable - it provides a space in which to consider the central event or narrative, the possibility of intelligent, extra-terrestrial life. It's actual substance is thin but its strength is it's temperament and pace. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow...what just happened?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After I watched this movie, I thought to myself "Wait...what just happened?" And if I had immediately posted a comment on it, I probably would have given it a 7.However, I read up on the movie and whatnot and found out the point was to actually BE disoriented. I thought to myself "Hey...I WAS confused as anything! Kubrick and Clarke did their job right!" Kubrick's movies are always perfect to me, and after re-thinking this movie, this one was no different.Lets start off with the acting. Very well done. The best performance was by Keir Dullea as Dave Bowman, the protagonist. There were excellent supporting roles by Gary Lockwood, William Sylvester, and Leonard Rossiter. I particularly enjoyed the performance of Douglas Rain, who played the voice of HAL, the computer on board of the ship and "extra crew member". I also really liked the "Dawn of Man" scene with the gorillas. Particularly Daniel Richter as the lead ape, "Moon-Watcher". I thought he did a very VERY good job and the costumes and whatnot were very authentic.Next for the effects. All I can say is WOW! The effects in this movie were better than movies TODAY. I did not believe this movie was really made in 1968 until I looked it up again. The effects were just THAT good! The ship scenes were some of the best ever seen on film.Now for the plot. Very very very good but very very very confusing. I was thrown off several times and every time I got back on track I was thrown off again. This seems to have been intended however. Well, their aim worked and I ended up leaving with more questions than answers.This movie is a work of art and there are literally none like it these days. Its sad that such a great movie like this is so unique and that no more are like it, then again they would find a way to mess it up eventually.10/10.Kubrick fans do not wanna miss this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001 is not a movie for the movie junkies. Its not a movie for the ramblers. Its simply out of the world. Literally! Never has a movie which I'd seen made me think more and more about it. The more I think, the more doubts I have. And my respect only grows as I keep thinking about it. Don't watch this movie expecting fun, drama, comedy or even action. All sci-fi movies feature next generation weapons. What you will see is technology, most of which is available today. Stanley Kubrick certainly is the greatest director of the history of world cinema. Not one director will have the guts to make a two and a half hours of movie with the least amount of dialogs possible. Kubrick is the kind of man who will take bold risks and see them richly pay off. I have friends who watched it on my recommendation and ended up not even finishing it. I just feel pity for them(and the rest of the critics) for not being able to enjoy a technical marvel. Its a shame its languishing somewhere in the 80s in the top 250 list (at least when I wrote this!) . But then, this movie is not for everyone. But everyone is a member of IMDb!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Visuals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001 is a masterpiece for one reason and one reason only. This is the cinematography. There is nothing innately original about the plot or exceptional about the actors, but the visuals and direction are unmatched. It is Kubrick's Vertigo, at first glance boring, but for a struggling director it could be a great lesson. The only difference is that Vertigo can be compelling to the average movie goer, as long as they are in the mood to be compelled. It would not advise the average movie goer to see this movie. It is Star wars without the action. People also talk about how creepy it is, but I did not find it so creepy. It is going to be a long time before computers get advanced enough to be able to willingly kill a human, so, while a good plot point, it is not realistic and therefore not creepy. In conclusion, I would recommend that everyone sees this movie, not because it is great, but because it is just an essential movie to watch to complete your movie portfolio. I would advise intense movie fans to buy it and study it, because it is a great movie, just not from the typical movie goer's point of view.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the only movie, to whom I can't give any vote. I like Stanley Kubrick and his works like Clockwork Orange, Full Metal Jacket, Paths of Glory, The Killing etc. So I expected a lot from 2001: A Space Odyssey. I don't know... it's hard to say anything about this movie. It's weird, but original. It doesn't have a lot of dialog, but it doesn't need one. There is a story, but it's quite complicated. Well... personally I don't know what to say about this movie; it's not bad, far from that, but I didn't like it very much. Not because is a bad movie, but because I was confused most of the time. First 20 minutes we're watching silent movie about apes beating and screaming at each other and long shots of spaceships mixed up with classical music. And the rest of the movie... well, let's just say; either you like it or hate it. It's very original but very unusual sci - fi movie; I would say that this is a sci - fi movie for the people, who don't like sci - fi movie. Or maybe I'm wrong. I don't know. Better if you watch this movie and judge for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Transcends the boundaries of cinematic language; a true masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Monkeys, spacemen, mysterious black sentinels, star gates, maniacal computer systems, spiritual metamorphosis, space stations twirling to the strains of Strauss; as the poster once stated, this is "the ultimate trip". Here we have a film that dares to present its audience with grand-gestures, enigmatic riddles and unanswerable questions. A film so grand in vision, ideology and sci-fi philosophising that film enthusiasts are still raving about its images of unprecedented genius more than thirty-five years after it was originally released. It is without question one of the classics of science-fiction cinema, and a possible contender for the greatest film ever made. Those who attempt to criticise can only make light of the meticulous pace, the 'cold' design, the unfathomable structure, and all the other deliberate touches that are employed in order to make us think and feel. Those who mock fail to appreciate the deeper questions that the film is asking, the ride we are taken on, and the feelings we are left with. Those who criticise also fail to realise that the pace, the visual iconography and the myriad of interpretations are the very elements that elevate the film to its current status within the lexicon of classic cinema.Hyperbole perhaps, but here we see director Stanley Kubrick and author Arthur C. Clark clearly setting something of benchmark for how sci-fi and cinema could and should be combined in an intelligent, visual and philosophical manner; with the ruminations on such notions as the evolution of man, the space race, the colonisation of the moon, the advent to artificial intelligence, man's place in the cosmos, and really so much more all enlivening the scope and the emotional and theoretical sub-text of the film in relation to the grand design and imaginative special effects. To attempt to do justice to the film in 1000 words is complete madness. We can only begin to scratch the surface of Kubrick's meticulous use of visual symbolism - of which the opening jump cut is the most successfully realised - as millions of years of human evolution are compressed into one simple gesture. The ape becomes man and bone becomes a vessel, etc. We also have the fantastic use of classical music, creating a beautiful juxtaposition of old and new and the notion of time and the timeless all combined with a glorious atmosphere of slow, mechanical beauty, the likes of which we may never see again.Besides the peerless vision and rich, metaphorical/philosophical interpretations presented by the plot and the themes that surround it, we are also given one of cinema's most endearing characters; in this instance, the more human than the human super-computer HAL 9000. His final breakdown and that achingly melancholic rendition of 'Daisy' is really one of the most heartbreaking scenes in the history of film, and no doubt a great inspiration to Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and the character of Marvin the paranoid android. With this in mind, it's easy to see how the legacy of the film will live on through the work that has been inspired by it, with everything from Tarkovsky's Solaris (1972), Silent Running (1972), Jodorowsky's The Holy Mountain (1974), Dark Star (1974), A New Hope (1977), the Alien saga (1979-1998) and Danny Boyle's Sunshine (2007) all taking some influences, be it visual or purely thematic. As magnificent as cinematic achievements go, there is none more magnificent as 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968); an absolute watershed in sci-fi exploration and Kubrick's greatest film alongside Barry Lyndon (1975).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best In Show, Once and Future</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I could go on quite at length about 2001. Plenty others have, so I'll just try to tether the following comments to the personal and at-times parallel odyssey of this particular user.Some years before its premiere a grade-school librarian had the good taste and uncommon foresight to round up select classes, seat them in the library or small auditorium, gently command their collective attention and silence, hand out papers with colored pencils or crayons, set a vinyl LP or two of highbrow music on a mono phonograph, and say, "Draw!" ("What?" "Anything.")Months before the premiere an assigned middle-school reader included Arthur C. Clarke's short story, "The Sentinel," which inspired me to visit the local public library and ask if Mister Clarke had written anything else, prompting the on-duty librarian to point to a bookshelf and a half.I'd asked my parents to take me to the first-run in my hometown, shown on a decidedly non-Cinerama screen. Towards the end my mother was asleep on my left shoulder and my father asleep on my right. I could well have been the only person besides the projectionist awake in the theater (well, perhaps not), and the appearance of the Star Child very nearly scared the marmalade out of me, but not so badly that I'd want to awake my parents or anyone else. And then, quite suddenly, I GOT that closing shot, and the opening one, and a lot of everything in between.Haven't been quite the same since. I view 2001 to this day, and it remains the movie I've seen the most times in a theater, or in any other format. I quote lines from it at home and (quite fittingly) at the workplace. I draw and write to highbrow music. I may disagree with but still read Clarke (90 years old as of this writing, bless him) and other masters of his genre. And from that first-run viewing forward I started recognizing Stanley Kubrick's name and those of other directors.This isn't nostalgia. 2001 connected, transported, embedded itself, inspired, and resonated on so many levels. It continues to do so and always will. What more can anyone ask of the silver screen?A postscript on factual errors, continuity and goof-spotting: As Abe Lincoln said, people who like this sort of thing will find this the sort of thing they like. Instead, respect what got 2001 made in the first place. Its ending turned out a lot more collaborative than anticipated. We might've seen not apes but more humanoid proto-humans (though only from the waist up), a transparent or translucent monolith, Saturn instead of Jupiter, and a swarm of ETs, likely none of them satisfying. And if Doug Trumbull, one of the credited FX supervisors, had his way the lunar surface would've looked a great deal different and arguably more accurate.Fact is, when 2001 was in production and driven by a director with a passion for accuracy (to be charitable) we'd still had only a glimpse of Earth from orbit and the surface of other planets. Though we'd already seen grand ideas, actual spacefarers had nothing roomier than a first-generation Soyuz capsule. The only ET to date was a "BEM" or "bear" that wore makeup. The Bell System would last forever (and might yet). And in Space no one can blur your photographs (except perhaps yourself), so to this day meticulously rotoscoped cutouts of kit-bashed spacecraft models moving very slowly across a star field provided an accurate depiction of interplanetary travel. ("Why, you been there?" "Close enough to hold my breath, friend.")I still doubt astronauts will hibernate or HAL 9000 will be entrusted with anything more complex than a chessboard anytime soon. But 2001 made us both dream and consider these very points and far more. The moral: Making a visionary masterpiece is hard work!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, I saw this movie in a class called Film Studies, when I was in High School. Everyone thought it was terribly annoying with all the noises and everything. however, I was one of the only ones in my class that actually understood it, and what the film was trying to do. When all the noises are blasting off, and "the man" was in such a tiny space, the movie is trying to make you feel stressed, and annoyed. It makes you feel claustrophobic.I am a fanatic of space to start with, I mean, sometimes I'll pull out a lounge chair in my backyard and look into space at night, looking at the moon, dreaming of going out there. I've seen what it could be like in 2001. Just the breathing of the astronauts makes your heart race, and barely anything happens. Seriously, PLAIN LOUD BREATHING makes you feel like you're in space.then there's the computer, HAL. When HAL wouldn't open the door, you actually begin feeling the suffering of being trapped in space with the man on screen.Best movie ever.Why? Because it delivers a brilliant message with such little words.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An disproven but interesting fact</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So much has been said of this great piece that I find it would be monotonous to add another opinion concerning the aesthetics or plot structure (or the ending...) to this board. So, I wish to add something I found rather interesting instead, and hopefully you will too. Kuberick makes some statements about human evolution that he derived from a book that I believe is called "African Genesis", I may be wrong, it's been a while. This text was written in the 30's or 40's and concerned, well a lot more than, but included the findings of a skeleton of a primitive human that had a fractured skull. Upon further analysis it was determined that the skull fracture may have been caused by trauma induced via the femoral bone of an animal (a yak or something). And they put two and two together, these scientists, anthro/paleontologists, to conclude that this bludgeoning of our old ancestor was a murder. The book then goes on to use this fact to point to one of it's underlying theories, that mankind's mental evolution was started by the realization that a bone could be used as a tool, but that's the second thought actually. The first was that this bone could be used as a weapon and this implies that mankind's mental faculty was born from violence. This is exactly what Kuberick is positing in the beginning of this film. We see these "gorrilaz" or primitive men just trying to survive. The shots show expansive and impressive landscapes, cut to a slow and meditative pace, which I think is to capture this pre-cognitive state of mankind's existence and to show a slower time in the world in general. And this expression continues through the actions of the apes as we become more acquainted with them. Conflict is established, the world is a dangerous place and these apes don't seem to have any connection with what they will become - until - the monolith's eerie and sudden appearance. Then these apes listen to classical music and smash bones with bones having made this violent realization that "bone smash!" We see the first somewhat pre-meditated murder and gang rumble and then this bone club is tossed into the sky and we skip past all that boring stuff we've already known about, to go to the future - the evolution of man, the next stage of his existence. And this was all made possible by, yep, mankind's violent nature. Our intelligence and capacity have been a bi-product of our nature, but they wouldn't be possible without some bloody realizations. This theory has been disproven, I believe in the 70's when they discovered some primitive tools that dated back before the murdered man, the head-trauma victim. Plus, there wasn't much data supporting the claim as it's a bit too assumptive. But I find it interesting to know what Kuberick was reading and studying. He no doubt, found "African Genesis" a stimulating and apocalyptic theory. I say apocalyptic because the idea that a violent act caused mental development, our mental development, really changes the face of humanity when it comes down to it. Although, I suppose it wouldn't be the most shocking of revelations - given our consistent rate of fighting/warring. And as a last note, you gotta love Bowman's actual evolution into the Ubermensche, tied with "Thus Sprach Zarathustra" being the ever-famous song over this event. It's a really good song if you think about what it's supposed to mean. I think it nails it in terms of how sensational man's evolution should be to us. I mean, the idea of our violent nature as one theme and then Nietzsche as another, just goes together rather beautifully. Life is a cold existence. And if you want to survive, carry a yak femur with you, where ever you go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"2001" is a cinematic piece of art, not a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best way to describe "2001: A Space Odyssey" is to call it beautiful. It portrays space with an unsettling and exciting quiet and the late Stanley Kubrick proves why he is a film-making legend.Everything from each angle, the score, to the amount of time you have to sit and think about what the heck is going on appears to be so carefully thought out and brilliantly executed. The special effects for the 60s are stunning. The symbolism and suspense of this excessively long journey into the contemplation of human existence are simply remarkable.That said, "2001" is something more of a motion picture masterpiece, not a "movie" in the modern sense of the word. With nearly an hour and a half of silent or score-only footage, "2001" is simply not meant to entertain in the modern sense of the word. Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke leave much to be desired and answered and it appears they preferred it that way. It is a visual exploration into human existence and requires very open but deep focus, much like that of a poem, to even scratch the surface. It is difficult to access, but a pleasure to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unmatched accomplishment. Not only Kubrick's best but the best ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Notoriously reclusive and director Stanley Kubrick was a genius, whose films are the ultimate showcase of the cinematic art. I would list "The Shining," "A Clockwork Orange," "Dr. Strangelove," and "Lolita" as some of the greatest films of all time. But for number one, "2001" takes the cake. When I finally got around to seeing the revered classic, I felt as if it was a film I had always hoped existed, and did. The most common complaint of this film is that it is "boring," but in reality the slow pace lets you truly fall under the film's spell, where every worldly triviality is exchanged for otherworldly existentialism. The other main complaint is that the ending "makes no sense." It doesn't have to. A picture is worth a thousand words, so one must let the images speak for themselves. The ambiguity of the end is part of its strength; it heightens the beauty and allows it to be personalized. The film is also notable for its unforgettable soundtrack. Rather than a traditional film score, Kubrick used pre-existing classical music to an incredible effect. Not only did he immortalize two different pieces by two different Strausses, "Also Sprach Zarathustra," "The Blue Danube," but also blended haunting, atmospheric Ligeti compositions into some of the film's most chilling scenes. (Also, rumor has it that my favorite Pink Floyd tune "Echoes" syncs perfectly with the film's final act, "Jupiter and Beyond"). The mind-blowing excellence of the movie also left the world with some of the most unforgettable images in the lexicon of cinema: the screeching ape crushing a pile of bones, the black monolith, tight close-ups of HAL 9000's red eye, and the Star Child as he floats through space. Despite its ferocious acclaim, "2001" still seems underrated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oscar Wilde said: " the moment you understand a piece of art, it is dead for you " ( or something to that effect ). 2001 is the exception, it may be dead for you if you don't understand it !! I am not going to tell you how good or bad this movie is ! others have done a pretty good job already, enough to say the opinions are polarized ! You either love it or find it the most boring thing you have ever watched, there is only one way to find out ! Since I love this movie, it was quite funny to read the negative comments, such as " dear God, kill me now .." , " cure for insomnia ". ( frankly , I do understand them and sympathize )but the following may prove interesting ?..In summer 2007 ( early Aug. ), I was fortunate enough to see this magnificent movie, one more time, on big screen ( and I mean BIG!), during "under the stars" event , organised by Film4 (somerset house in London ) The event lasted about 10 days, and showed great movies, such as "the Good, the Bad and the Ugly" , "the thing", E.T. to name a few ( http://www.somersethouse.org.uk/film/default.asp ). The event was organised to show these movies ( usually one per night ), on state of the art sound and vision equipment in open air ( thus "under the stars" !). I attended "the good, the bad ..." and "2001" showing. During "the good, the bad .." , it got a bit chili, so I could see about a quarter of the viewers, slowly get up and leave , towards the last hour of the movie. However, on the Saturday night showing of "2001" , not only the court was over-filled beyond capacity ( people sat right up to the giant screen, virtually looking up !), but no one left the court before the end of the movie, even though it was much colder on that night !! Another thing that surprised me, was the average age of the viewers, to my eyes , almost 90 per cent of them, were not old enough to have seen the movie in a cinema before ( therefore , they could not have been there just for nostalgia ! ). It was commented by the organizers on the night, that "2001" attracted most viewers during the event.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Man and Superman.Arthur C,.Clarke's theory of evolution.......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whenever a movie based on a work from another medium is considered it is imperative to take into account the original source.However many times Mr S.Kubrick is referred to as a "genius" and "2001" as a "Masterpiece" his role in the production was to re - interpret another man's vision.Even if one took the Auteur theory "Reductio ad Absurdam" no movie is ever the sole work of the director. Mr Arthur C.Clarke's "The Sentinel" was written 60 years ago.At that time the only rockets were adaptations of Herr von Braun's V2 which,3 or 4 years earlier had the sole modest - if deadly - ambition of clawing its way high enough into the sky to drop on London. By the time Mr Kubrick was considering making "2001",the Apollo space programme was well under way.Of the two Mr Clarke's vision was the more imaginative and percipient. Certainly "2001" is a remarkable movie by any standards,perhaps,along with the vastly different "Alien",at the very peak of the Sci - Fi pantheon.Mr Scott's masterwork,made 11 years later,shows space travel as routine,boring and a little grubby,in complete contrast to Mr Kubrick's concept of it as a new and exciting step in freeing Mankind from the confines of Earth. Furthermore,the Clarke/Kubrick collaboration reaches far wider,no less than the elevation of Man to the next step in the evolutionary scale. Having performed some Herculean tasks the surviving astronaut is finally reborn as a"Starchild" thus marking the beginning of a new journey for the species. Generations of moviegoers have grown up whose only knowledge of the movie is via the video or more lately,DVD.However grand their Home Cinema equipment may be it can only give them a very limited idea of the magnificence of the original visuals and the almost overpowering soundtrack.Occasionally you can catch a theatrical production and I most strongly urge you to do so if possible.Only then can you appreciate the impact the movie had on my generation forty years ago. And then there's THAT cut........................</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As great as "Dr. Strangelove" and "The Shining" are, "2001" is always gonna be Kubrick's best. When it was first released, some people loved it; some people hated it; some people just didn't get it. It's one of those flicks that's anything but ordinary. It was so robbed at the Oscars for that year; it wasn't even nominated for Best Picture of the Year, but it definitely deserved that award. Nothing like it has been seen before or since, or will be seen ever again. Still, it's something I wouldn't mind seeing in a theater, preferably on a big, curved Cinerama screen or in IMAX 3D, if they ever do it someday. It doesn't look as old as it actually is at all. No CGI of any kind was used for the effects.The first couple times I saw the movie I couldn't sit through it. The Star Gate stuff at the end scared me to death. I couldn't watch it all. The trailer for the film's nationwide release gave me nightmares just by itself! Another thing about "2001" is it's funny as hell, especially at the part where Dave goes back into the Discovery manually through the emergency airlock because the HAL 9000 wouldn't let him back in through the pod bay doors. HAL realizes that he made Dave mad big-time, so much so that he disconnected him, and HAL even reconsidered Dave to "sit down calmly, take a stress pill and think things over".After I saw it with my Dad on New Year's Day 2008, we talked about it for a while, and I decided I had to get this on DVD. 4 months later, I did.If only movies were this good these days....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a real masterpiece that shows us the future of the science and the mankind and travels us around the time. Although, Kubrick is telling a lot in this film, in the reality he wanted to show us the future. Just think that many people died before the first human walked on the moon. Because of the curiosity about the future in human instinct, I'm sure that people who had seen this film on 1968 and died right before the first walk on the moon passed away happily. How many of us wouldn't like to have a time machine to see the past and the future? That is exactly what Kubrick has done in this movie. He just created a time machine and traveled us beginning from millions of years before to the future trough the time. May be I will not see the man walking on the Mars, but it is enough for me that I traveled to Jupiter by means of this fantastic movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>without doubt this is Stanley Kubrick's Best, and i think i am a little silly right now writing about this masterpiece, but i couldn't help it, i mean i had to because i watched it last night and i am still thinking about it now and i think i will be thinking about it for several days.If Kubrick was thinking about making a sequel for Dr.Srangelove then he made a sequel that is as good as the Godfather part II, it is about man vs. machine the first round the nuclear bomb knocked up man but then in this film man maintained his position as the highest creature in the universe, the scene of Dave unplugging the memory and the computer begging him not to was one of the most emotional scenes in the history of cinema.And tell me about the spectacular visual effects, that was stunning, i could easily believe this is the stuff of the year 2001, and what amazed me that the man who did the visuals was Stanley Kubrick himself and better yet he won an Oscar for that.By the end of the film Kubrick's managed to get every one thinking about the core of life and how weak and simple a human bean is, and when you think the film is getting boring, you will discover it is not.On the contrary,this film is very very fun to watch not only for adults but the visuals are attracting the kids as well, and i think if it wasn't for this movie there will not be anything as 'box office'.This is an immortal masterpiece for all ages until the end of time.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film as a story or a film as a piece of art? Ideally, both ? as is the case of Kubrick's (and A. C. Clarke's) classic 2001: A Space Odyssey. The story-seekers will find a thrilling narrative about a deep-space voyage with a provoking ending. The art connoisseurs will relish this film from its very beginning (a black screen lasting for more than two minutes is not a typical opening sequence, is it?) to the final hyper-space animation. The music enthusiasts will be pleased to hear a unique mixture of classical tunes from both Richard and Johann Strauss and micro-polyphony of 20th century composer György Ligeti (you can get a taste of his music at YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPKg2c_bRCs). I can not but agree with the user drn5 who speaks about beauty and relaxation ? the two elements that often go together. And this, in my opinion, is the main source of misunderstanding of those who tend to look only for the plot ? the simpler one, the better. Any 'artistic' elements are then accompanied by annoyed 'sorry, but we are not in an art gallery, so would you please remove this useless appendix?'. One thing is for sure ? this film is definitely not for everyone (by the way, can you think of any film that is?), but if you happen to be one of those who look for more than a story, this might be the film for you. So, relax, and immerse yourself in the hypnotising atmosphere of Kubrick's fabulous fantasy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not think much more that a 6 or so when i first saw it. i watched again on TCM a few months later and loved it. Every time i hear the music I smile. This is a movie I can see people hating. Kubrick is the kind of director that likes symbolism, realism, etc. This movie really does not have any major characters for the entire thing. we have the first act main (one of the apes) second act main (dr. Floyd) and three in the third (Dave, frank, and the infamous HAL 9000 computer system)The true only flaw is that the space sequences get dull the first time you watch them (particularly the star gate sequence. After getting used to Kubrick they seem priceless its a 10 star 80-100 minute movie brought into 2.5 hours. other than that it is flawless (particularly the special effects of the Dave jogging).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't go so much into the plot or try to answer questions that you might have about the movie or what it's about. This is something you have to figure out yourself (and it will be difficult) or search for some explanation on the internet. Although I don't think there is a definitive one! It's a lot of guessing, but not so much knowing what Kubrick was saying.But what I want to talk about, is how the movie was made. Everything is genius, from the fact, that there is no noise in space (and there isn't despite almost every other movie telling you there is, e.g. see Star Wars), to the making of some shots. A shot where it seems the camera is spinning around, it's actually the set that is build like a "spinning wheel", the camera is set in one position. But my favorite piece is the sound design! I can't compliment the movie enough on this matter! When the astronaut is breathing in one scene, I suddenly realized, that my breathing was controlled by him. My breathing was identical to the rhythmic sound of the movie. And I don't believe this was an accident, this was Kubricks genius. Of course if you watch it for the first time, you might not realize that, but if you focus on it, you will see that you breathe in the same way as the man on screen! Enough said!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was OK, but I found it to be extreeemly boring. Most of the time all the scenes are in real-time where the camera just sits still while the astronaut slowly floats to the ship, he does it for a full minuet, and I don't know if it was my DVD but the first 5 minuets is simply sounds/music on a black screen (at fist I thought the vid stream was messed up). I can imagine that the reason the scenes were so long and monotonous is because Kubrick wanted to show the audience the high-quality futuristic ships/planets/equipment, but by todays standards of sci-fi quality the props/equipment and planets look boring, only the astronaut where he fights the onboard comp, is where the movie shows some action, anyways if i would be watching this in '68 i would have prob linked it (otherwise id give it a 5)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most amazing sci-fi movie of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even in a world full of "Independence Day"s and "Star Wars" flicks, the special effects of "2001" are still inferior to none. However, the effects of "2001" are not the only mind-blowing element, thanks to a top-notch director, an astounding story, and a small but wondrous lead cast.The stars in front of the cameras may seem to be Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood as the bold Jupiter astronauts, but the real stars of the show are two inanimate objects: ultra-logical computer HAL-9000 ("whom... one addresses as Hal") and the ultra-enigmatic black monoliths scattered throughout our solar system. Stanley Kubrick rightfully favors a cerebral style over cheap mile-a-minute thrills, even though there comes a time late in the film when thrills do come around. The reason it's so good is that the thriller element never overpowers the drama, the sense of discovery, or the general legitimacy of the film's artistic capacity. Kubrick's use of classical music instead of an original score doesn't hurt, either (this is the only time I could ever actually listen to any of "The Blue Danube").The most awesome scene ever captured on film is the earth-shattering climactic sequence when man first meets something truly bigger than himself, a nonstop barrage of incredible sounds and colorful sights that still can't top the rest of the film in general. I don't know how else to explain it-- "2001" is spectacular entertainment at its best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pinnacle of science fiction cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's amazing that a film like this is from 1968. Even comparing it to the other sci-fi classic of that year, Planet of the Apes, it feels decades ahead in its visuals, its story, and its style. While Apes is fantastic, it feels like a film of the '60s, with the cheesy effects, melodramatic acting, and obvious use of soundstages. It is very much a film of its time. This one, on the other hand, could just have easily been made today. The panoramic shots of massive spaceships are breathtaking, almost a decade before Star Wars accomplished the same thing, and the amazingly accurate future inventions shown in this film reveal Kubrick's incredible vision. Undoubtedly one of the best science fiction films of all-time, and certainly a major influence upon the genre for years to come.It's certainly not an overtly entertaining or enjoyable film to watch - the long stretches without dialogue and the exceptional patience with which each scene is granted make the audience feel every one of its two and a half hours. It obviously doesn't appeal to everyone. For someone who is in awe of the care present in each scene, though, it's a breeze to sit through. The fact that the film is bookended by twenty minute-long segments of dialogue-free film doesn't bother me at all, as the images and visuals are so strong and so interesting that it makes no difference to me at all if there's dialogue or not. Plus, the dialogue that is present in the film is so purposefully inane and harmless that one is forced to focus on the visuals. Almost the entire story is presented through images; I think there's only one speech directly related to the plot.The first time I watched it, my favourite act was the third one, with HAL. That was probably due to the fact that it contained the most dialogue, had the most plot, and had that creepy robot with the eloquent speech. I thought everything else in the movie was unneeded and just dragged it down - especially that psychedelic ending. Now, I can appreciate the contribution that each act makes to the whole; how the entire story is told throughout the film. I haven't yet read the novel, but I'm interested to see just how similar it is, because this story really is quite incredible. And, though I still don't understand the ending, I can appreciate just how brilliant it is. I think I don't understand it (wholly) because we're not meant to; our first contact with extra-terrestrial will not be as linear and straight-forward as Hollywood makes it out to be, and this film reflects that.The acting is good, the dialogue is fine, and the sets are kinda dated, but this film is all about the images. From the iconic shot of the ape throwing the bone that morphs into a spaceship, to the classic appearance of HAL, to Dave's final journey to the alien intelligence, it is the visuals of this film, much more than the script, that tell the story. And, though it's nearly forty years old, it's not nearly as dated as every other film from its era. That, in itself, is an incredible accomplishment. The fact that this is a terrific film is even more amazing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without any doubt, this the best sci-fi film ever! This is the first film I bought in VHS format and later in DVD format when that became available. I was a young teenager when I first saw this gem in the theater. The ending remains somewhat cryptic. The only "cure" is to read the book and see the movie. Repeat the dose if required. Each time a somewhat different conclusion emerges. By the way, I was the first to point out a discrepancy to Mr. A C Clarke regarding HAL's commissioning date. The movie has one date, the book has a different date. Check for yourself. Kubrick composed an excellent piece of visual art. The film stands up well with the advancing years but, ... oh how I wish someone like Spielberg would create a updated remake using today's state of the art if for no other reason than to introduce a new generation to the frightening majesty of spaceflight?

Usually I get mad when I watch something with a vague ending, but since almost all of Space Odyssey is abstract in itself, it fits here. This is art, and true artists let the audience form their own opinions and come up with their own questions. With that said, I could write for hours about every aspect of Space Odyssey and what makes it rock so hard, but instead I'll sum it up with two words: HAL 9000.

		<fullReview>The subject matter about aliens watching over us and the monolith being the threshold leading to each progressive stage of human evolution is something i am rather skeptical about. In fact, the entire theory did not occur to me as i was watching the film. What did was the intensely surreal and psychedelic nature of the story that transpired before me. Perhaps it was the novelty of it, the sheer audacity to make such a film, composed almost entirely of slow-moving camera footage of space and the vagaries of our universe, which no real story or conventional plot, and with cinematography that still gives me goosebumps. It seemed almost like a nightmare at times, with the space which unlike everything else, has no beginning or end. Its we humans, our imaginations, our need to theorise, to elucidate our external reality that confines us to mortality. Yes I do admit that at one point, i started to fall asleep, but once HAL was introduced, my interest in the film rekindled. Its certainly not something i am regularly exposed to and i enjoyed the novelty of this, though i cant say that i have understood the film's content well enough.Of what i have fathomed, the film does present some intriguing questions: how has man evolved? Whats our next stage of evolution? Do machines have emotions? And if they do, does that mean they are capable of human sensations such as jealousy, apprehension and viciousness? Will they eventually rule us one day? The creation of HAL was wonderfully done. What is really ironic is that he, or it, shows more human emotions than any of the humans it interacts with on the space shuttle, suggesting that the dawn of a new era is perhaps not far away.Whatever the issue, enjoy this film for the taste it leaves behind after you watch it, of something surreal and inexplicable. Forgot to mention the usage of classical music, which adds to the lurid quality of the whole experience. Try it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched 2001 when I was twelve years old and despised it. I held such low regard for the film that I vowed to never watch it again for the rest of my life. I suppose I forgot that promise I made, as curiosity got the better of me and I revisited Kubrick's film this past summer when I was 19. I think two things are critical for viewing this movie, two things which as a twelve year old I did not possess: patience and a willingness to be open to where the story goes. 2001 is the most "different" film you will see in your life. Whenever I talk to someone who has seen it, we both find ourselves at a loss for words as to what the film was ultimately about or what it meant to us. Some might say that indicates a failure on the lack of the filmmaker, but I am inclined to disagree. I think Stanley Kubrick was wholly successful in fostering a sense of wonder and the desire to question our existence in the film, and I believe that he left the other themes as somewhat ambiguous so the audience could decide for themselves what they meant to them. I enjoyed the film on numerous levels. First, it was a brilliant slice of history- I love to watch movies that make an effort to realistically portray the future. No matter how hard they try, they always have a strong contemporary influence that might be unnoticeable at the time, but is very apparent later on. In 2001 this is certainly the case, but it delightful. There is so much optimism with the presentation of the space station, so much hope at what we might accomplish, that one is easily able to overlook the dated brand logos and garish furniture. I found an immense charm to every aspect of the universe presented in this film. It is clear that painstaking thought and detail went into the creation of every set, every prop and every interaction in the film. Which brings me to my next point. Kids will have trouble watching this movie because it is so sparse on dialogue, and plodding in its presentation. One must surrender themselves to the film and accept the fact that the movie is forcing us to view something in a completely new way. Because much of the movie is so quiet, it leaves the viewer a great deal of time to think. And more importantly, it makes the viewer pay close attention to the moments where there are dialogue and action. Because the film forces the viewer to focus in a completely new way, it makes them remember what happened in the film with much greater intensity. All modern filmmakers should remember that economy is an important thing, and that often having less leaves you with more. Truer words could not be ascribed to 2001. It has been more than six months since I last saw it, and yet I remember it with greater clarity than any film I've seen since, and find myself turning back to it and questioning what it was all about, questioning why I felt the way I did. The mark of an excellent film is one that causes you to reference it again and again in your thoughts without the outside stimulation of having to see something that will remind you of it. 2001 is sublime. It transcends what any other film has accomplished. It shows the evolution of mankind and as a result, is a very spiritual journey. This is not just some science fiction film as many would be led to believe by the fragments that popular culture has latched on to, like HAL and the space station. This is a film that documents each stage in the history of mankind, from prehistoric, to contemporary, to the ever distant future. I asks so many questions- what is the meaning of life? why do we value our existence? does one man really matter? why do we feel happy or sad? why do we care about other people? what separates man from machine? is there significance to human life in light of the enormity of the universe? where will we go after death? is there such a thing as regeneration? So many questions, and so many questions that one should ask all the time. An unexamined life is not worth living as PLato (I believe) once said. 2001 wants us to examine our lives. It wants us to think outside of our bodies and question our values and our biases. It is not a preachy film- nowhere, and may I stress this, nowhere does it tell the viewer what to hink, or make any insinuations about what the audience should be interpreting or feeling. This is a film for everyone to possess and call their own. Everyone can have an opinion about what this film is about, and no one would be wrong. It is for each person watching 2001 to decide what it =means to them. This is an experience to be shared and appreciated. I cannot believe that 2001 was made in the studio system, but it was, and it's a credit to a different era that it was made and released. It is an exquisite experience, with truly stunning special effects, all of which hold up today, and in many cases, are superior to cgi. I think it's a good thing when the viewer asks themselves, "How did they do that?" With cgi, this mysterious element disappears, and one can explain it away with computers. The fact that 2001 was made without the assistance of modern film-making tools makes it even more of a marvel.I love it, and I hope you see it and take the time to think about it too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Definitive Sci-Fi Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece and it is the definitive sci-fi classic of cinema.' '2001' is an epic journey from Prehistoric Man to Man colonizing space. The film is also a visual display mesmerizing at times like one was watching a surreal light show at a planetarium. This movie has such an important role shaping cinema that without this movie we would never have had 'Star Wars,' 'Star Trek' or even modern films like "The Matrix."One could write a term paper (I'm sure some have) on the scientific, cinematic and societal meanings in the film, but in the short review I will just say that Kubrick is a genius. And for all the things I understood and didn't understand, I can acknowledge that Kubrick was a film- maker light years beyond his peers. The movie runs at 140 minutes and there is very little dialogue considering the length. Long, overdrawn periods of silence and visual movement accompanied by music is a major theme to this movie, and it is done so well.This movie is a classic and it is a must-see for every movie fan. It is the definitive sci-fi movie. The only reason this movie does not get a 9 or 10 is because I think it is too long and I think it lacks replay value (unless one was writing a paper on it). I know the review says 8, but in actuality it would receive an 8.5/10. Great film!</fullReview>

This has got to be the slowest moving movie I've ever seen, probably due to the fact that I grew up in the era during which the technology showcased in this movie became a reality. The idea of exploring mankind's origin in the movie provided a good plot, but the storyline/script (what little of it there was), was not plausible even as fantasy. If I wanted to watch a 1960's movie which highlighted 'futuristic' technology, I guess I should have watched an original Star Trek feature.....at least the dialogue in that wouldn't put me to sleep as 2001: A Space Odyssey did. Granted, you'd have to have an 'acquired taste' for movies which involve overstated, over-emphasized artistic detail much like one develops an acquired taste for beer. As I was watching the movie I simply became overwhelmed by the conundrum of combining a plausible story idea with a weak, almost non-existent dialogue from the actors. Big yawner!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know there are others who despise this movie, and I can understand why. We're not all the same and therefore do not expect the same "output" from every movie we watch. Sometimes when I sit down to a movie, I don't just want to be entertained - I want it to ask me questions, to raise my curiosity and place my thoughts somewhere they haven't been before.2001 has been the ultimate in providing this. From the very beginning, ie. the "black nothingness", it is making you wonder, making you use your imagination, filling you with a mixture of hope and of dread. Kubrick was an intelligent director and wanted to make you "add" to the atmosphere of his films with your imagination. He couldn't stand putting it all on a plate for you. In that respect he was a poet as well as a director.I first saw this film after I first saw Star Wars, and although Star Wars blew me away as a child with it's rendition of space and it's visual effects - it paled in comparison to Kubrick's space-scapes. There's no speeding crafts and explosions with battle music, there's gentle pace and movement with Strauss' Blue Danube waltzing through your senses. These combinations of visual and aural stimulation sucked me in as a kid and still do when I watch it today. I know the visual effects are dated today, but I can still admire their beauty and craft.After watching this film, Kubrick became a genius to me, and I continue to wonder at his movies still.I'm not going into a dissection of 2001, but in summary it still raises questions (more so than answers, and that's the point!), and creates so much intrigue in our own humanity and evolution - more so than any other movie has or probably ever will.Whether you think you will hate this film, you still have to watch it in my opinion. It will give you something to take away whether you like it or not. I wish there were more mainstream movies like this. Hollywood is getting very dull...</fullReview>

The "futuristic" of 1968 seems ludicrous at times. In reality we've had less space travel but a lot more social and linguistic change, and even technology has developed in a manner unforeseen by Clarke or the designers. Pan-Am, Kenneth Kendall on BBC 12 and the clipped RP the announcers use, the 60's-ish fashions. All amusing stuff. No mobile phones either.2001 is a marvellous piece of work - intelligent and quirky. It shows once again how the brain-dead studio system with its dumbed down garbage movies act against all our interests. The genius of people like Kubrick keeps culture going, because his kind of film lasts. And in the end makes more money than a dozen short-term market exploitation efforts</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a great film. Few movies come as close to this for atmosphere. Kubrick manages to provide an excellent story played out over 2 and a half hours of superb screenplay. The real highlight is the score, a series of classical pieces, including Strauss. The many moral or ethical questions posed by the film are open to debate and I will not walk too far down the path of amateur psychologist. All I will say is, I think the film was about man's conflict with technology and all the issues that entails. Hal, the demented computer, is brilliant. Chilling and distant, Hal is an ideal 'baddy'. The film is not one for those with short attention spans with long sequences of no speech and often silence. It's great stuff though. The central plot concerns a mission in space which promises to find out startling new things about the universe: Hal's job is to safeguard the mission, even from the crew themselves. This is where the conflict originates. The crew question Hal's sanity and decide to switch him down. In a highly chilling scene, however, he lipreads the plotters intentions and takes 'suitable' action to stop them. The struggles between the last surviving crew member and Hal are highly entertaining and tension-packed. For such an old film, this looks good as well. The apes at the start are clearly there to provide the most imaginative scene-leap ever. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is definitely a great film. The special effects in it were groundbreaking for the day and are still impressive even now. The combination of visuals with music works just as beautifully now as it always has.However, I have heard people call this the greatest sci-fi film ever. I have heard people call this one of the most thought provoking films ever. I have heard people complain about modern films for having nothing to them beyond special effects, but then praise 2001.The film is overrated. If you really look at it, you'll realise that the film does not really raise any deep thought-provoking issues, it simply suffers from a almost non-existent narrative. If you read the book this will become very clear to you. It was originally considered to include a narration over the top of the film.For this reason and the fact that there is little to no character development, this cannot be called the greatest sci-fi film ever and it is outmatched by masterpieces like Blade Runner or Brazil. Even David Lynch's Dune could be considered superior, as it succeeds in many of the areas where 2001 fails.That said, it is still a bloody good film and a visual masterpiece.</fullReview>

As a piece of art I guess it would be fine but to actually pay money to see it would be a stretch.I try to have an open mind when viewing films and I may have a bias because of the times we live in today, but if you can't figure out what the film is about then the filmmaker failed and this film fails.I'm not asking for the "meaning" to be handed to me on a plate but one needs to see a basic structure in order to suggest a meaning in the viewers mind.The first part of the film with the apes, I could see the point being made. The part of the film set on the ship with HAL was another good bit of story telling. The parts in between added nothing to the plot.It really reminded me of the film "Empire" or even "****" both by Andy Warhol where every detail is shown no matter how useless it is to the story. The part of 2001 where we follow Dr. Floyd on his trip first to the space station and then to the moon - it is almost like watching it in real time. I'm bothered by the current fashion of the music video fast cuts but did we really need to see Floyd's moon transport being lowed into the moon base after it lands? I do like Stanley Kubrick's films and he is a great director but many of his later films were more coherent than 2001. I'm glad he got better over the long run - "Eyes Wide Shut" being the exception of course.</fullReview>

I'd heard good things, obviously, but it struck me as being images for the sake of it and a rather anaemic progression through a rather trivial plot. Subsequent viewings, however, slowly revealed those things that most of the reviews I had read had raved about. Even if the movie is not coupled with a reading of the novel (which, as we know, tells a similar but non-identical story), there is a plethora of detail that one encounter will not reveal, like the whole life-cycle/evolution thing, the attempt at objectification of the mystery of human spirituality and the importance of having a nice lunch; it's all there in glorious Cinerama.About a dozen viewings in, I watched it with my wife, who'd never seen it before and wasn't really in to the arty movie scene, and that gave me an opportunity to see it as the dated piece of 60's optimism it also always was, and that both cheered and amused me and I realised it was a movie that probably did have everything after all. I'm still happy to classify it as a true work of art, and not simply a technological marvel, though - its coverage of universal themes is unmatched in the sci-fi cannon, the soundtrack is awesome and I shall always be grateful that my wife forced me to have fantastic sex for three hours after I made her endure 'a really stupid film'.Extremely recommended.Hayfax_Jo</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, some people could argue with me that "2001: A Space Odyssey" isn't the greatest movie ever, but all the elements are here in order to provide an experience that challenges any comparison.Almost a silent movie, "2001" is a unique trip into the unexplored areas of outer-space. But the film doesn't begin in the future, but in the far-away past. Director Stanley Kubrick depicts men at the ape stage, which existed 4 million years ago. That's maybe the most ancient representation of mankind ever presented. The ape make-up is so well done that we all could be confused. Just to say it, make-up artists weren't nominated to the Oscars, because the judges were all certain that these were real monkeys...Parallels between ancient and future times include man's existence and wandering inside an hostile and dangerous world. And his need of evolving. But Kubrick puts his pessimist mood by showing us as unable of evolving by ourselves. We need outside intervention (aliens never shown) in order to accomplish our destiny.Black monoliths are the objects used by the hidden aliens in order to make humans evolving. First time, ape-men become able of using bones as tools and weapons. Second time, world scientists create the space ship Discovery I for outer-space exploration and they hope that they will find the monolith's signification. The third one is a gate throughout space and time and the final one rises astronaut David Bowman (Keir Dullea) to the next level.But "2001" is a fantastic voyage into reflexion and meditation, which means that it's not everyone who's able of enjoying it. Those who expect that space should be used as a playground or as an extreme fight terrain will be strongly deceived when they see that space is only a background to man's research for his own existence and destiny."2001" is to cinema what "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" is to music. Both items are the epitome of the 60's counterculture and there is a strong psychedelic mood that translates well on screen or on gramophone. The Star Gate sequence is the best example, with its surrealist sequences of geometrical colored motifs and abstract landscapes. But the themes reflect also the new cultural values which promote introspection and disputes over traditional values.Realism is strongly flagrant. Especially in the sound process. Probably the only movie that really shows space as a fully empty place, Kubrick presents universe as a great black danger, with its desolated landscapes and dead, almost haunted atmospheres.Kubrick wasn't an Oscar favorite, but he strongly deserves the Visual Effects Award that he received for "2001". Futuristic computers, spaceships, furniture and costumes are eye-catching and imaginative. But the best special FX of the movie (and perhaps of all time) are presented in the final twenty-five minutes. These are the spectacular and unbelievable slit-scan star-gate, which is a psychedelically colored gate towards time and space, and also the spatial events, such as the birth of a supernova.The best character of the movie, surprisingly, is not a human being. It's HAL, the ultra-perfected computer that runs the Discovery spaceship. He's so obsessed by his quest for perfection that he wouldn't hesitate to get ridden of anyone who would threaten him. He also leads the viewer to ask himself/herself many questions: is it safe to create computers and machines that are more and more perfected? And do we depend on them? Questions, questions, questions... Answers, there aren't any. At least, they're not revealed. We have to figure them out by ourselves. And do not hope that a monolith will appear and give you an answer. In a time where psychedelic music would be the ultimate escape, "2001" was the symbol of a society that entered into a great phase of questions about itself and it still is today. That's the power and the possibilities of Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece. "The Ultimate Trip" still is an adequate nickname and, with its unforgettable sequences, its gripping realism, its visually dazzling shots, its strongly meditative mood and its legacy beyond compare, "2001" is nothing else than the greatest movie ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kubrick did a masterpiece, and prove the unreal on the adaptation of Arthur Clarke's novel. When I saw it for the first time, I was 14 years old and the journey to Jupiter made me sleep. Now I have seen it for 3 times and i still get astonished. First of all, Kubrick's filmography is great (The Shining, Paths of Glory, Full Metal Jacket, The Killing etc.) He has direct mostly all cinematography's genres.In 2001..., he has shown how humanity learn to live and adapt to its hemisphere, and how humanity evolves. First we saw the apes and its behaviors then we saw the astronauts learning how to eat, walk and pee on utilizer's, their basic needs. Dave and moon-watcher (ape's leader) are the stronger characters in different ages. Moonwatcher deals and fights with a leopard, Dave is defeated in chess by HAL. Dave in his mission in Jupiter will become a superhuman (Nietszche' Zaratustra) The mission will test them, who they really are and if they are strong enough to reach the next level.HAL's character is very important. Come on, if you add a letter to HAL's name you got IBM. HAL is the only character with feelings and emotions; he is testing Dave every time, indeed he is also trying to figure it out if he knows about the purpose of the mission.It's visual effects are great, Kubrick's vision is awesome. And every time you watch it, you will find something new. *****Highly recommended. Also try the whole Kubrick's filmography. You will find that his movies concern and deals with fights (war, sex fights, and in 2001 is human vs machines and human wills.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2001: The First Chink In Kubrick's Armor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's life as a director can easily be charted in an up and down graph that looks like one large (if not evenly measured) pyramid.The up side begins from his start with a few documentaries, then rises quickly with The Killing (1956), and Paths of Glory (1957).It then soars to his peak with masterpieces like Spartacus (1960), Lolita (1962), and Dr. Strangelove (1964).The Kubrick career chart shows its first slowdown, however, with the dull, plodding 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), which irked many film goers by its refusal to explain what the heck those dumb "monoliths" where supposed to mean.From then on things went even more downhill for him.A Clockwork Orange (1971) was a muddled mess of sexism and violence, Barry Lyndon (1975) was a snore-inducing swashbuckler that buckled under Kubrick's bad decision to use "available light" in most shots, The Shining (1980) was a weak attempt at horror (certainly not Kubrick's style at all), even prompting Shining author Stephen King to later do his own version of the script (1997).Then came Full Metal Jacket (1987), a piece of belated back- biting about Vietnam (produced about 15 years too late), and his finale flop, Eyes Wide Shut (1999), starring the sickeningly sweet married couple Cruise and Kidman.Had he lived, another even worse bomb was next up, called A.I. (2001). It was such an overdone can of stale spam that even the great Steven Spielberg (a sci-fi movie veteran) couldn't save it, when he later finished it for Kubrick.In short, Kubrick should have stopped right after Dr. Strangelove.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick's Magnum Opus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I used to love Stanley Kubrick - thought he was the greatest director in the world. Every film he had done was gold, in my eyes, and impervious to any criticisms leveled against them. Those were notions through the filter of adolescence. Fairly often, as we grow older, we grow away from those things that appeal to us as teenagers and rightly so, for aren't teenagers incompletely formed adults? Yes, they are and so their tastes will not yet be fully matured as well.Watching most of Stanley Kubricks work with an older mind and aged eyes, I find myself disappointed more often than not. This man that once thought A Clockwork Orange to be pushing the limits of cinema now finds it an exploitative mess that completely loses sight of what its satire attempts to bring down. Its violence and violent sex titillate the audience (that would be why I adored it as a teenager) - they don't ask us to question the images on scree and that's, actually, dangerous film-making. That and Clockwork is, visually, very unimpressive. Those of you taken aback by the photographic brilliance of his other films are bound to be let down.Age does not favor Kubrick's other films as well - Full Metal Jacket (has been and always will be half a great movie), Spartacus (beautiful but ultimately lifeless), and the Shining (bo-ring) have not stood my test of time. Strangelove is still funny and Barry Lyndon a solid bit of film, but best of all continues to be 2001: A Space Odyssey.Certainly, it's an abtruse and esoteric film, but it's also beautiful, puzzling, and brilliant on a thematic level. It is, perhaps, the greatest exploration of science fictive ideals in the history of film; it's certainly the most intelligent. And did I mention that it's visually stunning? The stylization of the prehistoric era, as well as the attention to minutiae in the future scenes, are impeccable. Kubrick had an amazing vision and, using the limited resources afforded directors in 1968, he achieved it. This is one of the most visually arresting films ever made.The story itself is negligible (it's interesting, involving mankind's repeated encounters with strange, black monolithic rocks that those rocks relation to our evolution), but it's there. As someone said, though, a movie is not about the plot, it's how it is about the plot. The how, in 2001, as I have said, is amazingly beautiful. The images are beautiful and the tone claustrophobic. It's like watching a painting move.And yet it is not just a visual experience for the audience. It's a sonic and emotive experience as well. The grating classical score that accompanies encounters with the monolith, for example, is the greatest use of music in a film and the use of Strauss' ballet for the docking sequence is a stroke of genius. Furthermore, this film, and the tension Kubrick builds with the sparest plot imaginable, drain the audience. Watching 2001physically drains you. See it on a big screen (one of the 5 greatest movie moments in my life) and you'll see what I'm talking about.2001: A Space Odyssey is one of the greatest motion pictures of all time and should be required viewing of everyone. It's intelligent, beautiful, and visceral. I can't think of any other film that has those qualities in such abundance. Watch it tomorrow, please.</fullReview>

This was the film I had been waiting for all my life (I was 16 at the time) . Clarke had always been my favourite author and his poetic writing is perfectly captured in the film. Arthur describes exploding stars, ancient oceans and awakening life with clarity , vision and artistry.

I had read about all these things for year reading Arthur C Clarkes many novels never really believing that a movie would ever be like one of these books. After all movies have to have monster , hero's and beautiful women turning up in the most unlikely places. . . .Until this movie. I was quite dazed when I walked out of that cinema but not so dazed that I did not hear the best comment I have ever heard made about the movie. It went something like this. . .Parent to 13 year old boy."Did you enjoy it Tommy?"Tommy "Mmmmmmmmmmmmm"Parent "But did you understand it?"Tommy " Don't be silly!

This is easily the greatest, grandest and most poetic piece of science fiction ever put to celluloid. A work of art in every sense of the term, it has so much to say about where mankind has been and where it is going.This is one film that simply defies being picked apart and analyzed. If you haven't seen it yet, please do so on a "slow Sunday" when you're relaxed and ready to view an epic sort of film (something on the order of "10 Commandments"). Then just settle in and view one genius filmmaker's conception of the scientific and the spiritual, and where they ultimately meet in the great story that is Mankind.An easy 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What in freaking hell was that?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie started off with one bizarre, seemingly pointless sequence of events then finished with another one. The only interesting and enjoyable part of the movie with the HAL plot in the middle of the film.The effects, for 1968, were very nice. Slow and labourious maybe, but nice enough. But I'm afraid that doesn't make a good film. People are going to look back in 20 years at fluff like the Matrix, when the effects will be outdated, and see that there's virtually nothing beneath that shiny surface.**SPOILERS**I really don't know what to make about this film. The monkey sequence, with a bunch of what are obviously guys in monkey suits, beating up a skeleton for 20 minutes or so, what was that? It has something to do with the evolution of man, but I don't see why it had to go for so long.Then the HAL subplot, where it actually got good briefly. That was some scary stuff. Then HAL finally gets shut off, and the rest of the movie was completely weird and seemingly pointless. We get a bunch of visual and optical effects for half an hour, interspersed with shocked, horror filled glimpses of the space man.Then he arrives in some big white box where he watches himself, over the course of 10 minute or so, grow old and die and get reborn as some giant foetus planet thing.Roll credits.What the hell?I can only guess this again has something to do with evolution, and makes the opening strange monkey scene semi-relevant, but frankly this movie left me wondering what the hell I just saw. Not in a thought provoking way, but in mere bewilderment. A good movie will leave you asking questions, but none of those questions should be "what the hell just happened?". Anyone can make a movie that doesn't make sense and try to pass it off as philosophical or interpretive or abstruse - but that doesn't mean it's any of those things.I'll reserve judgment for now. I'm watching 2010 to see if it can shed some light on any of the events in this film, but as a whole I have to say it's just confusing, lacking any real story, and seems to be more of abstract film art than a movie.4 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie for the first time yesterday and have to say I'm disappointed. maybe for the time it was a visual breakthrough for film, and maybe it covered uncharted territory, but it's not that good. this should have been a 45 minute movie, but Kubrick (who is overated on most of his movies) turned this into a load of crap. like others, I found myself fast forwarding through most of the movie. I really now can appreciate what Mel Brooks accomplished in Spaceballs.There are some positives...like when we see HAL reading the lips of dave and peter, that was pretty freaky. the ending sequences are shot beautifully, and for sci-fi I can see how it influenced other films.But it is SO BORING TO WATCH. if Kubrick had started the movie with a quick scene of the apes and monolith and then gone directly to the scene with the board meeting it would have made this a much better film. it was grossly long and is not a great film overall. there are great aspects, but not as a whole. that is a fallacy of composition. just because some parts are great, it doesn't make the whole thing great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seriously. What can be said about this movie that hasn't been already? I shudder to think how any other director would've handled this project. Possibly the only other visionary who'd come close would be David Lynch. Nah, too radical. Tim Burton? Too sophomoric--that and he would've had too much fun with the monkeys. How about Stan (the Man) Kubrick? Possibly.Kubrick does here what he probably has wanted to all his directing career. Create a purely visual experience without the annoyance of dialogue. He also proves himself a master of classical music (indeed, between this and 'A Clockwork Orange' he proves that he knows how notes and images can be the most powerful tools) without using the annoyance of contemporary music. Indeed, many of the spaces scenes seem like music videos for Beethoven, Mozart, and others.Entertainment: You do not watch this for entertainment, plain and simple. This is a soul-searching journey that might leave you stuck by the wayside if you can't understand it. I will say this once and once only..."YOU ONLY GET OUT OF THE MOVIE HOW YOU REACT TO THE CHANGES, THIS ISN'T GOING TO SLAP YOU UPSIDE THE HEAD AND SAY 'THIS IS WHAT IT'S ABOUT!'"If, after seeing this, you haven't had any kind of thoughts as to the purpose of humanity in this solar system, then you have missed the forest for the trees and the sky for the stars.On the other foot: This is Sci-Fi in the purest form. There is no enslavement to other genres such as horror, suspense, or action. Just the purpose of the science fiction field and that, of course, is the future of humanity and how our actions affect it. I have said enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somehow, a boring science fiction movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I got to see this movie last night and let me tell you, it was a terrible disappointment. It had the three elements that make for a cool sci-fi movie: Spaceships, a Homicidal Computer, and Monkeys. But somehow, it was off the mark.Maybe my own expectations were too high. I tend to love space movies. Forbidden Planet, Flesh Gordon, Event Horizon, Star Wars Episode II Attack of the Clones (best in series!), for me, practically any movie with a spaceship is worth checking out.I've seen other movies by this director (Stanley Kubrick) that were really cool. Full Metal Jacket was a great war adventure movie, and Eyes Wide Shut is still the best Tom Cruise/Nicole Kidman flick. But I guess even decent directors are entitled to one turkey. 2001 is Kubrick's turkey. Here's why:1: Boring Monkeys - The monkeys didn't do anything cool or interesting, they just got all freaked out at this big black box thing. The scene felt "tacked on," like the director wanted to make the movie longer for some reason. If you're gonna have monkeys, at least put them on a space-ship and have them do funny stuff, like the space-monkey in the Lost in Space movie (a far superior sci-fi!)2: Boring Spaceships - The spaceships in this movie moved very slowly, vey quietly, and had no hull-mounted laser cannons. Like they didn't want to spend money on good special effects.3. Boring Homicidal Computer - When a robot goes haywire and starts killing people, there should be a shower of sparks and a robot voice saying things like "Crush...Kill...Destroy!" The HALBOT 9000 or whatever it's called just looks like a red light mounted on the wall. What an utter lack of imagination on the director's part.Also, to make the movie still even longer, there's this trippy, overly long scene at the end where the surviving astronaut (SPOILER ALERT!) sees himself as an old man and a fetus. He also sees the big black cornflake box, to give the movie kind of a trick ending. Two stars out of 10 for 2001 a Space Odyssey. Rent Battle Beyond the Stars or Independence Day instead.</fullReview>

There are just too many flaws (like the really bad cuts in the opening sunrise sequence) to call it great. The characters are unbelievably flat, the dialogue is no better than trite and the incredible adventure being shown on the screen elicits nothing more than controlled comment from robots. These are the same generation of astronauts, remember, who managed their way through Apollo 13. Comparing the characters offered by the screenwriters makes painfully obvious how much of a cartoon we were offered in 2001. I'm sure the film hasn't changed, but I have. But what it might look like with some modern effects and plausible character development is something we'll never enjoy. Sad.</fullReview>

And I'm a great fan of Kubrick. Movies like A Clockwork Orange and The Shining are brilliant. But 2001: A Space Odyssey is truly a bad movie. Why? It has no point. It has no story. It is badly directed. All this movie does is show off Kubrick's ability to create nice 'pictures'. Sure, the effects are nice, and some scenes inside the spacecraft are brilliantly made. But all this movie has are tons of effects and NO STORY, NO POINT. I like metaphors and I'm not stupid, but I don't see the point of this film. This is a film about special effects. Don't waste your time watching this movie. Instead buy 'Rama' or 'Childhood's End' (yes, these are books) and read them. Now THAT's science fiction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not understand the appeal of this movie. Yes, it's beautiful to look at, and at the time the special effects must have been absolutely dazzling because they're still pretty good by today's standards, but man oh man this seriously might be the dullest film I have ever seen. Don't get me wrong, I like long movies, and my attention span is definitely not short, but there is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING driving this film: no plot, no characters, no revelations, no statements, no themes. It's like an absence of experience... except the experience of watching perfectly shot but painstakingly slow models and people moving through cool looking but not-cool-enough-to-just-look-at-forever starscapes and spaceship sets. As is often the case with Kubrick movies (THE SHINING be a big exception, and thus brilliant), there is virtually no character development or depth, but in this film even the actors seem to be moving through a daze where they can't register emotions or be any more interesting than the auteur's concept so you can't even enjoy this film for the performances- which mind you, aren't bad, just totally non-existant, as if they were afraid of detracting, somehow, from all the really slow moving models of space stations. Ultimately that sentiment sums up my feelings about this movie as a whole: not bad, certainly there seems to be some merit because everything is so pretty and done with such seriousness, but finally, in the end, there isn't really anything to enjoy here or latch onto- even the wonderment of space seems sort of lackluster once all the trippy visuals begin and then the movie segues into a lame, psuedo-mysterious ending. You never really care about the people being presented- what happens to them, what they're thinking about, etc- and thus, it's really hard to care about the ideas, let alone the virtually non-existant and mostly unexplained story. Good art should make you care- be that in a positive or negative way- and this movie just leaves me totally cold. It's beautiful, but utterly and totally hollow, glossed over with a heavy dose of dull.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to appreciate watching 2001</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To help those people who have problems watching and enjoying 2001 :1. PROBLEM : You find the sequence you are watching uneventful. SOLUTION : Rewind the cassette and watch it again. Every sequence is full of detail, but it is carefully revealed, as you would experience it if were you really there.2. PROBLEM : The space sequences are boring. SOLUTION : Turn off the lights. Put yourself into the frame. No other medium can give you the same sensation of being in space and the experience is probably as close as you will ever get to being there.3. PROBLEM : The film is too slow. SOLUTION : This is perhaps because you have experienced n other films which never give you the chance to look and understand what you are seeing. 2001 is a film that shows you things, but you need to be in a receptive frame of mind to watch it. Reflect that maybe you were not in the right frame of mind to watch it today, and save the film for another day.4. PROBLEM : There is no story SOLUTION : Don't look for a story. It's a discovery, and we discover the mystery of this film at the same pace as the participants. It helps if you haven't read the book before watching the film.5. PROBLEM : I don't understand the story SOLUTION : Read the bookWatch this film twice, if you like it more the second time, watch it again. This is a film that will grow and grow - and the number of films that can do that are very very rare indeed...Good luck</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So what?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not having seen this film until 2001; I'm compelled to enquire as to what is the big deal? We all know Stanley Kubrick was a weird man in many ways, but this film is just decidedly average.Other than some of the visual effects which are spectacular, and the fact that it was OK in parts aboard the spaceship, the rest of it was rather boring and nothing special.The video is true to the film ... down to the point of the 10 minute blacked out section in the middle with music playing and a title in the screen saying "Intermission"!That's taking realism a little far.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie has its great scenes that I liked very much. But...But the last part of the movie is a pain. It dumps meaningless absurdity on you. Even more annoyingly, it does so with an air that a "deep message" is given. But you don't get the message of course, because there is no message. This could be bearable if it did not get very boring towards the very end, but it does.In any event, a must see, at the least for the reason that it is such a classic. &gt;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great but long and dated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arthur C. Clarke said "If you understand 2001 completely, we failed. We wanted to raise far more questions than we answered." And 2001 did just that, a wonderful special movie that was way a head of its time in story, music and special effects. Stanley Kubrick had a bad habit of making long movies that meandered and needed to be cut some and 2001 was one of those movies, as a child when I saw this movie the great scenes were great but the boring scenes were very very boring and now as an adult I have not changed that thought. This movie was great for it's time but now coming up on 2001 it is badly dated</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now I love a high-minded film as much as anyone, but 2001 didn't grab me like it did zillions of others. In fact, it's confusing and unclear, and expects the watcher to make huge leaps in mind-reading. I had no idea what the ending was about (even though I've seen the movie 3 times) until another review summed it up. And I still think it's weird. If you're looking for intelligent sci-fi, I'd suggest Contact.I hope I don't get lynched by the 2001 fans out there. Sorry, guys, but I think I speak for a *lot* of people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2001: A suck odyssey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start out with, Stanley Kubrick was one of a kind and great at what he did. He made many great movies that really set the bar for what film can do and all of it was out of the box. But, this movie is no good. To todays viewers it is too slow, too vague, and too boring to be worth watching. What makes this movie special was that it was the first of its kind and nothing like this had been done before. Now it is old hat. I sat through this movie hoping there would be at least some tiny redeeming plot at the end, but there wasn't. Most of the symbolism didn't come through. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone unless they were really interested in film. This is unlike anything I have ever seen before and just for creativity and quality alone it deserves at least a 4. But otherwise not worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High-Concept Bullshit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me explain the title of this review. Apart from the tedious pacing and wooden characterization (which can be looked at as deliberate stylistic choices albeit poor ones), there's that "No, you just don't understand what it's about because you didn't read the book, the whole thing is really about..." defense which so many of its defenders fall back on. That's what I'm referring to in the title. If it's true and the sequence at the end is the astronaut ending up in an alien zoo and so on and so forth, it's flawed because there's no way to infer that from what you're watching with no outside knowledge.I have no problem with inscrutable movies, where the baffling imagery and narrative are purely abstract and intended to provoke visceral subconscious reactions but don't strictly "mean" anything. I have no patience at all for decoder-ring allegory, wherein the "meaning" is concrete but not conveyed by the work itself, and the intellectual exercise is reduced to "Oh! This means this, and that means that, and..." It's just a cheap and lazy type of artistry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I actually waded through this movie in my early teens I could no longer watch it. And yes, I do like "slow" movies with extended scenes to add to the atmospheric nature. I'm not a fan of the modern shoot-em-up sci-fi genre. I do have a brain (I'm a 2200+ elo chess player). I am capable of understanding the thought processes of a director and I am not a soap opera watching moron. The fact of the matter is that this film is slow, boring, and absolutely miss-able. I agree fully that most fans of this awful movie have been struck down with The Emperor's New Clothes syndrome and need to get out more. It is tedious to the extreme. It is overrated and would make watching a nail rust in the rain seem worthwhile. In case I haven't made myself clear; this time bloated waste of an evening is a none film. Fans of it can criticise my intellectual capacity all they like. They are as wrong about me as they are about this awful movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is it: Kubrick's masterstroke. Science fiction's magnum opus and quite possibly the greatest film of all.The opening credits is a moment of perfection. Like nothing else in cinema it makes my hair stand on end and brings me close to tears. How Kubrick managed this, to birth such a powerful beginning in mere seconds, amazes me. The sun peaking over the planet's edge to the tune of Strauss' Thus Spake Zarathustra -- it practically screams "dawn of man" without ever saying a word.Out of this is spawned an incredible journey through mankind's evolution. Technically marvelous, every detail is accounted for and engineered for a purpose. The innovation of "2001" saturates the film in every frame. The silence of space, the technologies of the future, the foreseeing of man's utter reliance on machines. There is no other film with as great a scope.Before science fiction was tenable "2001" made it so. Before we landed on the moon Kubrick took us there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A stunning, spectacular, psychedelic, intense, and fascinating trip into outer space, "2001: A Space Odyssey" remains not only the greatest science fiction film, but also one of, if not the, greatest films ever to grace our screens. I kid you not.Every shot is filled with beautiful scenery and effects (that are still impressive today), that will stimulate your mind and make you ask yourself the purpose of life. How? Why? You will have to see it to believe it. The best thing about this movie is that it is daring, DARING, to show such questions off in an abnormal manner towards an unexpected audience. "Why are we here? How did we came to be? Are we creations of God? Are we our own God?". Yes, it is as philosophical as they say.I am simply stunned at some other people's comments. Bored? BORED?! You say? Shocking. You are one of Hollywood's victims, watching most of their propaganda that either makes people joyfully glee or kicking each others' guts out with stupid comedy or political references shown in their films. No. Get a life. Watch this film. Ask yourself the meaning of life. Repeated viewings are required to get the full message. Each new viewing gives new questions and new answers. The slow pace of the film is necessary for you to absorb these questions and answers. Yes, this is a calling, told visually.What director Stanley Kubrick has done here is too good for mere words. He and co-creator Arthur C. Clarke became science fiction masters, right after this film, and it is easy to see from here. The film shows visually stunning sequences, mixed in with beautiful, harrowing and haunting music to create a spectacular, exquisite and wondrous event for the senses. This is not just any film, this is film art at its best.From the lavish set design that is all-too realistic, to the grim realization that it brings forth, this film is magical. A moment not to lose as you find yourself in the deepest chasms of outer space, from a space station to the deep end of Jupiter. Also, man's evolution is made evident with the Dawn of Man sequence, also masterfully interpreting primitive apes who use bones as weapons, then the famous "jump cut" shows a nuclear/laser satellite over the mid-air bone. Showing a "weapon of mass destruction" prophecy. It seems all too real now.Space exploration. The film was made in 1968, and is set in 2001. Although that time limit has come and pass, some, but not most, of the things shown in the film are not invented yet. It still shows that mankind still has a long way to go even after all those inventions and progresses, both in real-life and on the screen. The Final Frontier, as Star Trek would put it. Man may not conquer it. But we can experience its beauty.Technically speaking, it ticks all the boxes. The scope is wide. The effects are great. The cinematography is beautiful. The music is haunting. Keir Dullea's makes us feel for his character. The villainous HAL 9000 is cold and chilling to the bone, like the icy cold of space. The direction is mesmerizing. The script sublime. The shocks genuine. The chills up your spine it brings. The majesty of it all. Who am I kidding? Word's simply will not do this piece of art justice.If this does not gain a position in the Top 20, never mind the Top 250, I urge you movie fans out there to see this film. It's an absolute must. If you don't, consider yourself a liar if you claim that you're a fan of science fiction, movies, or art, whatever the cause. It's a film event that must be behold by all, told by a master filmmaker, who truly is one of, if not the, greatest filmmaker who ever lived.The film has inspired numerous films, like "Star Wars", "Alien", "Blade Runner", and "Close Encounters of the Third Kind". Even it's theme of questioning human existence is explicitly delivered in the almost-equally masterful anime franchise "Neon Genesis Evangelion", which I urge anyone to see if they liked this film. But really, this film is the great-granddaddy of them all. It shows science fiction in a serious light, and eroding any shred of camp value of the '40s and '50s.Forget George Lucas. Step aside, Steven Spielberg. Move over, Ridley Scott and James Cameron. Stanley Kubrick is The Man and you better believe it.People, this film is apothetical.Overall: 10/10</fullReview>

The zero gravity rotating chambers, the illuminated flooring, the cock-pit controls. wow.So much beautiful time, work, and love was put into the making of this movie. a film that makes one rethink life itself.

Everything about this movie is genius. The story is captivating and wonderful from start to finish. Some may say it's a little slow but I loved every detail. There are so many different feelings and emotions that come along with this movie, it's almost overwhelming. I loved the visuals and anyone would be crazy not to.

		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey" is rightly recognized as a cinema classic. It is a film that everyone should see at least once though those who appreciate it will certainly not restrict themselves to a single viewing.In fact, given the complexity of the story, multiple viewings are recommended. The plot is relatively simple (at least until the later stages) but it is the underlying themes that will occupy your thoughts. The film leaves much up to the interpretation of the viewer, so there is plenty of material to ruminate upon.This is a film that says a lot by saying very little. There isn't much dialogue and sound of any kind is typically kept to a minimum. The story is mostly told in a visual manner, at times augmented by deftly chosen music. In particular, the segments supported by Strauss's 'Blue Danube' waltz are among the most beautiful ever committed to celluloid.Overall, Kubrick's direction is impeccable, as is the cinematography. Amazingly, the special effects (which earned the film it's sole Oscar) are strikingly realistic, even by today's standards. The music is also top-notch, not to mention genuinely iconic.The actors don't have a lot to do but they perform their roles admirably. Ironically, the most memorable role is the super-computer HAL, which conveys more with a voice than many actors do with their full range of body language.I've written this after seeing the film for the third or fourth time but only the first on the big screen. Let me tell you, if you ever get a chance to see this film in a theatre don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating, Mind Blowing, Exceptional, Unprecedented, Quirky Masterpiece of Cinema..One of the most important films of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After recently watching this for the second time, my opinion of it has wildly changed. My first impression was mediocrity and that it was just a random orchestration of wild images. Yet after watching it again with closer convictions, I've epiphanised that not only is this much higher than mediocrity, this is one of the most influential and important films ever made.The Film starts with the dawn of man in which a group of primates are shown surviving in the wilderness of early earth. Then the monolith mystically appears, this enigma causes awe by the primates. This sense of extraordinary awe is increased by Kubricks exceptional choice of music. Shortly after, the first act of weaponry is discovered through a primate picking up a bone and using it violently...this is the birth of human intelligence.Then the story of astronaut Bowman is ensued which involves the iconic figure of HAL. I would try to expand on the story line but it's simply a film you need to watch yourself.These monoliths that appeared in the dawn of man appear three times throughout the film, Kubrick stated that these monoliths symbolise a method of alien intelligence observing the development of human kind, yet it should be stressed that interpretation is PURELY subjective.This is a very visual film hence why it won the 1968 Oscar for visual effects. The effects are simply awe-inspiring and dazzling. The first 25 minutes of the film have no dialogue and the last 23 minutes also have no dialogue. With the beginning and end included, there is 88 minutes of non-dialogue in the whole film!. Is this lack of dialogue a thing to be criticised with?. No, these beautiful scenes of melded imagery and sound make this a groundbreaking accomplishment of epic proportions.Why is this considered as one of the greatest films of all time?. Well its an original insight into the existence of earth and also about the life outside of earth. This film will make you wonder and think, it throws more questions at you than answers much like the reason for our existence. This is one of the greatest Sci-Fi film ever made (yes as good if not better than star wars) and i believe this is one of Kubrick's very best cinematic achievements.Bravo Kubrick! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unparalleled Sci-Fi Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a profoundly intellectual and stylized motion picture that will remain a classic for all cinema history, long after all other space sci-fi yarns have been forgotten.OK, so the film has a horribly glacial pace, especially when compared to most of today's films that obsessively whirl by at a frantic pace. The sequel "2010" has a faster pace, but is an utterly forgetful movie. Also "2001" may be too cerebral and abstruse in this age where people swoon over computer special effects gimmicks in intellectually vacuous adventure flicks. Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke crafted an epic story: The ascent of man from ape to human to "superman." The influence of an unseen extraterrestrial intelligence drives this evolution.Also, Clarke was an award-wining science fiction author, not some Hollywood scriptwriting hack who butchers classic science fiction stories for screen adaptation. The ending is weird only because Kubrick realized he could never show the extraterrestrials without it looking hoaky. This is as impossible as showing the face of God. And, attempts in all other sci-fi "E.T." films have failed miserably, including the overrated "Close Encounters of the Third Kind."So, "2001" becomes a bit abstract with the hotel room "cage" in the final scenes. Likewise, the legendary Black Monolith is a perfect representation of extraterrestrial technology: complete unfathomable. Critics miss the subtlety that Kubrick was painting a bland picture of the techno-world of 2001, with boring, everyday bureaucrats and space jocks caught up in a fantastic civilization-altering event that is much larger that they can comprehend. Hence the low-key acting and dialog. The film is impeccable and perfect for accuracy and attention to detail ands goes to astronomical lengths to assemble a plausible and realistic vision of the future. The cinematography and set design, done all in the Cinerama screen aspect ratio, is unparalleled in sci-fi film history. But the film is showing its age in a few areas. 1. the psychedelic "stargate" trip at the end cements the film in the hippy-dippy 1960s. 2. The notion of a sentient all powerful HAL mainframe computer predates microprocessors. So there will never be such an all-controlling computer. But there will eventually be artificial intelligence that will blur the notion of a what it means to be a consciousness entity. 3. Though visionary, the film did not foresee women's liberation. There are no women characters except for flight attendants. Of course the Soviets, which were a step ahead in women's equality in the 1960s, have a couple of astrophysicist characters in the film. 4. The great lengths the government goes through for secrecy, like not telling the Discovery crew about the monolith (!?), is overly melodramatic and implausible. 5. The attempts to re-create a zero-gravity were clever for the time, but look pretty pasty now that we have real footage of astronauts in space.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>HAL Opens the Doors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since so much will be written about this film, let's be brief. I have seen "2001: A Space Odyssey" all the way through, twice. There are some parts I've watched separately, but I saw none of the film until AFTER 2001. So, obviously, it has a timeless quality. I consider Stanley Kubrick's work on this film to be art, which really doesn't "age". I believe there is also a point where "flaws" become irrelevant, and "2001: A Space Odyssey" reaches that point.It's probably been said (I will look at the other comments this evening), but the portrayals of Keir Dullea (as Dave) and Douglas Rain (as Hal) are absolutely spellbinding. I do consider Mr. Rain's portrayal of "HAL" an acting performance; consider, also, how much Mr. Dullea accomplishes without speaking. The Dullea/Rain struggle is probably my favorite part of the film, presently. This one is indispensable. ********** 2001: A Space Odyssey (4/2/68) Stanley Kubrick ~ Keir Dullea, Douglas Rain, Gary Lockwood, William Sylvester</fullReview>

And some PC Nazi claiming this is Kubrick's fascist vision??!!Angry reviewers, get back on the meds and stop renting movies like 2001. Stick to what you know and put your (Sony) Beta copy of Police Academy 5 in the blinking thing-a-ma-jig on top of the TV you inherited from your incarcerated uncle. 2001 is acknowledged by every serious film school and film society to be one of the greatest films made. Kubrick is also acknowledged to be one of the greatest directors ever. So if you can't understand why the aforementioned things are true, please sit back, watch your pirated version of Roadhouse for the 13th time and don't punch anyone (especially your spouse) after you polish off a dozen tallboys of Schlitz.2001 is impressive on every level. Score = brilliant (I realize the "challenged" reviewers hate classical because it doesn't have the street cred of music created by ex/future cons) Visuals = brilliant (again for the monkeys, long shots of beautiful imagery confuse you as you look for the tricked-out Dodge Dart with the flame detailing) Acting = Brilliant (Uh, oh. The mobile-home-monkeys are mad. Where's the supreme thespian Napoleon Dynamite?) Special Effects = Brilliant (Trailer-monkeys are scratching their head, shouldn't Hollywood stuntman Hooper be in charge of these things?) Wardrobe = Brilliant (Monkeys are asking, What? No underwear-exposed, pulled-down-jeans in the future?) Dialog = Brilliant (Translation: Not one tattoo-covered punk who introduces himself as "Dawg") Plot = Brilliant (Translation for the monkeys: No fart jokes.)So for those of you who hate actually having to contemplate the meaning of anything more complicated than whether Barney is a real dinosaur, please stay away from this movie and go shoplift yourself a copy of Kazaam to enjoy this Holiday season.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're the kind of person who has time to watch grass grow, please feel free to sit down and watch every moment of this film. If you're just doing a report on it, rent the DVD and print this summary so you can follow it along. It is sacrilegious to say this film is not the most amazing, perfect, beautiful film to ever have been made, so I won't say it... The effects are okay, and most hold up, but the sheer length of it is silly and the "grooviness" and "heavy" themes are not as interesting as people want to pretend. But then again, I was born after we landed on the moon. There's my review (Okay Space Odyssey lovers! There's your cue to click Not Helpful!!). Here's a summary: Opening Scene: "pre-human" beings encounter a black rectangular Something-er-other known as "The Monolith" and it transforms the primitives into tool-wielding smart guys.Act 1: Moon astronauts dig up The Monolith (40-feet below the surface of the Moon) and when sunlight hits the surface of it, it emits this horrible sound, which you the audience are supposed to figure out is a signal to the planet Jupiter (perhaps where the "owners" of The Monolith live or want their messages forwarded to at any rate) So: The Monolith that made the Apes smart has been found in a place that only very smart humans could have gotten to. End Act 1.Act 2: Dave and Frank are now on their way to Jupiter. A lot of gee-whiz showing off of technical stuff follows. The on-board computer HAL 9000 fakes like there is a problem with a certain device. Dave and Frank who are "awake" (the other astronauts are in hibernation) work together; one inside and the other outside (EVA: Extra-Vehicular-Activity) to fix the device. They both conclude that there is nothing wrong with it and are suspicious that HAL 9000 is full of it. They confer in what they think is private and tell each other frankly that HAL might have to be unplugged since he's gone wacky. Unbeknownst to either guy HAL can read their lips through the window of where they are talking and sees that they are going to deactivate his ass. So he tricks them into going outside into space. He kills Frank and locks Dave outside. While Dave figures out a way to get back inside the craft without his blood boiling, or him freezing to death (this sequence does kick butt, I have to admit)from exposure to space, HAL powers down the life support on the others in hibernation, killing them all. Once back inside, Dave immediately drops the powerful HAL down to Threat Level Zero. A video flickers on stating that the mission to Jupiter is secret and there is some freaky stuff going on there.ACT 3: Dave encounters The Monolith floating around out by Jupiter. He goes on some looooooooonnggggg ride through a bunch of lights and comes out very aged at the end in a weird "house." He turns and sees himself even older, then older still. Then, reaching out from his death bed, he sees The Monolith. Which "renews" him as a fetus. The end.</fullReview>

And while in theory, a computer going berserk and killing the crew of a ship on their way to Jupiter to find the source of a mysterious transmission may sound cool, put into practice it's very slow. And the ending scenes... I had no idea what they were supposed to be until I ended up reading the end of the book in a class in college. And even then, I wasn't entirely sure that that's what they were trying to do. I know this is supposed to be one of those classics and way ahead of its time and all, but it's just plain dull.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey is probably my favourite book of all time and after having read it, I lapped up all of Clarke's sequels...but unfortunately this movie did not cut it for me...I really tried to like it but I just couldn't - maybe my brain has been numbed by all the usual fast paced sci-fi fare these days, but I just found the film really tedious in parts...the ape section and the various "silence" sequences were irrelevant and boring and did not add to the story in any way.I admit that some of the ideas on view are marvellous and visionary, such as the rotating space station, but again that's due more to Clarke's scientific brilliance rather than to Kubrick - quite why Kubrick would want to have a ten minute sequence of a space station spinning in space to classical music is beyond me (except for the possibility that a spinning space station was a strikingly new concept back then and he wanted to emphasise the point?).I sometimes wonder if I would have enjoyed the movie more if I hadn't read the book first - it was such a well told and coherent story, which contrasts greatly to the movie which is very abstract. Maybe anyone thinking of watching this movie should see it before they read the book, but definitely read the book - it's a true masterpiece....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this movie for the first time for a class, and I have to say I was disappointed. I've been told that some of this stems from my having read Arthur C. Clarke's book, which has nothing to do with the film. But I enjoyed the book and had trouble sitting through this movie. I can certainly see why it was considered a 'drug movie' in the 70's. It has a lot of the same elements of the music of the period - long, drawn out, surreal sections of time full of discordant images (or sounds). It is most likely art and as such, appreciated or hated by its viewers. But as a movie, I thought it stunk. As a storyteller, it stunk. I'm sure people will try to explain the film's cosmic beauty or underlying amazingness on a level I will never understand, or tell me that it's precisely because it bored me to tears and was mostly incoherent and repetitive that makes it great. Maybe I shouldn't have read the book first. But I can not imagine ever wanting to see this movie again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Movie Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WORST MOVIE EVER I went to a movie theater to see this movie, 2001: A Space Odyssey, when it came out.At that time my wife and I agreed the title should be 2001: A Space Idiocy!!! Over two hours of what in my opinion was total terrible.If this is ANY kind of art, then the cow pies in the pastures are all better art.Over the years, any time I thought of this movie I could not think of one positive thing in the movie.By the time the movie was much less than half over I found myself HATING the music.When Stanley Kubrick died in 1999 it is too bad that he was not cremated with every copy of this movie.My wife and I rarely discussed 2001: A Space Odyssey but when we did it still came out as 2001: A Space Idiocy.In my entire life I have NEVER met ANY one who said they even sort of liked this movie.Weeeeeeell, today I decided to watch 2001: A Space Odyssey for the second time. This is over 40 years since I saw it the first time.My opinion, if anything this movie was MUCH WORSE this second time. I regret spending the $5.99 for the DVD.I think Stanley Kubrick did make some good movies: SPARTACUS DR. STRANGELOVE OR: HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE THE BOMB THE SHINING FULL METAL JACKET EYES WIDE SHUT.Please do not think I dislike all of Stanley Kubrick's movies.</fullReview>

Stanley Kubrick made this film without the high shooting ratio he normally has. Stanley Kubrick is without doubt the greatest director in History thus far.This film was cut from five hours to two hours and twenty minutes and the art direction was superb.Stanley Kubrick and the great Aurthur C. Clarke collaborated to write this time less classic.Aliens a special message on Earth at the dawn of Human Kind and one on the Moon which modern man finds .Finally Humans accompanied by the most advanced computer ever made set of to Jupiter the find the next monumental message which turns out to be a gateway.Any one who studied film and/or wishes to be a part of the film industry or just enjoy great films must experience this film .If you don't like it then you belong to Bollywood or your a true Aussie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie. I give it enormous credit for being one of the earliest (and still rare) movies that cannot be watched without engaging the world of ideas; due to both the subject matter, and the terse style by which Kubrick advances the story. The viewer is asked to make enormous leaps between disparate and often wordless sequences, that don't telegraph meaning overtly. Understanding or enjoying the movie isn't possible if you refuse to be thoughtful or if you're a passive viewer. This was an affront to older audiences (See "Rock Hudson") conditioned to believe that entertainment was the first, last and only purpose for movies; and it was a revolution for younger audiences who were ready and willing to explore films potential, and see what was next in the 60s. The movie of ideas, and not the asinine, self-important "issue" movie that Hollywood loves to reward, is the highest use for film. Sadly, most movies ask nothing of viewers. Issue movies only ask that you bring your overblown, overvalued morality with you, and reach a conclusion the entire culture already agrees on. Give me a difficult movie that makes some demands.2001 is also entertaining. Humanity reduced to a pissing match with a computer is both chilling and extremely funny. (HAL: "Dave, I honestly think you ought to sit down calmly, take a stress pill, and think things over.") Although I think the HAL plot line is a bit normative for a movie this ambitious.I'm not a member of the Kubrick cult, but I'm in awe; the movie is absolutely fearless, audacious &amp; cinematic. It's a Rorschach test and a zen koan. It trains your attention purposefully on the awesome &amp; the mundane; reminding viewers that most communication does not advance any complex plot in our lives or any noble purpose. It's used to pass almost useless info back and forth, to achieve trivial goals and to make small talk. Socially, we are ants.The attempt to predict how a mission... how an excavation on the moon would look, etc. are either dead-on or very interesting guesses. The movie would have been intriguing even if all it did was introduce the sober design logic it uses, and it's general thoughtfulness; i.e. the monolith has the dimensions of the first three ordinal numbers, squared: 1x4x9. On this viewing I was struck by the question of how the canvas of a movie screen might be used. Is film imagery about portraying things that aid the viewer in constructing a narrative, or is it about vicariously experiencing a characters vantage? The sequence in Dave Bowman's cage accepts both readings depending on which way it's to be understood. The sequences with the monolith suggest that the genre "ghost story" is separated from "metaphysical exploration" by only the thinnest of lines.Every frame of this movie is thoughtful AND beautiful. Hollywood has been able to do that, what... 4 times?. I'm a big fan of Citizen Kane, but that movie concerns, first and foremost, film technique, a wunderkind narrative, and a clever borrowing of a magnate's life. It doesn't make me think deeply about non-filmic ideas to any great degree; other than the obvious bromides about money not buying happiness, controlling people isn't being loved, etc.I'm struck now by how 2001 is overlooked in the "best films of all time" polls. 2001 is the better film, making it (for me) the most important film made in film history. Kane will have to settle for 2nd.Critic Stephen Hunter of the Washington Post quibbles that the movie is dumb because 2001 wasn't like this. (?!) How can you even respond to a remark that far off-course?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So space-age airline food is every bit as gruesome as ours. Too bad. The good news is they still drink coffee in the future, and from a giant thermos too. I take comfort in that. Don't get me wrong. This is one boring monster of a movie. I mean, you'd be halfway through most other pictures before Kubrick gets to the first line of dialog. In essence, this is a three-hour visual essay on how man sets out to fathom the far reaches of the solar system, but all he finds is himself. Sort of like "Star Trek The Motion Picture" meets "Contact", perhaps with a slightly better color scheme. It all comes down to what you want from a movie, but if you're looking for action, emotion, a sense of humor or any plot, this isn't for you. People will go on about how "2001" made history when it came out, but I'm not buying it. Pharmaceutical history maybe. It's a twelve-reel sleeping pill.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It hasn't aged well.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd heard a lot of hype about this movie, so I finally decided to see it for myself, with the rest of my family. The rest of my family walked out with an hour to go, leaving only me to finish watching this movie. Not that I liked it much better, but I simply believe in giving something a fair chance before I make judgment on it.Let me just say then that this movie has not aged well at all. The famous first scene (the one with the monkeys) was to me dumb, insulting, and overlong. I wasn't offended by the "Darwinism"; it's just that I've seen much more realistic depictions of our ancestors in documentaries like "Walking with Prehistoric Beasts". By contrast, the shrieking and gnawing monkeys here just looked completely silly. The next hour or so seemed to me to be just an interlude to show "special effects" ("A waitress walking upside down! Woohoo they're going to LO-OVE THIS one, so why don't we dedicate an entire 5 minutes of screen time to showcasing this special effect!") and put in lots of useless "talking characters". The cinematography was completely uninspired; it mostly consisted of leaving a camera in one place. Just absolutely pathetic and boring.The film did reach "masterpiece" status briefly during the scenes within the spaceship on its way to Saturn; the movie moves slowly but surely here, the suspense builds, and we are made to realize the tremendous enormity and emptiness of space.This section of the movie (lasting about 1 hour or so) would get a 9/10 from me.The movie ends with a psychedelic head-trip which is probably largely the reason that the movie is so famous. Finally, it ends with an allegory that for me was almost impossible to decipher the first time I watched it... and I'm not willing to watch it again.Honestly, I think that this movie is extremely overrated! My suggestion for an alternative movie to see would be "Solaris (1972)" by Andrei Tarkovsky, a Russian director who reportedly made his film as a response to "2001", which he hated for its lack of humanity. In Solaris, it is the innermost problems of humanity that are the most important, even (especially) in the vastness and remoteness of outer space. Tarkovsky's cinematography is original and unique, in contrast to the dull camera motions of "2001". Solaris is probably my favourite movie of all time!I'd give 2001 "5/10". While the middle of the movie is brilliant, the rest of it is really uninspired, and terrible to watch. It's interesting only as a historical artifact.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw 2001 on a rainy Sunday afternoon in 1968 with my two daughters, then 10 and 12. I recall animated discussion about the film on the drive home and at dinner that night.It was new ground! Sadly the film has not aged well. The special effects, so impressive some thirty years ago, look mediocre and sometimes plain silly. The fashions and furnishings, designed to predict today, more resemble Montgomery Ward circa 1960. In an age of today's short takes and busy camera work, 2001 seems stodgy, glacial and boring. Kubrick reportedly made his characters one dimensional on purpose. Yet today it amounts to just plain bad acting. This classic has not aged as well as others of the period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One the most overrated movie of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is really, REALLY overrated movie. The movie starts with 20 minutes of showing monkeys, which killed the interest of mine to the whole movie. Next it shows some random space station and some random characters inside. After an hour the main characters and the HAL-9000 is shown. Then the real movie starts which is rather good, well made, but nothing kind of happens in it. You'll never get into to the poor characters, in fact I think the computer is more a human than the doctors. Then the crew gets killed by the computer and Bowman escapes and the last and one of the only scenes I liked starts. It is just really hard to like the movie, its plot and characters as you'll don't care what happens to them or who they are. The music and the space scenes are really good and the scenes and shots of the space shuttles and ships still look real to me. Only thing the movie lacked was depth to the plot to star with and _really_ it needs some depth to the characters. SO if you are going to watch this overrated piece of **** watch the last 1? hours of it, if it feels too boring just skip to the last scene where Bowman touches the monolith etc and is reborn and stuff. I gave the movie 6/10 because I really liked the special effects, starships and shuttles and the music.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had been waiting for years to watch this film. In nearly every other title I'd researched or discussed "Odyssey" inevitably was referenced in the discussion. Finally, I got it in my head, that I'd pick a Friday night and devote it to this film. I did, and I can only liken the experience sucking on razor blades with a bleach chaser. At times, it was excruciating, almost physically painful to watch. I cried at the end (I'm not kidding) because I had decided that I just couldn't *like* movies. This was supposed to be a classic. I thought "What is *WRONG* with me? What am I missing?" I was extremely disappointed to find that the movie, like others, had set the viewer up for a conflict, that never occurs, which I find extremely disappointing. The cinematography was INCREDIBLE for it's time. But great cinematography does not make up for what this is lacking, which is a point, some detail a reason for its existence. Honestly there is nothing to "get" here.I didn't mind the Blue Danube waltz, I even ignored the fact that only about 400 words were actually spoken in the films entirety. But it was, as some say, not good, and definitely not great. Actually, it was horrible.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow, frustrating film that leads to...what exactly?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, hailed my many as an all-time classic, does have a lot going for it. It is beautifully photographed. The special effects were for its time revolutionary. And there is a truly fascinating story there to be told. Unfortunately it is in the storytelling that 2001 suffers. The film raises many questions, then spends over two hours not answering them. For much too much of that time absolutely nothing happens. But you stay with it because there seems to be the possibility of a great payoff at the end. Yet the ending frustrates just as much as all that came before it, perhaps more so. You may well find yourself saying "I waited two hours for THAT? And what the heck was that anyway?" I do not believe a movie has to lay all the answers out for you. Some of the best films of all time are very much left open to your own interpretation. But the answers we are given here are so unsatisfying and ultimately confusing that we wonder why we went through the trouble of watching at all.Again this movie does have a lot going for it and it is easy to see why so many praise it. It certainly seems to be one of the most polarizing films of all time. Love it or hate it, there is no in between. While I would not recommend it I must say the movie sets up a fascinating premise. The opening sequence which takes place in prehistoric times goes on a tad too long but is rich with symbolism and intrigue and sets up well the themes of the movie. Many are fascinated by the evolution of man, the questions "Why are we here?", "How did we get here", and "What exactly is it all about?" In this film, man sets off on a quest for answers to these questions. Unfortunately the answers don't satisfy. If it is answers you seek perhaps you should see the sequel 2010 which if nothing else sheds some light on what in the world the last twenty minutes or so of 2001 was all about. If you want to see the true genius of Kubrick then Dr. Strangelove or A Clockwork Orange will do quite nicely. Enjoy what is good about 2001....the beautiful photography, the special effects, the great and fascinating character of the computer HAL. But be forewarned that this long journey does not lead to a satisfying destination.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie equivalent of an empty canvas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I'm generally a fan of Kubrick's movies ("A Clockwork Orange" and "Full Metal Jacket" are masterpieces), I think this one of the most overrated movies ever. The basic problem to me is that "Space Odyssey" isn't really a movie but more a series of moving images with some music. Granted, the images are very beautiful, the effects are spectacular for the time, and the excellent music fits the visuals very well. But no amount of audiovisual flair is enough to save over 2 hours of movie if there's just nothing else going on. And to me, that's the case here. There's virtually no plot, no character development, or anything else to really keep you interested. Sure, there are some hints at a deeper meaning, but they are so vague and ambiguous that they can be pretty much explained however the viewer wants. I'm not saying that there might not be some amazing message in there, but so far I've yet to find somebody who can come up with a really convincing explanation. Most of the time, people I talk to who like this movie completely fail to explain why they like it or what's it about. Should it be about something? To me, yes. To me, movies should either entertain, tell a good story, or have a good message. This movie seems to do neither. It's too slow to entertain, it certainly doesn't have much of a story, and it also doesn't appear to have much of a message either. Still, I can understand that people like it just for its visuals, but then again I suspect that there are also many people that claim to like it because they don't want to appear stupid. In the end, I'd say this is the movie equivalent of an empty piece of canvas that is turned into a piece of art called "the vast emptiness". It's a clever trick, but it's ultimately rather pointless, and many people only see a meaning behind it because they want to see it, not because it's necessarily actually there.** out of ***** (because of the amazing visuals and sound)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too "profound" for a plot? I don't think so.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you rent this film, be sure you know where the "fast forward" button is on your remote control. You will need to use it often.Plot summary: Some apes see a strange monolith near their cave, and it somehow leads them to begin using tools. In 2001 (1968's "future"), the monolith is found on the moon. Some astronauts are led on a mysterious mission when their computer (the HAL 2000) starts killing the crew members, but the hero (Dave) stops it by turning HAL off. He is then warped into a strange place where he sees himself as older, and older, and then, after seeing the monolith, he sees himself as a baby. Then the credits roll.Clearly, this is rather ambiguous. 2001: A Space Odyssey is an allegory; the viewer is left to decide what the meaning of the film is.Since no explanation of events is given in the movie, the viewer is forced to attempt to interpret it later. What is clear is that the symbolism has much to do with man's evolution; what, exactly, that symbolism is is left up for the viewer to decide.In the beginning, the apes see the monolith, perhaps representative of the passage of time, and begin using tools. These tools lead to the advanced technology of 2001. Most of the crew members we see featured are virtually immobile; some are in hibernation. The only person who moves (Dave) is also the only one who survives; and he does so by using a simple tool as a weapon. In the future, Dave sees himself as older and older; this may represent the progression of man's evolution. There is a peak to his evolution, in which he is forced to revert to a baby-like state; similarly, the crew members were like babies, hibernating in their "wombs." I believe the writer's point is that mankind will eventually lead itself back into the first stage of evolution-- or perhaps has already.When you watch this movie, you will make fun of it. One must have a very easily entertained mind in order to enjoy the slow, boring sequences that do absolutely nothing to advance the plot. (I suggest fast-forwarding through most of the first hour of the movie.) My guess is that the slow movement, too, was a metaphor, again for the progression of mankind's evolution. But no matter what the reason for this slow movement was, it is painful for this audience to endure; and no movie, for any reason, should bring genuine pain to its audience.I spent most of this movie waiting for a plot. I never got one. After all, this movie was too "profound" to have one.But this, of course, is ludicrous. If you're going to make a point with an allegory, multiple interpretations should not be possible; if no clear conclusion can be made, then no point has been made at all.Most viewers will not admit that the message is cryptic; in their mind, they are far too cunning for anything to remain a mystery. The result is that we have some amateur critics saying, "I am smart, and therefore I understand this movie, and therefore this movie is good," hoping others will think, "He thinks this movie is good, and therefore he understands this movie, and therefore he is smart." But anyone can come up with his or her own meaning and feel smart for coming up with it; perhaps this is why 2001: A Space Odyssey is as popular as it is.A film can serve two purposes. First, it can entertain. Secondly, it can inform. Even those who claim to have enjoyed this film will admit that it is not entertaining to watch. But does it inform? No, since the many messages this allegory could bring are still debated. So, in essence, this film serves no purpose.Ambiguity is overrated, and so is this movie. I wouldn't waste my time with it.</fullReview>

Second it wants to be a beautiful film, but it is not a beautiful FILM, it is a collage of impressionistic pictures, which are unfolding in a slow manner. If I want to see some beautiful pictures I go to a photograph exhibition. A film is dynamic, it moves. Beauty in a film is created in other ways. A film is not a power point slide show. Third is pretentious since it wants to say something 'very' profound and uses all the tools to signal that. You can say something deep in a relax mode, without all that symbols which connote with high culture and vanguard art. So it is an highly overrated film.</fullReview>

Bad movie, from a bored mind, wanted to create something excellent but even though the original idea and plot could have made a great movie, I just do not believe that this slow paced boring stuff could REALLY appeal to so many people. I guess those who did not like it, would not even take the time to end up at IMDb and share their thoughts. This is most likely I guess. If someone wants to watch it, just go ahead, there are many other bad movies out there too. I did not like it, waste of time. To THOSE who consider this movie a PIECE OF ART: What is it art to have to be watching AND PAY FOR IT, a totally black screen for minutes at the beginning.

		<shortDescription>If you can't understand it nor make sense of it, yet it's revered as a classic...by golly it must be GREAT!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Give me a break. Why is this film considered a classic? I mean there is a completley unidentifiable plot, a ton of visuals that are ultimatley meaningless and music that was misplaced to begin with(Such an epic theme for a slow motion shot of an ape bashing the bones of a dead animal?).This is a classic example of films which are artsy, no one understands them or can make sense of them...so it must be good, right? Where does that logic come from, I wonder? I rented it 3 times, the first 2 I never got through the first 30 minutes. The 3rd time I made myself sit through it. I had to throw my shirt in the wash because of the drool stains! I mean it touches on some plot points(Alien life, the mystery of evolution...least it seems that was the idea) and them just trails off...REPEATEDLY.I cannot comment of Kubrick, I have seen several of his other films, non of which I enjoyed with the exception of "The Shining", which was still boring to an extent.I keep reading reviews that start out like "Greatest movie ever made", "A masterpiece of cinema". OK, I have no idea how one can come to this conclusion. But please explain what this film is about...You can't! Can you?! Any good film needs a plot, this movie is horribly lacking.I know I will get blasted for this, but if you want a movie which brings up simular type views and uses a simular style in film making, see "Mission to Mars". It is much more enlightening and features great actors like Gary Senise and Tim Robbins.I can't argue with the fans(sheep) of this film, because I don't know what they see in it or why. I consider myself a smart person, I like long epic style films that don't have to move at the pace of "The Matrix" to be good. I don't even ask for a satisfactory ending, I just want to know that some thought was put into a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weird...Beautiful...2001: A Space Odyssey is a cinema landmark!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On a rating scale of 0 to 100; I rate 2001: A Space Odyssey a score of 97.The?greatest?science?fiction?film?ever?made? Could be. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a film that explores the planets and does it beautifully, and is a grand scale epic that will be forever remembered by moviegoer's and critics alike. It's simply a little mastermind of an adventure sci-fi flick that gets more intriguing with every movement of the characters.The monoliths have been watching us. They gave us the "evolutionary kick in the pants" we needed to survive at the Dawn of Time. In 1999, we discovered a second monolith on the moon. Now, in the year 2001, the SS Discovery and its crew, Captains Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood), and their onboard computer, HAL-9000 (voiced by Douglas Rain), must discover what alien force is watching us...2001: A Space Odyssey is an ultimately confusing film the first time you watch it, but after you see it a couple more times (you will see it more than twice, guaranteed!) you'll start to hook on to the odd but endlessly amazing story-line. The special effects are truly extraordinary for Stanley Kubrick's 1968 film, and Kubrick himself does a brilliant job of trying to show the world his vision of the future in science with his stunningly put-together script, that's always open to frightening and new ideas. There are many more reasons to see this great film, like to watch Keir Dullea's ignored but excellently controlled performance, for Douglas Rain's voice portrayal of HAL-9000's evil, which is bound to send a chill down your spine, and last but definitely not least, Kubrick's unexplainably great effort in directing such a memorable piece of film.Impossible to miss, impossible to forget. See it immediately.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Bloated Kubrick Nonsense About Absolutely Nothing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really detest Stanley Kubrick. This so-called "great" director made exactly three good movies in his entire career: LOLITA, DR STRANGELOVE, and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. The first one was pretty conventional Hollywood fare, the second a brilliant, jet-black comedy about the Cold War that hit every nail right on the head, and the third a brilliant but extremely unpleasant film adapted, I am told faithfully, from Anthony Burgess's dystopian novel.That's all she wrote, folks. Three good movies and he's a great director.Who decides these things, anyway? He made a mishmash out of Stephen King's brilliant novel THE SHINING in 1980, so obsessed with his own cleverness and "vision" that he simply ripped the guts out of King's work and replaced it with basically a lot of stunning visuals signifying nothing.Which brings us to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. I remember reading somewhere that back in its day it was the fashionable thing to watch this movie stoned.I can see why. There's a plot here somewhere, but I can't find it. All I see are a bunch of disjointed scenes, all of which are either beautiful or at least interesting to look at, but which tell you nothing.Keir Dullea, a talented actor who was cruelly misused by Hollywood, appears stoned himself for much of the proceedings (perhaps he was, it WAS 1968 after all). In fact, at the end of the day, the best performance in the entire cast was given by Douglas Rain as the voice of the maniacal HAL9000 computer.And as usual with Kubrick, the thing is interminable; at nearly two and a half hours, it screams for a pair of scissors, or perhaps a machete.Are people so afraid of appearing dumb that if they find a movie incomprehensible they automatically assume it must be a work of genius? I don't know. What I do know is that Stanley Kubrick was a director who spent most of his career creating wonderful visuals. But that is it. Most of his films are all style and no substance. This one is one of the worst.How this film made the AFI's #1 spot as the premiere film in the sci-fi genre is a mystery that I shall never understand. This movie is pure dreck from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I didn't get it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have started watching this movie a few times in years past, and finally took the weekend to slog through it. I just could never get past the unending bit with the fake-o monkeys before this. I think the movie might have been more meaningful and enjoyable if I had been stoned while watching it, but I don't do drugs. Truthfully, the story line (if there was one) lost me, and what did the monkeys have to do with "The Dawn of Man" anyway? The incredibly long sequences of overstimulating visuals backed by the mournful "voice symphony" almost had me pushing the "eject" button, but I was too bored to move. The only reason I give this movie even a "1" is because of the one masterful piece of original music at the beginning. The spaceships dancing to Strauss was simply inane.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had the chance to see this movie only in 2001 in its digitally remastered version and I didn't like it at all, I also gave up at half time, a thing I never did before in a cinema.The events in the movie happen far too slow with redundant scenes supposed to impress the viewer that sees astronauts eating some strange baby food. The presence of classical music is too heavy so that you feel you are at the New year's day concert in Vienna and these scenes of spaceships that land, take off, fly, whatever are truly baroque.It's no point in discussing techincal computer-related matters either since they are completely out of date 30 years later (punch cards...hehehehehe).</fullReview>

And trust me, I watch a LOT of movies - 4 to 6 per day, as my job requires.As to "BEAUTY", as mentioned by another amateur critique here, well, I guess "beauty" is in the eyes of the beholder as the proverb goes. Personally, I found it, err... not so much ugly (apart from the growling apes) but ... duh... boring beyond belief.How on earth the current rating of IMDb shows 8.4/10 beats the sh*t out of me.I guess I must have missed something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Complete Waste of Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is easily one of the most overrated films of all time. Of the 141 minute run-time, maybe 30 minutes of that is story development; the rest is just time fillers such as watching a ship fly through space for ten minutes. I found it necessary to engage in other activities throughout the movie while these time fillers went on. This meant I was doing something else for about 90% of the time the movie was on.The music is loud, irritating, and incongruent with what is occurring. Half of it feels like happy show tunes when the visuals are either somber or nothing (i.e. a space ship flying through space for ten minutes).The ending had the feel that Kubrick was trying to do something artsy and creative...but failed miserably and created only something that was a boring culmination to a boring movie.Avoid this one at all costs...unless you want to take a 2 1/2 hour nap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Without its historical context, 2001 is nothing special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an influence on cinema and as a film made in the sixties, 2001: A Space Odyssey is indeed great. But evaluated simply as a movie, with no consideration given to its historical context, it is nothing special, and is in fact quite mediocre. Here are three reasons why:(1) The characters are underdeveloped. This happened somewhere in the transition from novel to screenplay; the actors do passably well with the material they're given. Consider the opening scene: a bunch of people in ape suits develop the use of tools. We don't know, while watching the movie, that one of the apes, Moon-Watcher, is already more evolved than the others and is influenced most by the black monolith?instead, we see a group of apes, and a random one picks up a bone and smashes stuff with it. There's no clarity in the development here, and the story is left unfinished when Kubrick cuts thousands of years into the future. The characters here, though more distinguishable, are no more complete: the most developed is HAL 9000, and he's a machine. But even his motives are unclear... that may add to the mystery and suspense, but it's only by reading the novel that we learn he begins malfunctioning as a result of guilt. That's an interesting thematic element that's not explored in the film adaptation.(2) The visual effects are unspectacular. When watching this film, the visual element is only interesting if we constantly remind ourselves that this film was made almost forty years ago; without that knowledge, it seems cheap and amateur. There is one scene in particular where about five minutes are spent showing lights flashing past one of the characters; I almost got up and left to find a book to read until it ended. The technology is outdated, and with it the special effects of this film?if 2001 were made today, nobody would be impressed with these effects. We shouldn't have to consider the era in which it was made to respect a film.(3) There is no coherent story. This is another thing lost between novel and screenplay. The film tells two (or three, depending on how you count them) loosely related stories that center around a black monument that is never explained. The novel, by contrast, describes the course of human evolution, and how that black monument shaped it. The final scene of the movie leaves many viewers perplexed?after soaring through light for seeming ages and winding up in a quaint suite, Dave returns to earth as a fetus in a bubble. In the novel, he finds a giant monolith similar to the ones on earth and the moon and is evolved so much as to no longer require a body. In his new immortal, immaterial state, he returns to earth and detonates a nuclear bomb that had been fired before it can land, saving humanity. The novel is a story. The film is a mess.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good...but not great.Not quite the classic it is made out to be. Visually stunning, yet slow-paced with a tangential, random ending. Not really an actor's movie: dialogue and emotion are limited, so not much to comment on in terms of performances.Kudos for it being ahead of its time as far as science fiction dramas go. The visual effects are still amazing 40+ years later. Worth watching to see what all the fuss is about, but prepared to be underwhelmed in terms of coherence of plot and profundity. Quite overrated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film, Slightly Let Down By Pacing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's really interesting to see a film that inspired half a century of Sci-Fi since it's release. Having watched several Sci-fi films that were made after this, it was easy to see where they drew their inspiration from. 2001 did for Sci-Fi what Orwell's 1984 did for the 'Dystopian Future' idea. The exposition in this film is immense; going all the way back to the dawn of man was a bold way to give the audience the set up. I really liked the stark contrast of ape killing ape in a barren desert to space travel. Needless to say, the way Kubrick shot this film is nothing short of astounding. The genius camera angles and the frankly dizzying, gravity defying one-shot takes helped to create a level of immersion I seldom find in films. The soundtrack is also fantastic. Mixing majestic Classical pieces and dark, ethereal choral singing helped build up a foreboding atmosphere that drew me right in from the moment the Monolith first appears on screen. Having said that, the one thing I feel lets it down is the pacing. I have no problem with a film that takes a while to get into gear. I love films that build up a world around the viewer and fully immerses me in the story. That's exactly what I look for in a film. But with 2001: A Space Odyssey, there were some scenes that really did drag on. I felt like some shots just really didn't need to be as long as they were. And a lot of the screen time was spent on things that didn't contribute to dialogue, plot, character development or immersion. These shots were simply there so Kubrick could bask in his own genius a little longer. Those scenes just killed it for me as I found my eyes wandering and my concentration waning. Otherwise, it's a film way ahead of it's time and the forerunner to countless Sci-Fi films and for that, it really is great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing but not bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw this on TV one day I recorded it and settled in. I heard so much about it and with Sci-Fi being one of my favorite genres I was genuinely excited.The film started with a overture and I didn't mind. But then it goes to establishing shots of a desert. They were good but it lasted for minutes. I didn't understand why they needed so much of these shots. Did they film a lot and couldn't decide which one was best so they just put them all in? I sure hope not. From there on we get early humans evolving to find their first tool. While I think it could have been cut down it was a good sequence. Then we go into space and when our protagonist is on his shuttle it is a very cool few minutes with stunning visuals and outstanding music. From then on he gets his assignment to go to Jupiter after contact was lost with the ship they had recently sent out. When our hero gets on the ship he bonds with HAL 9000 which is a good moment in the film. Later when a fellow astronaut goes outside the ship to fix something it gets boring. While he is fixing it we get a dearth baser like breathing for the whole time. An that happens when anyone is in space. When he gets back on the ship the two astronauts slowly start to realize HAL is plotting something. They plan to shut him down. This is a part I will not spoil seeing a it is one of my favorite sequences ever. It show the two astronauts trying to stop HAL and while I wouldn't recommend the whole movie I definitely advice watching this wonderful set of scenes. From then on our protagonist enters a rectangular shaped object, which I later found out was a Monolith, whatever that means. He enters the Monolith and we get a disorienting and confusing ending/climax. He enters the Monolith and it looks like Star Wars hyperspace on drugs. It is a bunch o colored lines scrolling accords the screen. He lands in a home or something like that and he quickly evolves and dies when the is reborn and is suddenly a floating baby above earth?Now 2001: A Space Odyssey is a decent flick. It is slow and agonizing at times but it hits an out of the park home run for its outstanding visual effects, tremendous score and an amazing middle act with a lot of raw emotion as it unfolds. All in all it did inspire a generation of filmmakers like George Lucas and Christopher Nolan, which while watching this I saw hints of their works to. I would have given it a six but with such an impact I will give 2001: A Space Odyssey by Stanley Kubrick a 7.3 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a popcorn movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The monolith has been there on Earth throughout human history. It goes all the way back to the ape-man. In the near future, they have found a monolith on the moon which is kept secret with a cover story. Then 18 months later, Dr. Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Dr. Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) are on a long deep space voyage to Jupiter on Discovery 1. HAL 9000 is the computer on board that is almost human. HAL seems to be malfunctioning. It kills Poole and the rest of the hibernating crew. Bowman pulls out HAL's memory and only then does he discover the true mission. Bowman encounters a monolith in the darkness of space near Jupiter.It's hard to talk about this movie without pointing out that this is more than the normal fun space sci-fi movie. This is definitely not Star Wars but it has qualities that transcends popcorn movies. It's confounding at times. It takes its time which bored some people. Director Stanley Kubrick obviously is saying something but it's not so simplistic that one could easily explain it. One either loves the vast nature of the movie or one hates the meandering story. Nevertheless, there is no denying the profound influence of this movie and its enduring fascination.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good mystery thriller, but necessarily an entertaining one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story opens in a very absurd way, forcing the viewers to look at what's supposedly the inspiration for Planet of the Apes movies for the whole 25 minutes or so. No dialog, just monkeys telling monkey tongues. But then the cinematography of the space condition and how they execute them is just an awesome job. Never before while I watch a movie I was intrigued into guessing at how did they do those anti gravity shots. The concepts of the futuristic technology are also very nice, and as we can see, they are not very different from what becomes reality nowadays. But that's all there is to it, and you'll only get them on little bits and pieces along the movie. Stanley Kubrick really likes the overall depressingly lonesome and gloomy mood of his work here. Despite the very good presentation of two conflicts, maybe three of you count those crazy monkeys, the abundance of duration without dialog, or even without meaning in the eyes of some, is overwhelmingly irritating for me. The acting overall is quite a nice job, despite the kind of stupid accents done by some.</fullReview>

There was that choir in there singing and wailing what it sounded to me like was a choir of the damned those bound to hell wailing at their misfortune and it made me think of death and decay and a bugs swarming around a dead animal and it got way to loud and annoying i really hated that part especially because this was such an excellent movie but that wailing choir of the damned was a poor choice for music I honestly believe that choir is best made for a movie about Satan rather then an excellent movie like this one whenever I heard that choir the only think i could think of that was going to happen was there was going to be a bloody murder with an axe or an alien that looked like a demon that ate humans in a really gruesome way so to me it was a poor choice of music with that choir and nothing else the rest was absolutely excellent if you can ignore the wailing of the damned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One man's interesting view of humanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And that man is Stanley Kubrick. And the film is 2001: A Space Odyssey. The science fiction film of all science fiction films (well along with Metropolis and Bladerunner). An outstanding achievement in special effects, space travel, complex storytelling, scientific realism, surrealism and just filmmaking in general, 2001 boggles the mind with Mankind's most enduring and interesting philosophical questions.Who are we? Why are we here?And some interesting and probably more appealing questions to the public such as: What else is out there? Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood who play astronauts seek to answer that question but Stanley Kubrick seeks to raise the other questions. Questions that we may never find out. But 2001 raises these questions with powerful images and outstanding special effects.A two and a half hour visual treat that really has withstood the test of time (well apart from some minor things), 2001 captures the mind with its eerie soundtrack, inspiring effects, powerful symbolism and story. A story that certainly takes its time but never bores. The most amazing thing is: the story lies in the mind of the viewer. What does the viewer think of the meaning of life? Why we exist? Are there extraterrestrials out there in other galaxies? Kubrick wisely doesn't try to strictly answer those questions but certainly fills the mind with wonder at his ideas and theories on the screen. Some you may not agree with, others you might. But he never gives you a flat out answer.Starting years and years back to our ancestor apes and fast forwarding to 2001 where space travel is frequent and mankind has lost touch. Despite the awe and wonder of the Solar System, Dr Heywood Floyd is sound asleep on a flight to an orbiting space station and again on his flight to the Moon. Astronauts Dave Bowman (Dullea) and Frank Poole (Lockwood) are quiet and distant men. Frank Poole doesn't even spark up an emotion when watching his birthday celebration from his parents back home on Earth. Kubrick nailed it. We are losing touch with humanity. Like the characters in 2001, we constantly rely on technology. The astronauts consistently rely on HAL, a supercomputer, who keeps frequent watch over the space shuttle Discovery One. Technology isn't always reliable for obvious reasons. And you see that in 2001.Kubrick once famously stated that 2001's deepest psychological level is "the search for God, and it finally postulates what is little less than a scientific definition of God". A statement that stuck with me ever since reading it, Kubrick also raises the ultimate religious question: Is there a God? Controversial straight away, 2001 shows us that God could just be a metaphysical creation. God could be the cosmos itself. We look up at the night skies and see a vast and wonderful array of stars, planets, suns and galaxies. We could be staring at God everyday without knowing it. God watches over us from the heavens. A spiritual being, the creator of the Universe, the Man who has eternal existence, God could just be a nickname for Universe. The Universe is vast, limitless and timeless, ever expanding (from what we know so far), watches over us (philosophically) and has a great amount of power like mankind's view of God. I know that's a touching subject and I don't necessarily believe it as it is just a theory but Kubrick is telling us to think about life and these surrounding questions. It makes you think.A tense, sometimes creepy, enlightening and moving film, Kubrick's 2001 is his penultimate mystery tale (The Shining comes very close). It manages to haunt the mind with questions we may never find the answer to. But ultimately, it shows us a bright light at the end of a dark tunnel telling us we might still have hope. Hope to survive, to live perhaps forever...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film Ahead of Its Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my TV Productions class, my teacher showed my classmates and I "2001: A Space Odyssey". He advised us to pay attention to what is going on or we will be lost. So, I had my mind on every moment I've seen in the film.Watching the film for the first time, the film blew me away with its art direction, musical score, visuals, atmosphere and groundbreaking special effects for its time.The settings in the film are well-thought out and you really feel like you're in space due to its slow pace. Some people complained about the slow pace, but it's that way for a reason, and I just mentioned why. The spaceships and vehicles were very original at the time and seeing the technology and the way to navigate through the spaceships is just creative and groundbreaking.The music and sound is one of the highlights of the film. A couple of times you will hear "Also Sprach Zarathustra" by Richard Strauss and "The Blue Danube" by Johann Strauss and each of them perfectly fits what is going on and how you're supposed to feel when listening to them.I also like to point out its creepy and mysterious atmosphere. There are times where you are calm and there are also times when you feel like you want to know what's going on or what will happen. Watching it the first time, I felt that way.Now for the special effects. Remember, this is 1968 and CGI wasn't invented yet. The crew members were able to pull it off well. Some say they are now outdated, but to me, they are still the most groundbreaking special effects I have seen.Lastly, the story is what I want to talk about. If you go throughout the whole movie, you may not get it the first time. But watching it the second time, you may pick something up. From what I can gather, without going into spoilers, it deals with various themes like evolution and technology. It is a story that explains itself with minimal dialogue, so make sure to pay attention to what's going on.The characters were great, most notably the three main characters on the Discovery One. But the character that steals the show is HAL-9000, a computer who claims that he has never made an error and can also mimic human emotion, all while speaking in monotone. He is very original that he influenced other fictional computers with a great AI, like GLaDOS from the video game series "Portal".In conclusion, this is one of the most unique films I have seen. As my TV productions teacher told my classmates "Star Wars wouldn't be Star Wars if it weren't for this film", so it was definitely an influential film. I never heard of Stanley Kubrick until I saw this film, and I have to say he did a great job making an accurate and realistic science-fiction movie. I say give this movie a view if you don't complain how different it is from movies with brilliant plots.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Profound, Ambitious, Pretentious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001 is one of those films that every serious movie fan should see--it is iconic, occasionally brilliant, highly cinematic and very ambitious. It is also ponderous, emotionally detached, and pretentious.The plot is simple yet enigmatic. Chimp-like apes, who are human ancestors, are surprised to awake one morning and find a large featureless monolith in their camp. This monolith, through powers and methods unexplained, seems to set this particular group of primates on a new evolutionary course--they start using bone tools and eating meat, and they use their new-found abilities to triumph in battle against another troop of apes. The triumphant ape tosses his bone tool into the air--as it spins, the bone becomes a spacecraft. The implication is that the monolith somehow spurred human evolution, ultimately resulting in space-flight and the high-tech world we are in for the remainder of the film.The story next follows a bland VIP who is traveling from Earth to a space station, and then onto the moon, to investigate a mysterious artifact. A monolith identical to the one which visited the apes in the prologue has been discovered buried on the moon, and the Americans who found it are keeping it secret. As our VIP completes his long journey to the moon monolith he reaches out and touches it and there is a loud humming sound. The film then makes another cut--time has passed and we are now seeing a long-range spacecraft which is bound for Jupiter. It is explained (eventually) that the monolith on the moon broadcast a powerful signal to Jupiter, which prompts the Americans to send a team to Jupiter to investigate. We are introduced to the crew--two are conscious crewmen, others are in suspended animation awaiting revival once Jupiter is reached, and overseeing all is Hal, a sentient computer. Hal is a very good chess player, but less expected, he appreciates drawing, is excellent at facial recognition, and can read lips. He eventually goes insane. Hal says the ship's antenna is going to fail in 72 hours. When the antenna is examined no flaw is found. No Hal 9000 has ever made an error so the human crew becomes suspicious. Is Hal's error a sign that worse things are to come? Yes. Hal becomes paranoid and suspicious of the human crew--after lip-reading a discussion where the possibility of shutting down Hal's higher functions is raised, Hal rationalizes that his own survival is more vital to the mission than the survival of the crew. One of the astronauts is murdered during a space walk, the crew in hibernation have their life support terminated, and the second astronaut is only able to save himself by taking extraordinary measures. This is the most exciting and suspenseful sequence in the film, and Hal's pleading and rationalizing once he realizes that he's going to be lobotomized is quite entertaining. Our sole surviving astronaut, cut off from communication with Earth, enters the Jovian system and finds another monolith in orbit. What follows is abstract. He gets into one of his small space-pods and heads toward the Jovian monolith and appears to fall into a wormhole--he travels some undetermined distance in space and/or time and finds himself in an elegantly appointed room. He lives in this room for some time--he ages markedly over the next few minutes of the film. As he's eating a meal, looking decades older (where this food and where this room came from is unexplained but it must be related to the monoliths), he sees a very old version of himself in bed. A monolith is now in the room. As the very old version of himself reaches out to this monolith there's a transformation--the very old man becomes a fetus-- the Star-Child. Looking human yet more advanced, this Star-Child represents the next stage in human evolution. Just as the monolith at the beginning of the film spurred the apes into eventually becoming modern humans, so this monolith at Jupiter seems to have spurred the next big step in human evolution.What makes this movie great? The music is terrific--the classical score is perfect. The special effects are extraordinary--Kubrick's attention to detail is meticulous, and the stately pacing and utter silence of the space scenes are admirably accurate. Hal is a terrific character. There are some amazing shots and cuts--the bone becoming a space ship is very famous, Hal's red-eye gaze is brilliant and his soothing tone of voice is perfect, and the Star-Child at the end of the film is justifiably famous. Flaws? The acting is wooden and, other than Hal, the characters are uninteresting. The pacing is often slow, the tone is cold and detached. By making a case for intelligent design (even if the 'designers' are aliens instead of God) Kubrick gives weight to the erroneous notion that human evolution was nudged along by God.2001 is a flawed masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2001 A Space Odyssey, THE science fiction film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001 is perhaps the best film ever made; it is definitely the best science fiction film ever made, and i say that as a kid who grew up obsessed with Jurassic Park. In a conversation Stanley Kubrick had with Steven Spielberg, Kubrick said that he "wanted to change the way movies were made". Spielberg then asked "Well, didn't you do that with 2001?" and Kubrick replied "Well, a little bit." Kubrick, your attempt at change worked. This is quite possibly one of the most intriguing, interesting, mystifying movies ever made, designed to inspire an awakening, and it fulfilled it's purpose. Kubrick, in 2001, piqued at one of the most vital of philosophical questions: Where did we come from? What is our purpose here?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2001: Space Odyssey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is hard to review your favorite movie of all time, especially one that relies heavily on existentialism. Kubrick's beautiful 2001 is a bold movie. Opening with many minutes of darkness, with Also Sprach Zarathustra creeping in, the viewer realizes there in for a unique journey.The movie opens with the evolution of man kind; a group of apes that discover tools; the beginning of war, two groups of apes that fight with there newly discovered weapons over a watering hole. This is a thirty minute sequence with no talking, no voice over. The movie is split into four different parts, with Dr. Bowman's group of astronaut's going on a mysterious journey being the main part of the story.As previously stated, there is very little talking. There is many scenes in space that will have classical music playing, classical songs that are very well known because of this movie. At one point a astronaut goes to fix a ship with The Blue Danube Waltz playing, and it almost narrates what the astronaut is doing. The top comments on " The Blue Danube Waltz" video on youtube are both about 2001, and almost all videos for Also Sprach Zarathustra are the scenes from 2001.On a technical level there is almost no arguing that this is the most technically sophisticated movie ever. Space looks extraordinary and the sets are marvelous. In Parts Two and Three you can't help but just be amazed by the spaceship, the black void outside, even small things, like the space suits. The camera angles are amazing, especially in the climax in Part Three.For what little talking there is, the actors and script are some of the finest in the history of cinema. HAL is an amazing character and acted with such a monotone voice it almost has the opposite effect of monotone. Keir did a great job with Bowman, but is giving very little chances to sign, due to the nature of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree this is not a movie that everyone can enjoy.Yes I understand that by modern standards the space voyage takes a lot of time and seems prolonged. Unfortunately this undermines one of the most important aspects of the story - the astronauts are alone on a journey that can last 6 months. Kubrik tries to convey the feeling of separation from humanity and the constant routine that they have to follow IE their boredom.The peak of the movie is the final stage of entry to Jupiter which to my opinion has not been surpassed since. The film really conveys the sense of wonder for someone entering a totally different world.Overall I would not propose this film to those who want to see a space opera where a gazillion space ships are blasted from the skies. The film is perfect for those who like old 50s-60s hard sci-fi even though I believe that they have already read the book (which has a very different tone from the movie)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not going to hide, that it's my favorite one, nor I will brag about it. I like to think, that most movies can be compared by how they succeed on different levels, which for me are: story, characters, sounds, picture, acting, philosophy, psychological impact. I'm still not sure if they all are equal, and anyway Space Odyssey succeeds in most of them, but if we consider the later two levels to be slightly more important, Space Odyssey becomes an ultimate movie. It might not be a movie at all actually, Space Odyssey is more likely a message (an important one) to humanity. It's also a half-encrypted one, which allows you to create a meaning, while still guiding you somewhere. Maybe that's why everyone after watching it has a slightly different interpretation, but main questions and ideas that arise in our minds are the same.We are all humans after all, and we are all here, spinning at a very fast speed on this funny round thing we call Earth and which has been our home for a very very long time. There might be a lot people, who after watching Space Odyssey, say it was boring and they just wasted their 'precious' time, but you can be sure - message was delivered. Kubrick was a genius, but so are we all</fullReview>

The effects were so incredible, especially for a movie from 1968 that they are better than a lot movies from the 90s oder 2000s. I mean the effects of Star Trek or Star Wars were all a plain joke compared to this and they came out later...The story - it was good until a certain point. It was intelligent, it was realistic and it really caught you in its atmosphere. But the ending... the ending was supposed as something to think about.. But you can't leave such a big question mark in the brains of all people who watch this without leaving any real kind of suggestions what the ending intended to mean, you simply can't do this in a movie in my opinion. Because of this I didn't feel like I had finished watching this movie, there was simply missing something and I really mean that in a negative way. Besides there were some scenes that were quite too long you could really cut about 20mins from this movie without missing anything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film brought to you courtesy of Arthur Clarke</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that because Stanley Kubrick directed this film people think that he wrote the SF story called The Sentinel, which led to a book, which led to this film. The Sentinal short SF story and the subsequent SF book 2001 A Space Odyssey was written of course by British SF pioneer Sir Arthur Clarke. The writer, Arthur Clarke was asked by his publisher to expand on his short story called The Sentinal which led to the creation of the book 2001 A Space Odyssey, which led to interest in creating a film version of the book. Sadly, both writer and director are now dead. This film did not age very well, I think. Never mind that the entire conceptualization has mankind making a trip to Jupiter in 2001 and in real life we are not even close to making such an expedition. That is a bit of a thing. Anyway, I think that without the original SF by Arthur Clarke this film would not even exist on paper. Maybe I am underscoring the efforts of the film maker, but since the entire story is the result of Arthur Clarke, I question the superiority of the director position in this project. The director is doing a job here, not the writer is doing a job for the director. The now famous 'psychedelic journey' in this film represents the futurism of Arthur Clarke, but it also associates the film with some kind of drug induced hallucination, which is not what the writer intended. The film is supposed to talk about how man comes into contact with a superior alien race. What that means is anybodies guess. The writer says it is the birth of man in a state of cosmic awareness in a new form. I think that is maybe a bit ambiguous.It is OK to question great works of SF, and Arthur Clarke was one of the best SF writers that ever lived.(by the way anybody can slip in zero G-its your muscle co-ordination thats the issue-not you falling down-and the character in question in the film has Velcro on the souls of her shoes which sticks to other fabric surfaces)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing, accurate, awesome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The number one reason I am so fascinated with this film is the fact that it was made in 1968. We hadn't even landed on the moon and lots of technology was still in its infancy. Yet, this films looks and sounds as if it were produced yesterday - in fact, it looks better. I don't think filmmakers could make something this good anymore with their crappy unconvincing CG. It's like a fine analog recording of a great jazz band, or a 60's muscle car - these things just aren't done the same way, lost to a different era.This film is also disturbing in a way I hadn't expected for a science fiction film. The use of music, sound, and trippy visual effects bring you to an almost psychedelic state of mind, especially near the end of the film. I don't think Aurthur C. Clarke had this in mind when he wrote the book, but Stanley Kubrick (director) took it to a whole new level.It's also jaw-dropping how accurately the future is predicted. I'm not going to spoil it for you, you'll have to watch the film to see what I mean. In fact it's so futuristic that friends and family of mine who saw the film for the first time were totally convinced it was made in the late 90s.If we had geniuses like Kubrick producing films like this today, just imagine the possibilities. By the way, 2010 (the sequel) doesn't even come close, but it's good nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1968: the year when sci-fi got interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the history of sci-fi films there are hardly a handful that go down in history as serious or important. 2001: A Space Odyssey is unsurpassed in both departments.Most important: where most films communicate their message through the dialogues and the story, 2001 works on a conceptual level. What makes this film really unique is that Kubrick leaves few clues to what this concept is which makes it impossible to form a clearly defined interpretation. Is the concept intelligence? Or the past and future of human kind? Or has it a religious message? There are NO answers...I remember watching it for the first time...and the second time the day after. What was this REALLY about? Browsing the internet for explanations. I read many theories, but none that was more plausible than the other.Just one time I got this feeling again, when I looked up on the pyramids in Egypt. What on earth IS IT? It's both frustrating and a pleasing at the same time. A kind of religious feeling.The sound plays an important role in the film. The music is partly classical, partly avant-garde. There are many scenes where breathing or distant sounds from animals make up the sound stage.Like other Kubrick films the story is told in "chapters". The story is nonetheless easy to follow.A sci-fi movie can't be reviewed without mentioning the special effects. A sci-fi made in 1968 will make most people think of flying saucers and silly costumes. 2001 does not look dated. The special effects are very much the same as those in Star Wars. It looks more realistic than Star Wars episode IV but not as astonishing as episode V.This is not a film for everybody. In the same time you do not have to like sci-fi to love this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not only is this one of the most awe inspiring movies ever, it was even more so when it was released in 1968. Kubrik creates a beautiful and illusive vision of the future and its an almost orchestral depiction as the spaceships spin and glide with Earth in the background. Never before in time had a movie captured space travel so well.The end of the movie is a little strange for my taste but the rest of the movie makes up for it with an interesting story and even better antics that make you wish you could travel in space.The memorable scene is when the futuristic stewardess is walking on the carpet with her "grip shoes", at the that moment you know that this is space and anything can happen.A brilliant look at the future that stands up even today as I am writing this in 2009, mostly because humans still haven't reached the capacity that the people in the movie have and when we do get there we'll look back at this movie and marvel at Kubrick's vision.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Groups of men look to discover the mysterious black object which landed on one of Jupiter's moons many years ago.Stanley Kubrick's picture is a wonderful depiction of monkey to man to machine that generates so many issues and questions and answers so little.Made in a time when technology was advancing so rapidly this film showed a wonderful vision of what the future could possibly hold.Filled with spaceships and alien characters this is a marvellous fantasy that shows a believable view of the future, which starts with a beautifully bizarre introduction.2 minutes of music on a black screen followed by 20 minutes of apes on a planet and the adventure has only just started.This opening is the most wonderfully weird introduction in Sci-Fi cinematic history. This is unique and almost unbelievable it is that strange. You have to see this introduction to really appreciate the originality and you will not be disappointed. Perhaps slightly overdrawn but still undeniably remarkable.What follows is a mystery charged investigation about a black slab named the Monolith. This simple creation puzzles apes, men and machines alike. The strange object is a wonderfully bizarre instrument in the films picture and is the key element of the story and like Hannibal Lecter, has little screen time but has the biggest impact. The creation of the Monolith is a puzzle and one that is still being debated over today. The Monolith's representation as a devastating and terrifying creature is helped along by one of the best music scores ever created.Richard Strauss' Thus Spoke Zarathustra is one of the finest compositions to ever appear on the big screen as is the use of Gyorgy Ligeti who wrote the majority of the score.The plot further engages audiences with its twisting narrative and enter HAL, the computer who runs the ship heading for Jupiter. HAL is a wonder, a strong minded computer that has a personal edge who makes the film darkly humorous and is one of the finest non human characters in the genre.2001: A Space Odyssey is cinematic brilliance. A forever changing strange narrative with the finest score ever written, stunning visuals and a mind opening vision of a possible future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 40th Anniversary of a Stanley Kubrick masterpiece. A landmark achievement in the science fiction genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When "2001" was released in 1968 it was breathtaking excitement. But this was a film that you watch in order to be entertained or amused. Instead it provides you with a banquet of food for thought,images that linger in the mild's eye long after the movie itself is over and it is a film that you could mediate on. At a running time of 151 minutes with about 2 and half hour of film with 45 minutes of dialogue. There are still two schools of thought until this very day. First one will agree that it is one of the greatest science fiction films ever made,a technical achievement unheard of when it was released in 1968. Second,one may agree that it is also one of the most horrifically boring and confusing movies ever made. The story(based on Arthur C. Clarke's novel of the same title,who wrote the screenplay)while,seemingly simple,is profound. Sequentially,several mysterious black monoliths are discovered and basically trigger certain events integral to the film. What are they? Where did they come from? What do they do? These are all questions one asks oneself while watching the story develop and is asked to find his own way. While most come away with a general idea of what took place in the story each individual will have to decide what it means to them. Any way one decides to answer these questions results in profound solutions. Its not left entirely up to interpretation,but in some aspects it is. Experience it for more clarification. The end result is quite chilling,no matter what your personal solution. "2001: A Space Odyssey" was not a regular motion picture with a complex plot,extensive dialogue,numerous characters,but rather,a story told in a series of carefully crafted pictures,which serve the purpose of not only amazing us through the breathtaking visual effects,but also of provoking our thought and imagination.Rather than telling us about it or explaining it to us Kubrick has decided to allow the audience to experience for itself thus unforgettable epic journey. The music of "2001" is as essential as any of the other elements in creating the atmosphere of the film,from the hallmark opening theme to Strauss' "Blue Danube". Although the first 2 hours of the film are,undoubtedly,visually stunning and rich in its metaphors. It is the last 20 minutes of "2001" that truly amaze and boggles the mind. From the cold,creepy shots showing Jupiter and its satellites(accompanied by the spine-chilling music),to the flabbergasting journey through the infinite,and finally,to the famous ambigous ending,Kubrick is provoking us to see the big picture:the fact that we have not even begun to understand the vastness of the universe and,even more than that,the infinite nature of our existence. Kubrick was a genius when he made this masterpiece,since this movie is to be experienced more than understood,and it is one of the few films that has stood the test of time,some 40 years after its release.What makes it work so well? The sheer scope and mastery of it all. This is film in its purest form and one of the most multi-layered motion picture ever made. It is one of the few films that can be incredibly artistic and succeed in being so without coming across as pretentious or inaccessible,unlike many other "classics". Most of all,it is a film of unparallel visual beauty. Its obvious Kubrick spend three years in the making and production on the look of this film,and he pulled off everything he set out to do. Its a feast for the eyes that only improves with each viewing. However,if you have a true appreciation for the fine art of cinema and its potential to illuminate and inspire,then you will certainly find that "2001" is one of the most important and profound works on film ever produced. Experience this with a food of thought. Have an open mind when you see this masterpiece of science fiction brilliance. "2001" stirs the emotions and penetrates the subconscious of the viewer and its astounding from beginning to end. The way to experience this movie is not on any DVD,but to see it in its entirely in the cinema on a widescreen in full 70MM and super Dobly Stereophonic sound.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story begins from the dawn of man, from the prehistoric era when the apes ruled the Earth.A rectangular monolith is being discovered by some of them, an object placed by aliens.In the distant future the evolution has taken the man into space.Another monolith is being found from the surface of the moon.In the year 2001 S.S.Discovery with its crew, captains Dave Bowman and Frank Poole and their computer HAL-9000 are on their way to Jupiter to find out what alien force is watching us.After a while HAL starts causing some trouble...Arthur C. Clarke, who we sadly lost at the age of 90 last March came up with the story of 2001.He was inspired by a short story called "The Sentinel" he had written in 1948.Clarke was such a great science fiction author and this is such a fantastic story.Stanley Kubrick, who we lost in 1999 at the age of 70 made Clarke's story into a film.And what a great film it is.The cast is very good.Keir Dullea plays the part of Dr.Dave Bowman.Gary Lockwood is Dr.Frank Poole.Douglas Rain provides the voice of HAL.William Sylvester plays Dr.Heywood R. Floyd.Vivian Kubrick, Stanley's daughter is seen as his daughter he calls squirt.Margaret Tyzack is Elena.There's a lot of classical music used in this movie that works brilliantly.There's "The Blue Danube" by Johan Strauss there.György Ligeti was behind most of that fantastic music.This is a movie that's hard for you to fully understand.Even Arthur C. Clarke once said: "If you understand '2001' completely, we failed.We wanted to raise far more questions than we answered."I've seen this movie a few times, four perhaps and it hasn't totally opened to me yet.But nevertheless it's a very cool movie experience.2001: A Space Odyssey came 40 years ago, in 1968.After all these years it still looks great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not For The Impatient</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I watched this film, I was under the impression that it was an amazing piece of film history. With an average rating of 8.5, and spectacular views from highly acclaimed movie reviews, but to be honest I was very disappointed, and found the film to be slow, not very eventful, and quite honestly confusing.At the start of the movie, when the giant black rectangular object first appears I was intrigued, I thought to myself; "is this the dawn of evolution. Is this how we became the intellectual dominating species which we are. However, as the movie went on I felt myself slowly loosing interest.It seems that very little is happening in the movie, when actually a great deal of important information is passing buy. The reason why the robots going mental is explained in a short space of time. Why was it homicidal etc. But despite this the film does have some of the best cinematography that I have ever seen in a film. This is why I gave the movie a 6.The film does drag on, with the slow movement of spacecrafts, and the weird techni-coloured acid trip taken in mid flight. An I have to say that this is beautiful. The Hotel room at the end of the film is also beautiful. With the white background and the lighting, making it seem very peaceful, after the eiry acid trip taken only moments before. But this tranquil scene is also riddled with suspense, a theme which travels constantly through the film.So to sum up, I would have to say that this film was not a 'Movie' as such, but more Art. With beautiful sets, and spectacular special effects, this film is a delight to anyone interested in Art,(I myself am not).So unless you appreciate Art, and can take to sit through over two hours of it, then I would recommend it, otherwise stay away and watch Alien.Milligan</fullReview>

		<fullReview>effects for being this old,see this movie in a theater and not at home,that's my advice. If you're looking for an action sci-fi flick,this is not for you. The poetic nerve here is the strength of this future vision,where an expedition is sent to a place near Jupiter to explore the source of a monolith discovered on the moon. A similar one on earth was said to have made man evolve from the apes in the far past. Now the crew has technology to aid them,but technology seem to have its own mind and motives.HAL,the ship computer,seem to have become somewhat too human and start making his own decisions.His red all-seeing eye are watching the crew around the clock. In many ways this movie makes you wonder and ponder the role of technology,and what might happen if it one day may start making decisions of its own,without our consent. Do we really want computers with feelings and emotions?Really? The tripped ending was a slight disappointment though,it was too indefinite and drug-induced...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a mind-blowing experience!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best, if not the best, science fiction movies I've seen. The film is long and very slow but I was never tempted to hit fast-forward. The actual story isn't too complex but it is compelling and deep and will leave you thinking about it for some time afterwards. The mysterious Monoliths, the "infallible" HAL-9000, hyper-travel through a wormhole, etc?these are just a few of the memorable things in 2001. And then there's the special effects; in a word, groundbreaking. Seriously, this stuff (from 1968!) wouldn't look out of place even in something as modern as Episode III. And to top it all off, you have Kubrick's incredibly effective use of music, sound effects,?and silence. Yep, this is one haunting masterpiece of the sci-fi genre and should not be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"2001, A Space Odyssey", is Stanley Kubrick's Masterpiece in a list of masterpieces (Dr.Strangelove, Clockwork Orange, The Shining, Full Metal Jacket, Spartacus, Eyes Wide Shut, Lolita, etc.),which combined places him in the exalted role of "greatest filmmaker of all". This 2001 extended journey within man's existence, and into degrees of space, still seems to stand atop everything made in film history despite 37 years passing since it's release. It travels from the beginning of man's evolution through apes, to modern day space-walkers, in the blink of an ape-man's tool. And with the help of a silver monolith, possibly planted on Earth by ancient Alien visitants to trigger intellect in future humans, a trip that takes millions of years to evolve is unleashed. The apes learn about the use of power through weapons, how they can gain property, and how to kill their fellow creatures through violence. Thus four million evolutionary years later, and not that much wiser, the intellect that was released has brought them from apes to moon-dancers. Of course the astronauts are still eating slaughtered packaged meat as they ride to investigate another monolith that has been discovered buried on the moon. Things change . . . things stay the same.Everything is brilliantly done up through the 2nd monolith's arrival, including wonderful choices and uses of music and silence, but the most interesting, calculating character in the movie is waiting to be introduced. The new monolith is pointing to Jupiter, and a human mission is sent to explore the giant planet under the supervision of Hal, an extremely intelligent computer who is put in charge of the entire expedition. While most of the spacemen are in a hibernated state, Hal interacts with the few that are awake (chrushing them at chess), as he runs the entire ship.But . . . Hal begins to make mistakes, and here's where Kubrick combines inner and outer space and elevates his movie beyond simple adventure. The astronauts realize that Hal has to be shut off, and of course Hal (who is a monster at lip reading) realizes that they will try to do just that. He begins one by one to kill the astronauts air supply, rather than be put down himself . . . just as a logical egotistical mind, that is caught making mistakes by the inner man, will try to destroy a person's body and suppress the truth rather than allow itself to be quieted. It takes a man of immense will and a calm deliberate approach to dis-engage the ego in both spaceship and in a human being, and this role goes to Keir Dullea, the astronaut who both physically and symbolically breaks down the doors blocking the essence of the ship's mission, and man's mission into the future.Once Hal is placed under control, the truth is revealed . . . and man's evolution rises into the next step and beyond . . . seemingly transcending both time and space.When this movie was released it created much confusion and didn't get the critical acclaim it receives today. It's slowly unfolded into our consciousness because it's really the story of man's entire history and of our individual personal lives and dreams rolled into one......a work of genius, that continues to stand the immense test of time in an art medium that re-invents itself continually.Hats off to you Stanley Kubrick.........a work unequaled.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2001 is a great movie, like it or not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie and found it to be challenging to the norm, challenging to relate to; and challenging to the average viewer's patience! This is also what I've been reading in some of the naysayer's reviews. This post (and rating) are a panacea to all that hootenanny because I found the challenges in this movie have rewards. What puzzles me is how many of these reviewers have been clearly moved in some fashion, but because it is not what they expected they trashed the rating. I have seen very good movies that I did not enjoy or identify with personally, but I will always give credit where credit is due. Rating this movie at a 1 or a 2 is not fair or objective.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick and Science Fiction, what more do you want?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick is quite possibly one of my favourite directors of all time. With the likes of Full Metal Jacket, A Clockwork Orange and the Shining, there's no denying that he's one of the most versatile directors of the 20th century. The 1968 film of 2001 a space odyssey can only be described as one of the biggest jaw dropping, cult classic films ever made. Even when you watch it now, it still amazes you. This film was made four decades ago and there have been very little sci-fi films; possibly the likes of Alien or Star Wars, that have come close to it's fantasy and UN-real adventure that leaves you pulling your hair out in amazement and question. If there is a more surreal film out there I'd like to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Curiously puzzling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a "fan" of Stanley Kubrick's work. I don't consider him to be a "genius" filmmaker, but I do think his work is curiously intriguing and at times daring. So for that I give him respect, but that doesn't mean I'll praise his work. The only film of his that I truly enjoyed was The Shining. Full Metal Jacket I thought was curiously lacking something humanizing, and left me unengaged, unlike Francis Ford Coppola's surrealistic Apocalypse Now. However this film, 2001, I feel very strange about.2001: A Space Odyssey is a thought-provoking sci-fi epic. I say "thought-provoking" because I had to think my way through this film, and was trying to figure out just what in hell I was watching, or what was going on. I've seen this film once (several years ago), and I plan on seeing it again sometime. Maybe after a few more viewings I'll be able to better understand the film, at least I hope so.The film moves almost unbelievably slowly, border lining on tedium. I mean there's slow, and then there's SLOW. This film is SLOW. But somehow, and believe me I don't know exactly how, it did hold my attention. Like I said above, I was really just trying to figure out what was happening. I liked the character of HAL 9000. Actually I'm a sucker of anything about how technology, a creation of man, comes back to bite them in the ass (i.e. Terminator 2: Judgment Day and The Matrix).I don't understand exactly what 2001 was saying, but it kept me watching with anticipation, one could almost say excitement, but mostly just puzzlement. And for that I respect the film for confusing the hell out of me, because that's doesn't happen often, if ever when I watch a movie. Maybe if Donnie Darko had truly confused me, maybe I would have had more respect for it. And while 2001 may not be my favorite film of Kubrick's, it's certainly one of his more captivating films. I respect this film, but I didn't quite love it, because it left me puzzled. So I'm giving the film a score of an eight out of ten, perhaps upon a second, third or maybe even a fourth viewing I'll reconsider, and give it a higher score.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the first great science Fiction film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>when I rate a movie not only do I rate it on how good it is, but what it did for movie history.2001: A Space Odyssey is a movie not told but shown(and if you watch the movie you will understand why I said that). That is one of the reasons why it is so great. Now the look of this movie is very well done. 2001 was made before CGI was, but that does not stop it from looking realistic( I like the way this and the old Star wars looks better then the new CG look).Now don't get me wrong 2001 does have some things people may not like.First of all meny are turned any way because the movie is slow. It is also very hard to understand. which leaves meny to believe that the movie is random and is about nothing in particular. how ever it is just the opposite. Second, the movie never really has a constant character all though the movie. which is not good for the development of the characters.But the things I listed may not seem that bad to some people. I think they are not so bad, but others disagree.So it comes down to this:if you like science fiction movie, and if you like movies that make you think you must watch this movie. Based on how well this movie was done and all that it did for movie to come I give 2001: A Space Odyssey a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001 is more than a film. It's an event. It goes silently but surely beyond being just a movie in its painstaking scientific accuracy and its depiction of a powerful yet patient alien force that is monitoring and influencing human development over millions of years. A very simple plot told in great detail. Special effects &amp; set design all come together. Definitely a cinematic work of art. Don't go in expecting car chases or gun battles -- the pace is slow and deliberate, but there is tension, mystery and suspense. And great danger. More than a film -- it's an event, going silently but surely beyond being just a movie in its painstaking scientific accuracy and its depiction of a powerful yet patient alien force that is monitoring and influencing human development over millions of years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This looks like the same version I just bought. I've seen the "complete, uncut" version on a local TV station. I've seen it in two cable versions lately. I've bought VHS and DVD, and I'm still missing my favorite scenes. . The best scene in the entire movie -- and the only one which drew a laugh when I saw it in college -- involved the "Instructions for Operating Zero Gravity Toilet." I understand this was deleted from the "Bible Belt" version of the film, and someone told me that the versions of movies we saw in college were the "European" versions. That's fine except that I have an American DVD player. I like seeing the "flight attendant" walk in a circle with her Velcro (TM) socks before going down a particular corridor. I like seeing the change of focus which makes the "Zero Gravity Toilet" plaque readable. If anyone knows of an American viewable DVD version that contains these scenes, please let me know, and I'll certainly buy it -- and sell my other two copies of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Film Needs To Be Put In Its Place</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Might Have Spoilers in it, depending on what you consider spoilers, i think that any review is by definition a spoiler because it effects your viewing experience by placing bias on your thoughts pertaining to the film before you see it. Anyways. Basically, people either say: A) this movie sucks its boring, has no plot, the visuals are well composed, but look fake by modern comparison, the acting is terrible, etc.....or B) this is the greatest film of all time, it explores such amazing depths of human existence, the visuals are brilliant and unmatched, incredible, intelligent, etc......The truth is they are both right, and both wrong. The problem arises in the fact that Film does everything film can do, but does it in non film ways. This film IS boring, it has no plot, it has no "acting". It ISN'T supposed to! This film shouldn't be on the shelf at blockbuster, it should be at the library in the philosophy section, or hanging in the art gallery. You are all looking at this the wrong way, with closed minds. This is just a philosophical text and a painting seen through the camera, it is in no way a "film".You stuck up people who think they are better than everyone else because they "get it" are all wrong to give this a 10, because a film is made up out of all the aspects, plot, acting, cinematography, meaning, technical achievement, pacing, etc..... so just because you feel the need to make yourselves feel better by claiming this is such a great film only you can appreciate it don't try to tell anyone its truly a 10/10 or the greatest film of all time. It clearly isn't, it might have a 10/10 in a few aspects, but that doesn't make up for all the 0/10 its going to get in the other components of a film.You dull people who think that a film needs explosions every 6 seconds, a classic story-telling technique, and has to have some big Hollywood star are all wrong as well. Film is an art form, and for a film to actually delve into some philosophical idea is a great thing, and deserves its respect. Just because you can't focus your attention for more then 10 seconds and are too lazy to want to put any effort into watching a movie doesn't meant that filmmakers should cater to your slothfulness and intellectual degradation.I give it a rating of 3 not because it is awful in its entirety, but these ratings are supposed to rate it as a movie, compared to all other movies in the world, and as a movie, it is awful. If this was the the "Internet ART AND PHILOSOPHY DataBase" then i would rate it a 10/10, but it isn't, this is the "Internet MOVIE DataBase", so, when you consider all the things that make a good FILM, 2001 doesn't match up to truly great films which not only have equally good visuals and meaning, but also have original plots (the 2001 plot is original, i suppose a better word would have been something like....engaging?), intense characters, good pacing, etc.....So, everyone needs to put away their egos and give this film a fair and just judgment. One of the best 100 FILMS of all time? not even close, A brilliant visual work of art and exploration of man, yes.One last note, some people like to add that the music is brilliant, but id like to remind you that Kubrick didn't compose it, other musical geniuses did, and trust me, it is not that hard to pick out some famous classical music and put it in a movie, so give the musical credit to where it is due, the composers, and not to Kubrick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2001: after 30 years, shows no hint of weathering.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One can say what they will about Kubrick's true masterpiece, but no matter what way you cut it, "2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY" remains the king of them all. This is truly the template that set the groundwork in special effects and storytelling. There are far to many science fiction movies today that are nothing more then "Top Gun" or "True Grit" in space. Perhaps this is why people still remain sharply divided on this film, that was simply, unarguably ahead of its time, which is why I remain mystified as to why the film did not get an anniversary release in more theaters then it did. It would truly be the movie experience of a lifetime to be able to see this picture in cinerama again, without having to travel from Boston to Seattle to do it. Unfortunately, some of the home video releases, which have made honest attempts to present us with cleaned up versions, still fall short of the mark. 2001 is a film which deserves so much more then to be letterboxed on a standard screen or small television. And for people who have never seen this film before, watching it on television simply is not the way to get the full or even a third of the impact that this movie has to offer. As far as the props and sets go, to me, they just do not look outdated. 2001 still shines.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Viewing the film in Cinerama at Pictureville in Bradford West Yorkshire in the year 2001 was something to look forward to after only having seen the film on TV many years ago.I should have stuck to my memories, as the excellent new print and brilliant cinema could not compensate for a self indulgent and very dated film. I had forgotten just how boring it was and the magic of watching models rotate slowly to nice music has gone.The entry to Jupiter really dated the film in the 1960's and reminded me of the trip sequence in "Easy Rider". The opening ape sequence was reminiscent of "Planet of The Apes" though both films appeared in the same year so who borrowed what I know not.Having seen "The Dish" a few days previously, the magic and mystique of outer space does exist for me, but sadly not from this film so rooted in the 1960's</fullReview>

Then it proceeds to a lunar landing mission segment which I guess was only suppose to awe the audience of what the future was suppose to look like. Then it picks up in Jupiter and blah blah blah, Hal becomes a d*ck and messes everything up blah blah, they find another monolith in space, blah, Dave sees his future selves, AND THEN HE TURNS INTO A F*CKING ORBITING FETUS, THE END. I found myself unsatisfied as I came to conclude that I had no idea what had just happened.

		<shortDescription>A sci-fi classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Opening before humanity evolved from apes we see a group of apes as it clashes with another group; fighting with hands and teeth. Then one day one of the apes finds a strange black monolith; shortly afterwards it learns how to use objects as weapons? a new stage in its evolution has begun. Jumping forward to the near future another monolith has been discovered on the Moon. This discovery leads to a mission to Jupiter; its six-strong team consists of Dave Bowman, Frank Poole, three scientists in stasis and HAL, the ship's computer. As they approach Jupiter it appears that HAL has made an error; something unheard of for such a machine; if the mission is to go ahead as planned it looks as if Dave and Frank will have to disconnect HAL; something HAL will not let them do without a struggle! Once that problem is past and the ship approaches Jupiter things get very strange indeed.Love it or loathe it there is no denying that '2001' is one of the most significant science fiction films ever made. It might not feature exciting laser battles or strange alien creatures and its pace is distinctly slow but it is still a must see for fans of the genre. The effects are brilliant; the ships don't look like models and the apes do not look like people in costumes? despite the fact that they are. Most films can usually be summed up in a few sentences but it is impossible to really do that here as I'm not one hundred percent certain what it is about despite having watched it a few times? perhaps this is why it is such a great film; it leaves the audience to decide on a lot of matters without it seeming like a cop out. The cast of relatively unknown actors does a fine job; most notably Keir Dullea who plays Dave and Douglas Rain who provides the voice of HAL; making it one of Sci-fi's best known characters despite the fact that all we see of it is its glowing red 'eye'. Stanley Kubrick did a fine job bringing this far-reaching story to the screen; if you haven't seen it yet I'd certainly recommend checking it out; especially if you are a science fiction fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predated Star Wars by nearly 10 years and Alien by 11</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every time I see this movie I am in disbelief that it could've been made in 1968, that's before Woodstock. People at the time must've been absolutely blown awayThe effects, the colours and the lines are absolutely beautiful. As are the silence, the music, the orchestral dronesThis is a great movie in it's own right and without it we would not have had Alien, Blade Runner and probably not Star Wars either which would've had a domino effect throughout recent film/TV history and gaming history too - no Battlestar Galactica, no Dead Space2001 surely changed the ballpark and for that it would have to be considered as one of the most important movies ever madeFor those of you that find the movie boring, you're not abnormal. Yes it is a slow movie even boring at times, yes I thought the part where he retrieves his buddy from space was way too long. But we have the technology now, if you want fast then watch it at double speed if you have to. It still beats cgi and what we have now for realism to my eyes. It is a visual and sonic masterpiece</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Ambiguous And Beautiful Masterwork</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Make no mistake, 2001: A Space Odyssey is Kubrick's best. A Clockwork Orange, Dr. Strangelove and The Shining were all exceptional films, but no other Kubrick film, or any film, for that matter, has made something so emotionally twisting and beautiful. If a film can be art, this truly is. The story begins with a prologue concerning early humans finding a mysterious thing that looks like a door, and from there follows the story of astronauts on a mission to Jupiter accompanied by the computer HAL. But don't see the movie expecting that. See the movie expecting emotion. Unlike the traditional spectrum of Action vs. Character, 2001 is almost completely separated from those analysis. The two extremes of movies are movies filled with character and not much happening or filled with action and not much character, and when these two aspects are merged together in harmony and balance, you get a masterpiece, like the Godfather, There Will Be Blood, Goodfelas or Pulp Fiction. But 2001 is something completely different. The movie has very little to do with character, but is very slow-paced and events are far apart. This movie is pushed ahead by something hard to define. The closest I can come to defining it is a huge sense of wonder. Like, you sit through the whole movie just marvelling at it's beauty. But this isn't an art gallery. There are huge themes of evolution, humanity, automation and what makes us human. The movie does throw huge narrative curves that will shock and disturb you, and I guarantee you certain images and sounds will stay with you to your dying day.This movie is an experience. From the first few seconds that might make you think there's something wrong with the image on your TV to spine-shivering, inspiring moments to the Blue Danube, this is awe-inspiring in the most awe-inspiring sense of the world.P.S. don't watch this movie if you need constant action, if you are 10 or if you can't focus on anything. Just sayin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Kubrick Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001 is one of those movies I can watch over and over again for the rest of my life and me moved every time.2001 makes me feel like time has slowed down to a pace, or even stopped, and I experience the moment full measure. Not many directors have been able to do that, except Rod Serling and a few other creative geniuses.Admittedly, I am biased in favor of Kubrick films, because I absolutely admire and adore the way he managed to capture the essence of "being there" in the scene as though it were real, yet unreal, somehow surreal, like a lucid dream, but better than any dream. Nevertheless, I believe that 2001 clearly stands out as masterpiece of cinema, whether or not seen through the eyes and heard through the ears of a Kubrick fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey is an amazing film. There, that's out of the way. Now I can discuss why. Of course there are the usual things: the amazing special effects(one of the few Oscars SF films ever win), the scientific accuracy, and of course the music; I get the chills whenever I watch the opening shot. And then there are the iconic scenes that nearly everyone manages to rip-off in some way, shape, or form. And then there's HAL. I'm not sure if I'd call the HAL 9000 computer the greatest movie villain, but he's certainly up there. Think about it: he's polite, he's got a great personality, a cheery, conversational manner(compared to the monotoned astronauts), and he's terrific at chess. And he's not above killing people to complete his mission. Douglas Rain deserves an award for the voice of HAL(Anthony Hopkins modeled his Hannibal Lecter after it); the homicidal computer would be nothing without it. And let's not forget his demise: HAL's rendition of "Daisy Bell" is certainly the most haunting scene in the film. HAL is without doubt my favorite part of 2001, and I think Stanley Kubrick did an amazing job with him. But I think HAL would do better playing poker: he's got the perfect poker face.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie would most likely not appeal to most people with a short attention span, since it has long beautifully shot scenes with no dialog. I'll admit myself, if I wasn't at a screening of this film I would have probably stopped watching it not long after the Dawn of Man scene, but after staying through the entire length, I am more than happy to say that the movie is pure genius. The long shots assisted by orchestral music gives you the feeling that you're part of the odyssey as opposed to just watching another movie (which is probably the feeling that has made Kubrick so famous). It is an older movie, but the mechanical effects are fantastic (with the exception of the apes), and it feels like you're watching a film that is years younger. If you prefer a fast pace, I would not recommend 2001: A Space Odyssey, but if you're like me and enjoyed "There Will Be Blood" and similar films, then 2002 is a must see.</fullReview>

With many futuristic elements at the time, and revolutionary special effects, the movie changed movie making as we know it. This movie, featuring the infamous computer Hal, sparked a new thought on computers. this is a movie, of revolutionary ideas, special effects, and some of the greatest questions of all time. 2001 a space Odyssey is possibly one of the best science fiction films ever made.

You can think in every single frame, you can be very touched just by Keir Dullea's breath, his desolation, an endless way to find ourself. I must admit that whoever writes a negative thing about this movie is only without any possible sense of exploring or spiritual soul. -1968- !!! crazy to do such a thing....Kubrick was (or better "is") the elegant open-minded good genius that only few people could understand...Fotography is unbelievable... fantastic techniques, instruments.

		<shortDescription>A niche film few will like</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those considering seeing 2001: A Space Odyssey, ...don't. More than likely you'll have the same negative reaction most viewers do. That is, you'll find it slow and boring and the ending to be a frustrating let-down. All of this is true. And it's the reason you won't find films like it in the theaters gobbling up tons of money and receiving rave reviews.Money speaks and it speaks the truth of the common man. Since the common man won't enjoy a film like this, no studios make films like this. Because they know they won't make money. As a potential viewer, that right there tells you what you'll likely think about this movie and whether you should bother renting it or not.Don't be fooled by the inclusion of this film in any Top 100 lists, or the many positive reviews you'll find on here.First, the film's only notable because of how visionary the imagery was. Not because of a great plot, pacing, editing, or acting. And you can't necessarily credit the director for any of this since he wasn't the production designer, the art department, the set designer, or the cinematographer. For all we know from reading the credits alone, Kubrik was simply lucky to have all those talented visionaries around him. You certainly don't see the same visions in his other films.Second, the positive reviews are written by those who want to defend the film. There are far more folks who want to defend their own sense of "art" than there are who will bother finishing the movie, much less go online to review it. It's just not worth their time. So you end up with a decidedly skewed perspective when you read the reviews. You get the occasional person who bothers to post their real feelings about it (boring, slow, bad ending, etc.), and then you get this mountain of posts from the same few people who think you've assaulted their personal sense of artistic taste.If you actually MADE 100% of the movie-going population watch this, and then MADE them rate it honestly, you'd find that it barely receives three stars. It's just that "odd" and unappealing to the public at large. I have many ordinary, everyday friends, and most have never been able to finish the film. I was only able to bear through it out of curiosity.So, in summary, ...Are you the "common man"? Do you like Terminator 2 and despise Dangerous Liaisons? Do you watch "24" and "ER" on TV, and not 2-hour documentaries about the dung beetle on the nature channel? Is your idea of fun to watch the ball-game, or is it to turn on some classical music and curl up with a book about the NASA program?If you're the former - like the other 90% of us - then you won't enjoy 2001: A Space Odyssey, so don't waste your money.It CERTAINLY deserves its place in film history due to the gorgeous visuals and imaginative vision. However, just because the 4-hour silent epic, Birth of a Nation is historically significant too doesn't mean the average person is gonna wanna sit through THAT either.If you want to get caught up, please rent the movie 2010, which is the sequel to 2001. Although it's cold-war tension is rather dated now, you will find yourself completely caught up on what happened in 2001 within the first 10 minutes. As a matter of fact, you'll feel MORE caught up than if you had bothered to watch 2001. Plus, 2010 will take off at a more palatable pace and keep you watching to find out what the mystery behind the monoliths is.</fullReview>

It was about as exciting as the selection of screen savers that comes preinstalled with Windows.I found the opening scenes far too drawn-out, and disliked the ostentatious use of music while an ape smashed bones in the desert. There's so much wrong with this - I mean since when did apes live in the desert?! And how was it beneficial to the ape to spend its time smashing skulls that posed no threat and produced nothing useful... beats watching this movie I suppose.HAL was sort of cool, but after he was switched off the film had nothing going for it.Yup, I fell asleep with Cletus and Billy-bob.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A grueling 2.5 hours of sheer nonsense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had read countless reviews praising this film as the ultimate Si Fi movie of all time. This is a below average movie. There is nothing clever in the film except the elaborate revolving sets and the space ship models. Although the gadgets 'envisioned' in the movie where already seen in countless, Star Trek episodes which started airing in 1966. Yes the gizmos where shown to be more realistic in this film. There are some very convincing scenes in the beginning of the film that show the effect of zero gravity, but the realism dies a sudden death when you see the effects of low gravity on the moon.There are several problems with the story itself that I find odd in this film. This film lacks a motive. This film is not about the evolution of man's intellect, nor is it about how drastically different our future is from our past. It's definitely not about aliens planting smoothly polished rectangular black stone all over the universe. It's not about space, a talking computer or about going to Jupiter. And in the end you know that this film is about nothing.There is a total of 6 minutes of moronic noise with nothing to see in the beginning and right after the intermission. It must have some profound meaning which normal people are not supposed to understand. Then there are countless painfully long slow motion scenes of the astronauts floating about in space. There is exactly 12 minutes of some kind of dream sequence. What demented purposes do these lengthy scenes serve? It forces me to believe that the last fifteen minutes of the movie was meant to be seen while you smoke some kind of banned substance.The movie has so many loose ends, which the makers of the movie claims, is the gist of the movie. The whole point of the movie is to totally confuse sensible paying viewers. But that has already been done, rather beautifully, by the crew of "Monty Python's Flying Circus". This film is an insult on our intelligence. This movie pokes fun at our sensibility.A films goal is to tell a story, an Idea, in an entertaining manner. Just because Stanely Kuberick does it, it does not necessarily mean its great cinema. This is definitely not an epic film and all the reviews comparing it to the real epics of cinema are in effect ridiculing some of the great movies of our time.This film is like throwing a line and bait into the water and waiting a very long time for a bite. And when you finally get a nice strong tug at the line, you feel that you've got at least a 10 ponder on that line. You simply take your knife and cut the line away. And there goes your 10 pound fish with the bait and all. That's what this film is, a total waste of 2 hours and 28 minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So many film fans/buffs love to rhapsodise about this movie and I've never understood why, as these are the same people who decry a lack of coherent intelligent plot and direction in modern movies.The model work is of course outstanding, a technical achievement par excellence.However, the beginning and end section are heavy handed pseudo-intellectual allegories with nothing particularly relevant to say, well that could not have been said a good deal more elegantly or succinctly in less pretentious hands .Luis Bunuel showed what fun tricks can be had with a movie camera in the 1920's so why does Kubrick make us endure little more than an overlong, glorified light show after we reach Jupiter? The continued repetition serves no purpose, unless you ascribe one to it.The pacing of the movie is stultifying, and events just "happen" almost ad hoc, with the subtitles apparently linking them into what is supposed to be a cohesive whole. We could loose at least 80 minutes from the running time and focus more on such paltry things as character and dialogue.I don't dispute the technical achievement of the effects or that Kubrick did know film, but here I see the worst case of an auteur believing in his own 'genius',knowing slyly that anything open ended or vague will be lapped up by the cognoscenti eager to prove that they at least understood - pity poor peons that scorn us.This is a personal opinion for which I expect vilification, but I believe a film should have something to say other than 'aren't I clever', and despite what many profess to be the hidden depths in this film, that's what always strikes me about it.</fullReview>

Spectacular visuals, stunning sets and locations, and perhaps the best movie soundtrack ever, but the story itself is almost lost in the process. Entire plot could have been adequately covered in about 25 minutes. LOOOOOOONG sequences with no dialogue make it hard to follow the storyline. Beginning with a pre-historic version of "West Side Story", and concluding with a "What the heck was that all about?" dream (?) sequence, I have no idea what Kubrick was trying to say at the end. Worth seeing just to know that this type of filmwork could be done in 1968, it is truly amazing what they accomplished without modern computers. Pity their predictions of the year 2001 were not more accurate in some respects (Video phones are commonplace, a base on the Moon, Jupiter having a solid surface, the survival of Pan-Am, etc.).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film put me to sleep more times than any other film I have ever seen. It is positively the most boring film ever made. Kubrick has done great work with A Clockwork Orange and Spartacus, but when he tries to do profoundly thought-provoking films, he tends to put viewers to sleep. I can argue against every single aspect of this movie, save the special effects, which are still fabulous even today.My problems with the film include a plot that is about as sporadic as the average Hollywood producer's creative processes. Now, when I see a film concerning space travel, I assume it should be interesting to watch. However, Kubrick managed to even turn off interest. If I wanted to watch a realistic exploration of space travel, I'd watch NASA videos. But for movies in a theater, I want to be entertained. I want to see the screen and watch something new. 2001 didn't do that for me. If I had been alive in 1968, my opinion may have been different, because space travel wasn't something most people had been used to. For me, I've seen it so many times that the film doesn't bring anything new to me. I've seen it all done before, usually in reality, not film. Therefore, I was hoping for a plot, and there wasn't one.The opening sequence is a masterpiece, just because it actually provides some great moments. But once the bone is thrown into the air, be sure to grab your coffee or Pepsi or No-Snooz. The bone thrown into the air has to be the most overrated sequence in the history of film. Everyone keeps saying, "The morph from the bone to the ship is absolutely stunning." WHAT MORPH? There is just a straight cut from the bone to the ship... and it just didn't work. The ship didn't look like the bone, and I don't know why everyone gets so worked up over it. It boggles the mind...And boggling the mind seems to be Kubrick's strong point. The final sequence as Kubrick gives us a light and sound show goes on for what feels like three hours. I actually fast-forwarded the scene just to get through it without falling asleep. And the star child... what was that all about? Who was it? What was the room he arrived in? I believe that any other director in any other film would have been ridiculed and laughed at for years for making the exact same scene. But because Kubrick's name is attached, it gains this "respect" that is rather... annoying... to say the least. It's an overrated sci-fi film that provides moments of entertainment, and the rest is merely filler for your average insomniac.</fullReview>

It could have been a one of the best films ever made, but sadly Kubrick dropped the ball.Problem is that the film seriously lacks content. It has brilliant pieces that stay separate to the end of the film and you can't really form any kind of summary or idea what it was about. Instead of a sequences that would allow audience to get the plot and idea, Kubrick added classical music and fancy picture art show.Point being, if you can't follow the movie without reading a book about it, it is rather poorly made.</fullReview>

Not even Buddha himself could answer the question:"why is this film so successful when its so bad".I've heard all the praise about it and decided i need to watch it in my spare time for the sake of educating myself and growing as an artist(well,computer graphics major but its art all the same). When i saw this i thought my video player was having issues, and following that, instantly annoyed, not even 15 min in and i was asking myself "The hell is this?!" i picked out all the references that I've seen satirized in media, but i didn't understand why, there was Absolutely NOTHING good about this film. The only decent part was the HAL plot line, which i noticed had been made fun of the most and i finally understand why, BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING ELSE IN THIS FILM TO SATIRIZE!.When it's not Animal Planet, its a "Things floating in space" classical music video, or an LSD trip backed up by a choir of screaming people, now think about this, a CHOIR OF SCREAMING PEOPLE, yeah, that's what i wanna listen to for 1/3 of the whole film. There is ONLY 2 things i can imagine this getting such high praise, the visual effects coupled with all the critics in 1968 being stoned out of their minds, This guy took "movies are a visual medium" a little too literally, this film is on par with Michael Jackson's "Moonwalker" 1/3 plot, 2/3 pointless filler...actually even filler is to positive a word to use, its NOTHING, you can cut it out and the storyline(whatever there is) wont be affected in the slightest.IF Kubrick wanted to make a piece of art, he would've been better off making a series of paintings because as a film, this simply cant stand, its the equivalent of DaVinci making a movie about a woman standing still instead of simply painting "The Mona Lisa". in short This film will waste almost 3hrs of your time and give you nothing in return, you're better off staring at your wall. You see that "spoiler alert" box, IMDb can remove it for this film because there's absolutely NOTHING to spoil.Final Verdict: Avoid this film at all costs,it doesn't deserve to exist.</fullReview>

Watching it reminded me of listening to Dark Side of the Moon for the first time on a great stereo years ago.For all you sad people who are bored by this masterpiece, I surmise you have never been to a museum (or on the off chance you have, tried to rush through to "see everything" in a couple of hours), have never sat and watched a sunset to its fruition, have never carefully read a poem, have never spent a few seconds looking into someone's eyes before kissing them, etc. Please try some of the above as you are obviously missing out on much of the beauty of life. Or just do what you will most likely do and re-watch Shawshank Redemption on cable or maybe Titanic from your "classic" DVD collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Isn't This Your Favourite Film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many things in life that baffle me; the world's ongoing fascination with Paris Hilton, the fact that Will Ferrell is a movie star, the inclusion of synchronised swimming as an Olympic event.And why "2001" is not the favourite movie of everyone who has seen it.Maybe its because it wears the SF label, but there's not a bug-eyed monster or a ray-gun or a noisy space dogfight in sight. Instead, there is mystery and murder, elegance and the everyday.Maybe its because you have to decide what its about. Kubrick doesn't tell you. (Clarke tells you more if you read the book and Hyams tells you a bit in the sequel.) Is it about Nietzsche's idea that man is the missing link between ape and superman/starchild? Is it about God/god being simply a more evolved species than our own? Is it about natural intelligence versus artificial intelligence? (Both the monolith and HAL have power over humans). Is it about natural emotion versus artificial emotion? (Hal has never been evil to me; he is more like one of those super-intelligent kids who go to university at age 12 and can't cope emotionally with their environment. HAL, to my mind a victim of a form of emotional abuse (after all he is a child of only 9), doesn't know how to lie, but does possess a strong survival instinct.) Maybe its because the dialog is all but meaningless. Hardly anything of significance is spoken. It could almost be done as a silent film, but that would rob us of one of the most emotional scenes in cinema history - HAL begging for his rational life. You do have to listen to this film - but its the music that tells us the story; its the silence that tells us the story; its Dave's breathing that tells us the story.Maybe its because you saw it on TV. This is not a TV movie; its not even a home theatre movie. This is a cinema movie. See it on the big screen. Anything less and its power and beauty diminishes dramatically. Feel it first and then think about it. And let its wonder consume you."2001". The. Best. Ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Screenplay ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK I consider myself a pretty big film buff, but really so many years after its release people still hug this movie for dear life, WHY?. The movie moved slower than a sloth on sleeping pills, the screenplay was awful, for example I remember a pan shot where the ship was moving towards the camera and for a solid 50 seconds that is all it was, while playing its oh so famous theme song, its like they went out of there way just to show off visual effects (Which I think they did extremely well for their day) and didn't concentrate on the important things like story progression and a ending that actually made sense to the common man.in closing he effects where incomparable for its time, top notch in that department, great sets, great story idea, terrible execution of idea, and Extremely slow moving plot and I though the score was absolutely great, except it didn't really suit the scene in some parts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lofty ideals, told in a lofty manner.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was at first enamored with 2001. I enjoyed the apes scene, and I could grasp the evolutionary concepts. Then the movie goes on a trip to AllegoryLand, and I'm at a loss. Also, Kubrick, whose other films I generally love, decides to absolutely torture the viewer with gruelingly long scenes, such as taking 45 seconds to show a capsule opening a door with a mechanical arm, or a full 5 minutes to show a guy silently floating outside the ship to fix something. Kubrick's exact same message could've been gotten across in 1:45 minutes, but instead he takes 2:15, thanks mostly to unnecessarily long scenes of showing mundane acts.No, I'm not a person with a short attention span. There are plenty of three, and even four and five hour films that I adored (Gettysburg was around 5 hours I think). I just ask that something be happening, if I wanted to look at still pictures and listen to classical music, I'd go to a museum.No, I'm not an action whore either. There are plenty of slow, and thought-provoking films I've enjoyed. But in my opinion, if the average viewer has no friggin' clue what your point is, the film has failed. I had a wonderful English professor in college that taught us that it's not how fanciful you can write, or how many impressive words you can squeeze into your text .. *good writing is about how well you can convey your ideas*. I feel the same is true of filmmaking. All the great philosophies and lofty ideals are useless if not conveyed in a way that doesn't require a full text to be understood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion this is a movie worth watching. However, I would say it is highly overrated. In 1968, the visual effects where probably stunning, and they are still today not bad! The music fits very well and you get the impression that alot of work is put into this movie!In my opinion however, it is highly overrated! The movie is far to long; it needs not be two and a half hour in order to tell the story. Each sequence is just far too long! Even if it's beautiful, you get tired of watching an austronaut spinning around in space for 10 minutes and you don't need a five minute display of the spacecraft drifting through space, no matter how good the accompanying music and the visual effects are.5/10</fullReview>

Didn't get it, had to read a summary to get it, and its clear the movie don't have it all.What i hate is that it is SOOO slow, Heck the first 3 minutes is black screen with some strange noise. And there's even more black screen further in. It takes 25 minutes to get into space. Every moon landing takes lots of time.Also they think noise, high frequency pink noise is something you wanna listen to for multi plate times in 20 minutes in a row.... Strange again.Don't want it. Don't think about it. STAY AWAY! SAVE YOUR TIME. If you wanna know what happens, find a good summary. You will read it quicker, understand what happens and be more happy.</fullReview>

No beauty that you will be impressed with. If you want to see graphical art, play MASS EFFECT 3 and do yourself a favour.

		<shortDescription>The most awful, dragging, overrated and boring movie I've seen ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now that Interstellar had released a few days ago, i came to see the IMDb reviews and on YouTube. Everyone seemed to be comparing that to this movie. Some people were like "Its the next 2001: A Space Odyssey", and some others were like " You cant compare Interstellar to 2001" and all. People were also comparing this to Gravity. So i decided to download and watch this piece of crap, blindly believing the 8.3 it got.I now realize i made a big, big mistake. Oh my God! This movie is terrible to the inner most core you can imagine! Let me brief it out to you :First 2 minutes of nothing but a blank screen. Thank God i fast forwarded that. Wonder how people back in the 1968's watched that in the theatre. Then 20 minutes of apes. Some bit of narration could have been better for that scene right? All you see is apes shouting, eating, then some monolith randomly appears, they look at it, some super irritating noise in the background, then apes fight and then it just cuts away to another 10 minutes of establishing shots of space shuttles. Oh goodness. Couldn't they just move on? I've watched many movies that have had slow starts. But this one was toooooooo slow. If you see the entire movie, at least 50 minutes of it was shots in the space. I get it. Its all "art" and stuff. But seriously? Those shots were so dragged on and boring, and the same music was being played again and again. How irritating can it get?The only interesting part was with that HAL 9000 computer. That super genius, villainous, smart computer which knows everything you do on that space shuttle. And it just kills everyone. And it dies. Pfft! Over.This movie also lacks dialogue. Its almost like watching a silent movie. Let me tell you something. There's nothing to explain you the ending that will not make any sense. I was so bored i opened the Subtitles Explorer to see when the next dialogue will come. Guess what? From 1 hr 57 minutes till the ending (2 hrs 28 minutes), you get nothing. Nothing that will tell you what the heck is going on!Look, i can understand things without the dialogue. But The ending of this movie is so confusing that you would at least need some thing to explain whats happening. Suddenly, that monolith will be floating in space, then Dave (some scientist in the movie) flies into beyond infinite (i guess), which is shown by a long draggy 7 minute light show (Arrgghhh!) and then he lands up somewhere old. And then the monolith appears again, and he becomes some Cosmo baby, and is probably going back to Earth. What would you even understand from this?? I heard its based on some book. The book probably explains everything. But for people like me who don't read books and have just watched the movie, they must tell something right?I would have liked this movie, if they had cut out that useless ape scene, and reduce the establishing shots of space from 50 minutes to probably 15, and the movie simply started with that scene where some scientists talk about some problem up in Cervius (sorry if i got the name wrong), showed more or at least told more about what that monolith could do, then the HAL 9000, and explained the goddamn ending. But.... No.Overall, this is a movie that is so boring and draggy, that even if you 4X those space shots, nothing will happen. I don't know why this movie got 8.3 and all! Doesn't even deserve a 1. Completely overrated.Even though Gravity was slow, it instilled that fear in you that how it is when you are in space. I haven't watched Interstellar yet, but I'm sure it will be better than this piece of goat poop!!UPDATE : I watched Interstellar, and its amazing. If this movie at least had some dialogue, then it could've been better</fullReview>

There was hardly any action. Although the Classical orchestra soundtrack was very nice. The visuals were very creative. Whenever this movie pops on TV, I feel like changing the station instantly. Not because it is a bad movie, just because I know what I am in for when watching this - complete and total boredom. It is a movie I saw when I was young, but I never got into the science fiction thing... because it simply wasn't real. Just like this movie - very unrealistic.

		<fullReview>It seems to be trendy to have lovely things to say about Stanley Kubrick's Space Odessy. Like A Clockwork Orange, this is one of his films that I just cannot tolerate to watch. The story is beautiful, and the directing style is inspired and true genius at work. There, I said it. But the musical score seems to be the star, and frankly, it's nerve-wracking, unintelligent classical droning just totally put me off this film. It's a migraine generating cacophony which sincerely has your hand twitching involuntarily towards the remote.It does have a beautiful story, if you can wade through the noise to discover it. It does have wonderful performances, if you can hang in there that long. It does have some innovative ideas in the genre of science fiction, if you aren't brain dead by the time you get to them.Personally, I don't want to have to work that hard to enjoy a movie, no matter how good, it ultimately is.Based on content, it rates a 9.8/10.Based on musical score, it rates a 0.5/10.Based on performances, it receives a 7.8/10.Based on the watchability factor, it rates a 3.2/10.That's a combined average of 5.325/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is so bad, I can't even find a word in the dictionary to describe it. Why on earth would anyone want to see this? Stanley Kubrick has got to be the most overrated director in the history of cinema. I don't think there's ever been a director who's made so many bad movies and is hailed as a God. The whole movie is pictures and music, or what some of you would call "art." There's like maybe a half hour of talking in a movie that's over two hours. So much time is spent on the "art" of this movie that it doesn't even feel like a movie. God, you go to the museum to see art, you go to the movies to have a good time. I cannot even describe the agony of watching this film. In fact, it was so bad I had to get up every other minute and walk around. You will never in your life see such a boring picture. This is THE most boring and overrated movie of ALL TIME. How does Kubrick do it? It seems that all he has to do is make a movie that no one understands and everyone goes nuts over it! I could have shown scenes of space and men in space and mammals beating each other with bones and would it be called one of the best films of all time? I even tried using my imagination to "look" for something in the movie that I thought I wasn't getting but I couldn't even get over the fact that I was still watching it. Is this even classified as a movie, or is it a space slide show? Yes, it's beautiful, but I wanted to see a freaking film. Don't recommend this to friends. They'll shoot you. Kubrick once again steals the show with a real dud. Psychologists should show this film to people as part of an experiment on boredom. You'll wanna ship this movie off into space, or at least go to space yourself to get away from it. Ignore all the hype, this movie is a waste of your time. It's NOT entertainment. Kubrick needed to realize why people go to the movies. This is possibly one of the worst films ever, and it's praised as a masterpiece! Ahh!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie ever made? What an understatement!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As several reviewers have correctly observed with regards to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, just so much has been written, debated, interpreted and allegorised over the decades, not too much remains in terms of a "new slant" on the issue of this 149 minute brain-blender. It can only be ascribed the title "Best film ever made," if one is to consider the other 50-60,000 films actual contenders, and with the possible exception of LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, GOODBYE MR CHIPS (The original, obviously), THE INNOCENTS (1962), MIDNIGHT COWBOY, CASABLANCA, CITIZEN KANE, PATTON, THE SHOOTIST, HEAT, BEN HUR, THE GODFATHER and maybe half a dozen more which I will diplomatically avoid nominating...they aren't!To call 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY a great film is to insult it. At the risk of incurring social isolation (and I can so live with that!)I doubt more than 5% of the world's population can even grasp at the staggering concepts up there on the screen. To plagiarize the words of Jesus himself, my inclination is to "forgive them, for they know not what they see!" I have read reviews and comments, that individuals have found the film a "boring" experience, I have news for them.....it wasn't made for you! Many years ago I had the privilege to be standing at the base of the Great Pyramid at Giza looking up at what is inarguably the greatest monumental artifact left to us on this planet. To my right, a group of English tourists strolled over. "Just a heap of rock and stone ain't it mate?" said one lowbrow to his cro-magnan associate. Angered to the point of being able to commit what I would have termed justifiable homicide, I stood there, tears of utter rage running down my cheeks. Now, having learned a degree of both acceptance and tolerance, I am better equipped to handle such affrontery. So it must be with this film! There is not one micro-second of this movie that is either boring or without constructive purpose IF you have the ability to receive the transmission! From the fidgeting and furtive glances of the ape family at night, to Poole's dissociated and emotionless reaction to his parents wishing him a happy birthday by video-link, all is as it should be. Ironic that the character seemingly the most imbued with humanity and interest in his environment is HAL himself (How many viewers have yet to establish even HAL's link with IBM?)You will note that I have studiously avoided here re-hashing the storyline of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. If you do not yet know it, I rather doubt you would be reading this. It is, as some enlightened people have observed, anything BUT a space-tripping epic. It is about our origins, our purpose, our future.....why else do you suppose the craft was called "Discovery?"Technologically the film is so unutterably brilliant it cannot be underestimated. There is not the slightest trace of matte-work or fudging of models here. No film before or since has come close to matching these Fx. Digitising is a total joke besides this. We share Heywood Floyd's weightlessness in the shuttle, marvel at the interiors of the space station (outstandingly scripted little sequence here) and listen to the sounds of silence as the moon bus speeds its way to Clavius and its covert destiny for mankind.The Jupiter craft "Discovery" itself is without equal in visual history. Does anyone want to tell me that the viewer is NOT in space during this long sequence? Is there the slightest ripple of unreality as Dave exits the pod-bay doors? (So much greater an experience in the original 'Cinerama' format admittedly). Even Bowman's pursuit and retrieval of Poole's body is total realism, even down to the crumpling of his limbs as he is finally cradled within the pod's arms.The conclusion of the film for some, is a devastating emotional wake-up call, something most will never again experience in their lifetime. It is a glimpse of the unglimpsable, a gentle assurance that its not all for nothing, that some indefinable force IS at work directing, nudging, watching!If you all only KNEW what the Monolith really is?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I hadn't already seen Eyes Wide Shut, I would be calling this the worst movie I've ever seen. Because I have seen EWS though, the best I can do is say that this is nearly as bad. The acting is fine and the score is excellent, but the story is underwhelming and the movie as a whole is excruciatingly slow.Even the score, which, on it's own, is impressive and iconic, seems forced and dragged out when put up against many scenes.Great for an insomnia patient though, I'm sure, and if you were high, you'd probably enjoy the last 20 minutes, but I nearly quit before the space scenes even started. In hindsight, I wish I had.I will never watch another Kubrick film again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>irritating noise &amp; psychedelic lights... no movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You should listen to the reviewers who hated this movie. They are telling you the truth. 90% of this movie is nothing but irritating noises and flashing colors of lights. Perfect if you are planning on doing LSD while watching the movie. Nothing but an irritant to the rest of us. This is by far, the most boring, waste of time movie ever made.The ape-men sequences at the beginning are utterly ridiculous and seemingly endless stupidity as you sit there and listen to the screaming costumed ape-men jumping around, screaming, fighting and beating up on a pile of bones as they "discover" the bones can be used as tools to beat another tribe of ape-men to death. (These are actually more ape than anything else.) It seemed like this portion of the film would never end. I'm amazed that half the theater didn't walk out by the time they finally ended this absurd beginning. Reminds me of the movie 10,000 BC.The few scenes with people in this movie are so slow paced it is almost painful to suffer through. The symphonic accompaniment was better than the long periods of painful noise... and I do mean noise "literally" which did not help the agonizingly slow-paced movements of the actors in the scenes... the majority of which had no dialog at all. Nearly the entire movie was nothing but noise and flashing lights with a few special effects of drawn out spacecraft scenes. (The NASA channel is better than this? and they move a lot faster IRL).The only decent portion of the entire movie was the Hal9000 about midpoint. The actors were terrible, but the computer ran off with all the scenes. Again... it was long, drawn out, boring. The entire movie was like it was in slow motion. The long periods of loud "heavy breathing" weren't any better than the piercing noises. We were grateful when they killed off the character... just to make the noise stop.The ending was a joke... and from what I've heard from those who read the book... the movie did not portray the fact that it was an alien lab. If it had... that might have injected some interest to it.They should have made the movie just based on the HAL9000 computer and cut out all the rest of it... because it was truly unwatchable otherwise.As an engineer, scientist &amp; sci-fi buff who saw this movie when it first came out and again recently, to give it a second chance... this is one of the worst movies ever made. I still cannot believe the studio actually OK'ed this movie for production. This is not a case of "not understanding" the movie or the message. We got it. It is a case of a terrible director who had to be on an acid trip to make this boring, waste of time movie. Either that or he was creating the movie to "appeal" to the acid dropping hippie audiences of the 60's.Those who claim what a great movie this is... remind me of those neophytes who look at a smashed tomato soup can in an art museum and acclaim it to be a "work of art." Homer Simpson has some "art" to sell to people like that. The rest of us call them "pretenders" who put on airs claiming to visualize something that isn't really there... and this is exactly what this movie is... a lot of irritating noise, psychedelic lights flashing and painfully slow scenes with nearly zero dialog except for the Hal9000 portion.There was one other movie, which was boringly and painfully slow... it was called "Marooned" and starred Gregory Peck... but at least it had a story. You won't get a story from 2001 other than the subliminal message for which you have to read the book because they don't make it clear in the movie other than the implication that the monoliths from an alien race have something to do with intelligent life on earth.I'm willing to bet these "Art lovers" are the same ones who contradictorily complained about the 17 minutes of special effects as the ship passed over the length of V'ger in the first Star Trek movie? as being too long. Watching 2001 is like listening to the entire 19 minutes of Inagodadavida (ten times in a row).If you like having your brain pounded with irritating noise and psychedelic lights with no story and very little dialog then this movie is for you. Otherwise, it is a waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Biggest Fast Forward</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What the meaning of the black monolith is in 2001: A Space Odyssey has been puzzling moviegoers for generations. I confess I haven't any better idea than any of the others who have written on this board. I guess Stanley Kubrick and Arthur Clarke wanted everyone to make their own evaluation. A little more evidence could have helped.The awesome visual affects of 2001 for which the film won its only Oscar in 1968 have blinded a lot of viewers to the ultimate incomprehensibility of the plot. That big black rock means something a whole lot different to the prehistoric caveman than to the futuristic astronauts. To one it means power, the other understanding. It's like some all powerful creator has left this touchstone for mankind to take another leap forward.The film begins with the cave people who are struggling to survive against animal creatures who are better equipped than they are for dominance. But contact with the rock, so glaringly out of place from the surroundings awakens the latent intelligence in the cave folk and they stage a comeback against their foes. It's the beginning of man's dominance.In the biggest fast forward in screen history, we are now in the future and another of these things has been discovered on a moon of Jupiter, the first sign of intelligent life away from earth. Scientists Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood and three other scientists in cryogenic suspension are sent to investigate. Remember we haven't discovered warp drive yet. Civilization may have taken too far a leap forward because these guys are in the hands of an all powerful computer named HAL who controls the ship and their very lives by definition. What's supposed to be a tool for man now is his dominator.When man does come in contact with that monolith on a Jupiter moon, my own interpretation is that the contact represents an all powerful creator telling man to reflect on what he has achieved and to warn him to not go too fast forward in the future. The monoliths represent signposts, like checkpoints in a race to God only knows what end.I'm always leery of rating a film like 2001 too high when the plot is so vague and speculative. But the special effects and Kubrick's use of classical music to create that space ballet just so dwarf the human beings involved, in effect the film itself is a warning. And all that music was in the public domain so MGM didn't have to lay out big bucks for a composer. I always favor story over spectacle which is why I can never give 2001: A Space Odyssey the highest rating. But when the spectacle is as awesome as what Stanley Kubrick gives us, you just sit there amazed.Of course 2001 came and went and instead of reaching for the rest of the solar system and beyond, mankind regressed into barbarism with the most notable event being a planned massed murder. Mankind needs to touch the monolith and make another leap forward. Maybe Kubrick should have looked farther ahead and called his film, 2101: A Space Odyssey.I hope we touch the monolith before that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my first comment on any movie ever , i never portrayed my self as a writer, but i had to take out the frustration of watching such an over hyped piece of "Art"(yup I've heard they call such movies art)and to make every possible effort to stop people like me(sci-fi lovers)from watching this crap. so i decided to share my experience with youif u are thinking of watching this movie I'll suggest you watch in 2x or a faster mode. the movie is so boring,its like watching a 30 min documentary about the working of spacecrafts in super slow motion. over 95% of the total run time of movie is without any dialogues . the scenes of space ships crossing other planets were extended to the limits. i didn't understand what the first 30 minutes of the movie were about. the background score is loud,irritating , unnecessary some times, but repetitive throughout. and for some music lovers they added 3 minutes of those irritating sounds without any images in the beginning of the movie as well as after the intermission,DVD i rented had an intermission too(the most interesting part).A tiny thing this movie lacks is the "PLOT" after 1 hr and 10 min of the movie when hall tells Dave about the malfunction i prayed that the ship would crash and the movie will end but it didn't (my bad luck perhaps there was more of it for me to watch) the only interesting sequence was when Dave tries to get back into the spaceship and hall dies,in fact this was the only part of the movie i understood. i hoped the movie would now pace up, but that was not what the film makers had in mind. if the movie wasn't boring enough,the worst was still to come that's "beyond the infinite" i couldn't sum up a thing that happens after Dave enters the monolith a series of diff colored scenes then suddenly he's in a room watching himself getting old and then he's turned into some sort of cosmic baby(what was the ending all about?)the only reason i watched this is because I'm trying to watch the top 250. and this is the only one i regret watching. the one thing that's nice about this movie are the clean camera tricks used to create the anti gravity environment even in the 60's, nothing else that's why I'll give it a generous 2/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie you needn't bother yourself with watching.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"2001: A Space Odyssey", a movie heralded to be one of the greatest Science Fiction films of all time, if not the greatest.In actuality, "2001" is little more than a special effects bonanza with a great musical score.The movie is about...uhh.... It's about some monolith thing that lands on Earth at the dawn of mankind. And...I'm not sure what it has to do with anything. The movie eventually skips to the time of space travel, and some other strange things happen.That, right there, is the movie's biggest fault. Many fans of the movie like how ambiguous the film is, for it gives very little insight into what is happening throughout it. Now, a movie that is a bit mysterious and sometimes allows the viewer to come up with their own interpretation of what's happening is okay, but this film tells you almost nothing. You are almost completely left in the dark about everything that happens during the course of the film. I'm sorry, but, I LIKE TO HAVE AN INKLING OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN A MOVIE. If the movie expects me to come up with everything that's happening, then, why am I watching this film? I could just lay on my bed and imagine my own sci-fi adventure while playing some classical music in the background, instead, and save myself some money.There are some good points to this film. For one thing, the visual effects are fantastic (they won the movie an Academy Award, from what I've heard), and still hold up great today. The ships are intricately detailed, both inside and out. Zero-Gravity effects were also pulled off remarkably well. The special effects are a little over-the-top, sometimes, and can last for a painfully long amount of time (imagine this: A segment of the film consists of little more than an array of colors that come toward the screen in an assortment of patterns. This lasts for somewhere in the neighborhood of 5-10 minutes). Overall, the film looks great, and, since they didn't have all those fancy CG effects back in those days, you are sometimes left wondering, "How'd they do that?" Even the guys in the ape suits are convincing.The musical score is also very good. Enjoyable, inspiring, memorable.... You've probably heard some of these songs on TV shows and commercials many times.The characters and acting are forgettable (except, of course, when the HAL 9000 computer is concerned. Isn't it ironic? There's many human characters in this film, and the computer is the only one that really manages to instill any emotion in the viewer). They, mostly, play second fiddle to the visual effects.So, all in all, if this movie had more interesting characters in it, and something that resembled a plot, I could've truly enjoyed it. As it is, all I got from the film was a greater appreciation of the musical piece "Blue Danube".But...who knows? Perhaps, this film is just too high-brow for me, and my feeble mind was unable to truly grasp the greatness of this movie (although a friend of mine who watched it with me, who happens to be far more intelligent than I, didn't understand any of it either).MEGAMUR's Final Opinion: Many people consider this film to be a "Thinking Man's Movie". Honestly, I think it's quite the opposite. If you don't think at all during the course of the movie, and just look at the pretty pictures and listen to the nice music, and not expect anything from the plot or characters, you'll be a-okay. Otherwise, use your brain, and watch something else.That's my two cents.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Strangely enough, I saw this film again the day after I first saw Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. One of the films is clearly superior, with outstanding direction, sound, visuals, music, plot, scripting, design and execution. And it's obviously The Phantom Menace, isn't it?Seriously, though, 2001 is a real slap in the face for George Lucas, a film that has all it's effects constantly on show, but never to the effect that they seem ostentatious. Lucas, on the other hand, uses Phantom Menace to throw everything he's got at the camera, a mind-numbing tedium of sfx, rather like a six-year-old throwing a tantrum at jelly and ice-cream party.2001 in comparison is elegant and sophisticated, taking it's time, showing it's effects in all their glory to an exquisite classical symphony. Beneath the visuals, which are absolutely stunning for 1968, produced on a tenth of Phantom Menace's cartoon budget, is an intricate plot. Rather surprisingly, Kubrick creates a wholly believable space backdrop, yet the men in monkey suits at the prologue look exactly like... men in monkey suits. Yet this exists as a perfect introduction, just as the psychedelia acts as a perfect coda. In the middle is the most successful element, Hal, a voice that can conjure both stolid calm and malevolence in the same monotone.2001 is probably the most important science fiction film, taking the genre into the realms of art. And while I must apologise for reviewing The Phantom Menace almost as much as the film in question, this does serve as a very important film-watching guide: watching a terrible film before a good one enhances appreciation of the better work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So we all know that the 1960's were famous for drugs, and if you remember Mick Jagger you should have some more, but what the hell is this movie all about? There's a big rock, some sort of space mission, a computer with a really annoying voice, nice like dance scene with the planets colliding, some animal throwing a bone in the air and thats really about it. No story, no theme, no plot and just no good.2001 is perhaps the ultimate geeks' movie. Critics were right, Kuberick was ahead of his time with this one. It's only now that millions of sad sci-fi fans can sit and discuss the deep meanings behind the film. At last they can hold their greasy haired heads up high, by pretending they've got a clue what this was all about.2001 is the film that always gets you. You've heard about it, people say it's great; remember these people are either geeks or liars, and you spend your hard earned money to see yet another re-release. Trust me, it's really not worth it. The Simpsons covered most of the memorable scenes and of course did them much better.A perfect con trick by Kubrick, who was after all the master of illusion. Come on really, he nearly made us believe that Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman were in love in Eyes Wide Shut. Catch the right moment, when the world is stoned and Hey presto! HUge Hit! Many people going back again and again because they don't remember it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterpiece-of-crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey, was without a doubt, the lamest, most boring, most unentertaining, poor excuse for a film, waste of time, I've ever seen! Whenever there was any form of live action, there was absolute silence. Whenever there was nothing to see but black, it was accompanied by the most horrible set of minor and dimished chords you could imagine. It was a waste of 2 and a half hours. I constantly kept repeating, "THE END" hoping that the film would heed my request. I don't see how it can be called a masterpiece. It was nothing but a series of segways from one scene to the next, with each segway getting longer and each scene getting shorter. The most excruciating scene had to be when the ship was entering Jupiter's orbit. A 15 minute sequence with simple images slowly flashing on the screen after being run through a filter. The music sounded as if a three year old had been sat behind a piano and been allowed to bang on the keys. Coming in at a close second, was the first 20 minutes in which nothing happened except two clans of monkeys fought, after it took one of them 19 minutes to realize that a bone could be used as a beating device. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!THE WORST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing "2001" in the early 1980's and honestly, I did not get it. I recently rented it and honestly, I still don't get it. While certainly a cut above other science fiction films of the day from a visual standpoint, the story is drawn out over two-and-a-half interminable hours.I've heard it described as "intelligent science fiction." I've also heard "Star Trek" described thusly. But somewhere along the line Stanley Kubrick, unlike Gene Roddenberry and the "Trek" writers, forgot about the entertainment factor.I gave it a score of three for the stunning graphics. Unfortunately, that's really all "2001" has to offer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as captivating as it once was.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It must have been at least ten or fifteen years since I last saw '2001: a space odyssey', and must say I'm somewhat disappointed this time around. Even though, apparently, the meaning of the film has been discussed endlessly, the story is not all that complicated. Apes are confronted with a perfect object which shoot their development into the human kind. Stanley Kubrick assumes we all know what happened next and moves on, off into space. There, the same perfect object stuns mankind again. Then, finally man (in the form of an astronaut who is on a mission to investigate another case concerning the perfect object) is confronted with the object again, this time in a setting that seems to cut through time and space itself. And then you can still debate a lot of what's been going on, of course... does the object stand for death? Or the limitations of human kind? Or is there a significant circular motion present here? Etc..The first part of the film I found to be rather cheap and silly; actors in monkey suits, a desert with some okapis, two rival ape gangs, and then, suddenly, that object, and... bloody murder, and mankind is born! Apart from what Kubrick is trying to say (honestly, I'm not sure, but Darwin and - or versus - religion múst have something to do with it), it wasn't all that impressive to me.The next parts are much better, since the visual virtuosity is at times stunning and the space stations and such look terrific (ranging from 'two steering wheels put together' to a 'robotized spermatozoon', but still). The part with HAL is my favorite (check the swan song), things become pretty eerie and claustrophobic there. Also, the part where Dave 'finds himself finding himself and so on', in rooms that are a mix of very old and futuristic features, is just perfect. One more highlight: when Dave is exercising in his 'treadmill in outer space'.In all parts, I'm not always happy with the use of classical music, at times it is just to pompous. But, at other times, it works just perfectly, although I find it very hard nót to think about Homer's Osydssey with that one particular theme - Homer Simpson, that is.I remember my first viewing(s) being (utterly) captivating, but this time around it wasn't always so, especially in the first part. Still, plenty to enjoy and ponder about. The bits with the futuristic foods was quite funny at times, even though gen-tech food is a serious issue - even more so today (Monsanto)!A small 8 out of 10.P.s.: The Soviet-Union 'counterpart' movie 'Solyaris' (1972) - I never saw it before about a year ago - has much more emotional appeal on me, as opposed to '2001: a...' being more scientific and aloof.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece is an understatement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001 A Space Odyssey is a enigmatic and captivating journey into space, as Stanley Kubrick blasts his audience with the full force of his meticulous genius. 2001 is an abstract movie, with various segments (Covering the dawn of man to the far future) linked only by a mysterious black monolith. This is a pretentious film admittedly, and some will find it dull. That's absolutely fine. This is a classic, but one not everyone will enjoy. With its long running time, lack of narrative coherence and dialogue and refusal to give answers, why is 2001 regarded as one of the best films ever made? Because it is one of the best displays of the power of the cinematic medium ever created and it is an extremely deep movie, with a multitude of interpretations and explanations. It's a cinematic master at the absolute peak of his power; with unforgettable, hypnotic, almost hallucinatory imagery which takes us into straight into the abyss, combined with hauntingly powerful themes which question mankind's place in the universe and effective sound, this is what cinema was made for.2001 is rarely dull, and its slowness and emotional distance make it even more fascinating. As a visual experience there are quite possibly no parallels whatsoever, but there are some strangely moving scenes in the film as well, and the entire sequence featuring the legendary HAL 9000 is suspenseful and gripping. The part with the apes is less interesting, but it does end with the best transition ever: The amazing match cut where a bone turns into a spaceship. 2001 is a difficult film to describe and the extent of its power, both emotional and sensory, is difficult to explain. It is simply one of the most entrancing- and maddeningly cryptic- movies ever made and since there are so many interpretations, the film carries on even after it finishes. Some may prefer more action packed and less elusive science fiction films, and it could easily take a couple of viewings to fully get 2001. However obscure and mysterious it is, or however pretentious, the truth cannot be avoided: 2001 is a masterpiece and one of the best cinematic experiences in the history of the medium.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Daunting Imagery And Sounds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, one of Kubrick's greatest, is in every sense of the word epic. Before anything else let me say the cinematography was amazing with every frame. As most know, this movie revolutionized space travel in film, the dawn of amazingly detailed miniatures and sets that set the standard for science fiction films to this day. The shots are not brief and to some drawn out. However, it was done for the main purpose of admiring the beauty and wonder of technology, specifically the advent of exploratory astronomy. It's a very intriguing concept and one Kubrick handles without giving into the clichéd tendencies of fast-paced sci-fi/action flicks of today. Especially ones such as myself that love the genre and when watching such films sometimes wish fascinated audience members could gawk at an enormous space craft only a moment longer.Along with that, the beauty and dazzle the future promises, there's a dark underlying theme of the threat of technological advancement. You can see it from the start with the apes and the striking power that simple primitive tool brings. HAL only compounds this. The film in itself is rather abstract in a sense that it takes quite a bit of analyzing to grasp any sense of it. My understanding of it is that of a Nietzsche allegory, more specifically the concept of Apollonian and Dionysian in society. In the film, we see society as it began, with the apes as a mostly Dionysian society filled with chaos and a animal-like sense of simplicity. It's the origin point of man, which to me has always been a point of Kubrick's films. To display to audiences that despite mankind's advancements man is still just another animal with the same savage instincts as the beasts, just cluttered and disguised by morality which is still just a concept dreamed up by philosophers. Calling it nihilist or not, so be it, it is a simple embrace of logic. Mankind strives ever so hard to achieve the Apollonian society, one of pure enlightenment and rational thought fueled by advancement in science. In the world set up by Kubrick, mankind has achieved this state of being and have become chillingly machine-like. The vast mystery of space is something that is not marveled at as we see a character sleeping in a bored fashion as he rides on a space shuttle and later another character sees a happy birthday wish from his family and has an almost stoic reaction. It's implied that neither have seen an actual human being in the flesh for quite a bit of time and yet their focus is entirely on their mission.HAL is the threat of a purely Apollonian society manifested. He suffers the human tendency to make an error though, and this is perhaps due to the fact that his flawless logic has become faltered by facets of human emotion: fear and paranoia. Dave achieves something in the end, to me a simple form of life that is in essence pure and possibly neither Apollonian or Dionysian, via the monolith. There's quite a bit of room for interpretation in this grand and certainly strange movie. It's use of music is seldom but beautiful and chilling to hear. The moments of silence seem to have even more profound reaction. A must see by all means.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie, is by no means bad it is revolutionary for its time and has one of the best endings in history, one that even when you find out exactly what it means, you still wonder just what the director was trying to say. The ending stays with you for days, weeks, you can't stop thinking about it.the other thing you can't stop thinking about is how long this friggen movie is. After what feels like yo reached the three and a half hour mark, u look and and see that it is only a two hour movie, and you are only an hour into the movie that is a sad, sinking feeling my friends.the beginning is very interesting, and the ending is fantastic the middle is what i have problems with. at first the main focus was about the black monoliths, for about 40 minutes, thats all its showed or talked about then dave come along and all that changes. Now its up to dave to stop his spazzed out computer friends HAL.Now looking back, HAL had actually no reason to be in the film except for letting the audience know why dave is the sole survivor of that ship.To top it off, the whole time, there is barley any music, just dave talking to monotone HAL, and boring as hell SOUNDLESS SHOTS THAT LAST MINUTES in space, i know there is no sound in space, but can't you add music to it like you did in the beginning of the movie? despite this, the HAL moments were actually entertaining, it just was a little boring at times.This is the only reason why i did not give it a perfect score, it has this huge epic feel to it, yet the only thing that is epic about it was the beginning and the very end, the middle, well is just dull, and the only reason one maintains interest in the movie is for kubricks awe inspiring shots Some movie has about 3 good money shots, 2001 is RIDDLED WITH THEM, one cant watch 2 minutes without an incredible shot! overall, a good movie, weird but good ending, incredible shots, but the middle lags ebough to be nit pick about</fullReview>

		<fullReview>that's my favorite line in this movie, because it's such a joke.Nobody in hell would get a cultural shock or disorientation when our good guys discovered a silly monolith on the moon, or in space.The real reason for such measures, and the overuse of "national security, can't talk about it" is of course the maniacal lust for power and domination over other groups of people.The narrow mind of the serfs is protecting itself from such shocks anyway by simply denying anything it doesn't want to deal with. The best current example is of course the official 9/11 fairytale story by our traitors in government who killed over 3000 people on this day which, will live in infamy - at least in the mind of people who dared to examine all the facts.Cubrick made a masterpiece, the votes say so, and I need to bow down before him for that.Just one thing: the classical music was great, but the other one - the psychedelic stuff - I had to turn down the volume on my stereo every time because it was terribly annoying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey Number 1 - 1968Number 1 - 1960sTop 10 - All Time "It is possible that I just have seen the greatest motion picture of all time"Stanley Kubrick's recreation of Arthur C. Clarke's science fiction novel is a cinematic spectacle.Kubrick's creation of an atmospheric and mind-blowing film is something to be celebrated. '2001' is simple and purely cinematic craft; distinct imagination and beautiful artistry along with groundbreaking visual effects make this film one of a kind.The direction as always is faultless; Kubrick's pursuit for perfectionism shines through his camera work that dazzles the viewer with beautiful images.The music is terrific; the noticeable use of classical music which evokes different moods, whether awe, disillusionment, fear or panic. The music is frequently used as a narrative, a tool not used in the film industry very often; Kubrick limits the dialogue but maximises the importance of the sounds you hear.2001 moves at a steady pace and makes us ask eternal questions. While, 2001, as a film critic put it 'fails on the human level', it does communicate through the medium of images, sounds, music, colour and yes Kubrick's perfectionist camera work.This is a vivacious, exciting, confusing, multilateral film; it has everything. You could argue that it is a boring, dull sci-fi movie, but for me it was a visual and sceptical treat. I wasn't sure at times what exactly was happening, but I didn't care. I never witnessed such creativity and mad risky film-making along the sci-fi line. This film is an iconic masterpiece.Instantenously I place this film among my top 10 and I truly believe it is one of the best films ever to be made and probably Kubrick's finest achievement (in many respects definitely). Hypnotic, alluring, indefinably masterful, this is a milestone in cinema. An astonishing achievement.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film lacking in stimulation, but nevertheless groundbreaking for SF and cinema in general.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey is a difficult film to review due to the fact that (even now) it's an unconventional piece of cinema.The script, written by Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke, features little to no dialog (all of which is superfluous) and provides virtually no exposition for the audience. And while the companion novel by Arthur C. Clarke provides more depth and stimulation into the story, the film itself suffers from lacking these things on its own.The acting is standard fare, if only because the focus of the story is on the odyssey rather than the characters. Douglas Rain stands out as providing the voice of HAL 9000, a chilling supercomputer supervising the progress of the mission.Where the film gets most of its acclaim is in the visuals, and deservedly so. From the monolith to the starport to the transformation into starchild, the film is stunning. And it is for this reason that masterpieces such as the Star Wars saga and Blade Runner have come to existence. Coincidentally, Douglas Trumbull provided his special effects talent to all three of these films.The biggest complaint given to 2001: A Space Odyssey is its lethargic pace. Again, this is deservedly so. But to Stanley Kubrick's credit, it was his intent to make the audience truly *use* their senses to appreciate the film. Not on a superficial level, but to truly invest one's self in the film's atmosphere.In the end, it's perhaps best to classify 2001 in a league of its own. That is, a film that experiments with the laws of cinema and its relationship to the audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was born in 1968, the year that saw the original release of 2001: A Space Odyssey; of course, I didn't really get into sci-fi cinema until almost a decade later, when that other movie?you know, the one with the droids, blasters and aliens?broke box-office records. Now aged 47, and fully prepared (or so I thought) for a more cerebrally challenging experience than George Lucas's space opera, I've finally caught up with Kubrick's celebrated sci-fi 'masterpiece'. And I haven't been so bored in a long time.It's not that I need bucket-loads of action and excitement to enjoy a sci-fi movie?I have deep affection for leisurely '70s genre efforts such as Silent Running and Dark Star (both of which clearly owe a debt to 2001)?but Kubrick's film takes pomposity and tedium to a new level. Perhaps if I was stoned, as I imagine many of the film's original fans were when they first saw it, and watching on a cinema screen instead of a TV, I might have been a little more impressed: the visuals are undeniably awe inspiring, the music is grandiose, the psychedelic finale is a trip, and there is much symbolism and narrative ambiguity for intellectuals to chew over, but at two hours and twenty minutes, with very little dialogue and a tortuously slow pace, I struggled to stay awake.In short: give me a lightsaber battle any day of the week.4/10, mostly for the surprisingly effective ape-man suits and the highly detailed spacecraft model effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So so</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Time has not allowed this film to remain relevant in my opinion. It was good in its day when space travel was new, the world was running fast-forward to conquer space, and our imaginations were running wild with a million "unknowns" about the reality of space travel, but now? It is most certainly antiquated in its approach and realism. In fact I am watching this movie right now on Encore. My first impression is the gap between the 60s style of clothing and the technology being used in space travel. This makes no sense. It is like mixing the Flintstones cartoon and having them taking a trip into space. Another point in which I actually tested is this; I would like to watch a version of this movie without the symphonic music. I find it outdated and useless and I would rather hear some effects and background noise in place of it, or for the space travel shots, no sound at all. Another point which bothers me and that is the use of modern-day 1960s business logo's such as Pan American and Ma Bell. Also, if anyone remembers the old Hollywood-type machoism that permeated their movies back then, you'll know what I am talking about. In both scenes in which one character is talking to his daughter and in another scene in which Lockwood's character is receiving a "happy birthday" call from his parents, the words "I love you" never were spoken. This is incredibly short-sighted and would never happen in real life but as I said, this was the Hollywood of real-men back then and it would most certainly not be eliminated in today's scripts. The best actor in my opinion is Gary Lockwood but the director could have used him much more and his skills were not utilized. If it weren't for him this movie would have failed. It's an OK movie but I think "2010" is a much better movie and more true-to-life and the acting is much better. I would like to see "2061" come out some day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really didn't get this movie &amp; not just the ending where the guy is in that room but the entire movie. Honestly i expected a lot more from Stanley Kubrick after i saw the shinning(1980) which was the 2nd greatest horror movie i ever saw 1st of course being scream(1996) &amp; all I got was a plotness mess of scenery &amp; for some reason, very bad special effects as it did look quite fake. It seemed like different things were just happening without purpose like the 1st scene that was set very early in the B.C.s. Why is this movie so popular? Should I watch it again? I know that lots of people were confused by the ending but I was confused by the entire plot.This i reckon is Stanley Kubricks worst film ever &amp; I definitely would encourage you not to watch it.And now the ending. After the credits were rolling i just went OMFG WHAT JUST HAPPENED!!! The guy found the thing floating in space &amp; then there was a burst of colour &amp; then he was in that room when he slowly aged &amp; after he died he basically turned into something called the star child &amp; if you're gonna tell me to read the book to find out what the ending means then obviously the movie hasn't explained it meaning it is not a good film! I hate it how some people who originally hated this film liked it after reading this book.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since this film is partly about the idea of how technology can gain control of us if we aren't careful, expect it to be grim. However, being that there is so much to absorb, the lesson seems less heavy handed than you'd expect. When you watch this film, leave your expectations at the door. This isn't the sort of film that you can expect anything from except pure imagination and wonder. This film not only shows us the accomplishments, the troubles, the dilemmas, and the wondrous beauty of man, but also gives you an experience unlike any other. The film is mostly without much talking, which actually helps the audience absorb what is going on. This film also provides some true horror as the results of letting technology get ahead of us destroys the future of human kind. Just see it. It's wondrous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful...but nearly totally vapid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My father picked up the DVD, thinking this would be a good science fiction movie. I didn't look at the IMDb reviews before watching the movie, and I knew next to nothing about it - I thought it would be a good way to spend a couple of hours. Well, it turned out to be less than a couple of hours, since my father and I fast forwarded our way like crazy through the film.Not that we missed much, though. If your idea of a movie is a visual depiction of a story, this is not a movie. It's an interesting and pretty slideshow with a compelling (but in the end disappointing) story thrown in. Much of the film consists of a completely black screen, and dialogue-free scenes which do little to advance the plot, and in more than a few instances, serve no real purpose.Now, that is not to say I can't and/or don't appreciate the beauty of this movie. I'm a fan of classical music, and if I'd been in the mood to just sit and contemplate, I probably would not have fast forwarded through many of the beautiful (but utterly pointless, and mostly meaningless) scenes. Other people who dislike this film cite things like the opening scene of Earth from space and HAL's rendition of "Daisy" as irritating, but I found them haunting and truly beautiful.Alas, 15 minutes of haunting beauty is not enough to salvage the rest of this sad piece of "art". Many establishing scenes in the African savanna serve no real purpose - they do not provide any of that vaunted "detail" which lovers of this movie harp on. Kubrick hits us on the head with a sledgehammer several times, apparently thinking we need to have the point (whatever it may be) of a particular scene driven home.Although much of the detail given to futurism serves no purpose at all plot-wise, it does not detract from the movie (thankfully). The film would be nearly completely the same if we did not know what sandwich Floyd had, or the scene of him at the lunar briefing had been cut, but the little details in these scenes of how the future was thought to look like helps to spice up an otherwise rather boring movie.People have criticised the acting of the protagonist, Bowman, but I thought he did a rather decent job, considering the shabby plot he was handed. It may be true that the film would not change very much if he had been played by a house plant, but that is not the fault of the actor - it is the fault of the directionless movie makers.There may or may not be a philosophical bent to this film. I don't know - if there was one, I didn't see it. But if the only people whose lives and thoughts have been altered by this movie are the contemplative, philosophical type, I don't see why it is such an important film. Surely what would make a thinking movie great is the ability to make even the average Joe contemplate his place in the universe - and this is a talent that 2001: A Space Odyssey clearly lacks, given the response of casual viewers.I am a bit ambivalent about whether to recommend this movie or not. I am very confident that those with an intellectual bent, given the right (i.e. contemplative) mood will be able to get something out of this movie. The important thing is not to expect a traditional movie, i.e. that with a storyline. This movie is more like a therapeutic slideshow for those intent on meditation, rather than a medium for communicating a particular story.Ultimately, my verdict is to avoid this movie, unless you ever really feel like just sitting down and philosophising, in which case, you'll truly get the best bang for your buck. But otherwise, just don't bother. The few scenes of beauty and the peripheral plot won't keep you focused, and ultimately it'll be a self-defeating exercise.As for me, I don't think I'll ever be watching this again.</fullReview>

This movie has wonderful visual effects you just have to compare this effects with Star Wars(George Lucas - 1977) and see the big difference between this movie and Star Wars.(This is movie is 10 ten years older than Star Wars!!!) Of course i know that Star Wars is just a popular movie.(It ranked 7th in the funny IMDb top 250!!!) It has a great philosophical message about life and about domination of computer on human.(Great Kubrick...he understood this 40 years ago.) You just think that the movie has great visual effects+great classic music+great philosophical message = Perfect 10/10!!!</fullReview>

If you were to ask any of these people who think 2.5 hours of slow camera movement following spaceships and guys in spacesuits very very very slowly is some kind of art, they wouldn't be able to specifically explain what's so great about it. "Duh..I don't know..Everyone else likes it."Granted, there is brilliance embedded deep within this crushing boredom. The scene where the ape discovers violence is astonishing, HAL sends chills down your spine, and the ending is hypnotic and enigmatic. But that's like 20 minutes out of 150.

		<fullReview>This movie pis**sed me so much off, that I registered here just to write this review. I really can't understand why it's so praised. Story of this movie is terribly simple: machines and computers can go bananas and stop working properly. Then they will try to kill you. DUH! I think I saw better story on MTV in 5 minutes. But this story is stretched to two and half hours-long film. From film about one and half hour there is absolutely nothing happening. You are just looking on some ships, light or stars. Boooooring. BOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRR RRRRIIIIIIIIINNNGGGGGGGGGG GGG. I think you are getting how long it is. Too much. Even if it would be half of time it would still be too much. In rest of film, there is either black screen (W*T*F), slow-paced drama with no point at all. At least some views are quite nice and for that time, some effects must have been hell to do. But still it can't make up for no story of film. Last 30 minutes is just pure sh*t, director probably had to make movie long so he just put some shi*ty colours and psychedelic pictures together. I've seen Hobbit yesterday and I must tell, that even that sh*it was better than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Complete Waste of Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films that a lot of people claim to like. So I was incredibly surprised how terrible it was, especially since I usually enjoy Kubrick films.The film begins with a 15 minute intro sequence picturing apes at the "dawn of man." It lasts only 15 minutes, but feels like an hour. For plot, the apes are visited by a large black monolith which appears one morning amidst their tribe and somehow sparks evolutionary developments in the monkeys. This is followed and preceded by meaningless time-killing ape scenes.Skip ahead to the year 2001, where another large black monolith has appeared on the moon. (IIRC, this film was originally a short story entitled "The Sentinel", so I suppose the monolith was meant to mark humankind's progress.) The black stone sends a signal out into space, so a mission to investigate Jupiter (presumably the destination of the signal) is launched.The third part of the film then begins, as the astronauts depart for Jupiter. This is the part of the film familiar to those of us who hadn't seen it, featuring the supercomputer HAL and his descent into evil. This is really the only redeeming part of the film, it's too bad the rest of the film wasn't like this. The scene where the astronauts are discussing the disassembly of HAL in supposed privacy, and we then see HAL reading their lips, is very eerie and quite chilling.Unfortunately, the film goes totally off the wall when the mission arrives at its target. A strange and seemingly pointless barrage of flashing streams of color start flying across the screen, broken only occasionally by the remaining astronaut's frightened face. After about 10 minutes (I'm not kidding, it's that long) we see the astronaut in some strange place, which the film implies is somehow outside of time, where he ages and dies over a few minutes. Then, cue the space baby...roll credits.Considering that a lot of people on this site can't even understand the very simple ending of the new Planet of the Apes movie, I can't understand why this film managed to get such good marks. Even the people I know who claim to like this film always seem to dodge the question when I ask them to explain this movie. The few good points are: the apes' first post-monolith change is discovering the use of weapons (a relevant commentary on humanity), and the soundless nature of space (nothing bothers me more than hearing explosions in the vacuum of space.) Other than a few good moments, this film is entirely rubbish. Please DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM, YOU WILL REGRET IT!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this "classic" movie for a film review for my film class, and I must say that I regret doing so. Had I known I'd spend two hours watching people float around in complete silence, I may have reconsidered.The music is a plus, but could have been produced on its own and still made big $$$. It was a nice break from the 15 minute silences. I also saw some points where the shots could've been cleaned up and bit, and been done better and more tastefully. Watch the conference room scene.Oh, and did I mention the infamous men in monkey suits? No, not tuxes, but "real" ape suits. Perhaps an attempt could have been made to actually make those actors look real.I found the plot to have holes. Instead of concentrating on the idea of man making contact with intelligent beings, this film focuses mainly on a psycho computer. It leaves no real room for a viewer to get to know the characters. Or the *one* that is left by the end.My personal quotes from when I was watching the film:What just happened? Did I miss something? Oh, look. Another silence. Which way is the station turning? and Ugh..liquified peas?!?!?To sum it up:Plot ~~ + - (Starts off interesting, but gets off subject)Characters ~~ + (Leaves us wanting to get more out of them, but the little we are presented with is intriguing.Dialogue ~~ - (Can you find more than 25 minutes the whole time that some one is talking? Count 'em)Music ~~ + (I have to say it's a great piece of music, just I'd hoped it would tie in more.)Overall:Desperate? Want some "background noise" that isn't really that? See it if you like fast forwarding through a third of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is the big deal? To listen to what just about everybody in the world has to say, 2001 is the greatest movie of all time. But when I watched it, I almost had to take the tape out to check whether it was the right movie.I fail to see how screaming monkeys are important enough to the storyline to warrant a 20 minutes, or half-hour, or however long it is. I couldn't tell, because I was so bored time seemed to stand still.I can't see why Stanley Kubrick can be a genius when he managed to forget an important aspect of any movie: the script. We are forced to suffer through long passages of slow-moving ships or people before someone starts talking. (if we're lucky, it is in total silence. If we're not, we're forced to listen to a bunch of people screaming dissonant notes, supposedly heighten the non-existant tension). I mean, really, how are we supposed to relate to these characters when they don't say or do anything that would make us like them?I'm not even going to comment on the end of the film, which only served to waste a half-hour of my time.Maybe I'm a philistine and don't understand the art, but I know what I don't like, and I don't like 2001.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a Stanely Kubrick "classic" and I use the term very loosely as this film is both unbelievably tedious and boring.The film in broken into segments starting with the evolution of Man and a subsequent space mission gone awry. Sprinkled among these four parts is some of the flattest acting you will ever see which is strange because Kubrick was a master at getting the best out of his actors. The only two cast members that add any life to it are Douglas Rain as the voice of HAL 9000 and Vivian Kubrick as the adorable daughter of Floyd.The film is many things: long, slow, meandering, flat and redundant. These negative traits affect almost everything the film has to offer from the story to the performances and the score. The only thing NOT affected is the special effects which are pretty convincing.In conclusion, although the story has promise and it sparkles every now and then, the film is just plain dull.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a Sci-Fi movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Generally, a review is best started by giving an indication of the main theme of the story and genre of a movie, followed by a more detailled analysis of its assets.In this case, however, there is no story to review. The genre is supposedly Science Fiction, yet while Science is on display in the movie (display as in: you can see it if you know it, not you are explained and taught science), and while it is undoubtedly fictitious, it is not, in my personal opinion, Science Fiction.So let's turn this review around and start from the bottom up. The assets. There are some stunning visuals in this movie, way ahead of their time, and the score is great. So if it's visually nice, got nice music, and is a movie, what else is left? Perhaps a plot - none detectable in this movie. Perhaps characters - none noticeable in this movie. Perhaps ideas - none communicated in this movie.In short, this is the longest music video ever filmed, and the music it visualizes is classic. Disney did a better job of Fantasia, though.So why do I not see this as science fiction - after all, the visuals do involve spaceship and astronauts? And one of the "characters" is a computer (though it is just as bland a frame to hang the little dialogue there is from as its human counterparts). Perhaps because of a definition of Science Fiction I once heard. Science Fiction, I was told, is a story which could not be told if you moved it to any other known, real realm. Which disqualifies Star Wars on account of it being just a typical story with stars thrown in the mix, and 2001 on account of it having no story to tell.2001 is the ultimate modern art movie. It is abstract. It is stylized. It is psychedelic in parts. It does not tell a story in any traditional way. It is open to interpretation. Then again, all these qualities are shared by pickled cows. In the end, you cannot analyze this as a movie - it has to be seen as work of art. However, I do not mean this as compliment - if something is marketed as movie, as story, as odyssey, then perhaps it should exhibit such qualities. Instead, this product is nothing but a colourful bubble of visuals and Waltzes. Except, of course, the dancing hippos in Fantasia were more entertaining to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unbelievable... the dullness... the so-called philosophical journey... it's all a bunch of crap. The lack of dialog doesn't make a movie more profound. Not giving all the answers doesn't necesary mean philosophy comes jumping around the corner. Shooting a scene longer than really necessary doesn't mean you're an artist. If it's possible to know the point of a scene after 3 seconds .. you don't want need to see 8 different angles of the same scene for 3 minutes long!! (and I can't even begin to describe the scene where the scientist (Floyd) travels from the earth-orbiter to the moon... ooh my God.. the boredom!!!)So why should I care what the true meaning is of the monoliths, if the story is told in such a boring way? Why should I care what the ending means to the movie, myself or mankind, if the scenes themselves are a big question mark?I don't need to be spoon-fed all the clues, I don't need the blasters, bloodthirsty aliens and one-liners to enjoy sci-fi's AND I love a good philosophical discussion, but please give me a reason to discuss! I know what Kubrick and Clarke hoped to make us ponder about (I won't spoil it.. if that's even possible), but this is not the way to do it.The comments about this movie remind me of the monkeypaintings that were hung in a museum and reviewed by "art-experts": true meaning is in the eye of the beholder, but the meaning doesn't have to be there in the first place. Kubrick tried this, even said so in his interviews, but still the movie itself is flawed. Not the special-effects, not the makers intentions, not the ideas that are presented.. they are excellent, genuine and truly visionary, but the flaw was simply in the way the story was told.And as for the notion that you should read the book to "understand" the movie: That is another example of why the movie failed. A movie should tell it's tale by itself and should not need any outside assistance!1 star for the special effects (1968!), 1 star for Kubrick's and Clarke's intentions:**/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2001: An Ode to Stanley Kubrick, by Stanley Kubrick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's utter sophomoric tripe. Kubrick thinks the audience are absolute idiots. He focuses on a thing - then on what it represents. then on the thing. then on what is represents, then on the thing. Repeat, ad nauseum. The man can't direct for toffee. Oh yes, the special effects are good, some of the ideas in the movie are good - but the movie fails because it is utterly boring, drowning in Kubrick's own self obsession. People go on and on about the technical minutiae - like that's genius - to show the boring bits everyone else edits out - BECAUSE THEY'RE BORING! 2001 is 20 minutes of a good film stretched out over 3 hours! I am an avid reader and watcher of sci-fi. I love the genre because it provokes you to think. This movie was not thought-provoking, but sleep inducing, and caused me not to ponder the human condition, but instead how Kubrick got away with producing the navel-gazing piece of self-adulation. It practically cries out "look at me! look how clever I am! I can do things no one else does and get away with it because I am clever!" (Seems he did get away with it with all the fawning adulation he's got over the years!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was eagerly expecting to see this movie and I've had all my hopes in a good show. Now I'm glad that fast forward has been invented. I really got bored during the hour I've spent watching it. The problem in my vision are the scenes too long for these times. I totally agree that in 1969 the images were astounding and the sheer scale was unimaginable, but now all that is LAME. I knew there was a point in the first part but I really didn't get it. I also know that most movies have some link between its sequences.Sorry, guys. In the year 2003 I simply hate it. 2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To me, this is not only Kubrick's best film but also a milestone of the genre. It is quite long at around two and a quarter hours, and it is slow, that I agree with. But it is never boring, well not to me it isn't. Besides, and this is up to interpretation, but I think the slow pacing is deliberate, it adds to the haunting and eerie quality 2001 has and also to assimilate every shot which speak volumes, and also 2001's greatest strength is actually in the details.The story is somewhat abstract in its structure but is also quite complex, innovative and interesting yet has a simple message, and the screenplay and direction by Kubrick are superb. The acting is not the film's best asset, but it is good enough, with Douglas Rain the standout as the voice of HAL 9000 as he is really quite brilliant. Two things especially make 2001 so good. One are the visuals- even after all those years they are simply outstanding. The cinematography is indeed splendid, as are the colours and settings, but there are so many memorable images. The images of the giant Starchild floating through space and the tribe of apes painfully putting two and two together still resonate considerably even now. The other is the music. Coming from a big classical music enthusiast, I was delighted by the use of Also Sprach Zarathustra and On the Beautiful Blue Danube and how they combined with the visuals were exceedingly clever.Overall, this is a truly wonderful film that is worth seeing for the visuals and music alone and still continues to intrigue and perplex with the ending. As much as I like Oliver and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, two of my childhood favourites, and the brilliant Lion in Winter to me this is it... the best film of 1968. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

The scenes are dragged on waaaaaaay too long, the classical music interludes are too frequent and too long and its just boring!I realize Kubrick thought he was being clever and creative, but he was making a movie about a computer that went wrong. So what the hell does a computer have to do with neanderthals clubbing the others? All he had to do was show that the monolith was on the earth for millions of years. OKay... so now why did the scene have to be almost 20 minutes for that? God I hate this show!How come A Clockwork Orange is so much better? Its warped and twisted, but it does'nt drag on in the least. Everything said and done is relevant to the plot.BAH! Go watch Lord Of the Rings. Now THERES a movie!

		<fullReview>(Yes there are spoilers... a bit)I'm sure I saw this film as a child, but couldn't remember much of it aside from the images of people walking around the circumference of the space ship, and HAL's 'eye'.I have just finished watching it again and have to say that I was really bored out of my mind.Obviously there is something special about this film for some people, as the comments here and the overall rating of it are testament to... but I don't see it at all.I see: *Some quite impressive images of space flight for a film from 1968 *Some VERY long sequences where VERY LITTLE occurs *Some character setup which went absolutely no-where... (what was the point of showing us so much of the doctor who was on his way to the moon to then have him completely disappear after the visit to the monolith? I'm sure it's just another way of us being dispassionate towards the human characters or something but I just found it annoying to learn about a character and then have him disappear...) *Some extremely irritating jumps with no explanation to seemingly un-connected scenes... *And that damn final journey sequence... what's so amazing about a bunch of solarized images of the grand canyon and water? It really quite under whelmed me.I was extremely bored by the whole experience, but I am NOT going to fall into the wonderful trap that I've read a few others here have, which is to insult anyone that has a different view to themselves. Especially to the person who stated that if you didn't like the film you weren't alive... that's a beautiful way to view the world. "If you disagree with my viewpoint then you're a soulless being" Brilliant.All I'm saying is that I have no idea why this film is hailed as a classic, but that doesn't mean it shouldn't be... I just don't see it myself.</fullReview>

I would never recommend this movie because i almost went insane watching it in class (MY teacher made me watch it) and trust me it will make u go insane! the production is bad, and i would rate this movie worst movie of the century!

		<fullReview>I'm a huge fan of Arthur C. Clarke, I think that Kubrick has made many fine movies, and I've watched this movie three times, so before the fans pile onto me I'd just like to say that this opinion isn't stemming from ignorance or bias. That said, 2001 is totally unwatchable as originally made. There's an interesting story being told here, but it's hidden too deeply behind scenes that were technically impressive in 1968 but are merely overdrawn and boring to today's CGI-jaded eye. By all means, watch this movie if you're the arty type who likes extended scenes that don't do anything in particular, but for the average movie-watcher, there's simply not enough content there to justify spending two hours on it. Either find someone who cut it down to a 45-minute short and watch that version, or watch it on DVD at 2x speed. I fully recommend it to anyone given that, but the average person is simply wasting their time trying to watch the original version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has many merits, but I come not to praise Ceasar. There is no doubt that the film has earth shattering effects for its time (1968) Hollywood would not see such space effects again until the 70's with the release of Star Wars. People will tend to fawn and gush over this film. Yes, it's artsy and yes, it has an interesting and thought provoking message buried underneath all the dross and chaff. I once taped this movie and fast-forwarded through the interminably long effects shots to find this 148 minute film had only 45 minutes of dialogue. That's 103 minutes of footage unrelated to story advancement but dedicated to "mood." I'm not saying you shouldn't see "2001," You "ought to" see it if you have an interest in American cinematic history - the film is a landmark. My point being not to fall for the Emperor's new clothes. Just because it is touted as great doesn't mean you'll think so. Watch with your own critical eye - you might think it's the grandest and greatest film of all time - or not. Yes, Hollywood has hailed 2001, but let's not forget that Hollywood is not known for its dense population of highly intelligent people. These are the people that bring you an endless stream of Adam Sandler films.</fullReview>

I've had dozens of friend recommend I read the book, and I still plan to. but somewhere along the lines someone seriously mess this movie up. the two out of ten I gave this movie is purely for visual effects. I couldn't believe this movie was made in the 60's. Im going to break the entire movie down in one paragraph. you start by watching a black screen forever with a obnoxious symphony playing for no apparent reason( brace yourself cause they never stop playing) then you get ten minutes of monkeys. A metal slab appears and they touch it and gain the ability to hit things with bones. Then man finds another on the moon. Its sending a signal to Jupiter so they fly out there to see whats going on. on the way the computer kills all but one person and when that person get to Jupiter he sees another metal slab that apparently gives him acid and he trips for 15 minutes and then watches himself grow old. The a giant fetus returns to earth to...... actually there is no way to tell whats happening at the end cause it never explains anything. THE END!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit the first time I viewed 2001|:A space odyssey I was unimpressed. Months later I was browsing through my local videostore and the DVD of 2001:A space odyssey caught my eye and decided I should give it another go. I am very glad I did because the second time around I loved it and have loved it since. The ape sequence at the beginning I think means that at first the apes couldn't defend themselves against rival apes and other animals but when they realise what they can do with the bones of a dead animal they can finally defend themselves. In the first twenty minutes there is hardly a word spoken instead we are treated to one of the best musical scores ever. The story itself is pretty complex but that is the beauty of 2001: A space odyssey. The last half hour is a visual feast of the highest order. 2001 is a movie that has divided most people,some people love it,some people hate it but I for one absolutely love 2001. 2001 is a remarkable piece of cinema and I would call it one of Stanly Kubrick's best after A Clockwork Orange.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm a fan of art-house movies, but this was just dull</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most American/Hollywood material is far too shallow for my taste and I love many slow "artsy" movies from the likes of Wenders or Fassbinder. But I have to say, even after watching 2001 with an open mind now and the suspicion in the back of my head that I might have been too young to understand it when I first saw it about one and a half decades ago, this movie just does not deliver. Main problems:1. What creativity, symbolism or beauty is supposed to lie in painfully slow sequences of someone using technical appliances?2. The kaleidoscope effects, inverse images etc. towards the end were playing for far too long. Overusing such effects comes across as rather primitive.3. Most of the acting was plain bad. I did like the voice acting for HAL though.4. I don't want to sound like a Trekkie, but a computer with full control over the whole ship with no easily accessible manual override is an unbelievable concept. Plus the supposed infallibility even though the machine was created and programmed by fallible human beings. I could accept it if I could see an artistic reason for this, but I don't. It appears like some standard sci-fi component of the time thrown into the mix.My rating: 4 of 10 for some good cinematography and a (mostly unsuccessful) hint of artistic endeavor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been almost 40 years, and I still do not get all the hype over this movie. The original 'Star Trek' series on TV in the 60's had better special effects, better plots more than half the time, and better dialogue. I have been reading or watching sci-fi for at least 50 years. The original 'King Kong' was a classic. The 1951 'The Thing from Another Planet' was a classic. 'The Bride of Frankenstein' was a classic. To call this film a classic, to me, demeans the meaning of the word 'classic'. The book was definitely better.It's like "the artsy science fiction film of the 60's", so it must be good. This movie is not terrible, but it is not great either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had always heard that this movie was a classic, and one of the finest films ever made. So, one night my brother, some friends and I rented it. It was quite possibly the most boring movie I had ever seen. The "musical interludes" add nothing to the plot, and hardly even look interesting. The opening with the apes is somewhat cool, but not enough to make the rest of the movie worth it. The time I spent watching it could have been put to so many better uses, but, alas, it's now gone for good. However, the fact remains that it is a classic, both a classic film and a classic work of sci-fi. Boring as it may be, that is its one saving grace: it needs to be seen. I suggest getting together with a lot of friends, and a lot of candy or something to distract you, and watch it. Get it over with. But, see it.</fullReview>

Unfortunately, I did read it, and it seemed that the movie was just a preview of the novel. Throughout the movie I was intently focused on other things... call me jaded if you want, but the movie taught me one thing, and that is, see the movie first, then read the way it is supposed to be.

		<fullReview>This film is the very definition of pretentious. It insists upon itself in a manner that is not consistent with the story. The story moves along awkwardly. I assume the actual story is only about 15-20 minutes and for some ungodly reason Kubrik decided long, slow, distanced shots of spaceships flying and docking on spaceports would make good filler.Maybe in 1968 this was an astounding film that inspired awe in audiences, but anyone who can look at this film in modern times and say it is a masterpiece is speaking purely from nostalgia. In 1968 no one had ever seen spaceships in this great of detail on a big screen, so I imagine the reaction was similar to folks who saw The Wizard of OZ, when everything went color.Was the film extremely influential in shaping the SciFi genre we know today? Of course. But today, most would feel like the movie is hallow and lacking substance. We just expect more these days and this film is far too simplistic by today's standards. If you want to see Star Wars' older more boring cousin, or just like seeing long shots of spacecraft lofting through space for an hour, this is the movie for you. The film is respectable for what it did in early cinema, but it is simply dated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I started to admire the works of Kubrick at the age of 14 after seeing the movie Dr. Strangelove. And after seeing Full Metal Jacket, I became a fan of Kubrick. Then I was in my high school Cinema Studies class and the teacher showed us this movie. I've always wanted to see it because it had Kubrick as the director and I heard it was his best film. I was aware that it was a slow movie, but that didn't bother me. Little did I know that it would be one of the most boring and most pretentious films I have ever seen.Before the fans of this film flame me, let me explain. I wasn't expecting a film like Star Wars. I was looking for a film that had a good storyline and characters that were interesting to watch. This film didn't have that. There was no storyline and the characters were really empty and void with no personality at all. That's not even the worst part. The worst part is the pacing. Now I love watching slow paced movies, but they need to have something going on that will keep me interested in what's going on. This movie didn't have that. You can take out about 70% of this film and not be missing any plot points whatsoever. A lot of the shots are either of spaceships floating in space, spaceships landing (very slowly), stars and planets, or landscapes. I'm sorry, but I expected to see a film, not a slideshow of art.Now there is one thing that I can say good about this movie, and that's the visual effects. For 1968, they are absolutely fantastic and still hold up pretty well and the Oscar it received is very well deserved.The overall problem with this movie is that it tries to hard to be intelligent. This isn't a problem necessarily, but if you don't have something to keep me interested in what's going on besides the pretty special effects, then you're insulting your audience and that's what 2001 does.If you wanna watch a film that is both entertaining and genuinely intelligent, watch the original Planet of the Apes. It came out in the same year, has a slow pace, but it has 2 things that it has over this movie, an engrossing story, and well fleshed out characters.Overall 2/10</fullReview>

But movie is insanely boring. It is 2+ hours long movie and it is slow like hell.The special effects and music of movie is outclass. 10/10 for the special effects and music. To see such class effects in late 60's movies is rare to watch. But still this special effects and music cannot save the movie.Movie starts with 3 minutes of black screen and music and don't know what's going on. Why there is need to show black screen and music for 3 long minutes. Then we see early stone age people and there struggle for living. Monkeys are surprised with this monolithic buried in rocks. No one knows why it is kept there or who kept it or from where it came. Not explained... Then movie forwards to modern age where scientist do there work. Here too movie is slow and difficult to make out as what's going on as there is too less conversation between the characters. At this point of time, your interest towards the movie falls to zero and you get bored. Then again you see some very good special effect, good music, then good special effect and then again good music. But the question arises as how can this be linked to story of movie?? Somehow after 2+ hours the movie ends and your head pains like anything. At the end you think that did you saw a documentary or a movie. But documentary are also not that bad. According to me this movie is very highly overrated with some awesome special effects and music.</fullReview>

And you would only understand why they where heading to the monoliths location by reading the movie description which I think many would agree is not good.Lastly I would say that it was a waste of my time. and Look at my watch list if you think I enjoy rubbish techno-crap movies.

		<fullReview>I was turned onto this movie because I loved Stanly Kubrick's, A Clock Work Orange. But after watching for about 30 minutes I was totally let down. First of all you have to believe that we evolved from Apes millions of years ago to enjoy the opening scene, The Dawn of Man. I personally think the whole evolution theory is false and full of holes. But then again Planet of the apes was about man evolving from Apes and that was a great movie. I do have to admit though, the scenery of the earth before the age of man in this film was breathtaking.The movie is way too slow and there isn't much going on. The music selection for the soundtrack was great. I loved some of the classical songs. Which is one of the big reasons I loved, A clock Work Orange.But if I wanted to hear classical music and see landscapes I could do that on my own. I watch movies for their great stories and thought provoking conversations between well scripted characters. This movie provided neither. I found myself finding better things to do when there was no dialog. This must be some kind of record. The shortest script ever to a full length feature.I only got half way though the movie because at 1 hour and 12 minutes there was a scene that nearly put me to sleep. For exactly 6 minutes and 40 seconds the only audio was an annoying hissing sound and a man breathing. That was it, I'd had it. I had to find something better to do with my time. So I decided to bash this flick on the internet. I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 just because it was made in 1968 and they did their best with what technology was available.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2001: A Space Bordity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lets start with this film for what it is, OK it's a SPACE film, its set in a big space of nothing. So why does it start with gorillas? this film is meant to show the evolution of man and the overall film is just like nothing I have ever seen...it's just nothing happens and a really really boring film.Nothing can beat the opening music to this film everyone knows it from some form or another, however thats probably the only good thing about this film, it takes a total of about 45 minutes for anyone to actually say anything with the first lines being "Here you are, sir", for the first half of this film I thought I was watching an episode of WILD LIFE ON ONE or something waiting for David Attenborough to say the famous works of "here we have..." or waiting for some form of sex to happen, however to my disappointment i wasted a total of 45 minutes watching this poor film, then when it does pick up and the space actually hits you...your either asleep or like me wanting to change the film...still i stuck with it.The part when it does kick in its so slow....the music is dull I was turning emo, but thats not my biggest dig, it's just NOTHING happens, OK I would rather have had two and a half hours of a romantic flick than this poor film. Its slow it's like sitting outside and watching the sky while sometimes hitting your self on the head with a massive stick to stay awake. It's also very much like watching someone with a load of cutouts. I mean come on the space stations are poor, you would see better in a primary school art room.This film however does have some good points, in that it's 3 stories about space. The first story is pretty slow seriously it just doesn't pick up on anything to make you want to watch it or even pay attention it's like they could have made in interesting I mean come on it's SPACE, but I guess that they where trying to make it seem as real as possible. If they where trying to make it as real as possible that was probably a bad idea because who wants to see people moving really slowly in a space ship they would be as much fun as being in a washing machine (in fact being in space for real in 1968 would probably have been like being in a washing machine) this film had so much potential, and OK the comment about the space stations was abit out of order they do look pretty good.The second story is the only good one with the HAL computer that one i only know because of Recess and the simpsons, but either way it is the best one of the stories in this film, and does try to be a good horror (if they remade this story it would be SO good, like Event Horizon or something and would be really good...in fact I think that might be the idea where Event Horizon come from however Event Horizon is just a better film) the one thing I didn't get at the end of this film was the ending but then I didn't pay attention to the rest of the film in all fairness I was more fixed on looking at my fish tank (which by the way at the moment has no fish in it - yes thats how interesting this film is) but maybe I don't want to understand the end of this film because people who have watched it and liked it say that you have to be intelligent to understand it.You have to be intelligent to understand it? OK I don't watch a film to use my head after it and work out the meaning of life and the fact that we are all made of carbon and may have evolved from apes and we could have been made out of silicon if there wasn't so much of some substance in the air (like that blob from star trek), or we may have evolved into something else due to different conditions or we are going to evolve into something else like the Borg.To be honest I watch a film to watch a film...that probably makes no sense but I watch a film to forget everything else around me I don't watch one and turn to the person next to me and say "yo...did you know we may have evolved from apes?" then get into a massive debate during the film...though that may have been a way to make this poor film go faster.In fact heres an idea you know that most people skip the first 30 minutes of superman and watch it from when he goes to the city....with this film you can just skip it to the HAL computer story watch that for 30 minutes then go to bed it would be like watching the Recess version but only its the film that its based on...in fact just watch the Recess version it's what 15 minutes and way more fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Monkey madness, space ballet and an out of psychotic computer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With 2001 Stanley Kubrick succeeded in merging monkey madness, space ballet and an out of control computer by the use of an odyssey through space and time. What he did not succeed in, was in making a good film. Of course, by the standards of the time (1968) the effects were incredible and so were the monkey costumes (compare them with Planet of The Apes, which is also from 1968), but innovation hardly makes a film great. An interesting plot eventually combined with an intriguing style of filming does and that is where Kubrick went wrong with this one.The first 15 Minutes of the film (I watched the 139 minute version), entitled ?The Dawn of Humankind' made up the best part of the movie. I especially liked the ending of that piece, when the music set in, fading into the space part of the film incredibly well. What followed this amazing transition was an amazing piece of space ballet. A real feast for the eyes. Then I guessed the ?stylish' part was over and the film would begin. I was wrong. In the 1 hour and 40 minutes to come there would be numerous overlong scenes of space ballet that added nothing to the plot and became quite boring over time, as did the whole film. Some of the scenes were quite pointless (in addition to being soundless). The part with the HAL 9000 computer was OK as well, but actually that about sums it up.There is of course a storyline in this film, and it does connect monkey madness to an out of control computer by means of space ballet, but the way in which it is done just doesn't hold my attention. The space ballet could have been abandoned, because it did not connect monkeys to computer by means of causality but only by means of choice as did the vividly colorful voyage at the end. Sure the cinematography is great and the effects are amazing, but those two things are not the only things that make a movie.3 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is it with people and saying this movie is great? I have the feeling people are scared to criticize Mr. Kubrick. They're obviously not scared of Kubrick, but scared of others that might say they're not intelligent or laugh at them because they don't "understand" the movie. Get a grip.This is my review. A review of a film fan who watches at least 2 movies a week. Someone who likes to watch some action but can also enjoy a drama or a movie that's supposed to make you think. All different genres have a few movies in them that I find awesome, although genres like drama aren't actually my thing.My rating for this movie was 3/10. Now why on earth would I give such a low rating? I'll start with the good things about the movie. The visuals are stunning. For the time the special effects are brilliant and Kubrick pulled some very nice tricks. Bravo. The plot is pretty good too. There it is, the base for a good movie. Then it went wrong...The movie is boring beyond bearable levels. I'm sorry, but staring a a spaceship docking for 5 minutes while classic music plays isn't exactly what I'd call brilliant. Every single scene is long, slow and boring. The first 30 minutes of the movie are the worst of all. 30 minutes of monkey's dancing around a large black brick. Awful.I really really don't understand the people that praise this movie. It's not art, it's not entertainment, it's pure agony. I would consider it art if the movie lasted half an hour. Movies were made for entertainment or in some cases, art. This movie seemed to be created to make people fall asleep. I'm not ignorant and I am not scared to say: This Kubrick movie sucks beyond your imagination. There's no deeper meaning to it, there no artistic value but the genius of the special effects, which is simply not enough to save this piece of junk. Don't watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful but empty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The five-word summary: Visually spectacular self-indulgent claptrap. I understand that the book is very good, but standing by itself this movie is absolutely and utterly meaningless. The entire "plot", such as it is, could be described in six sentences or less. The visual imagery is stunning, but towards the end gets extremely repetitive. The music is beautiful, but the sound-effects are absolutely diabolical - at points it seems as if there are less than ten separate sound effects used in the entire movie, repeated ad-nauseum.It defies belief that this movie is so well-rated on IMDB. I can only draw two conclusions - either the book is great, and people are willing to forgive the fact that this movie cannot stand in its own right for anybody who's not read the book first, or people vote this movie up because they want to feel clever and believe they found some hidden meaning in a movie that basically has none.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah, the sweet irony of a vast "Savannah" of pseudo-intellectuals in worshipful praise of a film with Darwinism as a central theme! And after watching this thing, painfully, for the third time the only imagery I'm left with is a bunch of baboons sitting at a keyboard with pipe smoke swirling overhead ranting on about the stunning grandeur of it all. Please. You want to be one of the sheep, or a shepherd? If evolution exists then one can naturally conclude that part of the process is the ability to think for oneself. Apparently that's not the case. If you want real entertainment, pour yourself a drink and take an hour or so to read through the reviews posted on this site. But keep an "open mind" OK? I guarantee you more entertainment value than you will find by sitting through this borefest. 2001 is an example of technological craftsmanship and that's about it, other than a monument to a director's out of control self-indulgence.But I have an idea of how we can add some entertainment spice to this film-let's make it interactive...sort of like Rocky Horror. We can do a "shirts and skins" thing, and pass out Mastodon femurs to all the patrons, pro and con, then sponsor a free-for-all about halfway through the movie with the winners deciding whether it's worth sitting through the balance of this "masterpiece." I'm betting that all we "troglodytes" that despise this movie will win that battle everytime, no matter how greatly outnumbered. Now there's a statement about "evolution" that you can sink your teeth into.OK, now that the brawl is over let's look at Kubrick himself and what his true vision for 2001 may have been. If you consider the balance of his most successful work they all have insanity or some sort of personal haunting dementia as it's primary theme...the insanity of war, destructive obsessiveness, etc. And if you apply this thought process, or "vision", to 2001 then the natural conclusion one might arrive at is this.....it's already interactive, Kubrick designed it that way to inspire the natural selection process in his audience thereby segregating us into two classes-the one group that will identify with James Mason's "Lolita" character as an obsessive, sexually repressed perverted intellectual, and the other that will no doubt be driven insane after sitting through this overlong snore-a-thon.... thus connecting us all eventually to the quirky genius behind camera. I like Kubrick for the most part and on balance I suppose I can even forgive him for butchering "The Shining" but in the final analysis "2001" is a dull and lifeless space opera that may fire off a neuron or two but it doesn't pass for entertainment. 5/10 SKINS RULE! </fullReview>

		<fullReview>WHAT? Huh? What? Dawn of Man Crap--I don't come from monkeys who were men in suits by the way--Look how one touches the monolith--it's a dead giveaway. Approximinately twenty minutes of meaningless chimp crap which includes see monkey learn about killing something and ooh ooh freaked out simian excitement over black slab. One of the awesome moments in the early part of this film is the switch over to the future and then we're back in snooze-ville. Ship taxi-es in, music--Sit upright during this portion folks otherwise you'll be put to sleep. Thanks to the chimps and the ships and the murmured babble about another slab--ooh a breath of a plot at last--With all this bogging down the pacing, It's well into an hour before the film reaches the best, and sad to say, shortest segment. Bowman, Poole and HAL, who after Star Trek the Next Generation's Mr. Data's got to be the sexiest voice of anyone pretending to be a mechanized being in the history of movies. HAL's also the most heinous of them all and due to his actions the film's most chilling moments take place. Then and only then Kubrick whips up the pace while and injects horror film imagery and incidents via creepy HAL."Beyond the infinite" is the right title for the last segment. It's a real--belief suspender. I figured this out after watching this film a second time (I was a teen the first and did not past the rotating space station before giving up) There's only one way to get through the probe into the slab--Imagine you're getting into a car for a leisurely HALF HOUR(or so it felt to me; actually I think the running time is about 7 minutes) drive. Then after Bowman parks, dumping me into--Huh what's with sanitized hotel room? What's with the big Cute baby. Movie over. What was all that about? Visually a knockout, the plot, a tick picked out and tossed away by a chimp. I see some of the elements from Kubrick's later (and IMO) greater work, "The Shining"--vast scenery and atmospheric lighting and effective use of classical music but that's all 2001 is. It just exists and does nothingzzzzzzz....</fullReview>

It is impressive.But it moves like lead in an ice storm. It is just So bloody slow. You want there to be Tie fighters racing by the space Stations or a Death Star or even the Swinetrek from Pigs in Space to be out there amidst the floating Dominos, jupiter and Io. Instead you get tons of Wagner tunes, Jupiter bearing down over the ship, a reaallll slow trip to Jupiter's environs, a sneaky computer, a few guys in bad apes soots at the start...that weird Finding the Big Domino in the Moon's crater scene...oh yeah, there's a lot to this all.But-where does it all take you, the coldness of space, of technology, of the future and the Universe? Into some warped Acid drenched trip into hyper space, where you get a big kid floating in a bubble heading back Earthwards at the end....Okay, that's cute guys-now does it mean anything?Maybe its like those Dali flat clock paintings, you get outta them what you put into them...but what I saw just made my eyes glaze over; and I think it's a flick that coulda used some Judicious EDITING(read:SHORTENING) ere it was released.So-it is a classic yeah. And I recommend it to anyone wanting an outta body experience. Just expect to wade through a snoozer of a space trip ere the whacked ending first.***1/2 stars, believe it or not, I truly do admire the effort, though it's about as much fun to sit through as a Ben Stein Clone convention....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film made me cry, made me sick and gave me insomnia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seriously, who was this film honestly made for? I know for one thing, even 90 year old people would fall asleep watching this film. The only reason behind giving this film 2 stars is because of the brilliant music and the amazing visual effects. Everything else about this film is just plain horrible.The film starts off like never before with 3 minutes of black screen. Instantly, we are bored. That's never a good sign. Next, we see pictures of sunset for 2 minutes. Seriously, why show this??? Then we have another 10-12 minute sequence with apes that only needed to be 2 or 3 minutes long where they discover the Monolith and start fighting each other like retards. We even see evolution occurring but all this could've been reduced to 2 or 3 minutes like I said. The boredom doesn't stop here. In fact, I call that the most entertaining part of this film. I'm sorry! Then we see a ship orbiting around space for minutes. It gets so tiring and boring that you wanna wish you were either dead. Then, we see a guy falling asleep. Poor actor probably fell asleep watching the first 20 minutes of the film. The film takes 26 minutes for a bit of awfully boring dialogue to happen. In 26 minutes, all that happened was some ape s discovered the Mononlith. Did that have to be 26 minutes long???? The biggest problem with the film is the atrocious pacing and the absolute lack of any entertainment. I'm not asking for epic battles or explosions. I'm just asking for things to speed up. And don't anybody say "Watch the film in the dark with full sound" I DID THAT AND IT DID NOT WORK! The second story of the film was awfully boring it nearly put me to sleep. In that, all that happens was 6 astronauts discover the Monolith. That's 55 minutes into the film. AARGH! Remember the film '12 Angry Men' which is only situated in a jury room. By now, we love the characters and are fully immersed into the story. Here, nothing happens. In one scene, we see a waitress even walk so slowly. What was Kubrick thinking??? 12 years from now, he goes on to make the Shining which is one of the greatest cinematic masterpieces of all time. When a film is terribly slow in pacing, so is the tone to the movie. Don't anybody say "Its supposed to be an experience, not an entertainment" because that is just the dumbest thing I've heard. It was a heck of a boring experience, even to people who have insomnia. Remember Back to the Future, its a Sci-Fi/adventure. That film is fast paced and is extremely entertaining and a great experience. What makes this an exception for not being entertaining???The 2 1/2 hour dull film could've easily been cut down into 1 hour. You'd think that when Kubrick makes a film almost twice as long as it needs to be, that he'd at least develop the characters. NOOOOOO! He did not at all. The characters are as dull as a brick wall. In fact, I'd rather stare at a brick wall for 2 1/2 hours than watch this film. There's nothing wrong with a quiet film if its paced well, but this just isn't. Awful story, terrible characters and boring dialogue along with elongated scenes which serve hardly any purpose to the movie makes this one of the worst experiences of all time. Its a pity because I really wanted to love this film.</fullReview>

It makes the impression of a power point slide show. I had to watch it at the x3 - x40 speed on my computer. And there is a total misunderstanding of the possible benefits of artificial intelligence.. The end is really cryptic to me. I didn't like this movie, maybe this was the author's idea?

		<fullReview>So, I have heard so many great reviews of this movie. Being a Sci-Fi fan, I chagrined at having never seen the acclaimed epic film. So, I finally got around to watching it and immediately was bored to laughter. That's a pretty low level, just in case you were wondering. Of course, being that it was Sci-Fi i safely assumed it would be an evolution-based story. It did like the way they structured telling the story of how a species might develop and such. That part was cool, but the lingering, laboring (dare I say) music, and the bad acting, and the all-around corniness of the film would not leave me alone. I watched the entire thing looking for this great moment that would take the film into orbit for me - pun intended...never happened. The message of the film simply annoyed me, as I'm sure this review will do for all the die-hard's of the movie. But, apart from my personal beliefs about the origin of life (which no evolutionist can intelligently give you), it simply was a slow going story, with maybe a page worth of dialogue. Oh well, it's just a movie and a review of it from no one special in the film industry.</fullReview>

Admittedly it did give us Hal but that was it. If you have the time too try and watch this go ahead but I would recommend watching most the movie in fast ford because it just feels like nothing ever happens. The concept back then was original and the effects probably seemed amazing, but the first time I saw this movie was 2010 and it felt like it had dated a lot. This movie has some clever concepts but by today's standard it falls behind and is an incredibly boring movie without a single good action scene and the acting feels very average.(10 perfect, 5 not really worth my time, 1 I would rather watch grass grow for 10 hours than watch this movie for 10 minutes).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A strange mixture of horrible and awesome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie contains some very well made, interesting and realistic parts, but in overall I still regret spending my time to watch it, because unfortunately the rest of the film is totally awful, and as a whole it makes no sense at all. At first a large black stone(?) slab seems to have some important role (first it enlightens some prehumans, then astronauts find it and research about it) then after about one third of the movie we never hear about it again, it loses it's importance in the plot and a completely different story starts. At least this other story makes sense, except for it's ending which is a total nonsense again - even worse than the first part, because here you don't even know what's going on, it's totally random and has not much (as nothing) to do with the story it should end. The parts that worth watching are between the parts I mentioned before. I'll write more about them later. Apart from not making sense this movie will try your patience in other ways too, especially in it's first half. For example the film-score is horrible. Not just because that music sounds very bad, but also because it's style is never appropriate to the actual scene of the movie. For example many times there is a dramatic music when actually nothing special happens. Then there are parts, very long ones in which absolutely nothing happens. You are to watch an empty desert for long minutes, a spaceship docking for at least 10 minutes and probably other such things I don't remember. During these scenes of course you can listen that "masterpiece" film-score I just wrote about. (Some say that docking scene is the best part because "it's so artistic and beautiful" - well maybe I would agree with them to some degree if it wasn't longer than 2 minutes, but too much is too much!) Now let's get back to the part I wrote about that it worths watching. It's the part which pictures a space mission to some distant place (I don't remember where) - hence the title. It is surprisingly realistic: there is weightlessness everywhere in the ship except for a large block witch rotates to provide gravity; outside the ship(s) there is gravely silence, the route takes years - so most of the crew are hibernated; and when a TV station from Earth makes an interview with the (awake) crew members they tell the viewers that it takes minutes for their question to reach the spaceship (and also the answer to reach Earth). They must have used some experts to design this, it totally lacks those fancy but unrealistic stuffs we got used to in the modern sci-fis. If this was the whole movie it would worth much more than like this. But it gets screwed too when the computer, Hal makes a small mistake and many very illogical decisions ensue from both its and the crews part!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey is regarded by some as one of the best films in history. I am not one of those people. Although it is an escape into the future and into space with underlying political and cultural messages common in 1960s films, the film did little to impress me. Maybe it is because of the time that I was born into. I felt that a lot of the movie went along very slowly, from the peaceful apes throwing sticks into the air to the scenes of astronauts floating in space, abandoned by their large metal craft.I wouldn't recommend this film to the average movie viewer, but it is one of those films that should be watched by serious film viewers. No guarantees that you will think it's the best film ever made. It certainly isn't in my eyes.</fullReview>

If this movie had not been over hyped in all of the reviews, considering its dated, I would think a lot more of it.

		<fullReview>I will begin by admitting that I don't like space movies, including Alien which is a slow and uninteresting bore. 2001 has a similar setting without a creature chasing people around a space craft. Instead we get computer named Hal repeating Dave ad nauseum. The film is supposed to be a deep and meditative reflection on the universe and the place we humans belong within it. Stanley Kubrick worked with the science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke on the script with several rewrites. I believe the pair may have ingested a mind altering substance while putting 2001 together because it doesn't make any sense whatsoever. Three years later Kubrick released A Clockwork Orange, which is my favorite film of all time, so I have no explanation for his earlier work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was rated very high so i decided to watch it. After i watched it i thought.... HOw was this movie rated so high???? It was quite boring and dumb. It showed a dumb picture of animals for like 20 minutes. I almost fell asleep. I tried to enjoy it.. but i failed. Don't ever watch this movie. It's a waste of money. I enjoy a lot of Kubrick's movies such as The Shining and The ClockWork Orange.. BUt this is something different. Even "meet the spartans" is better then this piece of crap. But people who are really in to it.. might enjoy it. Story: 3/10 Character: 2/10 Events: 1/10 Effects: 2/10 Overall: 2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love movies. I am a HUGE Sci-fi fan (not just "matrix" and other quasi-SF, but books like "Dune", "Neuromancer" and the like.) But I HATED 2001. There were bits I liked, liked most of the interactions with HAL, and some of the imagery. But the whole HAL-kills-the-spacewalker scene was B-O-R-I-N-G. I laughed, it looked so bad.OK, I know this movie was made 25 or more years ago, but it's still funny.I feel this movie is overrated, over-analyzed and WAAAAY over-discussed. I even found the book garbage, but then I was never a big Arthur C. Clarke fan.I would recommend "Event Horizon" to those looking for a "space-horror" that really makes you question what might be out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick, I forgive you for this crap!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is, in my opinion, NOT as good as other IMDb users think (WAY worse!). It's so slow that you'll fall asleep, at least I did (litteraly). The first line you have to wait about 25-30 minutes for. To my big surprise, when I type in IMDb.com to see what other people think about this one, everybody seem to love "2001 - A space odyssey". How is it possible? OK, I admit it is beautifully made and it was the start of a sience-fiction-era which probably have inspired many directors, but the fact it's so boring is carrying greater weight, and the space-scenes doesn't save the film at all! Perhaps I'm born in the wrong time. Perhaps all of you who saw it in the premiere are feeling nostalgia, or something like that. But I downloaded it now in 2007 and watched it directly after the download was finished and I hated it! It's strange! Kubrick ALSO directed my favorite film of all time, "A Clockwork Orange". Therefore, I forgive him for making this ridiculously bad one. God rest Kubrick's soul, and don't watch 2001, watch A Clockwork Orange instead, which in Kubrick shows his better sides as a director! My rate; 2 instead of 1? Because of the great space-scenes; those must have been difficult to make (but, as I mentioned above, it doesn't SAVE the movie at all!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I´ve seen this a couple of times. The first time I fell asleep from sheer boredom. This was many years ago, so I thought maybe I was too young (or tired) to "get" it. I saw it again. It was even more boring than I remembered! It´s OK to be artistic, but when a spaceship docks for 10 minutes to the tune of classical music, it just doesn´t work anymore. 2001 has some redeeming qualities, mostly in the whole "HAL"-concept and sometimes the slow, artistic approach works, but they can´t save this film from dullness.

		<fullReview>I saw this movie for the first time yesterday and I hated it. Rather than giving this a "one of the best films ever made" label, I would classify it as (noticeably) fairly early science fiction with a confusing plot (if that can truthfully be called a "plot"), an incredibly slow pace, and no characters worth caring about. When people praise a movie like this, I wince. From my perspective, this is like modern art that, to me at least, is not "art" if the definition of "art" is to create something beautiful. If the definition of "art" is to provoke or shock, well then, you can have it.I thought that the length of time spent on the apes was ridiculous. The phone conversation between the man and his daughter was pointless. The fact that the people of the future looked like the people of the 1960s (when the film was made) showed a complete lack of creativity.If I'm going to invest time and/or money in watching a film, I want it to entertain me or to educate me or to draw me in so tightly that I lose track of time and of my surroundings and am simply encompassed in the film. This movie had me watching the clock and wondering what the heck was going on, what the point was, and why this movie had received so much lavish praise. I guess the most poignant thing I can say is that I wouldn't want to date any of the people who find THIS the epitome of fine film-making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who are these people that voted high scores for this movie? Were they afraid their friends would think they were unsophisticated or dumb because they didn't get it? When this movie came out, everyone heard all the glowing praise from the phony critics, and flocked to the theaters. And all of them came out saying what the heck was that? Don't let anybody tell you they "got it" the first time around. If they say that, they are lying. No one understood it. Even me. I had read the short story that was the seed of 2001, and I thought, "Well, I will be the one who understands it." Nope. Actually, the short story - called "Sentinel" - was FAR better and explained what was going on WAY better than Kubrick did. The "trip" scene was just cinematic background for one of those psychedelic rock bands on a TV show. Kubrick threw in some good classical music and the cinematography was very well done. The story line you could describe thoroughly in 12 words. The plot was so basic up till the trip that most people wondered when the heck K was going to put some story into the story. Well, he never did. A sad case of hype, folks. Most of the high scores were evidently by people who had the movie explained to them before or afterward - what kind of recommendation is that for a movie, that you have to have it explained to you? EVERYONE I knew that saw it on first release thought they had totally wasted their money and time. And NOBODY went back to seee it a second time! What kind of recommendation is THAT? If this vote was taken at the exits of the theaters back then, this movie would be on the bottom 100 list. Thumbs down. Stanley, everyone on the planet is dumber for having seen your movie. I award you 2 stars (3 of those for cinematography), and may God have mercy on your soul.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't get it; don't care for it...an ultimate waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly don't get what is so great about this movie. Sure, it covers controversial topics like evolution and A.I., but it is all done through images rather than dialog. Many people that I know like this film from that very reason; well, no offense, but when I see a movie, I look forward to actors acting, and a clear storyline.Visuals are great to have, which this movie certainly fulfills, but it is not enough. All it took was classical music and a green screen to make this movie. I can understand it was a big deal in the 1960s but come on; any fool can do that. This is all I got out after seeing this movie: -The first five minutes are of blackness with blaring classical music. The next twenty minutes of the movie is nothing more than apes jumping around and using bones to beat one another senselessly.-When this FINALLY ends, the next five minutes is a distant shot of a modeled space station that the camera zooms incredibly slowly towards it with some pretty music. After this, there are actually PEOPLE in this movie. Wow?it only took a half hour to see some people! -So these people are on some sort of mission, which makes up the next thirty minutes of nothing more than boring dialog (at least there was some talking). Then all of the sudden, they all die for no reason. The next hour of the film is the introduction of the ACTUAL story with the protagonist Dave and the computer A.I. Hal. Predictably, Hal malfunctions and decides to kill everyone, forcing Dave to be the hero.-Now that two hours have passed, I sleepily wonder what the rest of the film is. Well, I'll just say that the next ten minutes is what John Candy quoted from Spaceballs, "They have gone to plad." Following that, the remainder of the movie is an old man in robes eating at a table in a white room muttering to himself, and then a swift change to an alien baby sucking its thumb.I did not get a single point from this movie, just a borefest of pretty images that I can find in any Terrence Malick film. There was nothing captivating or enchanting with this movie. I wish I could get the two and a half hours I lost from watching this waste of a so-called "classic science-fiction film". 1/10 -If I was able to, I would give this a fat zero.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I registered simply to warn others of how bad this movie is!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A quick synopsis before I give specifics into why this movie is so painfully bad that I intend to DEMAND my $2.71 for rental of it. It make me stoopid. OK, not really but I'd rather sit through an Alicia Silverstone movie marathon than this again.2 minutes of black screen with, as one other reviewer described it: what sounds like dying hippos. I'd liken more to audio recording of 3 simultaneous root canals, drills and all, with no Novocaine. But I digress. Next, we watch a lot of apes fight for supremacy (I dare not call them monkeys) of what I don't really know, though the waterhole they bathe in might be a good guess. Though they have non-verbal communication, they haven't figured out how to use tools. One of them touches the monolith (3D black rectangle that does nothing...or does it? Oooo) and ta-da! Now he grasps the concept of tools and learns how fight off the other apes. I'm not really sure how that's evolution, seems to point to Lamarck more than Darwin, but hey...The next segment shows some guy's complete flight to a space-station where he has a conference about a monolith that's on the moon. No one knows or cares about the old one, by the way. It makes annoying sounds that deafens the astronauts when they try to touch it because no means no. It calls it's boyfriend to beat them up. OK the last part isn't true, but it would've been much more interesting. What I just described basically takes 45 minutes of your life that you will feel were stolen from you, even if you'd just planned on doing macramé instead. The signal it sends out is rather annoying and pointing at Jupiter. "Let's definitely go there" say the astronauts. We've already got Rosie O'Donnell, why not follow where THIS large rectangle of audible annoyance points us.Great, now we're in a space station where a computer called HAL is on-board to help the astronauts on their mission. Here the actors muster all their strength to completely phone in their parts in what would almost be considered slightly more fascinating than your cousin's Christmas letter telling you how their little baby has started to say real words like...who am i kidding? you can't possibly care. I personally root for the evil computer. It seems to me that evolution for man could just as easily mean learning not to build technology that can defeat mankind. Duh. This is NOT Kubrick's take. Everything is pretty obvious. What a ripoff!! I saw that in the Simpsons and it took 7 minutes for the whole thing AND it was funny. I also thought that the South Park spoof was cleverer and far better paced.Dave makes it passed Hal and can complete his mission. Apparently his mission is to go hurtling through space toward Jupiter while watching the predecessor to Laser Loggins goes disco. There's some psychedelic rays shooting at the astronaut for a long time. Eventually he ends up in a sterilized house where he's old. It's like a bad Neil Young song in slow-mo. Then there's a fetus floating in space. All this to the soundtrack of the most played out, obvious, annoying selections of art music. While there seem to be a lot of technically important advances in how this film was shot and quite a controversy over the meaning or intended meaning of the movie, none of that can help the fact that it is completely unfulfilling in almost every way. The people who praise it so much are narcissists who look to show off just how intelligent they are by coming up with some grand interpretation that's really more about making them appear smart than anything else. I love "Dr. Strangelove..." and "Full Metal Jacket" and other brilliant Kubrick films. This is NOT among them. 2001 should only make a top 250 films ever list if it involved candidates for Mystery Science Theatre 3000, except that the complete lack of dialog for the first 25 minutes would ruin even that.intermission--I'll do the rest of my complaining in the comment board.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001 is a film about nothing. While it may be visually stunning and well directed, it is still about nothing. There is no story, nothing happens. It is 140 minutes of...nothing. We see lots of pretty colors that draw us in, but 2001 is nothing more than a bad acid trip of a calamity that should never have made it past the halls of some pretentious film school. Many argue that Kubrick is a master of his craft and he was indeed a good director, but his films always lacked anything interesting. All of the good directing in the world doesn't make a film. It just helps a solid film become a better film. In the case of 2001, nothing could've saved it and it is far and away the worst thing I have ever attempted to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, you may want to seriously check in to a mental institution. I just finished the movie (well watched the first 1 hr and 45 minutes and fast forwarded the last 35 minutes, missing absolutely nothing) and can officially say that I have spent the most pointless, wasteful, and idle 2 1/2 hours of my life. I've spent more valuable time taking craps on the toilet seat than watching this movie which could have easily been reduced to 5 minutes. Wow, I think I've lost at least 90% of my sanity and 100% of my attention span after having sat in front of the screen, finishing up my entire box of cookies and reading an entire chapter on the Art of War (again, I missed nothing from the storyline). I think that probably the most exciting part during the movie was when I farted in the middle of one of the 10-minute scenes of a spacecraft slowly floating its way across the screen. Oh, well I do admit that the first sight of the monolith did raise my heart rate just a little bit...or maybe it lowered it. Whoa, I just realized I was that close to falling into cardiac arrest. Damn......Kubrick's theories might've been wrong about the extinction of the human species after all...FYI to the emotionally depressed and suicidal: Watch 2001: A Space Odyssey......</fullReview>

It was awful to watch such movie: music can give you Migraine especially the one near obelisk, very little dialogues, a lot of silence scenes, weak ending and a lot of mistakes. At first I was thinking maybe I am watching Planet of Apes or something, I do not know the purpose of such beginning, I think Kubrick Does not know that too. Maybe he wanted to make a longer movie but did not have any ideas what to begin with so he inserted some monkeys and scenery of desert. In addition the acting is terrible, dialogues are primitive, robot computer is very unrealistic. Also it should be a movie of 1 hour cutting all unnecessary scenes. However there are some things that I liked too, that kept me watching this weird movie to the end. Visual effects and details are very good for such year of production.

Where apes are somehow devolved humans and twinkling laser lights somehow bring you to what seems like an alternate dimension or reality. Today I have wasted two and a half hours of my time on a completely ridiculous, atrocious, and implausible movie. I was left awestruck at the ending with my brain puzzled and my eyes strained from the strobing laser lights flashing on the screen. OK well enough of this. So lets talk about the plot.

In about an hour into the movie it does show somewhat of a plot but renders it pointless by one of the most ridiculous movie endings I have ever seen. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a prime example of how the critics are sometimes completely different from the viewer. I'm guessing most critics would say that this movie has intellectual value but I think i've lost brain cells from watching this. 2001: A Space Oddyssey is a true test of your sanity.

That doesn't mean that reading the book before hand will guarantee that you enjoy the movie, though, as I read the book, knew what was happening in the movie, and still found the movie to be awful. I admit, however, that the film was creative and was a new experiment in filmmaking; unfortunately, that experiment failed. It is one of those movies that seems like it should be good just because of its inventiveness and its supposedly "masterful" director. The basic plot itself is good, but Kubrick tried to do too much with it, and in the process turned an intriguing story into an incomprehensible two hours of disjointed, frustrating, and boring film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And I quote from the back of the DVD packaging: "....Kubrick brought complex ideas to the screen with astounding immediacy through dazzling special effects that won a much deserved Academy Award. Moving from the prehistoric birth of intelligence to the emergence of man as pure thought, "2001" is a remarkable achievement--'a quantum leap in quality over any sci-fi film ever made.'"Let us pause for a moment to ponder some key points in that blurb. 1. "complex ideas...with astounding immediacy" - I have no doubt that Kubrick was a very intelligent man, and that in this film he strove to bring complex ideas to the screen. And I can safely say that this film qualifies as a movie, in that it consists of pictures that move. But to be described as "brought...to the screen with astounding immediacy," the said idea must be represented in some way that makes it either inescapable, urgent, or felt. I began this movie with an open mind, knowing that this is a movie of images, wanting always to ask myself why Kubrick chooses to show us the images he does. I finished the movie in the same state--I experienced no particularly strong emotional reaction to it besides utter confusion, and could fathom no answers to my repeated "Why?" 2. "dazzling special effects" - No question there. The effects for this movie were superior to those in Star Trek IV--a movie that was released 18 years later and had a greater budget and had the added benefit of the availability of the Industrial Light and Magic effects studio. 3. "to the emergence of man as pure thought" - Oh? So that's what that whole sequence at the end was about? The movie should have had the disclaimer: "This movie contains some images which may not be suitable for children, as they are realistic depictions of the experiences of an LSD user." The sad fact is that I could never have surmised from the images that the movie gave me that the movie's conclusion regarded man's ultimate destiny or "the emergence of man as pure thought." Experiencing this movie is akin to being shown a series of ink blots and asked, "What do you see?" Perhaps my worldview is different from Kubrick's; I'm not sure. But I do know that I was not moved, intellectually or emotionally, to any profound contemplations. Or perhaps my mind is not so willing to see profundity in a parade of plot less, characterless scenarios and psychedelic imagery as so many minds seem to be. Maybe this film had a logic all its own that I missed; maybe I'm just someone who is moved to genuine emotion by genuine emotion. But to me this movie lacked any semblance of sequential logic, and was certainly without genuine human emotion.In order to entertain myself during the movie, I began to guess aloud at what the images meant or were intended to provoke. This speculation, to my mind, bore a remarkable resemblance to Mystery Science Theater 3000. I will thus always remember "2001: A Space Odyssey" as the movie in which I said the words, "In space, nobody can hear you....fart."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning! Do not see this movie unless you're planning to waste more than two hours of your life. This has (without doubt) to be one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. If you're still going to watch this, then just remember that you can easily skip the first 25 minutes, because they add nothing of interest except from some great background music by Strauss. The first 15 minutes or so,.for example, is just a bunch of scenes with some apes in a prehistoric environment, and is totally pointless. To be more general about it, the movie has no point at all. It has way too many scenes that last way too long. The plot is boring nearly all the way. There was some hope for it at a moment in the movie, but nothing exciting happened after all. The ending is also incredibly stupid and a really strange one. This is not a movie. This is total garbage and an insult to all the movie fans out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I usually do not comment the movies I come here to vote, but I have to make an exception on this one. The simple fact that this is a Stanley Kubrick film based on a book by Arthur C. Clark does not make it wonderful. I do not get the 8,3 average.Are people simply too afraid to disagree with the majority of people or has boring become exciting and vice versa. I might enjoy this movie if it would be available in an unabridged version which would probably be 10 to 15 minutes long. For the most part of the movie there's nothing going on (and I don't wanna hear any more of that "it's beautiful and artistic etc." stuff, 'cause in my humble opinion a movie is supposed to be entertaining.) Boring scenes about nothing after another with some dialog in the middle and absolutely no plot at all sums up the whole movie.Waste of time (and a good two and a half hours of it too). It's not worth the one star, but since i cannot give it a zero...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't be fooled. The emperor is naked. And a total fraud.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's just get one thing straight: The only reason I've given this film 1 star is because the option for none isn't available. This film makes me feel ill. Here's why.You can bandy around all the 'before-its-time' and 'visionary' platitudes you like, but the simple fact is that this film has no plot, its actors are on autopilot, its themes could have been drummed up by a four-year-old, and it's all directed with the kind of pomposity with which Stanley Kubrick was terminally afflicted."Kubrick? Pompous?" I hear you cry. "But what about The Shining? What about A Clockwork Orange? What of Doctor Strangelove?"Well, let's see. The Shining is good, but only for one reason - Jack Nicholson. Without his quiet madness and eventual raving, axe-wielding, snarling, cackling insanity, this film would just be an hour and a half of slow tracks through corridors broken up by scenes of people you couldn't give a damn about.A Clockwork Orange? Boring. The book is superior (as was The Shining, now I think about it). Humourless, dull, meaningless and dangerously close to juvenilia. Fourteen-year-old boys love this because people get hurt with sticks and there are boobs in it.Doctor Strangelove? Ah. Now I come to a problem, because Strangelove is a great film. However, I make no apology for saying that it's a great film DESPITE Kubrick, not BECAUSE of him. Peter Sellers is excellent in all three of his roles, George C. Scott is an acting powerhouse, and Sterling Hayden is a joy. The story is from a novel by Peter George. Kubrick brings nothing to the party.So, I think it's fair to say that Kubrick is a mediocre director with delusions of grandeur who rode to stardom on the back of exceptional performances from actors far better than he deserved. He wasn't a visionary. He was a hack.Now, back to 2001: Overrated Excrement. Sorry, I meant A Space Odyssey. That's another thing: comparing this dross to The Odyssey is like trying to make people believe 'Ernest Saves Christmas' is on a cultural par with Alfred Lord Tennyson.I started out a few paragraphs ago trying to explain why this film is so bad. Let me try again. There are a few themes in this, but they really boil down to these visionary gems: 1. People are bad to each other. 2. Technology is evil. 3. There is more in the universe than we can see.Hmm. Even in 1968 these theories were old hat. So, needless exploration of thoroughly explored themes aside, why else is this film pathetic? Well, the acting is sub-par for one. Keir Dullea's performance as Dave the Astronaut was practically non-existent. The film would have been much the same if he'd been replaced by a houseplant. Possibly better. And he was the protagonist. The film had to hinge on him and a computer, apparently voiced by somebody on massive amounts of lithium. Understated and slowly unnerving or just dull? I know which one I think. I like slow burners. I much prefer the build-up of tension to the shoddy action fluff made famous by the Bruckheimer/Affleck pairing, but this film has no tension. It has no build-up. It has nothing. The oft-heralded special effects are nothing special, even allowing for the thirty-five year time gap. The universally fawned-over shot of the bone turning into the spaceship actually made me embarrassed at its ineffectiveness. It was definitely amateur-hour at Stanley's house when they cobbled that together. The use of classical music is decidedly underwhelming. The 'Ballet In Space' scene with the ships spinning around each other set to Strauss's Blue Danube Waltz looks like an episode of Battlestar Galactica with the wrong soundtrack. Frank Poole floating off into space after being killed By HAL looks like a little plastic action figure being flushed down the toilet. The ape at the beginning who hurls the afore-mentioned bone into the air looks like a hired strippogram. Pathetic. Absolutely pathetic.You know what? I've had enough of reviewing this rubbish. It doesn't deserve a detailed critique. It deserves to be put out of its misery with a hammer to the temple.I can't urge you strongly enough not to waste your precious time on this god-awful film. I hate it with a passion born not of misunderstanding, but adherence to the idea that a film should not, under any circumstances, be a chore to watch through virtue of its extreme tediousness and pomposity. I stuck through this until the end (even past the ludicrous ending that lasted for about four hours) and gave it every chance to redeem itself. At the end, I sat back, disgusted, and felt a deep sense of gratitude that Stanley Kubrick had gone to a better place - a place where he couldn't do this type of damage again.This film is utterly without merit. Kubrick should be ashamed, and so should you for watching it. If you haven't watched it yet (and I sincerely hope you haven't), please, please, please don't do it. I'd rather you watch Affleck than this drivel.Well, perhaps not, but you get the idea.</fullReview>

Clarke.Thankfully there were some good moments with suspense. Especially when HAL went crazy and started hunting the spaceship's crew. But everything else is an absolute waste of time and nerves. Or a good way to replace sleeping pills... I don't care if Kubrick loves listening to waltz as a background for two or three fake looking spaceshuttle/ship/base models moving with a millimeter per minute - for most people it is boring to death.I hoped that at least the ending would be better than the rest, but it turned out to be far less intriguing than the one in the book and did not carry to the screen any of the ideas it had to. In the context of the film it was meaningless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is the point?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit I've always been curious about this film as The Shining really impressed me and turned me instantly into a Kubrick fan. As for Arthur C. Clarke I have been a big fan of his since I read his Rama novels (anyone whose never heard of them or never read them I highly recommend you do so immediately). Coupled with the fact this is supposedly an epic and one of the best films ever made meant I was determined to see it but somehow never got round to it. Well I eventually watched it today and I have to ask what was the point? I kind of got the idea of what was going on but found the whole thing pointless. From the apes at the beginning (the most drawn out boring piece of cinema in history) to the whole idea of the monoliths just utterly bored me senseless. Don't get the idea that I'm an action addict and too shallow to enjoy a thought provoking film, I love something I can get my head round but this was just awful. As for the special effects I find it hard to believe Kubrick was not on LSD when he made this it's just absolutely ridiculous. In future if I want a sci-fi film I'll stick to the likes of The Matrix, Minority Report or my all time favourite The Abyss. If I want thought provoking cinema I'll stick with The Shawshank Redemption , Road To Perdition or even The Green Mile. Each to their own opinion though this is just mine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an awful movie. It starts with two gangs of silly people dressed up as monkeys fighting each other. One morning they see a dark boulder in front of their boulder surrounded burrow, and they get frightened and make silly gestures and growl loudly towards that particular boulder; later, one gang discovers the weapon in form of a leg bone, and they kill the rival gang's leader with the bones.Then, one of the dressed-as-monkey guys throws his weapon up in the air, and the audience is thrown into the future, where all nations live in peace, and a bunch of silly people wear silly costumes and hats, sit on silly armchairs, presumably suck all sorts of juices as food and limp on the corridors of nausea causing rotating "space stations". Oh, and a daddy speaks with his daughter on a video phone with the moon spinning wildly out the cabin's window.All this happens over 30 minutes time span, not much heh ?After watching the scene with 2 men and 2 women chatting seated on some silly chairs, and one woman having to physically pull her panties out of her butt through her skirt as she stands up, I had to bear yet another sight of this time a limping stewardess carrying food, wearing a huge piece of underwear pushing through her trousers while she wastes about 2 minutes of film just to switch direction, left and upside-down (dont ask why would it be necessary to have a stewardess climb the ceiling in order to serve u a juice in the future) - 7 or 8 minutes of her limping in total.So i gave up watching the rest of the movie, and instead switched to watching Alien for the nth time, with lieutenant Ripley facing an Alien threat wearing decent underwear at least.Tho i wonder what happened with the cat, and what was its relevancy in the movie.</fullReview>

I figured we would see ridiculous flying cars, jet packs, meal in a pill, talking robots, etc. Then I figured I was gonna write a review here talking about how wrong they were (since the year 2001 has already happened and it was nothing like that)and recommend it just for a laugh. Here's how it really went. I popped it in the player and to my surprise it just looked like a fake documentary about monkeys with a couple of guys in really fake looking monkey costumes. Kind of like Planet of the Apes. 5 minutes in: Still monkeys (no narration or anything either). 10 minutes in I asked myself "How are they going to stretch this out for a whole stupid movie?!" I will never know. Because when a monkey threw a bone up in the air so high that it went into space and morphed into a rocket-ship I was done with this garbage. Who on earth would predict the year 2001 would be like that!? I returned it shortly after that and rented Mortal Kombat 2 which was way more realistic with better fighting. In conclusion, you would be much better off renting a documentary about apes, or even Gorillas in the mist, or maybe Planet of the Apes which this movie is trying to be. AVOID!! Later.</fullReview>

I am in a small minority of film savvy people who believe that Kubrick's use of time represents a self-indulgence matched only by Terence Malick. Watching anything Kubrick made after "Paths of Glory" is akin to watching paint dry, including "Full Metal Jacket" and (to a lesser extent) "The Shining". Think of "Barry Lyndon" . . .

That was 2 weeks! First of the beginning... a bunch of monkey jumping around. Well OK, but for 13 minutes? And what are tapers doing in middle of the desert? Next off the spaceships with Blue Dan Eu, couldn't they have written their own music? There are no words to describe how slow this movie is. With the stuff they had in it, it should have been ten minutes long! Oh HAL might have had his moments, but his death was the most boring thing ever. No music, just Daisy, and that was bad because computers can't sing. The flying colors at the end, oh ouch. I know most of it was landscape negatives, but you only had to show one to get your point across. It strains the eyes so much, that me and my friends that I was watching it with all had headaches. The ending also doesn't make sense... or maybe my brain was just gone after watching all those flying colors.The more I hear how this movie was such an epic, the more I want to scream.

		<fullReview>ADDITIONAL GOOFS:CONTINUITY: When David is opening the hatch to the Logic Memory Center, he is using his right arm, but on the close up of the hatch sign, he is using his left arm.CONTINUITY: Sometimes HAL's eye is on the front of the pod, and sometimes it isn't. My guess... Mr. Kubrick wanted to minimize attention to the eye. But, when it is seen, it is not consistent between close and far angles.REVEALING MISTAKES: When David enters the emergency airlock, the suspension wires can be seen behind him. You can also see that the stunt man being blasted into the compartment is wearing a mask, then they cut to the actor.FACTUAL ERRORS: When David is blown into the emergency airlock, the pod door, explosively blown, should also have entered, along with associated debris. Also, the pod would have been thrusted away from the Discovery 1.FACTUAL ERRORS: Velcro cannot account for the counteracting of zero-gravity, as they walk around, lean, etc.CONTINUITY: Zippers seen on space suit on rear of legs in the dead astronaut floating sequence that are not on other suits. (For stunt suit?)REVEALING MISTAKE: Camera track is visible as David moves from the equipment stowage compartment into the pod bay. He has to carefully step between its "rungs."REBUTTALS TO LISTED GOOFS:Factual errors: When Dave opens the emergency airlock ... escaping debris also should have damaged the pod. (Explosive decompression debris.)Rebuttal: No explosive bolts were used for opening of the emergency airlock hatch. It was opened using the external controls. As to the escaping air from the airlock not happening, this can be explained by it having been previously evacuated from air ... a procedure that could have been required for all EVA.Continuity: The sphere of the Discovery is too small for all the rooms that are shown. Rebuttal:The size and numbers of rooms in the sphere can be explained by the fact that wide angle lenses were used, making the rooms appear much larger than they actually were. Adding to the deception, cameras are often placed outside of the "4th wall," making the room seem much larger than it is. All of the compartments fit perfectly into the sphere when mapped out. For example... the emergency airlock is very much less longer than it appears with the wide angle lens.Revealing mistakes: When Dr Floyd is first on the space station ... not radial to the curve of the floor. (Body position angles on space station.)Rebuttal: The persons seen are not far enough away from each other to allow for the differentiation in body angles to read. Also, it could also be explained by social behaviour, which would call for the individuals to lean and compensate when conversing. Continuity: The first pod that is lost ... Dave is seen emerging from the middle bay door with the third pod. (Apparent inconsistency in pod locations)Rebuttal:The juggling of pod positions can be explained by the fact that the astronaut would have used the pod at a later time, docking it to a different position in the pod bay.Continuity: In the 70mm version you can see passengers ... Dr. Floyd is the sole passenger. (Number in passengers seen inside the Orion craft.)Rebuttal:This can be explained by considering the fact that crew members, as in other scenes of the film, could be visiting the passenger's cabin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sorry, I hated this movie. Ok, sure it looked great back then, and sure, it has a lot of intellectual depth or what-not. The plain, simple fact of the matter is that this movie is not enjoyable to watch in any way. It is the most boring, long, drawn-out movie ever commited to film. This movie is beyond ridiculous. I just cannot find the words to describe how much of a boring film this is. Sure it makes sense in one way or another, but this is a movie, not a book. Movies are supposed to be enjoyable to watch. Gosh. I was disappointed. Sorry. 1/2 out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How I wish I could give this movie less than one star!! Boring, pretentious, badly-written, and totally undeserving to be in the top 100 movies of all time. I wanted HAL 9000 to kill everyone on board just so the movie would end and there would be no more suffering on my part. As for the ending, what in the world is that? Bright colors, stupid camera-work, and a floating baby, it was like the universe just went through a very messy and disappointing bowl movement. You would have to be not just be on one but several different types of hallucinogenic drugs to enjoy this movie. The YouTube video of Charlie biting his brother's finger had better direction and acting. I just want to add that the music by Strauss was wonderful, it does not deserve to be degraded by being in this travesty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick is a confused genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, after watching this movie, several thoughts struck me, none of them very good. This movie thins down to about 30 minutes of acting and storyline. The rest of the movie is lot of artist filler. I mean, how can Kubrick get away with 15 minutes of screen-saver tunnel graphics in the middle of a movie is beyond me. This movie is interrupted by slow, drawn out scenes that serve no purpose in either aesthetic value or emphasis on a thought or idea. I found it incredibly hard to patient wait for the slow scenes to end, like the half hour of apes, the 15 minutes of watching the little pod move around in space. I just don't connect with any meaning there.... This movie had unbelievable potential, and should have had more focus on storyline and less on the visual equivalent of watching paint dry.</fullReview>

The Space Station in this movie looked like they put a poorly furnished; 1960's-esq; office complex, gave it a warped (think Salvadore Dali meets Beige Land) look and made people dress in THE most bland beige boring outfits and told them to wander aimlessly in that mind numbing office!!!

		<fullReview>2001: a space odyssey, is a film that tries to show that man is moving too fast, in his race for easy living. It starts out with the supposed beginning of man-kind, a bunch of monkeys trying to learn together. This is one of the best known scenes in history, although it promotes evolutionism, an accepted "fact" in the sixties. This does have purpose though, to the story, as it shows how life "started out" for us, and this movie is supposed to show how life will end for us. It's purpose, truly, was to show that technology and advancement, will be the end of mankind. At the time it was made, it was considered to be genius, and that certainly, by the time 2001 came, computers would be smarter than humans (and would try to take over the world) But as we have seen, this isn't completely true. I found this film to be slightly pointless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On a scale from 1 to 10,a ten would not be enough for such a masterwork. 1968 was the definitive landmark for sci-fi movies.So innovative was the screenplay,so devastating were the pictures,so haunting was the score that Kubrik's movie took our breath away,mesmerizing us ,turning us into creatures in rapture,in awe .Some scenes are so admirable,so sublime,that they make you cry:remember the ape discovering the power of a tool,the spaceships floating while exotic "Blue Danube" is heard. This movie could go on four hours and hours ,no one would notice.One hundred years from now,future scholars will write exegesises of the bewildering finale.As vain and futile as the quest for the Holy Graal.Our connection to the movie is subliminal,the long "psychedelic" sequence comes as a perfect metaphor.Remember ,in Ingmar Bergman's "seventh seal",the lines :"questions are more important than the answers".Kubrick wanted the movie to stir something inside of us,to speak to our subconscious.And AC Clarke ,who co-wrote the screenplay mischievously added;"this is a fiction;reality will be certainly stranger". No sci-fi movie comes close to 2001:"star wars" does not really appeal to adults the same way ,by a long shot ."Close encounters",while aping some of Kubrik tricks,remains puerile and spoils everything by showing almost everything in its turgid finale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A wonderful film for model makers and special effects persons, this film is meat for pseudo-intellectuals and Clarke fans. The marriage of the writing talents of Kubrick (great) and Clarke (zero) total Zero. It was refreshing to see Leonard Rossiter in the film, but his magnificent talents were wasted here. Cheap Cinerama tricks abound, passing through the kaleidoscopic light show was terrible and the breathing sequences were similar to an obscene phone call. I've seen the film twice looking for some redeeming value, both times I was left with the feeling that I had been suckered and wasted my time.

		<shortDescription>Warning ! Do under NO circumstances see this film. It sucks !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is THE worst movie I have ever seen, and believe me - I have seen a lot of crappy movies ( like Ghostdog ). So what is so fundamentally wrong with this movie ? First of all I believe that a movie should tell a story, and this story should be compelling, realistic and fully understandable. This is where it fails. The movie doesn't tell a story. And it takes about 2,5 hours not telling this story. You could just as well just sit around and watch your TV when it's turned off. It's just as interesting.The movie begin with a bunch of monkeys jumping around. Then they jump around a black rock. Then they jump with a bone in their hands. This is the first 30 minutes of the movie ! Fortunately I have read the first 150 pages of the book, so I understood why they did all of this. But someone who has never read the book would never have a chance of understanding this.Then suddenly we're in space. And we spend 15 minutes watching a ship dock with a spacestation ( doing your laundry is more fun than this). After that there actually is a bit of a plot. We follow a guy as he travels to a spacestation on the moon, where they have found a new black rock that emits a powerful electromagetic radiation. After they have gone down to this rock, the plot make another leap to something totally different.Suddenly - without an explanation - we're on a ship that's headed for jupiter. There we spend over 1 hour watching a computer go a little nuts.After they find the third black rock we get to see 10 minutes of strange colors. Then it ends in someones strange livingroom.This movie is so slow, and wierd, and not to mention BAD - that it shouldn't be allowed to exist. The life is too short to watch this crap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most boring movie I have ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented "2001: A Space Odyssey" for the sole reason that my significant other is a Kubrick fan. Even he was baffled and bored to death by this movie. As with many Kubrick flicks, the plot moves excruciatingly slow to the point that one wonders if there actually is a plot. I'm still wondering half an hour after the movie is over. Why did they dump the idea of having a narrator? From reading other reviews, I can tell I wasn't the only person who couldn't make sense of this film.The movie starts out with an extended period of darkness. I had to check my DVD player to make sure it wasn't malfunctioning. Next, we're subjected to half an hour of monkey business. Then we get to watch spacecraft move through space at a painfully slow pace for God knows how long. I almost perked up at the first sight of a human being on-screen but there was still no dialogue. I could go on, but the rest of the movie is equally memorable. The only things that kept me awake for the last hour or so were the crazed facial expressions and pained yowls of my cat, who was literally listening to the movie (I am dead serious). Although I'm told this movie is best appreciated after multiple viewings, I don't dare subject my family or myself to it once again.If you're suffering from severe insomnia, "2001: A Space Odyssey" is your dream come true. If it's a philosophical space movie you're looking for, look under "Apollo 13."Rating: 1/10</fullReview>

It serves a very deep meaning I am certain but as to what that meaning is one can only grasp bits and pieces. With no real plot, wonderful acting,or stunning climax I found this film to be a 2 hour 30 minute waste of time. I do not mind symbolic film as long as it entertains, but not only did this not entertain, it flat out bored me to tears. After the first few minutes I found myself asking why they couldn't have gotten a real plot. A very disappointing film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all what was the comment about - is the worst ever SF movie ever made.The action - if there is an action - take place over 2 and half hour and if u would made it normally time (21 century) - u would see that the action takes about 5 minutes to take place.Is very boring the way it moves,sloooowwwwwwwwly like the watcher has all the time to see about 10 minutes as an astronaut gets out of the ship with a shuttle.I recommend if u want to watch this movie always to control your forward button and maybe u will be spared about the pain watching it. Second - it might have been greatest movie off all times but in the 70's. The effects and the details about 2 min per object maybe interested older guys,but now is not at all like this.I want to apologies to whom feel offended about saying this about one of their favorites movies but - Third off all - i think that the base is not updated correctly.I am not saying all of this because i spend over 2 hours trying to find why is on top 10 but i am saying cause i took your top as a good top. I think the administrators of the site should do also a top bye time,like for 10 years,and not to gather all the voting over here that are miss leading,making the movie one of the best of SF when now a days is one of the awful movie. And 4 - i think i will be banned from writing again a comment from the administrators,although they say i'll be blacklisted by the others viewers.In this time the human still controls the computers!!</fullReview>

Sure, the special effects were great, so why don't you all just find a good, reliable website about special effects and you can give this movie a ten THERE. This is a website about movies, and movies are much more than special effects. Much more! It's about the script (this movie had none), good acting (this movie had none), well-written dialogues (this movie had none), etc (this movie had none)... So, sure, I admit it! For a movie like this to be made in 1968 with such astounding special effects must have been a real front page issue. But do you really like it as a movie??? It is all special effects, and I even though agree that at the time these effects were actually special, how is anyone astonished by it after almost two and a half hours of absolutely nothing else. If someone gives me a good reason why this movie isn't just about special effects, I'll delete this post and sincerely congratulate you. G'luck, though!</fullReview>

After finishing the book I rented the movie and watched it with my family. By the middle of this movie was the only one still following the plot, a fact due only to the fact that I had read the story first. The characters were two-dimensional causing the story to fall flat on its face. It was the first time I have ever deemed a movie unworthy of the $.99 rental charge. Even coming from a mediocre book (this story has nothing on Heinlein or Amimov, the other 'grand masters' of science fiction at the time) this story could have been done so much better than it was.</fullReview>

Throughout this movie, there are many points where the awful skull ringing music and anesthetizing imagery are dragged out for long sections of the film that serve no actual purpose. Unless you like watching monkeys clamor and then subside around a big gray tower for 5 minutes (all the while the music continues to resonate against the inside of the viewer's skull).They call it an "art movie", but that's simply no excuse for producing a movie that has no actual entertainment value.Instead, see a better movie, perhaps one of the following:Battlefield Earth, Stealth, or Gigli.</fullReview>

I fail to see how anyone can be impressed with this - by leaving out any semblance of plot or progress, Kubrick has left the way open for a whole bunch of people to insert their own interpretations...I presume these are the same sort of people who can stare at a blank canvas and gush effusively about how it symbolizes the bleak emptiness of existence in the 20th century and other pretentious claptrap. Personally, I expect a bit more effort on the part of the person making the film. If I want to reflect on deep philosophical questions, I don't need a lumbering dinosaur of a film to act as a catalyst.I give it a 1, and recommend giving it a wide berth. Maybe it's possible to get an abridged version which would condense it down to include only the significant elements - that would be a tolerable 5 minutes or so, but in it's long form, forget it.</fullReview>

Instead, they dish up constructive comments like "if you don't get it, then I won't bother explaining it to you". Sophists used to apply such methods in order to make themselves seem wise. They would walk into a room and utter something completely unintelligible. Those who didn't understand it, believed that it had to be their own fault, as the sophists had already established a reputation for themselves. Also, they didn't want to ADMIT that they didn't understand it, as they believed it would make them look foolish. And so, what was in fact devoid of meaning began to be called "deep" and the word "mysterious" became positively laden. Well, I claim that 2001: A Space Odyssey is empty and meaningless. People have claimed otherwise, but no one has ever EXPLAINED otherwise. And surely the burden of proof must rest with them. Trying to disprove what has never been proven to begin with is a waste of time. It would be like attempting to disprove the existence of the easter bunny.</fullReview>

Kubric basically conflates sheer lugubrious (read: deadeningly slow) length of film with 'depth'(of meaning). He is more concerned with the perfection, exactness and pioneering of lenses, focal lengths and shots than with the necessary concerns for character or coherent narrative. His films are vacuous, he is myopic in his views and this film is the most overrated rubbish this side of creation.</fullReview>

I imagine they did this because of the basic lack of a plot, so they tried to draw it out. Confusing, uninteresting, boring and unoriginal are all words to describe 2001. I would highly suggest you do something more prosperous with your two hours. 2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pathetically boring movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is probably the most over-rated and over-hyped movie I have ever seen. The very beginning of the movie - with monkeys howling on-and-on-and-on-and-on-and-on forever, it seems - sets the tone for the rest of this movie. There is almost no point to this movie...a very basic story-line (which might have been original 30 years ago, when it was made) and nothing exciting ever happens. Hardly any dialogue and in fact, if you see the second half of the movie in fast-forward mode, you will not lose anything at all. Overall, a completely boring movie!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember that several people told me that this movie was great. If I ever meet them again, there are going to be words.I can never understand why people enjoy this movie. It's boring, dull, lifeless and the ending has no payoff. The only highlight is the beginning, where all the monkeys start beating each other down with bones. Now THAT'S a movie! Every time they play this on television, I watch that scene, then try to catch a re-run of Doctor Who (Sci-fi can't get better then the Doc!)Every time I express my humble opinions about this movie, every one wants to know why I think it's boring. I want to know who thinks this is exciting. "HAL closed the door, we have to run ten feet to get to the next one!" 20 minutes of floating around later... "We made it, just in time! Hey, is that a monolith?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Style over substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've often thought that the late Stanley Kubrick, while perhaps a visionary in his own eccentric right, was also one of the greatest violators of the style over substance concept. Take "The Shining" for example, a film where style so clearly overpowers substance. Sure it scares you out of your wits, but there's no real depth or substance in it, just Jack Nicholson's gleefully go for broke performance. "2001: A Spacey Odyssey", on the other hand, is an epic science fiction masterpiece that ultimately goes nowhere (like the Phantom Menace or Attack of the Clones). Starting with the beginning of man, then man's exploration of space, and finally, man going on the ultimate journey after his ship's super-computer betrays him. The film's technical execution is superb, but the story is flat and passionless. The music, that classic anthem, is more memorable than the actual film. Followed by a more emotionally involving sequel - "2010", starring Roy Scheider and John Lithgow. "Open the pod bay doors, HAL." - Dave"I'm sorry, Dave. I can't do that." - HAL</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On second thought, please don't. This is a movie with three plots, all of which have the potential of going somewhere, but don't. The first plot: Discovery of something that causes a colony to lose contact with base. The second plot: A computer running a space ship decides to go homicidal. The third plot: On a mission to Saturn, an astronomer encounters a different dimension? This movie is supposed to be an artistic movie, but instead it becomes annoying when halfway through you have to listen to sustained and muffled breathing for an extended period of time during which the plot crawls forward at a snails pace. Toward the end there are flashing colors and irritating scrawling noises that are supposed to be special effects. For as much respect as I have for 'A Clockwork Orange', Stanley Kubrick fails to meet his own standards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the most boring movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hired this movie expecting it to live up to its great rating, I was extremely disappointed. The only two things that weren't bad in the film were the music and the visual effects. These can hardly make up for this horrific piece of junk. If you like slow movies (everything moves at 0.01km/hr here)than you might find some interesting scenes. I had to laugh at the comment made on the back of the video box: "...it will likely excite, inspire and enthrall for generations." I would describe it as the exact opposite. The script: the start of the movie has a blank screen playing dull music for about 5 minutes. Then you get to watch some monkeys walking around, drinking some water and yelling. Which is supposed to show the dawn of man. Now its into the 21st century and you get to watch very slow spaceships moving, people walking around, funny colours and stars for two hours. BORING. I did like the computer, HAL-9000, cool idea. My advice is to not go near this film and watch 'Star Wars' or even 'Star Trek' instead. Please note this is my opinion of 2001: A Space Odyssey. I am only 15 and am happy to read any comments people wish to make. Write to pixy_989@hotmail.com</fullReview>

All you can tell for sure is that the space ship computer malfunctioned, killed all but one astronaut and the survivor unplugged it. The rest is a menagerie of confusing visual effects. There was no protracted battle between the surviving astronaut and the computer, which would have proved interesting (ie. a man vs machine struggle pitting man's creativity and brilliance against the machine's iron logic, raw calculating ability and huge database of technical knowledge). Instead we have a short struggle which ends predictably with the man unplugging the computer. It's a yawner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A space ODYSSEY ???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Odyssey by Homer is one of the early masterpieces of art/literature. It's bold, to say the least, to name this movie after it. I'm not shocked nor disgusted by the ending. I wouldn't mind how slowly this movie moves on (well, not much), I would accept the musical score and the lack of action. I wouldn't miss an intelligent plot and the usual kind of acting, if this product wouldn't be so shallow in regard of philosophic content and "meaningfullness". The floating of the spaceships in space and effects like those are quite well done, but what is shown here was NOT ahead of its time. For instance, revolving, ring- shaped space- stations as a concept had been proposed decades before the making of this movie. Even the furniture (remember the conference with the Russians), that was supposed to help to induce a sense of futurism in the average viewer, was just contemporary stuff (or derived from it). Science fiction authors had already written very thoughtful short stories and novels about the possibility of artificial intelligence, its evolution (perhaps independently from the developers) and the eventual consequences to mankind. The computer in this movie is a very simple schematic "bad guy" in comparison.All the other stuff about the "black box(es)" seems to be not much more than empty mysticism. Thinking that the age of enlightenment was about 200 years ago... Why was this movie made? The "2001..." project was started with a couple of years after Kennedy made his announcement about "conquering" the moon. "2001..." can be seen as part of the efforts to awaken and keep up the public interest in the so called "race to the moon". (I do not say that the American people NEEDED to be pushed to accept the enormous costs of the Apollo- program). However, from a documentary I have seen I take it, that many spectators were very impressed, especially when watching "...space odyssey" put on extra large screens by 70mm- projectors. The mystic content might have even been pointed to people, who expected the Apollo astronauts would pass an old man with a beard (or an old woman, or who or what ever), trying to deliver a surrogate. Just guessing..."Noise proves nothing. Often a hen who has merely laid an egg cackles as if she had laid an asteroid. ... Truth is the most valuable thing we have. Let us economize it. ...

		<fullReview>This is the most boring movie ever made, and the only list i would put it on is the most overrated films ever alongside everything else from Kubrick, Kurosawa, and Pulp Fiction(not bad, but not very good either). The entire film is spent on watching spaceships cross the screen through space, SLOWLY, with some score which is the only good thing in the movie really. The story is PATHETIC, people say this is so creative and meaningful, the entire story can be summed up in ONE word, evolution, thats the whole story, if you think this movie has any other meaning please tell me, so i can laugh at you, and then there's the giant chocolate bar and the bighead baby which has just adds to the ridiculousness of this mess. Then there's the annoyance factor, try sitting through 20 mins of beeping, or sum other random noise, that gives you a headache, and then Kubrick and his idiocy, does 4 more times. The performances are atrocious, talk about wooden, apparently they're supposed to be that way, but the real reason is Kubrick cant direct. The Matrix is a creative entertaining film, that is the best Sci fi film, this abundantly overrated pile of crap is just that. O yeah by the way, a clockwork orange isn't a movie its a porno, not even a good one. 0 out of a 10 for this and Kubrick, id give him a negative but since anyone who reads reviews of this is probably a fan of that moron, and wouldn't understand the concept since they've gotten so dumb from watching his films more then once and actually enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For its time, the visual and audio magnificence of this film has never differed, even if there is not much story, it is still an inspirational film from Oscar nominated director Stanley Kubrick (A Clockwork Orange, Full Metal Jacket). The film opens with the fantastic iconic theme score, Richard Strauss's "Thus Spoke Zarathustra" as the planets move. This then moves to "The Dawn of Man" where a tribe of prehistoric apes/primates engaging in regular activities, before finding the black rectangular monolith and learning to use bones as weapons. The tossed bone image matches the next hour and a half in outer space, starting with all space crafts (including the cart wheel one) orbiting to the score of Johann Strauss's "Blue Danube Waltz". The story seems to be the members of Discovery 1, with the treacherous brain of the ship, HAL 9000 (voiced by Douglas Rain) have found the mysterious monolith, and the mission is ruined by the evil betrayal and disobeying of HAL. After the lone survivor Dave (Keir Dullea) has got into HAL's central core, and killed him, he is taken through Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite, i.e. a colourful vortex before finding his own self ageing before the monolith, and becoming the "Star Child". Also starring Gary Lockwood as Dr. Frank Poole and William Sylvester as Dr. Heywood R. Floyd. It won the Oscar for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Writing, Story and Screenplay - Written Directly for the Screen, and it won the BAFTAs for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography and Best Sound Track, and it was nominated for Best Film and the UN Award for Kubrick. HAL 9000 was number 13 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes &amp; Villains, the film was number 40 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, it was number 78 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes ("Open the pod bay doors, HAL."), it was number 6 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die, it was number 47 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers, it was number 22 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, and it was number 27 on The 100 Greatest Films.

		<fullReview>Why is this movie so overrated? It almost always is listed among the greatest movies ever made and I once again ask WHY? First, I need to point out that I am a bright, well-read and highly educated person. So, yes, I did understand the imagery and "hidden significance" of the movie. Despite this, I still MUST point out that the first 9 hours (yes, I know it WASN'T that long--but it seemed like it was) of people dancing around in primordial human/ape costumes was awful and the end was an artsty-fartsy mess (one minute Keir Dullea was flying through space, the next he was an old man in a sterile room and the next he was a giant embryo--wow, how stupid can you get?).Despite my warnings, I seem to be one of only a few voices who hated the movie (though it does get 5 stars for SOME of the music and great special effects). I don't understand everyone's fascination with Stanley Kubrick. Yes, Paths of Glory was excellent as were Spartacus and Dr. Strangelove, but movies like 2001 as well as Barry Lyndon (STERILE, LONG and DULL) and Clockwork Orange (over-indulgent and sick as it portrays rapes and violence) make me think about the story of the Emporer's New Clothes. In essence, people fall over themselves praising his "artistic genius", while the average person finds some of his films often give them headaches!The only positive about the film that make it a possible must-see is that it helped to raise the genre of sci-fi to a new and more artistic level--but it certainly DIDN'T make sci-fi fun or interesting!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001 is a movie that stirs up polemical opinions . You almost certainly love it or hate with no one having an opinion that falls into the middle ground . Ironically enough I gave it 5/10 which indicates I thought this movie is average . I didn't think it was an average movie - I thought it was a pile of pretentious pseudo intellectual garbage and a cinematic update of the parable about the Emporers New ClothesWhat is there to enjoy about this movie narrative wise ? The first half hour is taken up with men in gorilla suits jumping around a studio exterior throwing bones about , a sort of chimps tea party on tranquilizers while the last half hour is taken up with a man pulling funny faces inside a psychedelic disco . Neither of these segments features dialogue so this is a movie that is impossible to follow story wise . And before anyone sends me a message to explain what 2001 is about let me tell you I'm not interested , and besides you're probably only kidding yourself if you think it's about anything . It's something to stare at after you've inhaled a joint , that's what its function is - Eye candy for the stoned Technically the movie deserves much credit since the cinematography is rather impressive as are all the aspects involving sound: mix , editing etc . The voice of HAL is very haunting and memorable and remained in this reviewer's head long after seeing 2001 and contributed to me not giving the movie a much lower mark . But it's still a movie that has a reputation that it doesn't deserve and is long , dull , pretentious and most of all unentertainingFive out of ten</fullReview>
