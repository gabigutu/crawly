		<shortDescription>One of the finest movies of the decade.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gattaca is a brilliant under-rated piece of cinema that the not-too-distant future will, in retrospect, see it as one of the more outstanding movies of the nineties. It is prolific, stylish, thought-provoking, and one of the few recent science fiction movies that totally foregoes special effects and does it well.There is nothing about Gattaca that I didn't like. It is a subtle piece of art that reminds of the writing of Ray Bradbury. Technology (the core element of science fiction) is only the backdrop for the story of a man who goes against all odds, including his brother, and overcomes those odds.Make sure you watch it more than twice. There are many subtle details that you'll miss if you don't (ie, Gattaca's doctor asks, "Have I ever told you about my son?" not even five minutes into the movie, and childhood Vincent falls down holding a toy rocket...) and it's these small details that create a tapestry of cinematic artistry.The soundtrack is phenomenal. The sets are noir and stylistic, and (thankfully) instead of trying to present a realistic physical future Niccol instead vies for the FEELING of the future: constrained, restricted, and patterned.Watch it before it's cool to have watched it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thoughtful Science Fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gattaca is in many ways the best film I have seen about prejudice. Just as people have been judged for centuries by the color of their skin, Gattaca predicts that in the future there will be a more subtle discrimination. It being a science fiction film helps make it more effective by allowing us to feel the emotions of the characters with little of our own history getting in the way. A haunting musical score goes well with the feeling of the film.Ethan Hawke as Vincent does a fine job showing the pain of someone whose life is limited before he even tries. But just as interesting were the supposedly superior characters; Vincent's girlfriend, brother and double who suffer from the lie that genetics can perfectly predict a person's life.The film that Gattaca most reminds me of is Blade Runner. They are both about genetic engineering gone very wrong but Gattaca takes a very different approach. The problems are more subtle in Gattaca involving our own desires for success for ourselves and through our children. Amazingly, Gattaca is a good science fiction film with a small budget, few special effects and mostly filmed in existing modern buildings.After seeing this film for a second time I liked it even better as the plot seemed more plausible. If you would like to see a sci-fi film that is based on interesting characters and situations and not explosions or special effects, try Gattaca.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most underrated movie of the 90's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is incredible--yet the only ones who seemed to like it when it came out are the type whose favorite movie is "True Lies". It became critically ignored, which I can not understand at all. The themes of this movie-of superiority/inferiority, of identity, of destiny, they're all there. For those of you that haven't seen this movie, it is about a eutopian society where the highest ranks work at a space program named Gattaca. Vincent (Ethan Hawke) has wanted to work there since he was a child, but since his parents did not "pre-order" him, he was born inferior (a 99 % chance of heart failure by the age of 30, physical and mental problems, etc. ) to his "ordered" brother Antoine. Vincent has always seen something in a rival in his brother, because his brother is their dad's favorite, and he seems to have everything going for him. Vincent's job is as a janitor at Gattaca, with the hope that he will get in some day, but all the have to do is get a fingerprint of Vincent's, or a blood sample, or anything, and they know all about him, his profile, his life expectancy, etc. No one will hire Vincent because he is so liable to damage. One day, though, he hires someone to turn his identity into Eugene's, (Jude Law) an olympic-swimming, high potential winner who has everything you would need to get anywhere-except he comes back from a trip a paralyzed cripple from the waist down. So Vincent makes a deal with Eugene-Vincent gets Eugene's identity if Vincent pays the rent and gives him a companion. Everything works to plan, and Vincent borrows Eugene's fingerprints, blood samples, haircut, even urine samples. He even meets Irene (Uma Thurman) a sexy female worker at Gattaca who takes a shine to Vincent (who she thinks is Eugene). Until one day......Gattaca is a great visual movie (it was nominated for the best art direction oscar but lost to Titanic), rides strong on very good performances by Ethan Hawke and Jude Law, and is definitely worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mind enriching movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first heard of this movie while in Europe where it was called `Welcome to Gattaca'. I was unable to view it at the movies there so rented it when I came to the US. I was very impressed with this movie and I might say that I was even surprised for the better. I was expecting it to be good, but it was even better than I thought.I enjoy movies that require you to think or that have deeper meanings for those who look for them, and this movie was full of such hidden treasures. The script is very multileveled and will not disappoint anyone unless they are looking for Hollywood style sex and violence scenes.Another great quality of this movie behind its thought provoking script is that it is very timeless. It could have been written for a century ago or for a couple centuries from now and it would still fit in with minor technological changes.This film was really an excellent film whether you look at the cast, which was very well composed, or the cinematography, which was breathtaking. When the movie is finished the script leaves you thinking and your mind races on different tangents for a long while after the movie is over. There is no void or `why did I waste 2 hours sitting in front of a plastic box' at the end. If you like to think and like good acting do rent this movie, it will be well worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply one of the most beautiful movies ever conceived!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will keep this short. This is most certainly one of the best films of all time. Script is wonderful, cinematography brilliant, Actors perform to a T, and the underlying message is one that all mankind should take to heart, for this great movie about human perseverance and will, and how real a situation in the world like this could be. 10 out of 10 bottom line. If you don't see this movie you will be committing a crime against yourself. Also the relationship between Vincent and Gerome and his brother is brought together perfectly and well developed. For that matter all of the characters in this film bring a little something different to the table that you will see very rarely in any film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uses science fiction to explore ideas, and reveal some depths of the human spirit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"There is no gene for the human spirit." This is the TAG line of the movie Gattaca, a film that searches deep within the heart of man. This is one of Ethan Hawke's strongest performances as a man who refuses to trust the odds, and relies on fate and sheer will to achieve his dreams. He borrows the body of a man without dreams, played by Jude Law in his best performance to date as well. Law simply captures every scene with his sly intelligence and deeply darkened soul. He has no illusions about life, or himself, and he is the perfect counterpoint to Hawke's unrelenting dreamer.The performances only enhance, however, a wonderful script by first time writer/director Andrew Niccol. It deals with science fiction and the future in the best way, by exploring ideas. He quickly and easily presents a future not unimaginable, and truly existing in a "not-too-distant future." Genetic engineering is happening today all the time in areas outside the human species, and sometimes within. How long will it take before the gloves are taken off and science truly starts to decide the type of people humanity will become? What issues will be addressed when that time comes? Niccol addresses many of them already, mostly dealing with the discrimination that would probably take place in society. The most subtle and yet important question he asks though is whether a man is truly the sum of his genes, or could his spirit somehow carry him beyond all expectations? Such thoughts are dealt with through intelligent characters given intelligent diolague and placed with intelligent situations. It is interesting how such a thoughtful picture can be at time a real thriller to watch as well.Gattaca is one of my favorite movies because it is not afraid to address important issues that are truly current in modern day society, and do it with great thought and heart. It wisely stresses the subtle theological questions of whether man ought to tamper with God's work, and whether the result would be a better society, or a better humanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my all-time favorite films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Andrew Niccol's Gattaca, in my humble opinion, is at the pinnacle of the motion picture art form. All aspects of the production serve the story spectacularly. The retro-style art direction, script, acting, music, and lighting all brought to life, much too chillingly, a cold and soulless world where the content of your genes counted for everything while the content of your character counted for nothing. Watching Ethan Hawke's (Great Expectations, Hamlet) Vincent evade the relentless pursuit of the authorities while pining to be on the Titan mission, romancing Irene (Uma Thurman), and micro-managing his samples from Jerome (Jude Law in a very impressive supporting turn) made for some the most riveting viewing ever. This story highlights the negative side of pursuing the eugenic ideal, an ideal that is not an unworthy pursuit, but one that must be approached with the utmost caution since its seekers hope to master a realm once the sole domain of the Divine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pity I didn't know anything about this movie when it came out in 97, I would've enjoyed watching it in the big screen instead of on my laptop screen. I've never been more inspired by any movie. This is an absolutely beautiful piece of art, from the scenery, the colours, everything. Ethan Hawke is fast becoming one of my favourite actors. His performance always lift me up. I know he almost play similar roles every time, i'll like him to play a different role actually, but in every movies he starred in (Dead poet's society, Great Expectations etc) i found that i always cared for his character and his performances never failed to touch me. Jude law is amazing as Jerome Morrow, I thought Uma thurman's character should be more developed, but she's perfect as irene. 8 out of 10. There's no gene for the human spirit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's the little things that tell you you've found quality!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this film cold at the video store -- and was very pleasantly surprised with a very well done movie. If you don't know anything else about Gattaca, the less you know, the better. Stop reading this review right now, go watch it, and come back when you're done!It was after my first viewing of the film that several little details dawned on me:1) The term "borrowed ladder" is a utterly-brilliantly-conceived bit of future slang that carries a *double meaning*. I'm still amazed that the producers didn't make more of this. Instead, they were content to leave this gem to be discovered by the thinking and missed by the vast masses. I was very definitely impressed. 2) As I was explaining the film to my wife, it occurred to me in mid-explanation that this is really a film that has to do with what is properly called =eugenics=; one of the things the Nazis were about. Then my mind wandered to word etymologies: I recalled that the name "Eugene" = "well born." And then I realized...!!!3) It's interesting the extent to which so many of the characters in the film *didn't* live up to their genetic destiny, one way or another.4) Because I hadn't seen any previews, I had no immediate reference for where the name "Gattaca" had come from. And then I suddenly realized...!!!5) It wasn't until I watched the movie the second time that I caught the effects with the title sequence letters...Now I had figured out by this time that there were likely to be other intriguing little details I've missed, so I was fascinated to read from another reviewer here about the boy Vincent falling with a toy rocket in his hand. I wonder what else is in there?All in all, this is a very well written, tightly woven movie. Seen cold, with no real prior knowledge of the film, it came off as a tremendous science-fiction SUSPENSE THRILLER. There were several scenes that just had me climbing the walls with tension. Fabulous job!And I'm not the only one who thinks so. When my WIFE says she wants to see a SCIENCE FICTION movie for the SECOND TIME... well, I don't think THAT has EVER happened before!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a bit cool and creepy, but slow and too self-conscious to really make a dent.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gattaca (1997)An interesting concept, with terrific set design, and some headliner talent. Overall the plot dragged, and in a way, once you got the idea, it started to flatline, as if the variables of what might happen were limited. In fact, some of the outcomes were almost laughable because they were trying so hard to pull some heartstrings and wrap the thing up in a story-telling way. The parallels of the lift-off and the incineration, so calmly done, and the second swimming contest at night are both ludicrous if only because they are so heavy-handed.Not that there aren't interesting aspects all along. It's not a boring movie, just stretched thin. It lacks atmosphere the way Solaris (2002) or 2001 (1968) have atmosphere, but it is paced in the same deliberate way (almost). Not that it intends such weighty philosophical poetry. No, Gattaca is a sort of reach for the stars movie, out to remind us that humans are the best, flaws are part of perfection, and romance only goes so far. Ethan Hawkes is fine in this, and so is Uma Thurman, but since everyone is supposed to be a bit machine-like, we can't expect highly emotional performances, even when they are making love (not shown). Alan Arkin certainly gets the post-modern detective award, wearing a long coat and bowler inside at all times, as all detectives should, and he's clever but not quite clever enough to solve the crime. Other minor characters, including Jude Law, do their best to fill in the chinks of a very calculated effect.In a way, this made me think of the Law/Paltrow extravaganza, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow(2004), not for any visual similarity, but just for the sense of an artificial future and an awkward love affair in the midst of it, and if neither movie is great exactly, both are really interesting and fun. But Gattaca, by comparison, is so intent on dulling the comic book aspects that are a little bit at play, in favor of the sterile future that may or may not ever happen, it chills the whole experience. We can't quite take it all serious (there will never be a number to our heartbeats before we die, nor a way to know when that number would be counted), so why not push it into something more fanciful, surreal, fun, or just futuristic. Never mind reality.All that said, sci-fi fans should love this overall, if the idea is what counts most. DNA manipulation, and screening our progeny before birth, is presented as a weirdly normal activity, a little cold, for sure, but nothing immoral. The idea of just having sex and being in love and letting it all fly, take what the roll of the dice gives you, is presented as a model of the perfect life (which is what most of us do, of course)...until the end, when it slips a little back into boyhood dreams come true for those who persist and cheat and are really really pretty and selfish. Which not all of us are at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dystopia through genetics - philosophically powerful sci fi drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a thinking person's film. Do not bother with it if you are looking for typical sci fi special effects, action, and fast-pace.I would especially recommend Gattaca to anybody who has been turned off to the genre of science fiction by the plot-heavy superficial trash Hollywood so frequently places under that label. This is a film which uses the power of the sci fi genre to great effect.Gattaca is one of those movies which is better read than viewed as a film. It is a very cleverly contrived work of dystopian fiction, based on the simple premise of a future society where a person's entire life is basically assigned through their genetics. Though the future tense is implied in this film, I prefer to see it as more of a speculation on what might have happened if real world imperial-colonial powers of the early to mid-20th century had fully carried out their fledgling eugenics programs to a logical extreme. In the world of Gattaca, what you are allowed to do, where you are permitted to live, and how, are all determined by your genes, which are sampled almost constantly - about as many times as we are asked to show some form of ID daily.Uma Thurmond, Ethan Hawke and Jude Law lend powerful performances to this film, and the love that grows between them - forged in Hawke's struggle to maintain the pretense of genetic perfection he requires to fulfill his career ambitions to become an astronaut - allows the human story behind the sci-fi to saturate the film. Hawke's character, though genetically flawed, has one thing that many of the genetic elite of gattaca lack - strong motivation. Ultimately, the film offers some very subtle, simple, and profound messages about the evils and injustices of ANY form of discrimination. It's a little disturbing, however, that nearly all of the genetic elite of this film were cast with white actors. The story also carries compelling messages about love and ambition. This is a work which I am convinced Ayn Rand would have enjoyed.From a technical and artistic point of view, this film is pretty close to perfection. The film is beautifully shot and almost devoid of special effects. I remember a total of three explosions in this film (perhaps this is an all-time low for recent Hollywood sci fi?) - all of which were normal parts of rocket launches. Since this is not, by any stretch of the imagination, an action-oriented film, there is no need for the typical sci-fi gimmagery. Some of the artistic choices are a little over-the-top with symbolism - such as the anachronistic use of 1960s and 1970s sports cars. I think I understand this choice - as it emphasizes the fact that, had things gone differently in our own history, we could easily be living in a nightmare world like Gattaca today.To sum up, if you enjoy a thoughtful film with a positive message , and don't mind a little discomfort along the way to that message, Gattaca is a film you will enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Change The World So I Am Happy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:Beyond the esoterics of moral reasoning, which when you are residing in Typee 2015, it is a bit anachronistic, could we talk about the probabilities of the script. How many close calls are in this script? How many near misses over and over? Vincent is residing in one of the most totalitarian periods of human history and even within its silly parameters the likelihood is painfully contrived. Finally, as if Niccol sensed this, we have the doctor being a confederate who backs him up. That helped, but the number of near misses on being caught rivaled a James Bond movie. Then there is a small ethical problem, forgive me. Yes, I know we have the scenes of him beating his genetically superior brother at swimming but tell me: wouldn't it follow logically that we should let people with heart conditions have jobs that may put others lives at risk. I find the logic inescapable if you accept this film's moral reasoning. When we accidentally hear his heartbeat, when he makes that mistake on the treadmill: I ask you, would you like your life depending upon his defective heart? I am heartless, no pun intended, for saying I could not give a poop if it hurts his delicate feelings, his emotions are not worth other peoples' lives. See the deadly consequences of quixotic narcissism? Just so he is happy, that is all that matters. How about blind airline pilots? Don't hurt their feelings, you mean creep!See, when I watch the movie, I see PC ideology allegorically preached. Vincent has a bum ticker, miraculously, and quite improbably, he has survived and excelled as Jerome's changeling. Let's grant the extremely unlikely probability of his heart miraculously defying medical science. Even then, peoples' feelings about being barred from doing jobs that could kill other people, due to their dangerous anatomical defects, should be predicated upon risks to lives and not the PC: how we make them feel. Yes, isn't it lovely that Vincent gets to see Saturn, now how about if he has a fatal heart attack at a critical moment and kills everybody? Was Vincent's emotional fulfillment worth their lives? Non Sequitur. The acting is fine, Law, Hawke and Thurman do well. It was great to see old Ernest Borgnine in his final role. The movie is well acted and well written except for the myriad close calls that strain credulity. The ethics are poorly thought out; they reflect the New Age Zeitgeist of the canonization of personal feelings above costs to others' lives and safety. The character himself, with that damaged of a heart, is utterly unreal and contrived. How people feel about their limitations should not cause society to put others' lives in great danger in order to assuage their unhappiness with their fate. I am very unhappy Michael Jordan can jump two feet higher than I can. I do not expect the world to lower the basketball hoops and wreck the game so I don't feel so inferior to him. Again, reason before emotion, please. Q.E.D.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inspiring and moving. A flawless example of great film-making.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film will go with me to my desert island. I have watched it numerous times over the years and I continue to be astonished by its perfection.The script, casting, direction, lighting and beautifully appropriate music combine to create something inspiring and moving. The retro style is used to great effect, this being a device often used in film-making and in this case it seems to put the film outside any fixed time frame; we are not distracted by futuristic images or special effects so we can focus on the essentials and on the immediacy of the subject. What a fine touch also to allow us to feel sympathy as much for those programmed to succeed as for those destined to fail. Unlike his brother who, theoretically, should not fail to achieve all his goals, nothing was expected of Vincent so, with great courage, he could reach for the stars; he had nothing to lose.I thank the writer and director, Andrew Niccol, for his great creation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the greatest sci-fi film of the 90's. Kubrick may have liked this one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andrew Niccol began his feature film career as a director and writer with Gattaca (1997) which is very surprising science fiction(?) movie with all its feelings and important subject matters. Stuff like this unfortunately don't come too often from Hollywood, and I think that Gattaca too wasn't very successful at the box office, because stupid mainstream couldn't find anything interesting in it. Gattaca is set in the near future, where DNA technology has developed so hugely, that it is possible and advisable to manipulate the developing fetus and make it become as the parents and society wants. No fat guys, no diseases, no bald heads, nothing leaved for destiny. All manipulated and all persons to become the same.This may not sound too interesting written like this but as a movie with the theme mentioned above, this is fantastic and has also a thriller elements in it, and thus the film is also extremely exciting in its suspense. The film studies what it is to be an individual. The strong element is that people should not tamper with God's work and Nature's creations, as the results are always the same: disappointment and destruction, because human beings should/must not do things they are not allowed to do and things that they don't know. Human being has feelings and emotions, and no one should not disturb them by making some changes physically to others. There is also that larger than life question that what waits us once we leave this world we live in. That is the point, because people who believe in God know also that there is no way we can tamper His work or try to change something we don't know or even understand. These things are very philosophic and the more the viewer likes to think and use brains, the more this little film unfolds. Everyone sees it in his/her own way, and they who don't see anything in it, don't understand cinema and have no ability to interpret it as an art form. Gattaca is eternal movie, and the answers the film asks we may get once we experience the same thing as Jerome/Eugene (Jude Law) experiences at the end..This film shows what it is to be man and what it must no become. We are individuals, no one is exactly like some other (excluding nature's own creations like identical twins), and that is the rule of the Nature. If science makes all the people same and alike, what is the point to live in that kind of world? There are so many others and they are like you/me, so let them live and go on by the rules of "life." It is no use to do this since some other may do it. Those who think that person can be manipulated and to become as wanted/required, don't understand that no one can manipulate the complex and personal brains in which the real personality lives. Or does someone believe that science can create many ultra wise soon-to-become presidents or persons who will make many important inventions in the future? I think that science is able to remove something from brains/personality but not ADD something there.Gattaca is very wise and contemplative film and deals with important themes of personality, privacy, happiness (of being a human and having a personality), friendship and living (in our world and after it). Gattaca is also incredibly effective piece of cinema and very beautiful piece of art as Michael Nyman'n music is again gorgeous and photography totally stunning. The colors and over all use of camera is among the greatest I've ever seen. The colors are close to Dario Argento (although Gattaca and Argento's work are very different!) and this is a film, I think Stanley Kubrick would have liked: very intelligent and provoking and cinematically stunning at the same time. Like 2001: A Space Odyssey in other words.The actors are also great and give their finest. Uma Thurman is so sensual and talented in her role, Jude Law is fantastic as unhappy person who doesn't think he fits in the society he is born to. Ethan Hawke plays the lead part as Jerome/Vincent, who is born "in-valid" as he has not been manipulated to "perfection" before birth, unlike his brother. The actors are fantastic and do nothing wrong. We can feel exactly the same feelings the characters do and that is a sign of their talent. Gattaca is the kind of film that after the first viewing the viewer may have the feeling that it has to be seen immediately again. And that was the case with me: I viewed this immediately again after I'd watched it for the first time. And this magic will last for several viewing times and the film will unfold more and more. It would have been fantastic to see this on big screen, but it worked on television, too.10 stars out of ten for this unique and brilliant masterpiece, and hopefully the director can continue his personal line, and avoid commercial productions at any cost. As highly recommended as possible, but only for the fans of intelligent cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most important films of the 90's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without getting into the plot, which is more than adequately covered elsewhere here, I'll briefly summarize why I think Gattaca's two main messages are important. I'd even suggest that this film would be excellent viewing for a high school ethics or English class, with the topics in the film giving plenty of fodder for class discussion. An obvious point, of course, is how the direction of today's genetic sciences could be leading us dangerously to the brink of a new form of discrimination, a society of genetic have's and have not's. Research in genetics has and will continue to yield invaluable tools in fields such as medicine and criminology, all to the benefit of humanity. Like any science however, it can have a dark side when the potential outcome of its abuse is not carefully considered. Perhaps more importantly though, there is another message in Gattaca that exists in the here-and-now of our lives, and not in a potential future. It's a message of inspiration for the ordinary who believe they weren't gifted enough to achieve a goal, and a warning to the gifted that even for them, one can not rest easily and have achievement handed to them. Like the fable of the turtle and the rabbit, victory goes to the one with the determination and drive. No musician worth listening to ever got to where they are without years of practice, regardless of how naturally music may come to them. This can apply to nearly anything, and I think this is where Gattaca really shines.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the not too distant future, genetic engineering is the most common form of childbirth. Those born naturally in an uncontrolled fashion form a social underclass. One of the underclass Vincent, dreams of working within Gattaca and making it into space. He combines with Jerome who was disabled in an accident to take his identity and live his live. Vincent takes his idenity and daily eradicates all proof of his own genetic makeup. However a murder within Gattaca reveals the presence of an invalid and the police begin their search for Vincent.This is a very intelligent look into the future where racism etc has been replaced by a bias formed around one's genetic makeup. This builds a two-tier story around Vincent trying to pass off as a valid and around the murder investigation of the space programme's director. However to say that this story is just that is to ignore the layers of humanity that are looked at in the film. The real Jerome shows how elitist the valids are and how they look down on those below, but he also shows how they are only human and have the same feelings, fears etc. Vincent is the character we associate with - being excluded from society because of his genes, he is the vision of persistence that we all want to be. We see his father design a second son with his own name and the background he experiences. We also signs of humanity all round and it is as much a look at present day racism etc as it is a futuristic sci-fi. The story around the murder investigation concludes with several twists that tie the two strands together - this takes the story of Vincent to another level and it is quite moving to watch.Ethan Hawk is really good here, as is Jude Law. I found Uma Thurman a bit cold to watch and she was without much character but I assume that this was how she was meant to be . Alan Arkin is excellent as the (I assume) natural born detective who has to call a much younger man Sir because of his genes. The supporting cast is well filled out with strong actors including Elias Koteas, Gore Vidal, Ernest Bourgine and, er, Blair Underwood.Overall a moving intelligent sci-fi that is clever throughout. How many modern films can you say that about?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comment on Gattaca</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think Gattaca is one of the best movies about genetic engineering I've ever seen! It's a very emotional and dramatical film. The actors play their roles very well, so that you can identify with them closely. Because of this point it becomes clear that this is not only a science fiction movie but that it could be our future. The quality of the film is not described in big action scenes or special effects but in philosophical questions of our society. It shows that the discrimination of inferiors is a big role in our society. It make the viewer think about the perfection and the individuality of the humans. At the end you can say that this movie is more than a typical action film because it has a critical meaning in view of our society!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the 90s' best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gattaca arranges perfectly between the best movie of the 90s, probably at the top, for his multiple nature, equidistant from sci-fiction to social drama. The apocalyptic future is here portrayed not with aliens' invasions or mechanical creatures. Instead, with a "rational" decadence where Valid and Invalid people (translation: perfect and not perfect people) are classified to leave the planet towards a new, better world. The insane project to classify a society through rules of perfection was cherished from the worst dictators in history but here, with the help of science, playing to be God seem to have a legal appearance.The denunciation purpose is clear, but the experience gifted by Gattaca goes beyond. The minimalistic art direction recall extraordinarily the idea of a "near" future, so credible to seem real. A single paragraph deserves the soundtrack. Composed by the great Michael Nyman, its oneiric sounds underline every meaningful scene of the movie. The theme, the largo, the Schubert's ballad, and then again the largo with the piano addition, then the theme again. Gorgeous, ardent, a rare experience.All the actors fit perfectly their role: Uma Thurman is trapped in an algid beauty, but remains irresistible. Jude Law is very good, like his future roles have proved. Ethan Hawke fits for his role remaining though a little rigid, lost, in front of the camera, lucky that the role of Vincent it's a bit like that. Besides of other little roles, the whole movie is held up by these 3 actors and by their dialogues. An ambitious project, written and directed by Andrew Niccol (whom unfortunately disappointed me for the mediocre S1m0ne and Lord of War), that accomplishes all his targets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film tells an excellent story of a person who gives everything for his dream. Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke) is born into a futuristic ultra-conservative world dominated by genetic engineering. He is told from birth he can never be as good as those around him. Faced with this reality he gives everything he has to reach his goals. Few films have blended sci-fi, drama, romance, and thriller genres as nicely together as Gattaca did. The story moves at a good pace and consistently builds suspense throughout each scene. Hawke and Thurman show great chemistry together on screen. Jude Law also delivers a good performance. The sets are well designed and worth mentioning as they make the movie even more interesting.This is an overall excellent film with few if any weaknesses. The story sends a strong positive message that can be appreciated by almost anyone. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gattaca is not so much science fiction as human drama and prejudice in a science fiction setting.I had never heard of Gattaca until it was recommended to me by NetFlix. Gattaca is a great movie. Apparently it was not a box office success, but I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes drama and speculative fiction. Some other comments compare it to Blade Runner or 1984. Gattaca is thought provoking and stimulating without being over-blown with special effects and the idea that mankind is doomed to destroy itself.I like the soundtrack; it is not a collection of pop songs or attempted futuristic designer songs, it just fits.I won't recommend, as some comments do, to watch the movie several times to pick out gaffes. Just watch it once and enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish Sci-fi thriller whose true horror seems to be lost on most people</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was intrigued by the cult popularity of this film and the fact that so many people seem to think this is one of the best films ever made. Frankly, I struggled to sit through the whole thing and I had to fast-forward through the ponderous stair-climbing scene."Gattaca" is reminiscent of 60s sci-fi horror films with its sterile atmosphere and melancholy characters. It's hard to relate to people with absolutely no joy in their lives. Ironically, in watching the first act of the film a second time, I thought the central character seemed happier in his life as an "in-valid." Our hero's quest seems a bit far-fetched for the price he has to pay and, for the audience, the outcome seems like a foregone conclusion; lacking the impact of a twist ending in comparable films like the original "Plant of the Apes" or even "Soylent Green." The subtext of sci-fi horror elements, such as invasive background checks and medical testing by employers as well as discrimination based on genetic attributes don't seem all that horrific because, sadly, they have been widely accepted business practices for some time.I'm amazed to see so many reviewers comment on the "revelation" that in the future employers will discriminate on genetic perfection rather than traditional prejudices such as race, sex, etc. Numerous studies have confirmed that "good looking" people have better jobs and earn more. Men who are less than 6' tall earn more than shorter men, for example. Employers are often impressed with dubious measures of intelligence like college degrees, grades or standardized test scores.I was also struck by the obvious incongruity of a world where both physical and mental perfection are prized, yet the demands of the career seem to require neither. How much physical perfection is required to sit at a computer keyboard? The work itself is obviously a white collar clerical job with the computer doing the serious mental work. We know it's clerical work because the filmmaker shows him in a cliché clerical setting: sea of cubicles with employees working like disposable, interchangeable parts in a large machine. A future where the best and brightest have only mindless bookkeeping tasks to challenge them is the real horror in "Gattaca."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stands the test of time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched "Gattaca" earlier when it came out, but I was probably too young and/or drunk to appreciate it at the time. So I got the blu-ray and watched it again.What a quality film this is. Nevermind that the budget wasn't big, everything is handled with care. Cinematography is top notch, the script is coherent and clever at the same time, the music is absolutely beautiful, actors do a fine job, the directing of Niccol keeps everything in check. I can't find significant flaws in this movie.This is not what people usually expect from SciFi movies today. This is not an action film in space. "Gattaca" is a science fiction movie as much as it is a drama with a little detective story hidden inside. Almost nothing is "in your face", since this movie doesn't make a huge deal out of every meaningful scene. It's not trying to force you to feel or think anything, so the emotional reaction I got was only after the movie had ended. Only then it hit me, and it hit me hard. And the music (I have to compliment the score once again) played inside my head for quite some time.The above is the main reason I appreciate this film a lot. Many will dislike it for the same reason. If you want something huge, something with immediate impact, something which is trying to impress you, there's a chance you won't love this movie. I too admit that I would've wanted the story to be more gripping and intense, but then again that certain subtlety is one of the strengths of this film. Nevertheless, I recommend "Gattaca" to everyone. When you're in a calm, ponderous or thoughtful state of mind, watch this.Gattaca asks you important questions without forcing an ambiguous, open ending. Niccol wrote and directed a quality movie and he will be remembered for it. Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, Jude Law, Xander Berkeley and Alan Arkin were convincing in their roles, and every actor did a fine job."Gattaca" is a thoughtful, humane story and a genuinely well-made film. It already survived the test of time this far, and it will continue to do so. Even if it seems a bit underwhelming, there's a lot of love in it.</fullReview>

In this movie a new underclass if "invalids" is created in the not too distant future when genetic engineering becomes the preferred form of procreation. Vincent Freeman stops at nothing to accomplish his dreams. A story of how dedication and perseverance can overcome the impossible. This movie is true testament to the human spirit.

		<shortDescription>Timeless and poetic exploration of issues of identity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie does a number of ingenious and remarkable things : 1. It makes the extraordinary ( space exploration ) seem completely routine in a way not accomplished since 2001 A Space Odyssey. But in total contrast to the latter, instead of achieving this effect through the vivid portrayal of technology with engineering exactitude, it does it by showing almost no technology whatsoever. Rather scenes of the completely anodyne. The "astronauts" wear business suits and work in an office.2. It creates a sense of timelessness by using almost featureless sets reminiscent of a classical play and paraphernalia re-cycled from other times ( such as the cars and the back-projection displays ). The feel of the film is in a very positive way reminiscent of Alphaville.3. It employs completely impractical technical devices in such an effective theatrical way as to render their impracticality irrelevant. For example, it is possible to identify someone by a genetic "fingerprint" generated from a hair follicle ( but not in itself a hair ) or skin, but such traces would not facilitate a break-down of the persons genetic character, as pretended here. These are two different orders of measurement. Indeed, urine, which features centrally in the plot, is of no use on either account, not being a body tissue in any case. Only the blood tests would facilitate both identification and genetic analysis as shown in the story. Yet, in spite of knowing these things, the use of such devices as a plucked hair in the story is made so poetically as to become effectively a perfect metaphor and so beyond criticism on grounds of mere realism. To me, this seems almost unique. To do the wrong, obviously, yet aptly.4. The plot is so contrived as to convene three parallel stories into convergence: Vincents story, of course. But also the directors story, which is oddly similar ( his life's ambition in the flight of the mission can only be fulfilled by killing the man who would have axed it ). As is that of the son of the biologist mentioned at the end.5. The movie actually achieves what most dramatic art strives for but fails to do: the story resonates far beyond the limited scope of the dramatic enactment. Vincents dream and the challenges posed by society's prejudices is a story that is eternal and universal. As are other issues brought up: sibling rivalry, the "straight" way to a mediocre life as against the "crooked" yet heroic path toward a greater truth. Most profound is the way in which the paralysed Jerome actually becomes an immortal, historical space-farer Vincent, destroying his mortal self to do so, leaving as his legacy the realisations by the other man of his dreams. This is both incredibly ingenious and thought provoking, creating a mood that lingers long after the credits roll. I doubt that vicariousness has ever before been made so realistic a possibility.The atmosphere, mood and languid tempo yet with a sense of inevitability is greatly aided by Michael Nyman's score.This is one of the very few movies in which a narrator is entirely apt and not a mere convenience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If everyone is perfect, than doesn't perfect simply become average?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In recent years, sci-fi movies have been primarily popcorn flicks. You would never see a really thoughtful film along the lines of Planet of the Apes, 2001, or even Logan's Run. We were given films about Bruce Willis blowing up an asteroid and movies about an alien fleet trying to blow up the world. Even Star Wars wasn't an intelligent movie. It was pure entertainment, but that was all it tried to be. Too many movies today are popcorn flicks with a moral tacked onto the end of the film. But every once in while, we find a diamond in the rough. Which is the case with Gattaca.Gattaca takes place in the near future. It presents a future that is completely plausible and seems to be strangely familiar. In this future, genetic manipulation has become quite mainstream, leading many parents to choose the perfect traits for their children. These children have perfect features and no trace of birth defects. They are all intelligent and almost perfect. However, they are not the mindless robots coming off of an assembly line that you may picture. The entire idea is completely realistic and plausible.However, some parents choose not to undergo this procedure, whether due to religious reasons or the inability to afford it. Regardless, these parents sometimes give birth to children with birth defects and other less-than-desired traits. These children are usually given the world's less-than-desirable jobs.Such is the case with Vincent, our main character. He was born with a heart condition and was expected to die by age thirty. His parents learned their lesson, and when they had a second child, they made sure that he had superior genes. This leads to an unusual sibling rivalry between Vincent and his brother. As a child, Vincent dreams of working with the space program called Gattaca. He has the brain-power to do it, but his genes are holding him back. DNA checks are mandatory for all new recruits. He continues into his adult life, getting a job as a janitor at Gattaca, which only increases his hunger for space. However, he soon finds a way out. Jerome Morrow is a former swimmer who becomes paralyzed from the waist down. After his accident, he simply fades off of the map. Through an "identity-dealer," Vincent finds that he can alter his appearance and use Jerome's DNA to get a job at Gattaca. In return he will pay Jerome a portion of his salary. So the two begin a life together. Vincent becomes Jerome and gets a job a Gattaca.I don't want to ruin the entire story, but there are many interesting twists to keep your interest. The film also moves at an incredible pace, making the 101 minutes fly by. There are action scenes, but these are not Michael Bay action scenes by any means. Of course, that isn't a bad thing. What I am trying to say is that this is an intelligent film. While anyone can enjoy it for its rich story and good performances, those interested in science will be the most interested. The film offers many references to genetics including Jerome's middle name (Eugene is a reference to eugenics, the branch of genetics involving gene manipulation), Jerome's spiral staircase (a DNA strand), and even the films name (letters used to label the nucleotide bases of DNA).I must complement the film's cinematography. The films color palette is great, containing a lot of rich greens and blues. The look of the film is also great. It is very minimalist and just futuristic enough to keep things in line.Performances vary from good to great, but everyone does a pretty good job. Ethan Hawke does a great job playing Vincent, but Jude Law steals the show as Jerome. His wit and humor contrasting some heavy drama makes him an unforgettable character. Also noteworthy is Uma Thurman's performance as Vincents uniformist love interest.I must truly compliment Andrew Niccol. Had he simply written the script, he would deserve recognition. But his directing is spot on. The film is unique, smart, well-acted, and great to look at. Best of all, this is an intelligent movie. It will make you think about many things. If everyone is perfect, than doesn't perfect simply become average? 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is unfortunate that Gattaca did not do so well at the box office back in 1997. But is has become sort of a cult film as people begin to rediscover it on video and DVD. I think it may have something to do with the recent innovations in genetic engineering and the success of the three main leads.The first half of the film is quite intense and suspenseful as well as provides a canvas for many ideas on the theme of identity, class society and elitism, fate and destiny and control. Ethan Hawke does a great job as the fraudulent Vincent, and Jude Law is entertaing as the borrowed ladder.Watch this film when you really feel like thinking after the movie, as the movie has little action.I think this flick will become a sci fi classic in the years to come and dumb overblown sci fi wannabes such as armageddon and mission to mars will have been forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sci Fi As It Should Be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Gattaca', the 1997 sci-fi film, has definitely done its part in adding to the culture of cult films around the world. Whether it's the disturbingly familiar future-society that the film depicts, the ethical and moral nightmare scenarios that it entails, or something subliminally appealing, this piece of film found its audience and cemented its place in history.In the 'not-too-distant future', the world of genetics has expanded to previously unimaginable proportions, wherein a person's entire life story can be told with just a drop of blood or a strand of hair. In this post-genetics world, science has perfected the art of life; children are no longer born biologically, but rather their parents give their sperm and eggs to laboratories and they deliver the best child that can be produced from these genes. Children who were not conceived this way are referred to as "in-valids" and society deems them accordingly. It's a whole new type of discrimination, but one that Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke) is not willing to accept.Vincent is an in-valid who has always had the dream of going into space. Refusing to accept his pre-determined life, Vincent consequently adopts the identity of another man whose genes make him 'valid'. Jerome Morrow (Jude Law) agrees to let Vincent have his identity if he will provide Jerome with a place to live. Using samples from Jerome's body disguised as his own (blood, urine, hair), Vincent becomes employed in the Gattaca Aerospace Corporation as Jerome Morrow and after many years in the job, he is finally given the opportunity to go up into space on one of Gattaca's frequent launches.When the director of the Gattaca Aerospace Corporation is murdered, however, investigations into the crime put into question Vincent's true identity, and he soon finds that his long deception could be unraveled and his life-long dream could be shot down in flames. With only fellow colleague Irene (Uma Thurman) and Jerome on his side, Vincent must race against the powers that are trying to put him back into the social hole he was supposedly born into and put an end to the life he has worked so hard to build.The film has a very sorrowful approach to what sounds initially like a very lame plot. It's cinematic and stylistic without being pretentious or overdone, and the way it is shot and put together reflects very well the film's bland and sterilized society in pursuit of perfection. The chilling sense of realism that goes with the world of Gattaca makes everything within it become more than just a strange concept in a science fiction film. Not unlike Spielberg's 'A.I.', Gattaca very cleverly draws from horrors within our society today to suggest the terrifying prospect that our science will eventually render us, as a natural species, obsolete.Director Andrew Niccol has done a fine job in transforming this sci-fi flick into something much deeper and more interesting. The writing is not spectacular, but is still better than most. Hawke's narration provides very good atmosphere for the film as he talks about the way of the world in this eerie future and the film's theme is very secure, with events such as the murder being practically irrelevant. The thing that matters most is Vincent's dream and the social inequalities that prevent him from actualizing it, and this is made very clear from beginning to end.The acting performances are all very adequate, but the stand-out ones are Ethan Hawke and Jude Law, who seem so comfortable in their characters and, truth be told, share more chemistry than Hawke and Thurman do. This was one of Jude Law's first feature films, and it is a remarkably impressive debut.Basically, this is a film that says what it means. Even in a world that has successfully bred perfection, people still suffer, the system is still unjust and lives still go to waste. Far from just being an unrealistic portrayal of what the future will hold, 'Gattaca' questions the ideals of mankind, the principles of civilization and leaves us to wonder what we, as a society are truly striving for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gattaca tries to label itself as an intellectual film but can't stand up to scrutiny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gattaca was not average by any means. I feel I must rate it a five though, not for being mediocre, but for being excellent in some areas and utter tripe in others. The premise of this movie is an interesting one: that genetic engineering will produce a ruling class of post-human elitists. However, this film is simply too unbelievable to effectively make any sort of point.Vincent, played by Ethan Hawke, is a child conceived naturally during a time where that sort of conception is considered passé. Unfortunately for him, all the good jobs require a genetic screening to weed out less-than-perfect candidates, and his dream of becoming an astronaut is made extraordinarily difficult due to his bad genes. In fact, he actually has to hire Jude Law, who has really good genes, to allow him to take blood and tissue samples so he can pretend to have good genes too.Throughout this movie there are many, many times where the plot was simply too unbelievable to allow me to enjoy this movie. First of all, the sheer number of DNA tests that people in this movie were subjected to was simply over the top. Employees of the center where Vincent worked had to have their fingers pricked constantly. For an agency that's looking to attract the best and the brightest, I can't think of a better way to drive them away. I give blood to the Red Cross every four months, and that finger prick they make everyone endure still drives me crazy. Many nurses have told me that it's the same with just about everyone. In the end, this all turns out to be rather useless for their purposes, as Vincent gets around the DNA tests and the infernal finger-pricking with latex pouches of Jude Law's blood glued onto his fingertips.Of course that's just a detail, but nevertheless it's a detail that stood out to me. More important is the fact that Vincent doesn't show any signs of being a genetic cripple, save for his thick glasses. Judging by the list of his disorders they rattled off at the beginning, he is not, as you might suspect, a retarded obese midget, but reasonably good-looking, extremely motivated, and very intelligent. One of the points this movie seems to be trying to make is that your genes don't really affect who you are, but clearly they do.There are some more ridiculous scenes. Vincent claims that despite the genetically determined prediction that he would die young due to coronary problems, his "heart is a thousand beats overdue." Just for kicks I figured out how long it'd take for a heart to beat one thousand times, and it's about 15 minutes. If that were all, I wouldn't be so optimistic. Then there were the spaceships, manned by a staff with impeccably gelled hair wearing suits and ties. Then there was the assumption that Jude Law's character was a failure, despite winning only a silver medal in the Olympics. Considering the sheer number of genetically perfect athletes, I'd say second place is pretty good. Then there were the showers that cleaned themselves with flamethrowers, yet had no safety features to prevent the inevitable.I could keep listing things, like the way all the DNA tests seemed to be designed so that a determined person could barely beat them, but that would be pointless. It all serves to show that despite this film being an obvious work of science fiction, the science was usually obscured by art and marketability. That's not to say Gattaca isn't worth seeing; it certainly is. It was done very artistically, and there are many things to be appreciated here including the excellent performances by the cast.Most people agree that there are two types of science fiction: that set in its own universe and that set in ours. Gattaca was clearly meant to be in the latter group. However, a science fiction story set in our universe must abide by the same laws as we do, which is something that this movie did not do. If this were its only fault, I would have rated this film higher, but alas, it was not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GATTACA - Worth watching again and again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is rife with symbolism. I show it to my biology classes every year. After seeing it 6x per year during each class, for eight years, it never ceases to amaze me how I see something new and different each time I watch it. This year, I noticed the themes of swimming and stars:SWIMMING: Eugene - an Olympic swimmer; the swimming competition between Anton and Vincent-- and later Anton working out in a lap pool because he has never come to grips with the fact that Vincent beat him swimming. I wonder why the swimming theme was used in the screen play? My students have hypothesized that perhaps it means a "baptism" or "cleansing" but that's all speculation.STARS: "Reach for the stars" -- setting high goals for yourself and working to achieve them. Stars are shown several times as they gaze into the sky Titan is the destination -- a moon of Saturn which appears as a star in our telescopes Astronauts "They say every atom in our bodies was once a part of a star. Maybe I'm not leaving, maybe I'm going home." -- a quote by Vincent.Last year I realized for the first time the names of the characters: "Eugene" - or "True Gene" "Eu"= truth and "gene" = to create or to cause.Vincent's last name is "Freeman" ... free from being a prisoner of DNA as he escapes its grasp and uses his spirit and determination to succeed. (I felt stupid never thinking about those names before.)The more you watch the movie, the more you begin to see.My students' favorite part every year is how the silver medal turns "gold" as seen through the flames of the incinerator.Age discrimination is another theme that is subtle. The "in-valids" they are testing in town are all older fellows, the killed director was young, his replacement under him, was old. The detective was older, and his boss Anton, was young.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Gattaca" (1997 - 112 minutes) is one of the best scientific fiction movies of the 90 years. Deep, overwhelming and controversial, it was written and directed by Andrew Niccol. Gattaca, the name of a specific DNA strain sequence of the human body, is also the denomination of a space trip megacorporation. The society described in the narrative adopts the genetic manipulation to improve the attributes of each human being. In fact, the people are classified as "valids" [or perfect conceived in laboratory] and "invalids" [conceived by the natural method]. Vincent Freeman [the actor Ethan Hawke] is one of "invalids" having to support his stigma of birth, beyond other imperfections. He has an illness that limits his life to 30 years - in contrast to his younger brother, Anton [Loren Dean], that was designed genetically and is a member of the elite. But Vincent did not accept his destiny. He aims for changing his life and fulfill his dreams, traveling to other planets. To qualify himself as a space pilot, the young one would have to be "perfect" or "valid". As in that society the identity of someone was not confirmed by documents but by their genes, Vincent perceives that he has to turn himself into another person to obtain what he wants. Through a DNA trader, he knows Jerome Eugene Morrow [the actor Jude Law], a superior being that was paralyzed in an accident and was excluded from the society. Using samples of blood, hair, skin and urine of Jerome, Vincent assumes his identity, becoming a navigator. Vincent also falls in love for the pretty Irene [the actress Uma Thurman], his colleague in Gattaca, that does not know his true identity. One week before the space mission, a murder in Gattaca starts an inquiry led for Anton, that is a policeman. Vincent is in a great danger to be discovered. The main message of the film is that there is no genes for the spirit. Extraordinary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hello? Top 250 anyone?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How this movie is not in the top 250 is beyond belief. This was an amazing movie with wonderful acting, not to mention a wonderful story. Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman deserve more credit for their roles played in this movie, as does Jude Law. But how can anyone ignore the story, I truly believe this to be a warning for the "Not to Distant Future."Genetic discrimination is truly possible, or, I should say, will be possible within all of our futures. Science is making progress by leaps and bounds, and is doing so at an ever rapid pace. To ignore the warning set forth in this movie would be a travesty.If you listen closely to the news you can hear the progress, every day, "Science Advances Again," "New Cloning Procedure Tested." These are the headlines of science, buried deep within the newspapers of America, where, by the way, all the interesting news lies. The sheer tactfulness of how this movie analyzes the future is classy, the colors of the movie are well balanced with the seriousness of the movies tone, and only add more to a movie that seems to have it all. The suits, hair styles and modernistic architecture also add to the movie's brilliance and tone.This is a clever movie, "GATTACA" as everyone reading this probably knows, is a combination of the first letters of the four amino acids in DNA, as any introductory biology class would teach you, which is also why they show this movie in most Biology classes across America, and it is also where I first saw it.I can only give my highest rating for GATTACA, it is a great movie, and watching it over and over again only adds to the experience. My official rating is 8.4/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Looks beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The production design of this movie is so perfect it is almost enough to like this movie already. Every scene looks great and together with a good cinematography it gives the movie a beautiful appearance. This is a science fiction movie with ideas instead of mindless action, and for some reason the look of the complete movie adds to this idea.The story is set in the near future. Babies can be born the natural way or parents can genetically produce their child and make them as good as flawless. Vincent (Ethan Hawke) is born the natural way and therefore he has less chances than most others. His dream is to go in space but since he is an "In-Valid" as they call it in the movie, he probably never will. Then he finds a way to make his dreams real. A "Valid" person named Jerome (Jude Law) has lost the use of his legs and although he is almost perfect he can't do much without them. Vincent and Jerome become a team. Since every part of the body that contains DNA can betray you, Jerome has to give Vincent his blood samples, urine samples, hair, etc. and Vincent has a chance to enter the space program.He is selected to go to Titan, one of Saturn's moons, and a person who was against this mission is suddenly murdered. An eyelash is found and it belongs to Vincent, of course, but since not Vincent but Jerome is working there at first he is not a suspect. Will he be discovered? In this way the suspense comes from more than one way. We have the murder case with the detectives (played by Alan Arkin and Loren Dean) trying to solve it, we are not sure whether Vincent has something to do with it, we don't know who suspects what, Vincent can be discovered anytime. He can be discovered by anyone as well, including the girl he is seeing. Her name is Irene (Uma Thurman). The story can sound a little complicated to you, but it definitely is not. Everything is pretty clear to us and although there are some surprises it is all done in a logical way.Like I said everything looks great. The direction is important for that as well, and the actors find the perfect note to play their parts. Hawke is probably the perfect actor for the leading role here, Thurman does pretty well and Law is the best thing in every scene he is in. The supporting characters including Alan Arkin, Loren Dean, Ernest Borgnine, Xander Berkeley and Gore Vidal are also perfectly cast.A drama without family deaths, a thriller without guns and explosions, a science fiction without aliens, what a relieve.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gattaca is one of the best science-fiction movie I ever saw. It is almost perfect in the form. The photography is extremely good. Buildings and global social organisation are just weird enough to feel different but not THAT different. The music is excellent, as usual from Michael Nyman. And the actors are ... Well, Uma Thurman, Ethan Hawke and Jude Law. Do we need to comment on that?Let's now turn to the plot: It is original, interesting, full of suspense and scary. And here is the first scary bit: It is not science-fiction at all. We can already genotype people. I can do it. It just take a little bit more time and material than in the movie. But basically we're there. And the second scary bit is: This is not a movie about discriminating people based on disabilities, as it was often told. It is a movie about discriminating people based on the possibility that they could maybe get disabled in the future! Does it ring a bell to people interacting with insurance companies?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually stunning and thought provoking sci-fi.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gattaca is a disturbing vision of what the future may provide. Gattaca takes the concept of George Orwell's 1984 and pushes it even further. Not only is big brother watching, but they are genetically engineering babies, and taking blood and urine samples on a daily basis to segregate the "strong" from the "weak". Hitler would have been proud of what "this" America has become.Gattaca is a visually stunning film. It has a very sterile and sleek look which matches the mechanical future it is trying to present. At times the film itself appears neither black or white, nor in color. It is a hybrid of the two that is very artistic and modern.Overall, Gattaca is a very good film, that could have been great. At times this film dragged out and left me wanting a little more action. Besides the occasional lull, I still felt strong enough about Gattaca to give it a 7 out of 10 stars.Charlie Korch</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite possibly the most fascinating - and underrated - sci-fi of the 90's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Science fiction isn't my favourite genre (I'm more of a human dramas, dark comedies fan - or anything that involves more flesh and less steel), but there are some titles of this genre that fascinate me. "Gattaca" is one of them. This is probably the best sci-fi of the 90's, a thoroughly engaging, entertaining and fascinating story about a genetically imperfect man (Ethan Hawke) who assumes the identity of a member of the genetic elite (Jude Law), but lives a nightmare when he becomes the main suspect of a murder. The film is set in a "not-too-distant-future" and although the technology we see is quite advanced, it doesn't rely on special effects to dazzle our eyes (the discreet but stylish art-direction is a feast for the eyes, nonetheless, and Michael Nyman provides a great musical score). This is great storytelling with emotional punch and provocative ideas, and although it's not fast paced enough for the Michael Bay generation, it's not complicated like, say, Kubrick's monumental classic-puzzle "2001: A Space Odyssey" (1968) or Terry Gilliam's "12 Monkeys" (1995, another great, if not flawed, sci-fi of the 90's) - which means it can be enjoyed by anyone who likes a good story. Quite possibly the most fascinating - and underrated - sci-fi tale of the decade (oh, and Uma Thurman is always a pleasure to watch!). 10/10.</fullReview>

It has enough basis in reality to be a good story, but still a big enough divergence to make us think. We are moving closer and closer to "designer babies". Are we going to create anew caste system? Is it morally acceptable to do so? This is also a story of potential. One character says potential cannot be exceeded. But is he right? We also see potential is no guarantee. Identity is not destiny -- one stray bullet and the promise of the future can be shattered. Ho much of the world can humanity control, and how much is impossible to plan?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautifully constructed chapter of a future</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review is going to be very generic and ponderous. I will possibly not discuss the specific elements and facts from the movie which can be read in any well constructed review, rather provide my feelings after watching it.This movie is one which I will not want to forget, but probably will. The simplicity of the narration and the subtle portrayal by the cast is one of the better I have seen in quite some time. Being a sucker for creative science fiction, I have a biased view point, but for a viewer like me (and I do believe that there are many more) this is what Science Fiction should be.The world is beautifully constructed of the "not so far future" and very believable given the pace of science today, the research on progress and the mindset of the new age society. This plausible world has its set of societal rules and cultural dispositions with a compatible set of beliefs and moralities. The social evolution (transformation) associated with a more technologically advanced society is what wins me over, and Gattaca develops this theme to a beautiful effect.The protagonist's struggle to escape his definition in this world and his heart pounding journey to achieve this is what riveted me to his story. This narrative provides an interpretation of how our understanding of "survival of the fittest" might shape the world one day and why our human "weaknesses" like disease, frailty and mortality actually give us the traits of dreams, determination and faith. This is perfectly exemplified in the conversation when the benefactor thanks our protagonist for lending him his dreams. That one line has summed up the humanity of limitations that actually makes us dream and want to achieve them rather than lead the dull existence of "privilege and perfection".I know my vague ramble lacks a coherent structure, but I hope that if you have seen this movie you may be able to find a slightly new lens for thinking about it and the meaning of our lives as well.</fullReview>

This movie is a classic Science Fiction movie which can be watched and enjoyed by the masses.The relationship between the characters is perfectly built up and the characters themselves are believable.

		<shortDescription>A Brave New World of Genetic Determinsim</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gattaca refers to a fictional aerospace company whose space flights the film's protagonist Vincent (played by Ethan Hawke) dreams of joining. Unfortunately for him, the film begins with the "natural", i.e., old-fashioned, birth of Vincent compared to the genetically engineered birth of his brother and most of the rest, it appears, of this society set in the "not too distant future." This society has the technical knowledge to allow parents to select the genetic components for their offspring that optimize mental and physical factors, and apparently most parents pick that route rather than the uncertainty of random genetic re-combination. Thus, we have a two-tiered society between the genetically "enriched" and the "natural births", respectively called "valids" and "in-valids" in the film, and Vincent as an "in-valid" with a heart condition is relegated to menial jobs rendering his dream of going into space impossible.Vincent gets a janitor's job at Gattaca, and the rest of the film is largely driven by his efforts to get on the space flight to Saturn's moon, Titan, by passing himself off as a "valid" by using genetic markers purchased from a "valid". The film ominously depicts how practically everybody is being screened all the time by their genetic markers, e.g., blood, a strand of hair, which renders the individual almost instantly recognizable as a "valid" or "in-valid." Gattaca is a science fiction film that has no weird aliens or deadly space rays, but instead takes an intelligent, thoughtful approach to a scientific issue that may be closer than we think. Some scientists have predicted that perhaps in several decades we might have the two-tiered society envisioned in Gattaca between those with the financial resources to pay for genetically "enriched" children and those who must opt for a random shuffling of the parental genes.For that matter, this film reminded me of Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World" in which I re-read a few chapters prompted by seeing Gattica. In Huxley's book all children are genetically designed to fit into five castes. The less numerous but superior Alpha and Beta castes rule over the more numerous but inferior three lower castes who are subjected to chemical interference to promote arrested development in intelligence and physical growth. The allocation of the castes presumably promotes social stability. So we have: (1) Brave New World's genetic determinism which seems to be sort of a centrally planned variety, (2) the genetic determinism feared by current futurists who worry about genetic enrichment being accessible only (perhaps initially) to the rich, making for a caste, not a class, society based on the resulting unequal competition, and (3) Gattica's portrayal of a genetically determined world which shows genetic engineering available to everyone, but with some opting for "natural" children. Of course, this allows the film to celebrate the human spirit and motivation of an "in-valid" as he strives to achieve his ambition, but these personality characteristics, e.g., motivation, risk acceptance, would also be (at least partially) genetically determinable as well in the world envisioned by Gattaca. If these issues intrigue you, or better, worry you, than Gattaca is a film for you.</fullReview>

I thought you would be good... but... wow.Gattaca is set in the not too distant future; about a man named Vincent who wants to be a space traveler, but is born naturally, not the 'correct' way, i.e. created to perfection. He cannot be a space traveler, however, since he is an "in-valid. He finds a person, "German", who gives capable "in-valids", the life of a "valid" who cannot live their dream, due to an incident. In this case, Jerome Morrows has broken his back. So, they switch identities.Now, before you ask, "Is this guy rating this ten 'cause he is an idiot?" Well, I have a logical explanation. It was sitting on an eight until the ending. My only spoiler is it is sad. It was good enough to rise it by two stars. Oh, yes, a beautiful movie.

		<shortDescription>We now have discrimination down to a science.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gattaca is written and directed by Andrew Niccol. It stars Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, Jude Law, Gore Vidal, Loren Dean, Xander Berkeley and Alan Arkin. Music is by Michael Nyman and cinematography by Slawomir Idziak. It's the near future and eugenics dominate a society where children are either "valids" (reproductive through eugenics) or "in-valids" (naturally birthed with inherent genetic flaws). One such "in-valid" is Vincent Anton Freeman (Hawke), who plots an intricate scheme to assume a "valid" person's identification so as to reach his dreams of being an astronaut. There is no gene for fate. Biopunk future meets tech-noir in this thought provoking and intelligent piece of sci-fi. There is a decent argument to suggest that Gattaca is more style over character substance, especially given that visually Niccol's movie is stunning. It's a near future world of genetic engineering where although discrimination is illegal, perfection rules the day and the "in-valids" are passed over for high grade employment. Identity, inferiority and bigotry are fused together to offer up moral quandaries and ethical conundrums, all set to an oppressive tech-noir backdrop painted by Idziak's deft choice of colour filters. There's a striking difference between the look of the Gattaca corporation compared to the rest of the outside world, this helps to keep the thematics at work rich and potent. As a thriller it barely raises the pulse, but this is deliberate, as is the pacing by Niccol. This is an emotionally stunted world and the ethereal atmosphere hovers continually over proceedings. There's a romance in the mix between Hawke and Thurman, which on the surface seems a token sub-plot and devoid of passion, but again this feels deliberate, lack of passion is actually the order of the day. Cast performances are well up to scratch, with Law stealing the film as a one time "valid" ironically invalidated by an incident. And while we could have done with more from top performers Arkin (as a copper attired like a classical film noir gumshoe) and Elias Koteas (as Vincent's father), it rounds out as an impressively constructed picture. Provocative and brainy, with visual pleasures unbound, Gattaca has many attributes that reward still further on repeat viewings. 8/10</fullReview>

The twists in the end, with Anton and the doctor are well inducted in the story and justly highlight the accomplishment of the genetically inferior protagonist.Not taking anything away from the brilliance of the director, there are several oddities in the plot like the inability of Eugene to get artificial limbs in the supposedly futuristic age or the inhuman treatment affected to genetically inferior people even though there is a mention that genetic discrimination was illegal ( especially the way they are treated by the police during the investigation reminds one of Jews in the Holocaust ). And you can hardly expect space travelers to don three piece suits while boarding space ships, no matter how advanced technology might be. Another point to note is the contrasting behavior of the detective while questioning an elite employee ( Eugene ), when he started apologizing for a mere offensive remark and his unapologetic boldness while hinting an accusation at the Director of the firm! Minor oddities not counting, the film was a refreshing experience and a certain to make it to the best 'hope' films of all time.</fullReview>

Psychological value of this movie is even more than IMDB#1 "Shawshank Redemption's" one. It proves that aspiring man can reach his goal one way or another. I saw a lot of interpretations of that subject, and I consider this one the best. The subject is : "A man CAN but MUSTN'T". The movie doesn't give a chance to all that downers who says "I simply can't do this" or "The odds are always against me".

As for the film itself, it is full of interesting ideas, and at least for the first half hour or so, these are well explored. The film unfortunately becomes lost in a murder plot towards the middle, and this stops it from exploring the most fascinating parts in more detail. Even so, it manages to be relatively gripping, and there is more than just the murder plot that is not all so good about the film. Michael Nyman's music is simply beautiful, but it is overplayed, and while on the subject of excesses, the sea symbolism could have been played down a bit more. The narration is not the best, neither is Thurman's performance, yet the film always manages to sustain a nature of enticement. The sets are great to look at, and Jude Law gives off an intriguing early performance. If not perfect science fiction, this is certainly worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant snapshot of emotions and genetics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>9/10Gattaca explores a world where designer genetically modified babies spurn the next wave of human life eventually turning into the brilliant people of a new generation. Ethan Hawke's character, Vincent Freeman, wasn't as ?lucky' however, and in the 1990's was born as a then normal baby out of love by his parents. His brother on the other hand was given a genetic head start in life and seemed superior to Vincent in almost every way. Freeman's dreams of becoming a pilot in space and exploring planets are in tatters however, as who wants to take on somebody that has human imperfections. Not letting this change his ambitions, Freeman takes on the seemingly impossible task of becoming somebody else in order to make his ambitions a reality. However, the changing world of Gattaca ensures that everybody is on record and that Freeman has to not only be somebody else in appearance but also must fake blood samples and urine samples as well as keep himself groomed to a state of paranoia so that no evidence of the real him can be found. Gattaca is excellent in almost every way exploring human instincts and emotions, whilst also highlighting principles and ambitions and the struggle to fit into a perfect society. The film is even more poignant in the now, as the issues of genetically modified babies are prevalent. Hawke's performance is also brilliant and Jude Law portraying a crippled man who could have had it all is also fine. Uma Thurman gives an accomplished performance as Irene Cassini, a worker who sort of suspects something is out of order, but who goes along with her instincts of not saying anything anyway. Gattaca is a triumph and most scenes provoke deep thought. Some of the more emotional scenes are between the brothers, as the battle of pride takes them on the edge quite often especially as they play chicken with each other on the dangerous waves of the sea to prove what is better ? natural humans or modified beings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily one of the top 10 films of the '90's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film doesn't need to be independent, nor DE-pendent upon special effects to shine a mirror back on society's future for what it is (and what it has the capability to evolve to), should the course of events proceed unchanged.I think the film moved me so much since I guess I have lofty goals about employers myself, and yet would NEVER be considered genetically sufficient enough to work there, should the "entrance" requirements become so stringent as DNA testing. Perhaps I empathized more with Ethan's character, or just appreciated a simple noir thriller, but nonetheless, each character seemed as real to me as if they were sitting next to me. Uma in particular astonished me with her apparently dormant ability to appear "cultured" &amp; restrained (so who was that in Batman &amp; Robin?).Some people may have concerns that the film has too many open questions, yet the only question I found myself asking was, "what do all these people do on the weekend ... or do they even get weekends off?". :-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film represents what amazing film writing can actually do. This film has absolutely amazing dialogue and this film is not held by one actor but three. Jude Laws performance is mesmerising as he allows the viewer to understand his pain and it brings the 'human reality' to this picture, as you normally feel this film is just to much like 'Playing God' it doesnt harm the story but it does enhance it and its credibility. If you cannot lose yourself into this film then there isn't very much hope. Fantastic, Ethan Hawke proves his fame is well deserved and if you enjoyed his performance in this film you must have a look at Training Day. Top 3 film easily.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing but not as profound as it wants to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gattaca" is intended as a cautionary tale about genetic engineering. The film takes place in a future world, not too far removed, where destiny is determined by genes: all babies (except for a few "accidents," known as "invalids") are genetically engineered to near-perfection, people are hired on the basis of their genetic profile, and the imperfect products of accidental births are relegated to low-status menial jobs. Our hero, Vincent (Ethan Hawke), is an "invalid" who wants to rise above his genetic destiny. So, in an elaborate scheme, he buys the identity of Eugene Morrow, a genetically perfect athlete crippled in an accident, and gets the job he always dreamed about in a space-exploration program. Complications ensue as Vincent/Eugene is threatened with exposure and, at the same time, becomes involved in a risky romance with his beautiful co-worker Irene (Uma Thurman).One problem with the film, in my view, is that the model of the future society in "Gattaca" was not sufficiently well-thought out. The narration (voice-over by Vincent) informs us near the start of the film that genetic discrimination ("genoism") is technically illegal but companies get away with genetic profiling under the guise of testing blood and urine for drugs. Yet throughout the rest of the film, the second-class citizenship of the "invalid" is taken for granted by the legal authorities. Nor does it make much sense that people would be hired for challenging and demanding jobs simply on the basis of a genetic test, with no interview and no testing of skills -- as Vincent/Eugene is hired at Gattaca. Even in a gene-obsessed society people would know that you can't always judge a worker on the basis of his or her POTENTIAL, which is all the genetic information can tell us!The message of the film is that biology is not destiny; it is statistical probability, but the probability can be transcended by the individual spirit and will. It's a good message, no question about it. But its value is undercut by the fact that the futuristic model of genetic determinism challenged by the film is highly improbable and muddled.The problems of the film are compounded by a weak murder-mystery element tacked onto the plot, and by the dull and bland acting of Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman. The most impressive and moving performance by far is that of Jude Law as the real Eugene Morrow -- arrogant, self-pitying, self-destructive, cynical, and yet in the end capable, it turns out, of true nobility.Visually, "Gattaca" is powerful and striking; the film does a great job of creating the cold, sterile, inhuman look of an inhuman futuristic society. Particularly fascinating is the scene in which Vincent/Eugene, out with Irene for an evening on the town, loses his contact lenses; of course, Irene doesn't know that he has very poor eyesight. Seeing nothing but a blur of flashing light, he has to cross the street and then pretend to look at a beautiful sight Irene wants to show him.Unfortunately, the visuals often end up overwhelming the story and the characters. "Gattaca" is worth a look, particularly for those who like futuristic films, but it does not live up to the importance of its subject.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good ideas, bad story. Good questions, no answers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea of dealing with the issue of the century was timely, and this is probably why this film receives over 200 comments and over 10,000 votes today at IMDb. The issue regarding genetic engineering does bring us realistic concern, and hence raises a lot of questions in our mind. So we naturally expect some insight from this film. We don't get any. What the film does, instead, is merely to re-phrase the questions which we are already asking.In addition, the plot was oh so lame and boring. Having genetically modified male and "organic" male as brothers was a brilliant concept.But alas, the film spoiled this and reduced it to a swimming contest (a very minor spoiler). Swapping identity, again, was another plot which could have brought to fore a lot of issues, but the story dealt with this as if a 10 year old writer-wanna-be would have handled. And as pointed out by others, the murder case was nothing but a mess. And lastly, what in God's green earth was Uma Thurman doing in this film??? It would have been fun, at least, if she was the killer (another minor spoiler, I guess).If you've never had any thoughts on genetic engineering, this film may leave you with disturbing questions. To that end, the film deserves credit. But if you've already had hopes or doubts about this issue, there's nothing new in this. Not even the beauty of Uma will be enough to keep you entertained.If you're going to tamper with a provocative theme, at least try to tackle the issue rather than just describing it!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intelligent, thought-provoking and exciting tale of genetic engineering</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think GATTACA might be one of the best sci-fi movies to come out of Hollywood in the last 20 years. It's certainly far more engaging - and, indeed, thrilling - than THE MATRIX, which I should imagine has dated somewhat with its over-reliance on CGI effects throughout. The sci-fi of GATTACA is far more realistic, as this is a story of genetic engineering and the consequences on those affected by it.GATTACA is a thoughtful, unique, and compelling story. It all feels unusual and confusing in the first five minutes, but soon gets the viewer up to speed with an excellent back story. Once the main part of the film grips properly, I was hooked. Almost all of the suspense sequences in this movie - and there are plenty of them - are original, feeling fresh and inventive. This is a breathless thriller indeed that feels like a classic Hitchcock film in some places.I'm not usually a fan of Ethan Hawke, but I can admit that he's perfectly cast in this film and Uma Thurman is fairly good too. The standout is Jude Law, playing a tragic supporting character, who makes the film his own with an understated performance. As a whole it's just completely refreshing to see an intelligent piece of science fiction film-making based on ideas rather than soulless effects and other nonsense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scarier than any horror movie, it shows our true nature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the idea that we should not judge others by appearance, we've all done it at one point or another. But what if it was your own genetic traits you were judged by? Gattaca explores a world where the human race is perfect in every way thanks to genetic alteration, and where the naturally born, imperfect ones, are left without hopes and dreams from the moment they are born.Vincent is a child who beats the odds, naturally born and with a heart condition and possible ADHD. His brother, genetically altered to be perfect, leaves his parents often forgetting Vincent's existence, and trampling his dream of space travel. Then one day, a genetically perfect but suicidal and confused man, Jerome, gives Vincent a chance. The problem is, despite the extensive lengths Vincent takes to "become" Jerome aren't stopping detectives from getting closer and closer to the truth.I saw Gattaca during a class unit on social identity and I have to say it was a really amazing movie! The characters are very complex, from Irene (a woman who appears perfect but in fact has a minor heart condition that prevents her from most space travel) to Jerome (seemingly perfect but suffering far more than the imperfect Vincent is). Strangely enough, "designer babies" is getting closer and closer to becoming a reality, which I find disturbing and wrong. Not to mention it's selfish, just because a parent wants their baby to look like Dakota Fanning or Justin Bieber or to not have health issues does not mean that tampering with a child's life is worth it. Modern parents honestly need to wake up, as do scientists, the topic might seem like a trend now but messing with human DNA to create perfect children, especially when there are so many adoptable children in the world in need of caring parents... ugh, there are times when science should not advance and this is one of those times! Gattaca also points out that anything is possible. Vincent proves that having physical/mental disabilities can't stop us from achieving our dreams, and that if we listen to society maybe we'll miss out on finding our real talents. Six years ago after failing math and being diagnosed with depression, fibromyalgia and asperger's syndrome, I highly doubted I'd ever be like other people and I gave up on my dream of publishing fiction novels. Well, after seeing Gattaca I ended up writing a novel and now I've got several published books. We all have talents, regardless of outside factors.highly recommend Gattaca, with its wonderful soundtrack, creative characters and eye-opening story, it's a movie we all need to see. It reminded me of Martin L. King's "I Have A Dream" speech, and hopefully we can all learn from it. We as humans have the scientific technology for sending the whole world into a nuclear holocaust, and the power to force everyone to conform to environmentalism without input from factories and corporations. The technology to clone and alter humans is out there. The difference is that we don't do these things, because if we did, not only would we be causing irreversible changes to society, we'd be losing our legacy as a human race within our own mistakes.I also recommend you watch Never Let Me Go (2010) and Village of the Damned (1995) along with Gattaca. All three of these films feature genetically superior beings and the ways society deals with them.</fullReview>

The story is plain beautiful...really inspiring and it really motivates you to achieve your goals no matter what...you think to yourself "if he made it after all these sacrifices then there's nothing I can't do" Vincent's devotion to follow his dream really makes a difference!The ending is rather unpleasing though..I really hated the way Jerome ended his life!!The direction and acting was excellent..I especially loved Ethan Hawke's and Jude Law's performances and of course Uma Therman was stunning as always! The music was amazing and I especially enjoyed the piano scene with the song that can only be played by a twelve-fingered person!All in all, this movie is a pure piece of art and I absolutely recommend that everybody sees it more than once, so that you can notice the small details that make a difference!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Andrew Niccol directed this fascinating futuristic tale starring Ethan Hawke as Vincent Freeman, a space-loving man who wants to be an astronaut, but is deemed genetically unfit, and only suitable for "menial" jobs that don't fulfill his potential. One day, he is contacted by Jerome Morrow(played by Jude Law) in a scheme to swap identities, and enable Vincent to live his dream. After a training period, the scheme works, but when the project supervisor is murdered, the ensuing police investigation threatens to expose his real identity... Uma Thurman costars as Irene Cassini, his love interest. Imaginative and thought-provoking film with a compelling story that is ultimately quite moving, with beautiful art design and sets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gattaca is a great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film review GattacaIt is important to keep in mind that technology will always have a big impact on us, especially in the future. ?Gattaca" is a science fiction film released by Andrew Niccol in 1997. Andrew Niccol is a famous director and movies like "The Truman show" or "The Host" were written by him. The main characters are played by Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, Jude Law, Loren Dean, Ernest Borgnine, Gore Vidal, and Alan Arkin. The movie represents a society that is based on liberal eugenics. Children are be separated in "valids" and "invalids" right after they are born. People are no longer getting discriminated by, for example, their skin colour. Now it's down to people's genes. People that decide to have a baby the natural way are most likely to have children with diseases so they are not "perfect". "Valid "children are selected through their genetic diagnosis so they won't have obstacles like cardiovascular diseases. The main character in "Gattaca" is Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke). He is considered as being an "invalid" because his parents decided to perceive him naturally. But his biggest dream is to fly up into space. The problem is that "Gattaca" that would prepare him only accepts "valid" people. His only choice is to take over the identity of Jerome Eugene Morrow (Jude Law). He was a swim star who was injured in a car accident. Now he's paralyzed and sitting in a wheel chair. Vincent uses Jerome's "valid" DNA via hair, blood, skin, tissue and urine samples to pass the screening but also for the "interview" to get into "Gattaca". A few days before he will be able to go up into space the administer got killed because he was trying to cancel the mission to the universe. Detectives found one of Vincent's real eyelashes close to the place where the administer was murdered, but they can't identify him because there is no invalid registered in "Gattaca". Even though it's risky, he is not canceling this "project" and day by day he is coming closer to his dream to go to the 14th moon of Saturn for a one-year mission. The cop who is trying to find out who killed the administer is Vincent's brother Anton. To show who is stronger they swim as far out into the ocean as they can. Vincent wins and has to rescue his brother. At the end of the movie Vincent is about to enter the space ship but he has to take a urine test. He didn't bring one of Jerome's samples because he didn't think about it. The doctor, who has a son who also has the dream to fly into space but can't because he is an in-valid, realizes he is an in-valid but still lets Vincent pass the control. While Vincent is in the space shuttle taking off to the moon, Jerome sets himself on fire. Vincent opens the "letter" and finds a hair sample of his now-dead friend Jerome. My personal opinion about this movie is that it is very emotional, dramatic and exciting. I really felt with Vincent and sometimes I thought I was actually really inside the film. It is sad and emotional because everything is being shown how it could be in the future. It's also sad that people are still getting discriminated even though it's because of their genes. I would recommend this movie because it shows the huge impacts technology can have on humanity. My wish is that this, will never happen because there shouldn't be segregation due to people's genes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This fantastic movie humbled me a lot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watch it.As a kid I wanted to become a scientist specialized in genetics... I wanted to mess with the human DNA... create monsters, but also super humans... but that movie isn't about that... merely perfecting people to make them less likely to have diseases, violent impulses and have good looks, better endurance, intelligence... perfect for a normal human...This really appeals to me... I know deep down that it's evil and Hitler like... but I always believed it was for the best and a fantastic idea...Until I saw this movie.It showed someone who was born naturally... fight against his own discarded fate... to reach his dream. He turned out to be more resourceful and a better person than a killer whose DNA would have never been suspected... surpassing even the DNA of someone who was born with the utmost perfect fate, but with a tragic accident, saw it all go down in the garbage in an instant...It shows how that values such as passion, determination and resourcefulness are forgotten but shouldn't be... that we shouldn't just assume that someone has no future, no matter how unprivileged and even handicapped his start might be... the heart and will can have a tremendous weight in the balance... and that very power, which allowed the most humble to surpass the most gifted became more powerful by being trained by the very hardship and flaws that we thought made him inferior...That movie really made me think... and help me see that the people that we dismiss have tales to tell, values that we are clueless about, wisdom that we can't even suspect... all thanks to the hardship they went through... and that's what made them better people... not a ton of money.I was born with the greatest brain, I could have done anything... I thought that I could do anything alone, but it's meaningless if no one wants to believe and hire you... meaningless if you're too sick to even move... fate isn't everything...The music, the actors, everything was perfect in this movie. It's one of the few that actually showed me that some people are even more clever and wiser than me... I really respect the creators of this movie for being able to show me why my idea of perfection was wrong so brilliantly and in an entertaining manner; but don't expect explosions all over the place... it has a sort of nostalgic pace...I just plain love this movie. I feel a sorrowful fondness every time I see the name.Jude Law said this about it (see his biography): It was the first time I felt I was making a script I believed in, and that I'd see something on screen close to what I'd hoped, rather than this vaguely confusing wilderness my jobs had been to this point. It was my first project with quality minds behind it, Jersey Films, Andrew Niccol and Ethan Hawke, who was a joy to work with. I felt we had a real meeting of the minds. (On making Gattaca (1997)).Thank you for this movie. I want more of this.</fullReview>

But all in all the film have to much comprehension gaps, which complicate the whole understanding.The film has a really strong and significant story but it is also confusing to understand who is who.The film has a wonderful statement: you should fight for your dreams. So I think that the idea of making a film about genetic engineering,the love story and the surprising end was good but the realization not as good as I hoped for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unpleasant filters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some reason the director chose to film every scene through a tobacco-coloured filter, making it appear as though you, the viewer, were immersed in a bowl of urine, peering out at passing events. Whilst this has relevance to the plot, I did not find it a pleasant viewing experience. The whole thing was subdued with minimalist acting techniques to match the minimalist sets. Michael Nyman's music was very jolly in places but otherwise the whole film is something of a downer.The idea, as you probably know by now, is that in the future only genetically engineered persons are cool whilst people born by natural means are in-valids. It's a very interesting topic and one well worth exploring but this film fails to do the ideas justice. It's just so cool that, in the end you don't care very much. Pity. The players are pretty good especially Ethan Hawke as the in-valid and Jude Law as the crippled valid who supplies the necessary biological material to get Ethan accepted into the right circles.The main problem is lack of tension. Even when Ethan is being hunted down as a suspected killer the director fails to capitalise on the potential. For the odd few seconds you suspect the film is going to come alive but then it returns to plodding along towards the inevitable conclusion, letting the viewer sink further and deeper into his or her aquarium of urine. There are no car chases, nothing goes bang, crash and the sex is very subdued. Not that a film has to have sex and violence in spades but, if it doesn't, it better offer us a very good storyline, characters and plot. Gattaca doesn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gattaca (1997)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Andrew Niccol's Gattaca, in my humble opinion, is the peak of the motion picture art form. All aspects of the production serve the story spectacularly. Vincent (Ethan Hawke) is one of rare naturally born children, who is condemned to die in young age with 99% percent probability. Vincent wants nothing more than to be an astronaut, so he buys himself a different life as Jerome (Jude Law), who has been crippled in an accident. From here begins Vincent's deception game to reach the stars. Basically the plot deals with the issues of human spirit: what Vincent can achieve despite of his condition. Can he be better than the perfect people? Can he deceive everyone? Also there are lots of issues between the perfect and their humane flaws and how Vincent as flawed contrast with them. Gattaca represents a rare genre of intellectual sci-fi movies that contains minimal amount of action and none of larger than life stuff (usual weapons and monsters kind) This kind of genre is heavily relied on the actors and settings. Settings for Gattaca are originally adapted where the future children are not conceived naturally, but through genetic engineering. This has brought up new kind of racism: perfect versus flawed Watching Ethan Hawke's role as Vincent evade the relentless pursuit of the authorities while trying to be on the Titan mission, romancing Irene (Uma Thurman), and micro-managing his samples from Jerome (Jude Law in a very impressive supporting turn) made for some the most riveting viewing ever. The best part for me regarding the movie is the greed and passion Hawke carries to be successful on his mission despite the disabilities on his side......At that point of time it doesn't matter whether he gets caught or not but his passion really stole my heart giving an insight into the hard work he really does although is not very legal though... Do watch the movie for great screenplay,stunning cars,and great sets and decoration and Uma Thurman delivering a great performance in one of the most glamorous role of her career accompanied by excellent acting of two leads well played by Eathan Hawke and Jude Law. The retro-style art direction, script, acting, music, and lighting all brought to life, much too chillingly, a cold and soulless world where the content of your genes counted for everything while the content of your character counted for nothing.My Rating - 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the whiny narration, melodramatic music and romance subplot resembling a Barbie movie, Gattaca deserves a place in the movie cabinet because of its talented acting, suspenseful plot and dark, chilling message about genetic discrimination. Although Hawke's character is the lead, it is Law's character who really shines in this film, adding life and energy to otherwise flat scenes. While the pivotal scenes such as the swimming race are often plagued by sappy, violin-dominated music, they carry the movie and skillfully develop the characters. It may not be your all-time favorite drama, or even sci-fi, but Gattaca is worth a watch because of Law's superb acting, the suspenseful plot and the overarching message that genetic imperfection is no reason to discriminate.bitesizemoviereview.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gattaca ranks near the top of my favorite films. It never fails to make me feel like I should never give up trying to reach my own goals, despite the difficulties. And I love the way that Irene, after suddenly discovering Jude Law in place of Ethan Hawke, still stands up for her man, and helps him when the "Hoover" cop is after him. Gore Vidal is perfect as the ambitious, murdering Director. His remark to Anton, that "nothing that would prevent one from being a police officer, for example", when Anton questions him about the mental capabilites of the Gattaca workers always cracks me up. And the musical score is fantastic and suits the film perfectly. Lastly, I love the way Irene and Vincent wake up the night after being together, and as she washes her face, she believes (incorrectly) that Vincent has committed murder, yet she still loves him and protects him.</fullReview>

The narrative technique, which I will not reveal, was very effective especially because of an "element of surprise" that is revealed close to the end. Ethan Hawke is a proving to be a GREAT actor with his multitude of roles (in movies like "Reality Bites", "Dead Poets...", "Great Expectations", etc.), Uma Thurman is perfect for her role, Gore Vidal is very effective as the aloof director of Gattaca, and Alan Arkin is quite funny. The Art Direction is marvelous, but you'll have to see it for yourself.The haunting music of "Gattaca" brings pictures of scenes from the movie whenever I play the soundtrack. This is my favourite film of 1997 after "L.A. Confidential" because "Gattaca" explores the apprehensive possibility of a phenomenon that would affect us in our time; genetic perfection versus the uncertainties of fate. "Gattaca"'s one-track narrative endeavor towards its theme seems more compelling and passionate than Truffaut's "Farenheit 451".I give it an 8.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sci-Fi / Film Noir Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gattaca has emerged as a definite contender in the movie sci-fi canon. Niccols sharp script and excellent direction make this a very watchable film. The art direction is excellent, using what look like contemporary modernist architecture and interiors to create a natural futurist look which is obviously taking us not too far into the future, and the costume design is straight out of 1950s noir, Haeke and Law in large lapel double-breasted suits and kipper ties, the police in long trench coats and trilbies. The story is classically simple - a small guy pretending to be someone else falls foul of a random murder and becomes embroiled in hiding his identity during the police investigation. He eventually overcomes all the odds and achieves his goal.Niccol mixes sci-fi and film noir, not in the way Dark City (1998) did a year later in its use of time shifts, surrealism and aliens, but as a straight-forward police / crime movie using genetics as the point around which the story revolves rather than say race or class. The three leads - Hawke, Thurman and Law are believable as the imperfects all striving to achieve their goals in their own way, and for me it is Jude Law who, in one of his early big screen outings, is really at the centre of the film. Nice to see Gore Vidal making an appearance as the weary director of space operations and Alan Arkin is excellent as the police detective, and there is also a cameo from Ernest Borgnine as a cleaner. A Excellent movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With irony</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have proudly added Gattaca to my DVD collection and recommend it for it's entertainment value and it's strong story and characters, brilliant cinematography and for it's relevancy 15 years later. In 1997 I would have said that this movie was science fiction, today I think it is more science fact than fiction. Special effects were a minimum but the cinematography was brilliant. I especially like the 'upside down' love scene and the clean, uncluttered spaces. The story and characters were both strong. These concepts are a raging debate. For instance, where should genetic preselection begin and end? Maybe it would be okay to eliminate health problems (not that I am saying it is) but then is it okay to custom design a baby's features like a house or a car? People can excel by determination alone, overcoming 'handicaps' and beating the odds - so could preselection be denying the world of a Vincent? His determination beat the system and people like Jerome, Anton and even Irene. Additionally, preselection was shown to be flawed at times as was the case with Dr Lamar's son. Preselection is limited when it comes to accidents or the improbabilities that daily life brings. It doesn't matter why you see it, just see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is about a young man who has a dream to go to space, but he isn't perfect enough to make his dream come true. The name of the boy is Vincent. His parents wanted a naturally made baby, and he was born with heart disease. After that unsuccessful experiment they decided to make a perfect baby. Now, Vincent had a brother, Anton who was better at everything. That was like a challenge for Vincent, he wanted to prove to everyone that he could be successful and it didn't matter if he was created or naturally made. The story is set in the future when nearly all the people are perfect so there is no place for Vincent. He can't have a good job or other priorities. It takes place in America where Vincent was born. He dared to try and find a person who could help him to pretend he is perfect. He found a man, Jerome, who had no genetic problems. Jerome is a young man who was a swimming champion in the past. He always wanted to be the best but in the very important competition he came only second. After his failure he tried to commit suicide but became an invalid. Jerome gave his identity to Vincent. Vincent could now do all the analyses and could work in the company which was planning a very important mission connected with space. Vincent has a great flight plan so he is chosen to go to space and complete the mission. However a week before the mission, his boss is killed and the police come to investigate the murder. They start to test everyone in the company. Once, the police are really close to knowing the truth, but they don't find out who he is in reality. I like this movie because it shows us the real ambition of a young man who was born with a lot of problems but found a true friend and the woman he loved. Finally, he made his dream come true and went to space.</fullReview>

Sacrifice. Movies nowadays seem to just have funny, witty, big action, big Hollywood film stars with crappy script. They sell the movie on the big names, director, actors, etc.. This movie was way before its time and will eventually be seen as a splendid cinematic adventure with meaning and purpose.

		<shortDescription>Living in a Society Where Discrimination Begins Before Birth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING This review may contain spoilers!Imagine living in a society where discrimination begins before birth, where your genetics determine whether you live a life of prosperity or a life in the gutter. In 1997, Andrew Niccol explored the future of our society where genetic perfection rules all. In Gattaca, Vincent Freeman, a genetic degenerate, assumes the identity of Jerome Eugene Morrow, the picture of genetic perfection, to gain access into the Gattaca space program. Vincent's dream was to travel to Jupiter before his heart was scheduled to stop; Jerome, who is paralyzed from the waist down, allows the use of his perfect identity to help Vincent achieve his dream. Acting/Characters Ethan Hawke gives a brilliant performance as Vincent Freeman. Hawke shows the pain of a person cursed with the "genetic defect" of being what we consider a normal born child. His dedication to the role is seen through Vincent's dedication and drive at stopping at nothing to travel to Jupiter. Vincent is cunning in his disguise as Jerome Morrow making sure to clean and dispose of every hair and nail that may reveal his true identity thus derailing his lifelong dream. Jude Law as the real Jerome Morrow is an amusing character allowing Vincent to use his identity to pose as genetic perfect. Though he is often drunk and babbling about how much of an amazing person he use to be, deep inside Jude allows us to see Jerome's serious and vulnerable side. Irene Cassini is the lover of Vincent and is played by Ethan Hawke's past real life love Uma Thurman. Irene is sort of a cold character, but this is made so by her environment which disallows her (not as genetically perfect as she may seem) to be and love who she wants. She falls in love with Vincent posing as Jerome and is shocked yet memorized when she finds his true identity. Script Unlike most other first time screen writers, Andrew Niccol's Gattaca script was beyond brilliance. He takes us in deep at the very beginning of the film during Vincent's birth. Vincent's father refuses to name his first born son after himself as his name would be tainted by Vincent's genetic deformities. We are taken along with Vincent through his childhood where his is out-shined physically by his younger brother and shunned by his parents. The emotion digs even deeper as Vincent is denied job after job because of his poor genetics. He ends up as a janitor cleaning the ins and outs of the Gattaca building. It seems he will never travel into space even though the very building he cleans specializes in space travel.Niccol finally gives us hope as Vincent decides to take on Jerome Morrow's identity which is considered illegal in their society. Succeeding at literally becoming Jerome Morrow, Vincent is finally given the chance to travel through space as he is accepted into the Gattaca space program. But before he gets his chance, Niccol hits us again with a major stumbling block for Vincent ? murder at Gattaca. Niccol continues to engage us as Vincent and Irene fall in love, and Vincent tries to conceal his true identity as detectives (including his own younger brother) rummage through Gattaca trying to find the murderer. Niccol gives us intense romance and thrill in this science fiction drama that once you've seen, it will never be forgotten.It's quite obvious I am in love with this film. It came out when I was only seven years old. I remember hearing Michael Nyman's brilliant score and remembering it up until I was about fifteen years old when I finally saw Gattaca in full. It's a shame Nyman didn't win best score back in 1998. If you want a look into the future of our society ruled by genetics, check out Gattaca. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been using IMDb for a long time and over these years this was the movie that urged me to make an account. I couldn't withstand the reviews from pseudo-intellectual critics who looked down on it, or worse even, from those that didn't even understand it's basic concept.This is a movie about the struggle of an individual against society and against himself. The emotions of the characters in the seemingly cold environment are portrayed in a way that your own start swelling up. The actors did a great performance. The environment is perfectly correlated to the story, it is recognizable and familiar, yet alien. Despite the depth the movie holds it is very comfortable to watch. The questions this movie raises are many, I don't want to reveal too much, but simply put this is a movie that will move you, that will inspire you,that will make you regain your faith in the stars and make you wonder: what is it that defines us as human beings?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie I Have Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the best movie I have ever seen. I have seen it so many times that my brother and I will frequently quote lines from this incredibly written script, back and forth at random. The lines from the script are delivered by such amazing performances that the scenes will stick with you. Truly, some of the best acting I've ever seen and it's always consistent, never straying even to the slightest from perfect. I would like to point out that the climactic scene where Vincent is confronted by an investigator showcases the best acting I have ever seen and conveys so much emotion that it will literally take your breath away. With that said, every other notable actor in this film does not fall short of that kind of perfection.In short, this is a story of achieving the impossible. A story of the human spirit, or human will. The main character, Vincent, is a social outcast with unachievable aspirations. He makes many sacrifices and overcomes many obstacles, but when his dreams are finally within reach, he becomes the prime suspect of a murder. He also finds himself in love with a woman who doesn't really know him, but slightly suspects he was involved. His relationship with her and every other character further compound his struggle to succeed. Each conversation is a spectacle. It really makes for an engaging film. There is also the aspect of genetic engineering, which is very important to the story. The director, Andrew Niccol, tries to provoke thought in his movies. This aspect blends perfectly into the film, only adding to the complexities, taking nothing away. The music score in this movie is fuel for each scene and really helps transition emotions between them. Everything about this movie is perfect. This film will hit you deep. I'm pretty happy that I didn't use spoilers. I couldn't recommend this movie more. Please watch it. I promise it will make your "top ten". ("Top ten" is a game I play with my brother and my friends to quickly conjure up their current 10 favorite movies and why.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie worth watching even with flaws.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie that I enjoy, but that I have some hesitation in recommending.First, the good things about Gattaca: When I think about Gattaca, the first thing that pops into my mind is Jude Law and the part he plays. Law is absolutely the key to this movie, IMO, and he's riveting. I would go so far as to say that he's the dominating figure in the film, which is all the more remarkable because of the physical limitations his role imposes on him. I believe the movie lives or dies depending on whether you find his character believable.Ethan Hawke in the lead role is also very good, but he just doesn't have the burning intensity that Law has. FWIW, the first time I saw Gattaca, I felt convinced that if Hawke and Law had switched roles, this would have been a much stronger movie. This is not to say that Hawke does a bad job, or is flawed in the role; it's just that when you contrast him with Law and consider the parts they each play, it's hard not to think that it would have been better cast the other way.Visually, Gattaca is a beautiful film. It cleverly invokes a feeling of a future time without having to rely on mind-boggling special effects and other technical wizardry; it's mostly a matter of clever choice of sets, the style of photography, and suggestion.The plot moves along at an easy pace to follow, and the resolution of the conflicts in the film is very uplifting. It's an easy film to feel good about when it ends.That said, there are some problems.One of the major problems for me is what I'd have to call the "ewwww" factor. Without spoiling the plot for anyone, let's just say there's a lot in this film about testing of bodily fluids and biological specimens. Yeah, they have to address this issue, but it's jarring to the point where there were some scenes where I disconnected with the film because of the "ewwww" factor. I don't know if this affects everyone, or just me.There is also somewhat of an issue of credibility of the major premise of the plot. I think it requires somewhat of a suspension of disbelief that was a real stretch for me at times. I know that there are some people who are going to watch Gattaca and just not be able to suspend disbelief, and those kinds of people are not going to like the film very much, if at all.I also think that to some extent, if you don't find yourself liking the Ethan Hawke character and identifying with him, you aren't going to like the film at all.Uma Thurman plays a character who is primarily a romantic interest, and she plays her part well, but she's mostly visual candy. I wish she had had a bigger part in the movie and had played her role in a less detached manner.So those are the pluses and minuses for this film as I saw them. I do believe that if you enjoy the sci-fi genre, you will want to see this film; and I also believe if you're a Jude Law fan, you're going to enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>transcending, intimately engrossing, subtly inspiring, humanity loving movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably my best movie of all time. The relationships between the characters are just beautiful, the scenes in that yellow-filtered colour (which was even more exaggerated when i saw it on a brightness-messed-up pirated copy, that added to the effect), the gentle childly- innocence of the relationship of Hawke and Thurman at the foreground of an institutionally- perverse reality -where the tease of being able to (accurately) measure one materially, through their biology/genes, makes people overlook the immaterial, the soul and all the subtlety of humanity that cannot be reduced to the material - perpetually countering the contra notion of 'humanity being gene-deep'.The plight of brothers separated materially (by genes) yet sharing a bond beyond it. The presence of beautiful humanity within the 'system' itself, hiding out, then popping up unexpectedly in beautiful contrast to the stark materialism. And finally the determination in Hawke's character, his very-cool dedication is so genuine, his quest to transcend his state psychologically which in a 'rage against the machine' way turns into innocently-ruthless life strategy. In this latter way it is as if this movie is in the same world as 'V for vendetta', yet it is so much more engrossed in that reality and into the essence of humanity. The character also reminds me of a (silent) Malcolm X.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All I can say is I watch good films again but i watch masterpieces again and again and again.... this film falls rightly into that category. Gattaca really is an incredible film. I think in some ways it is a one off and certain sci-fi films in recent times could do with looking back to this film for what I think is its core aspect for me 'inspiration'. You cant help but feel inspired after watching Vincent beat all the odds to achieve his dream. It sounds cheesy, but there is something about Gattaca that is different and gives the film its credibility.Gattaca is not about the crazed and stupefying effects that are so prominent in todays movies. Its basic and thoughtful. The performances are brilliant, Ethan Hawke and Jude Law really shone in this film for me. The retro style really gave them and the film in general a stylish and sophisticated edge, it makes it hard to put a specific time on when it is set so therefore leaves it for you to decide how near this possible fate of perfecting humanity is. The cast is brilliant, the music is brilliant, the scenery and above all the concept and message is brilliant. The only sci-fi film thats come close to it in recent times in my opinion is the film 'Moon' but I do not really think it should be compared, i really think its in a league of its own in many different ways and if you have not seen this film yet, I suggest you do so.</fullReview>

The story was original, the characters strong, and it proves science fiction films should be about both ideas AND visuals. Ethan Hawke, Jude Law, and Uma Thurman shined in their roles, and all did really good jobs. The premise is very intriguing. and the film does force you to think about the way society COULD manufacture and about the advancement of technology and genetics. The visuals are also really outstanding. The cinematography is beautiful, and the music score really wonderful and fitting.

		<shortDescription>An Extremely Underrated Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this movie recently due to my younger brother's request. Having similar tastes in movies as him, I decided to rent this movie right away. And I can honestly say that I am extremely happy that I didn't put this one off. From the very beginning of Gattaca, I felt an instant liking for the main character Vincent(Hawke). The time period takes place in what the movie calls as "the not too distant future," and Vincent finds himself a genetically imperfect "invalid" and outcast in a rapidly changing society. This new world puts heavy emphasis on the genetic perfection of the individual humans which constitute this "perfect society." As the story progresses, Vincent comes to realize that his true place and purpose is not of the world around him, and becomes infatuated with becoming an astronaut. However there are difficult barriers which Vincent discovers he must surpass so that his seemingly unattainable dream can be realized. On an endnote, Gattaca is a superbly made film with all the ingredients which are required for a perfectly balanced film. Gattaca has a wonderful blend of romance, suspense, science, and also has an excellent script that allows me to give it a solid 10/10. I can honestly say that this movie is one of the most underrated films ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Never Saved Anything For The Swimback...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's a science fiction with n funky aliens, no city-sized spaceships but with pure art and brilliance. One of the most inspiring scripts I must say and very well written as well.This is one of those movies that you love along with all it's plot holes because the point it makes ultimately makes all the plot holes redundant and you can only feel awestruck by the sheer intensity of the story and its characters.Gattaca happens in the 'not so distant future' where babies are ordered to be made out of sperms and eggs of parents and genetically engineered t perfection. A world where people assume genetic perfection to be he ultimate measure of your capacity and those who lack it are treated like an underclass is a mind-blowing concept in itself. And the there's Vincent, a child of natural birth, with a 99% probability of heart failure who refuses to play the hand he's been dealt, who refuses to believe that he can't reach the stars just because he's genome is supposedly faulty, the determined hero who'll stop at nothing to get to his goal, who's here to tell us that it's possible to exceed your genetic potentials, to tell you that there's no gene for human spirit. And the way Andrew Niccol puts it is no less than pure genius. A special mention must go to Michael Nyman whose original score raises the movie to new heights and Slawomir Idziak whose eye-pleasing cinematography makes the world of Gattaca real enough for us to get intrigued in the drama.I know it has plot holes,like there's no way no1 notices his lenses,there's no way that he never loses a hair at d workplace etc. But then as Vincent,who's heart is 10000 beats overdue, puts it for Irene... "You are the authority on what is not possible, aren't you? For what it's worth, I'm here to tell you that it is possible. It is possible. "or the way he put's it to his brother "Here's how I did it,I never saved anything for the swim-back."And with these mesmerizing quotes,I too refuse to believe anything is impossible to be achieved once you truly put your 100% into some goal,then no one or nothing can stop you...Not even your own genes!</fullReview>

This is backed up by an excellent performance from him as well as the rest of the cast who portray their characters extremely well. I think the drama and sci-fi mix in this film is done with great thought and care which makes you think a lot more about the ideas and issues raised in the film. I also especially like the little touches, such as a DNA shaped stair case. One of the only things I could say might be bad about this film is that you have to be ready to watch a very sad film with an open mind and I am not always in that sort of mood haha. But if your fancy watching a really thought provoking film with a fantastic story then this is the film you should to watch. One other thing that makes this so good is that it isn't too far fetched and after watching it it feels like something similar could actually happen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Film about the Human Heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When an avid film buff friend of mine - whose opinion I trust -- told me she did not like this film, it took me a while to figure out why. GATTACA tackles an idea that made her very uncomfortable: that those of us who are able bodied enjoy special privileges in our society, and that perhaps, just perhaps, without even thinking, we have set up the game so that those less able bodied will find it very difficult to succeed. My friend, a great beauty, fit and given every advantage in life, did not like to face the fact that she is part of this privileged class and might in fact hold, or play part in a society that holds, such a bias.I am surprised at how few reviewers mention this aspect of the film and I suspect that for them as well as for myself, it is simply an uncomfortable subject. But GATTACA tackles it bravely using the time tested method that science fiction does best: it puts you in the other person's shoes. When the protagonist goes through the turnstile to enter the elite academy he has worked so hard to get into, a drop of blood is drawn from his finger. An instant DNA test shows whether his genetic material is of high enough quality to enter the facility -- 'valid' -- or if he is just a mere God child like us, whose genes were left to chance and the predispositions to disease that come with it -- an 'in-valid.' Certainly, the point could not be more obvious, discomfiting though it is.This Great Films tackles many other ideas as well: fate, the ability of the human heart to triumph over adversity, the burden to succeed placed on those given every privilege. All these ideas are wrapped within a whodunit. The screen play really is quite an accomplishment in the way it tackles these many issues within the framework of the story. The art direction is also very notable as is the location (at a Frank Lloyd Wright building). The music, too, is top notch and adds much to the film.There are several outstanding performances in GATTACA. Jude Law, one of the finest actors working today, is at the top of his form here. Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurmin's performances are both very reserved -- it seems that genetically modified humans are all cool cats -- but when they do show a flicker of emotion it is all the more powerful for that. Ernest Borgnine is here, too, in a brief supporting role. It is always good to see him.GATTACA is on my list of favorite films, and it has stayed on it for over ten years now. It is inspiring and full of truth. When you've watched it you may agree with me that a good rule for life is: never save anything for the swim back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A little masterpiece of science-fiction from and about the time when everything will be governed by the genome of every individual. You will be identified through it, you will be followed from birth to grave by it. Good morning Vietnam, good morning genome-drome, genoism. You will be nothing but a complex DNA identity. Too complex to memorize, but any machine can memorize even more complex things and recognize them. But here we have several couples of interest and rivalry. A child born naturally and whose fate is doomed to be deemed bad and it is supposed to be bad, and life expectancy is as low as some odd 30 years. On the other side his brother was genetically correct and perfect. Unluckily the former has a dream and the latter has none. The former is motivated to do what only the genetic elite can do, and he is not. The latter is motivated to do nothing except be a bureaucrat that will trace out all the "fakes", the non-genetically perfect who are trying to go through nevertheless, frauds in other words, like his own brother. The latter will find a way to go through the genetic selection by assuming the identity of a genetically perfect man who suffered a severe accident and cannot be anything any more. That is hard work, but that is possible because they are only dealing with machines, as long as they are dealing with machines. But there comes a time, and it is a lot earlier in the story than you may think, that one will trace the fraud but will say nothing because he has a personal reason to see if the fraud will go through and that the fraud will go through. Remember: it is a Mark Twain trick: a right handed man normally holds his penis with his right hand when he urinates, and a left handed man does the reverse. The details of the end are not interesting here. One thing is interesting though. If the future world decides to become genetically correct we are going to cheat a lot because success anywhere depends on only one thing: motivation, first and foremost, and intellectual and even physical qualifications are only second to that motivation. A small prodigious marvel to be seen by anyone who believes man is better and more important than science which is only an extension of man's mental and nervous system, not a replacement, a prosthesis.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID</fullReview>

Gattaca really is Science-Fiction in the sense that it took the existing science promises at the time and projected them in the future, trying to imagine the impact it could have on people's everyday life... Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman are amazing at expressing their fear of being rejected by society for not being perfect (not everybody can be Leelo Dallas Multipass ;-) What is the supreme bing? Who is the real winner in society? Firmly recommended... still today!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just wanted to step in and give this movie a 10. "Gattaca" is my personal favorite movie - not the best movie ever made, mind you, but it's my favorite. It's well made - the acting is flawless, the script is great, the sets are beautiful. It's engrossing, interesting, thought-provoking, deep, special, one-of-a-kind.I'm not sure who gives a better performance - Jude Law or Ethan Hawke. Both are incredible. And Lorin Dean is also a personal favorite of mine in his role.If you haven't already watched this movie in biology class, I suggest you go out and rent it now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the not-to-distant future, Ethan Hawke (as Vincent Anton Freeman) wants to be an astronaut. But, he is an "In-Valid" - that is, he is considered genetically inferior. When he was born, Mr. Hawke's parents could not afford a good geneticist. So, Hawke was born with a lackluster genetic quotient. Grown up, Hawke gets a janitorial job in the space facility "Gattaca". Determined to join a space exploration mission to Titan, he becomes a "degenerate" - switching identities with genetically superior Jude Law (as Jerome Eugene Morrow), a champion swimmer who is in a wheelchair, after breaking his back. Mr. Law stepped in front of a car, after "winning" a silver medal. ("You don't win silver, you lose gold.")As "Jerome", Hawke qualifies for space travel. But, a murder investigation at "Gattaca" threatens to derail his liftoff. Moreover, he risks discovery by beginning a relationship with mysterious and alluring Uma Thurman (as Irene Cassini). ("O brave new world. That has such people in it!") Writer/director Andrew Niccol's "Gattaca" has some obvious scientific flaws; and, its astronomical knowledge regarding our Solar System is dated - but, it was 1997, after all. The film has a much larger story to tell, however, and is faithful enough, to its own scripted universe.Part of the ending dampens the film's triumphant spirit somewhat. Mr. Niccol rightfully (and righteously) elevates those considered "genetically" inferior, but what does "Gattaca" provide those who are disabled after birth? One could read Law's finale as a "triumph" of sorts - and, there is a story-arc for the progression of his actions - still, it's a downer. It helps that this film is so intellectually stimulating, however.Inarguably, the "Triumph of the Human Spirit" is portrayed exceptionally; by not only by Hawke, but also supporting characters - like Xander Berkeley (as Lamar) and Ernest Borgnine (as Caesar). The great subtleties, given by Niccol, to these characters, are very satisfying. Alan Arkin, Loren Dean, and Gore Vidal leave you wanting to know more about their intriguing secondary players. The direction, photography, sets, editing, stars, and music are award-worthy. ******** Gattaca (1997) Andrew Niccol ~ Ethan Hawke, Jude Law, Uma Thurman</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An underrated Sci-Fi about the not-to-distant future...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This sci-fi/thriller is a scary reminder of what our world might look like in the not-to-distant future. Ethan Hawke plays a man who is discriminated against because he is of natural birth. In other words, he was not genetically engineered, so he is relegated to janitorial duty the rest of his life, that is, until he finds another way. Full of futuristic philosophies and technologies, this film includes exciting, edge-of-your-seat moments and challenges the idea of what it means to be human. The great plot is supported by awesome sets and visuals that literally take the viewer to the cold, hard time ahead. Uma Thurman is adequate as Hawke's co-worker and object of interest and Jude Law delivers a very solid performance in his role. I've never been a huge Ethan Hawke fan, but he does about as good as anybody else would have as the main character. One of my favorite sci-fi films, this one is highly recommended for your entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mesmerising sci-fi classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a classic movie that I saw somewhat reluctantly...I think it was well liked by Margaret and David on the original The Movie Show, but I saw it with not very high hopes on VHS.What I took away from it was admiration for it's style, lyricism, and spellbinding nature.What I remember from the movie (I saw it many years ago) was the science fiction scenario presented in it. These days there is much media speculation about genetic modification and its implications for humanity. This movie is basically a riff on this topic.The world of the movie involves genetically 'superior' people having more rights and possibilities than the so called 'invalids'-people who are genetically 'inferior'.The movie focuses on one such 'invalid' (played by Ethan Hawke), who wants to have the same kind of chances as the genetically 'superior' people. Extraordinary steps are taken to achieve this.Even though much of the content of the movie has slipped from my mind, what stuck with me is how spell-binding it was to watch. Lovely performances all round, great cinematography and terrific performances.Other must watch movies which deal with philosophical themes: The Matrix, The Thirteenth Floor and Dark City. These were all 'niche' movies which made Hollywood watchable again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who Do We Think We Are?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, now; here's a rare piece. Here is a genuine science-fiction story, as opposed to science fantasy. But it's got a lot more that that.The movie prognoses a future in which our lives and careers are defined by our genetic quality. If you're top-drawer, then the chances are you're the product of carefully controlled IVF. If you ain't, then you were probably conceived by some other, more disreputable way, like sex.All the good things open before the right people. The wrong types, however, find themselves sweeping floors and clearing rubbish and other menial chores. That's the system. There's no bunking it. It's a genetic apartheid. No bad thing, some might say. It's only an extension of Darwinism after all.The story centres upon an also-ran with ideas above his DNA. He wants to fly a spaceship, not push a trash-truck. And there are ways...Jude Law plays a top-drawer who has been accidentally crippled. He and the second-grade dreamer - played by Ethan Hawke - do a deal. They swap identities.They share their home and their lives completely. Law's character supplies whatever his alter-ego needs for medical tests - skin, blood, urine: anything. Their relationship becomes increasingly complicated and intense as their identities begin to merge. At the same time, there is an equally complex and exciting drama played out as Hawke's character so often risks discovery. In fact he's highly intelligent and extremely athletic and is almost the right stuff. But almost isn't good enough. He has eye and heart problems.The two concepts run side by side and are really quite stunning in their execution. Law and Hawke were of the new breed of Hollywood leading-men. Not toughies from the traditional mould like John Wayne or Bruce Willis, flawed in character but morally sound. Instead, these were the pretty boys. Slim, and handsome in a rather effeminate way, ego-centric and not entirely reliable. 'Metro-sexual' is the term, I believe. To allay any suspicions that they might be gay, Uma Thurman is cast as a love interest for Hawke. As such, hers is the easiest role imaginable, being little more than a series of rolled eyes and coquettish smirks. But the quality of acting between the male leads is quite outstanding. They bicker and feud in a way that seems perfectly natural.Astonishingly, that old-time Hollywood heavyweight Ernest Borgnine appears as little more than an occasional cameo in the role of foreman cleaner. That an Oscar-winning actor of yesteryear is seen doing menial chores and cravenly offering to dispose of Hawke's empty coffee-cup, seems deliberately scripted to emphasise the draconian and ruthless nature of the regime. Despite spades of talent, his sterling career was almost always that of a supporting actor simply on account of his rather brutal looks. The message seems to be that only leading men (and women) matter. Supporting stars, and past success count for nothing. Security systems and tests are also extremely well thought out. The only test not made manifest so far as I could tell was a retinal-scan, which struck me as rather odd as it is fast becoming an identity standard today. Their fraud goes more or less to plan until - there's a murder. This brings in the police and a review of security.The idea that humans will be designed and evaluated according to their genetic constitution is a very plausible pitch. Already IVF babies have passed from disease screening to characteristic selection, for such things as eye-colour and so forth. And insurance companies are all very eager to get their hands upon clients' genomes as an in-depth guide to health risk assessment. As indeed are employers and snoopy governments. It's a frightening prospect and this movie pulls very few punches.There is an excellent soundtrack and theme music. The set-pieces are imaginative and well-crafted. I particularly liked the retro-fitted electric motors to older model cars like Rover's '2000'.There's so much to enjoy in this movie, including an unexpected and fraught little twist at the end. Believe me, for a thinking-person's sci-fi flick, as opposed to a space shoot-'em-up, this undervalued little gem has everything you could wish.If some want to describe it as a classic, I for one won't stand in their way. Off-hand, I cannot think of a better effort. It knocks the slightly similar and more flamboyant and famous 'Minority Report' into a cocked hat.Seeing really is believing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Little Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the future social status is governed by genetic make up, where the elite are those with all physical and psychological faults, defects and imperfections removed pre-insemination. Amidst this society, one man attempts to achieve his dream, even though he was born naturally and has a genetic disposition towards heart disease.Bewilderingly overlooked at first release, Niccol's film is a wonderful blend of script, design, cinematography, score and performance. All credit to Sarah Knowles and Jan Roelfs for creating such a stark, clinical yet incredibly stylish environment - the use of iconic 20th century automotive designs (Rover 2000, Citroen DS, Studebaker Avanti) as Gattaca's vehicles is a masterstroke. Niccol's achieves just the right level from each of his actors - amidst so many horrible career performances, Law is brilliant here (as he was in Entertaining Mr. Ripley), whilst Hawke creates a compelled and compelling hero. Finally Michael Nyman's score weaves itself through the plot beautifully, at once both gripping and deeply moving.Hugely recommended both as a stylish and subtle piece of sci-fi and as a dramatic, cleverly constructed thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Sci-Fi Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gattaca was a great treat from beginning to end, only occasionally losing itself within itself every now and again. I found the premise of the story extremely interesting and was what I originally wanted to see the film for. As the story progressed however I began to feel for the main characters more and specifically loved Jude Law's character of whom he had done a great job of bringing to life. The character that I felt wasn't fleshed out as much as they should have been was Uma Thurman's, which also hindered quite a bit of the plot involving her relationship and feelings for Vincent (Ethan Hawke). The story between the brothers may also have been a tad clichéd but in the context of the story, it was a lot more interesting, original and compelling to watch than I've seen so many times before.And so it was somewhere during the middle of the story where I felt the story began to get a little too comfortable in the telling of the romance between Irene and Vincent because of insufficient characterisation up until that point: I just didn't buy it. I was far more interested in the genetic technology present in this future and the discrimination that it entailed for the 'In-Valid' citizens. It is a theme that can be extrapolated from any society in the history of mankind and so makes it both relevant to us today and also of our history. Of course the film makes a direct reference to this when mentioning that it is science, not skin colour these days that determines your class. Sadly however, we're not treated to more than is accessible during the film which is a real shame because it certainly was an interesting theme to deal with and Niccol seemed very competent at delivering it.In the end, Gattaca turned out to be a very nice science-fiction drama with a fantastic cast and some very original and interesting ideas from Andrew Niccol that I won't forget anytime soon. I recommend it to everyone!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine piece of science fiction; Original story, solid performances and an excellent ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gattaca" is indeed a fine piece of quality science fiction and I really can't believe I've missed it before. Well, by an advice of a friend of mine I decided to buy the DVD and I watched it a week ago. I was very satisfied on the overall result the film had to offer. "Gattaca" tells a story happening in the future, where a man named Vincent Freeman is a natural birth or "In-valid", living in a world in which "designer people" - forged in test tubes - rule society. Determined to break out of his imperfect genetic destiny and fulfil his dreams, Vincent meets Jerome Morrow, a "Valid" willing to sell his prime genetic material for cash. Using Jerome's blood, urine, skin and hair samples, Vincent is able to forge a new identity and pursue his goal of a mission to space with the Gattaca Aerospace Corporation, and enjoy a blossoming romance with Irene, another "Valid". However, a week before his flight, a Gattaca mission director is brutally murdered and Vincent finds himself pursued by a relentless investigator threatening to expose his counterfeit life and reveal him as "In-valid", ending his dreams forever.The main character Vincent is played by Ethan Hawke who makes a strong performance, being at his very best. The best role performance comes undeniably from Jude Law though, who plays the role of Jerome. I've really waited for Law to get a real lead actor role and though this isn't a lead role from him it's still the best of Jude Law I've seen. The character itself has some real depth and though he is sort of an asshole, being witty and using sarcasm as his defence, yet the viewer still feels so much sympathy towards him because of his disabilities and past. To me Jude Law just doesn't get the attention he needs and after this movie I was still left with hunger of more from him - A lead actor role in a drama wouldn't mind me, or even him. Other performances worth mentioning are the performances of Uma Thurman and Alan Arkin. Uma Thurman adds that plus to the movie, the whole romance which works really well with the main plot. Alan Arkin is the enjoyable himself and though he is in a minor role he still gives that certain edge for the film and with a cast like in "Gattaca" you can't go wrong. Solid and strong performances indeed.I found the story very interesting and as I've now become a fan of certain science fiction, sci-fi that tells a story not so far in the future, I found this truly enjoyable throughout. The story is very original and the screenplay is very well written, though there are some unnecessary fill-ups in it. The film gets very thrilling after a while and it definitely has a good catch in it which keeps the viewer interested throughout. The romance -part handles itself pretty well as well and it doesn't bother the main plot at all as it also gets surprisingly significant. I thought the decoration and set-up department did a brilliant job, as the world is indeed detailed, especially the Gattaca Aerospace Corporation -center in its melancholic wholeness is very ponderous and plain, yet being so precise because of the story and it just fits so well with the even gloomy main theme. I still think that they could have made it even better, as in some parts I thought some things were left in half-way, which was a real pity, though it didn't matter so much in the end. The film itself stumbles a bit after the first half and it sort of doesn't move along in while, which was kind of disappointing. But in this case the thing that saves all the stumbling is the ending of the movie, which really makes you shed a tear, so a tear drop is indeed the saving Grace for the movie, as I thought the ending was one of the best endings I've ever seen in a motion picture. I am certainly not going to spoil it to you, as then the movie would lose its whole purpose in the end of the journey. Just see it yourself."Gattaca" is an amazing sci-fi movie and disappointingly a slightly underrated one as well. As I said, it could have been better, but my final rating is mostly going to be because of the stunning ending it offers. I'd recommend it to every science fiction fan or for those who seek for an original thrill, something unique. It includes solid performances, especially from the astonishing Jude Law, and a tight package throughout despite the already mentioned stumbling. It stays in the main theme and it doesn't get messy, although it has that usual unexplainable sci-fi stuff in it, that familiar sophisticated vocabulary, which no-one can follow even when the slow-motion's on. It's still there and it doesn't matter - It's science fiction after all and it belongs in it. All in all, "Gattaca" is a terrific motion picture and if it still doesn't interest you at all you can always watch it just because of the absolutely beautiful ending. Dreams can come true.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Rich and Meaningful Cinematic Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gattaca" is a truly phenomenal film. It is thrilling at times, while at other times completely entrancing. The film is narrated by Vincent, played with quiet restraint and force by Ethan Hawke. Vincent is one of the last remaining naturally-born people on Earth. Prejudiced by all those around him, Vincent dreams the impossible dream of traveling to another planet and leaving his home forever. To do so, he takes on the identity of Jerome Merrow, a former swimmer with a handicap. Jerome is played by Jude Law. Sparks begin to fly as an investigation led by a determined detective (Alan Arkin) ensues in "Jerome's" office. A hidden romance also sparks between "Jerome" and the lovely Irene (Uma Thurman).The acting i the film is award-worthy and criminally overlooked. Ethan Hawke is restrained but potent as the all-but-lost Vincent. Uma Thurman is also fantastic as Irene. She plays the role in a split-persona style, making her character all the more real. Alan Arkin is also great as usual as the lead detective investigating the workplace. However, Jude Law steals the show as the real Jerome Merrow. Playing a dynamic supporting character, Jude conveys his changing attitude and emotions flawlessly, while still trying to take the spotlight off of himself. His actions at the end of the film, while I won't disclose them here, are also enormously deep and poetic. Mr. Law handles the performance perfectly, with just the right levels of charisma and sadness. In my opinion, he should have been nominated for Best Supporting Actor, but he was, like the whole film, overlooked."Gattaca" is a beautiful film, full of ideas and emotions. when you peel off the frontal facade, a whole new world and vision opens yup before you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The greatest book in the world, the Mahabharata, tells us we all have to live and die by our karmic cycle. Thus works the perfect reward-and-punishment, cause-and-effect, code of the universe. We live out in our present life what we wrote out in our last. But the great moral thriller also orders us to rage against karma and its despotic dictates. It teaches us to subvert it. To change it. It tells us we also write out our next lives as we live out our present." ~ The Alchemy of Desire ? Tarun J. TejpalI first saw this film in 1998 with my 6-year old son. And even though he asked a lot of questions, I could see he loved it. I believe he understood it. That's what happens when a work of art is perfectly conceived and executed. The theme, plot and message are so transparent even a relative babe can appreciate them.Last night, now 14 and a freshman in HS, he was looking through our video collection. I was fascinated watching him make his choice. At first, he toyed with films like WILD, WILD WEST and RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARC. Then he chanced to lay a hand on GATTACA, which he had not seen for eleven years, and to my mind, had forgotten."I want to see GATTACA again," he said. I realized his choice would open whole new levels of appreciation. Seeing it again, we were not disappointed. After, my son said, "They don't make films like this any more; there'd have to a long chase and a shootout."Sad, because 1997 was only 10-years ago. It seems like we could have held onto decent stories for a little while longer. In fact, it seems like we could have continued to demand them. 1997 was also the year LA CONFIDENTIAL came out, another under-appreciated film with a great story line. There haven't been many recently.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, Gattaca is not Sci-Fi. Misslabeled as such, this movie has suffered criticism from sci-fi fans. Gattaca is a human drama, one of those in which "will is more important than blood". The future portrayed in Gattaca is very plausible (space travels are a constant, electric cars, endless fields of solar panels) not only for its technology but also human sentiment and discrimination. Once again human beings are categorized according to something totally out of their control. Once it was skin color, education, sexual orientation, religion.. it only seems reasonable that genes are next. But somehow the human spirit always finds a way to overcome even the most absurd obstacles. An extremely well conceived concept in a superb movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the Overlooked Film Festival, Gattaca was the first film presented. We had passes but I wanted to skip this film because I'd seen it before. My wife insisted we go anyway, and she was so right. The mark of great film-making is that you become absorbed in the film all over again despite having seen it before. That was the case tonight. All the leads were excellent, from Uma Thurman to Jude Law to Ethan Hawke, all excellent and easy to watch and care about. And the plot and the choices made by the director were so evocative of another world that it was essentially a vacation for my head as much as an intellectual exploration of the possibilities of a world centered on genetics.It was particularly entertaining to watch every detail of Uma's face, body and performance and compare that to the way she was in Kill Bill. And it was Jude Law's first American film for which one of the producers was chastised for having chosen someone with a British accent to be one of the elite. Jude more than does his part.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the best movies out there, in my top 100. Even though I watched this movie over several days, it did not lose its message.The movie starts out with Vincent being a god-child, de-gene-rate, Broken ladder, or in-valid. The way the writer uses the term in-valid is very clever because the word can also be pronounced in-va-lid (an infirm or sickly person). By being genetically inferior, vincent is discriminated against and can only get lesser jobs such as being a janitor. He pulls of one of the greatest underdog stories in movies (even greater than dodgeball). With an all-star cast such as this (Tony Shaloub, Alan Arkin, Uma Thurman) I am surprised that the movie did not get better ratings and recognition.Even though this is a Sci-fi movie it really does have a good plot and meaning, it really makes you think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Subtle Dramatic Conflict and Thought Provoking Questions of Bio-Ethics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise of this film is that in the not so distant future, the idea of "designer babies" will be both accepted in an extreme form and almost have become the norm of society. So obviously within the first few minutes of this film questions of whether humans should tamper with the natural reproductive practices have some light shed on them. Should we use technology to better the population through an "unnatural means", is another interpretation of this issue that resides throughout this film.The plot itself is centered around Vincent, a man who was born using natural means and is likely to have heart failure by the time he is thirty. In the aforementioned world that he lives in this prevents him from doing anything that most people would see as significant. However his will forces him to find a way to realize his goal of becoming a space explorer.The plot is very strong it flows and has a dreamy and surreal quality to it. The conflicts of the plot are not made overly dramatic. Which in my opinion has thrown some other reviewers who have panned this film off. The conflict like the plot are very dreamy and don't have the harsh tone that is common in many mainstream films. The conflict is not hyped up in an unnatural way. The plot itself because of the dreamy feel moves at a relatively slow pace. So if you think that you will like this movie because Sci Fi films usually have fast paced stories and lots of action don't watch this film because you wont enjoy it. However the plot's slowness serves to give the viewer more time to consciously question the ethics and issues that are raised in the film.The characters of this film are superbly acted and magnificently constructed. The characters who play major dramatic roles in the film are not archetypes. Nor are the characters particularly likable. The protagonist has a great heart and will, but at the same time he is flawed in his selfish and overly competitive nature. Which is probably the reason why I respected the character construction so much. Characters should not meant to be likable they should be meant to be real.Altogether if you are looking for a fast paced Sci Fi film with lots of action stay away from this film. However if you seek dramatic thought provoking conflict and a moving human drama, then I definitely recommend you watch this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I came into this movie with VERY low expectations (my friend watched it in her physics class, of all places), but I was wrong. Gattaca instantly became one of my favorite movies! This movie has an engaging plot and and an easy-to-love hero, thanks in large part to Ethan Hawke, who can't help being lovable. But Gattaca also has a worthwhile--and yet subtly conveyed--message. It is a classic underdog story, and as with all good underdog stories the viewer absolutely adores the hero, a genetically disadvantaged but determined man who has always dreamed of being an astronaut. Sound cheesy? It probably should be, but Gattaca somehow avoids being another sappy beating-the-odds movie. I highly recommend this movie not just for watching once, but for rewatching-- it's even better the second time!</fullReview>

Boy, I was wrong; Gattaca is as good as any other movie that I used to like at that age, but I didn't know that until now.The appealing of the movie, is not visual effects (there is hardly visual effects, and the few CGI shots are not that great), is not the action, (there is no action sequences in here), it is the story and the boldness and imagination of the ideas that are presented that are really attractive to your imagination.That's an amazing achievement, keep your interest for 2 hours, without the usual action sequences, and it's so good, that you're going to find yourself thinking about the movie at least a few minutes after the movie ends.Bring more of these ones. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Gattaca" is about manipulating human DNA and shows some possible results of doing it: The hero's parents want to fond a family the traditional way and so Vincent Freeman, played by Ethan Hawke, is born with imperfect genes. His parents regret their decision and when the mother gets pregnant again, they erase all diseases from the embryo's DNA. Vincent tries to compete with his "valid" brother Anton and one day he really succeeds. After that, he scoops new hope and leaves his family to start a new life and to achieve his dream. At the beginning, he works as a cleaner at "Gattaca" but one day he gets the chance to work as a first class navigator and to go into space. This is what he always dreamed of and so he really wants it. But there is only one way for him to make his dream come true: He has to give up his identity and to become Jerome Eugene Morrow, who is played by Jude Law and who is paralyzed due to a car accident but has the perfect gene code. Vincent has to change his outward appearance to look like Jerome and he even lets a "doctor" break his legs to make him taller, because he has not the right height. He passes several blood and urine tests at "Gattaca" because Jerome supplies him with his blood and urine. The first time his identity is really in danger to come out is when the mission director is found murdered and a detective founds an eye leash of Vincent at the crime scene?I liked about the film that it was thought provoking. I asked myself the following questions: Is genetic engineering enrichment for our society or does it create new problems? Is the individual losing importance because of the possibility to interfere in human DNA? "Gattaca" is a dystopian movie but on the other hand it would be very positive if we could prevent birth-diseases, which shows that those questions are difficult to answer. Moreover, the movie is timeless. It was shot in 1997 but it is still current. It deals with a topic which is very up-to-date and which will probably become even more important.I was impressed by the way how Jude Law played the paralyzed Jerome who sells his identity. With his desire to die despite his perfect genes, Jerome is a very difficult character. Jude Law succeeded in showing the depth of this character. Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman also mediated in an impressive way the purposes of their characters: Uma Thurman (Irene) was a perfect example that emotions and the individual can't be suppressed and Ethan Hawke (Vincent) showed in a moving way that success doesn't depend on genes but on the personal efforts.The movie is well done it isn't only worth seeing if you're a sci-fi fan. It creates a realistic image of the possible development of our society. I can't think of anything to criticize on that movie, which is why I'd give it 10 stars in a star rating out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What about a carefree future?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a not so distant future, human beings can be genetically constructed before birth. The risk of disseases and bad character trades can be reduced. As an effect, a new upper and under class develop. People who are born naturally cannot compete for jobs with the so called "valids", They can just clean their workplaces. One of these "invalids" is Vincent Freeman, played by Ethan Hawke. From the youngest age on he is not as good as his little brother Anton, who is the best possible product of his parent's genes. Vincent has the utopic wish to take place in a space programm. He finds out, that their is no way to fulfill his dream. No legal way. So, he decides to take the identity of Jerome Morrow, a by accident chairbound valid. Jerome gives Vincent blood and urine samples to pass the daily controls. With Jerome's help Vincent gets one of the best and perfect employers of Gattaca. Only a mysterious murder and his own brother can keep Vincent from fulfilling his dream. This story does not seam unrealistic like many other future predictions do. The whole setting does not try to be futuristic. The cars and buildings are classic and clean. The clothing is simple and classical inconspicuous . The whole movie is filmed without many colors. Everything is kept grey. The music is also a bit sad, but suitable for the whole atmosphere. All this helps to focus on the main thing in this film. The story. For a better understanding, the main character plays the narrator, too. This way, his childhood can be summarized without any problems. The spectator should think about what is happening. Nevertheless, the story is entertaining and exiting without many action scenes. Despite the coolness of this future society, there is still place for a love story. It does not deflect from the main topic. It helps to get a realistic profile for this society. The role of the blond Irene is casted well with Uma Thurman. The changing between the cold society and the warm love story is felicitous. Ethan Hawke manages to play the perfect 1st class navigator and the excited and nervous "invalid" in one person. All in all, i can really recommend to watch Gattaca. In times where the Nobel prize for medicine is given for DNA researching, this movie gives an idea of what hazards this technology contains not just in biological terms but also for the society. It is not necessary to think about these problems. You can just enjoy the plot (if you want!). But this is not just another Hollywood movie for two hours of entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>G-A-T-T-C-A ? "Valid" (pre-)disposition of the future 102minutes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gattaca USA, 1997 Direktion &amp; Script: Andrew Niccol ("The Trueman Show" 1998) Actors: Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, Jude LawGattaca, a Sci-Fi movie which manages without space action and tells a hortative story from a world changed by new possibilities in human genetics.Andrew Niccol arranges a society in the 21st century where skin, hair and other outward appearances becomes non relevant for differing people, DNA become it. Biology gives parents the opportunity to influence the genetic code of their unborn children. People with the best predispositions of their parents are so called "Valids", natural born people are "In-Valids". In the realistic dystopia of Andrew Niccol is the bought DNA all you need for a positive job interview.Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke) is an "In-Valid" who became a "Valid" and tells his prehistory in a flashback. He, a brother of a stronger "Valid", Anton Freeman, and with a life expectancy of 30 years, he dreams of space but his genetic information seems to lock up this way to universe. At the day he swims against his brother and wins, he realizes that he can dare the impossible. He leaves home and works as a cleaner. One day he cleans at Gattaca, an aviation-center. His dream returns, but also with lot of training and learning Gattaca does not want the ambitious Vincent, because of his DNA. A criminal intermediary brings him to Jerome Eugene Morrow (Jude Law), a "Valid" bound to a wheelchair, who sells him his identity with blood, fingerprints, hair and everything Vincent needs to become Jerome in the eyes of Gattaca. As Jerome he works soon as a First Class Navigator at Gattaca. After a colleague is killed the flashback ends. Vincent gets the victims place to fly to "Titan", a moon of Saturn, but because of the incident many policemen search for the murder. Vincent must be very careful especially since they found one of his real eyelash. Will he be able to leave the hated earth which does not want his real identity?The Science-Fiction-Thriller Gattaca engages with a topic which became by "Dolly" (or cloning itself) and stem cell research more current than ever before. Vincent leads the viewer through a dystopia of discrimination and cleanliness, without flying cars, talking robots, alien species, broken skyscrapers and space action in speed of light. This affects a high potential of self-identification and skepticism concerning out future and science. Abacterial settings help the atmosphere. The story line combines the life story of Vincent in a new world, love and a crime thriller. Life and position in this society is mainly good pictured by the different Characters. The mostly inconspicuous soundtrack of Michael Nymans brings more atmosphere in the flashback. Some Easter eggs, like a double-helix-stair or the title itself consisting of the DNA bases, make the movie more interesting. Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman and Jude Law are able to satisfy the expectations.The storyline is not able to meet demands of a love movie or an enthralling action-thriller. Most time the film is calm and does not reach a high motivation to watch it repeatedly. Old cars with just green lights and electric sound and normal clothing make it sometimes difficult to accept this as future. First Class Navigator, Vincent's dream-job, makes a simplistic impression by non-stop-tipping. Beside the "Marin County Civic Center" (San Rafeal, California, 1952 by Frank Lloyd Wright) the setting is not very futuristic and diversified. "In-Valid" life is only showed by the cleaning scene, other circumstances are not clear. Probably because of time shortness, Andrew Niccol gives no direct information about the political system or interests. Camera work is not very eye-catching, but satisfying. Star Wars fans will not fall into amazement by the used special effects.In my opinion the film targets men as well as women, whose are more interested in story than in action. Gattaca is no funny children's hour or senseless entertainment.In my opinion Gattaca is because of the mentioned points and despite of some scarcities a good and advisable movie to brood over. Gattaca attaches more importance to conversations and story than action, as Michael Bay's "The Island" (2005). The viewer sees in the 102 minutes a new world, with new kind of discrimination, different destinies of the characters and a murder case of upper quality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GATTACA is a science-fiction- drama about a genetically</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film ReviewGATTACA: A movie about the gene-manipulated future societyGATTACA shows you what the world will be like if you continue living this way! So think about it!About the writer: The writer of GATTACA is Andrew Niccol, a talented New Zealander who also wrote "The Truman Show". The audiences and critics recognized GATTACA as one of the most intelligent science fiction films of the 1990s.Quick take: GATTACA is a science-fiction- drama about a genetically caste society in the future where a person's genetic make up determines the social class and future. A natural born man tries to succeed in travelling to space although his imperfect DNA.Connection between the movie and the society today: Today one of the most interesting and the (most) often discussed subjects in society is the genetic engineering. Doctors and scientists think to have a research assignment because they have the possibility and the know-how in order to cure and prevent diseases and in order to discover more about the biological system of a human being. This is the one hand, on the other hand there are arguments against interventions in nature. Religious people and others decline genetic engineering due to moral and ethical issues. Should human beings create other human beings after their model and imagination and act like God???Plot: Vincent Freeman is one of the last "natural" born babies in a genetically-enhanced world where society is divided up into "valids" (genetically engineered) and "in-valids" (natural born). Vincent is supposed to die at the age of 30 because of a congenital heart condition. In-valids are discriminated and fated to low-level occupations while valids qualify for positions at prestigious corporations such as GATTACA, a space company. In order to achieve his lifelong desire and life's aim Vincent assumes the identity of Jerome Eugene Morrow, a valid who was crippled in an accident and works at GATTACA. He uses samples of Jerome's hair, skin, blood, urine in order to pass the gene-tests, e.g. for entering the company. At GATTACA the mission director is killed. By chance an eyelash from Vincent is found at the scene of the crime. The policemen, one of them is Vincent's valid brother Anton Freeman, start the investigations and Vincent lives in fear to be discovered. While working at GATTACA Vincent falls in love with Irene who loves him and who discovers his real identity. Finally Vincent subverts the society's social and biological barriers and travels to space. Jerome commits suicide.Analysis: GATTACA as a dystopian movie shows a merciless and discriminating elite-society where imperfection and mistakes are not allowed. GATTACA can be seen as a forecast or a warning to everyone, giving a push to think about the consequences of genetic engineering. By reading the taglines (headlines) you already get an impression about the film's plot: -There's no gene for the human spirit! -How do you hide when you are running from yourself? -Only one criterion: Genetic perfection! -Only the strong succeeds! GATTACA is a movie about the excessive intervention in nature and the discrimination against those who came into being by love and not in a laboratory. It is shown to what the wish of improvement and optimisation of the human being can lead. In GATTACA we find several hints to genetic engineering. The company's name GATTACA is composed of the four letter code of the DNA-nucleotids and the staircase in Jerome's house is like a double helix of the DNA. The example of Jerome shows that perfect genes are not equivalent to happiness and success. In sports he was only second best. Jerome was a valid but because of the fact that he was crippled in an accident and now is paralized he became in-valid. He does not succeed in life. Vincent, what means winner or victor is the proof that ancestry and parentage are not that important and that the human being achieves his/her aims by willpower. Vincent has not a perfect DNA and he is expected to die young because of his congenital heart condition but he shows strength, perseverance, tenacity and heartfelt humanity, warmth and sincerity. He saves his valid brother's life twice who outdoes him at nearly everything, when they have dangerous swimming competitions although he risks his own life. Vincent subverts the society's barriers and overcomes his DNA-imperfection.Actors, target group, a movie for kids? The movie has a "star-filling" with Ethan Hawke as Vincent, Jude Law as Jerome Morrow and Uma Thurman as Irene. The actors identify with their roles and play very well. The movie is rousing and interesting for both men and women, perhaps not for kids because they do not think about ethical and moral issues and do not have the background knowledge about cloning or gene research. Kids do not think of the possible consequences in future and could be afraid when they see how society could be like. For teenagers the movie is interesting because they should think and reflect about subjects treated in GATTACA. In the movie there is a murderer and you see a bloody corpse. Jerome commits suicide and you see people drinking and smoking, but there is not much brutality, violence and no sex-scenes.My opinion: I really like the movie and the plot because the subject interests me. After having watched the movie I thought about genetic engineering and the pro's and con's.I was impressed by the message of the movie that you can achieve your dream by fighting hard for it and that Vincent acted ethically in an in-human environment. For me GATTACA is a parable (parabola?) of discrimination in this case against genetic "inferior" subjects. I associated it with the discrimination against religion or race in our society.So my advice to YOU: Watch GATTACA and form your own opinion!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gattaca and the Draw Between Nature and Nurture (I actually wrote this for AP Biology)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though impossible to predict the society of tomorrow, one can hope that the inhabitants will physically resemble Uma Thurman, Jude Law and Ethan Hawke, but lead not lead the predestined lives of their characters. The film Gattaca predicts a future dominated by genetic determinism and it ain't pretty. Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke), pays the consequences for his conception of love by being born with a body too sickly to bear his fathers name. Uma Thurman plays his ladylove, Irene Cassini, a sweet piece of genetics who supports Vincent despite his "imperfections." The most poignant portrayal is Jude Law's as Jerome Morrow, whose impeccable genes enable him to do anything ? save heal a spinal injury. The institution Gattaca is an aerospace firm where the main qualification for employees is a passing performance on a DNA test. Vincent dreams of traveling to space and is determined to abolish the many obstacles obstructing his goal. Though Gattaca is a delightful, enthralling movie, how much of a realistic depiction of the future is it? Today's society is a not-so sneak preview for the world in which Gattaca can exist. Invitro fertilization is becoming an increasingly more reliable method to conceive assuredly healthy children, which brings up the issue of which precautions should be taken for safety and which precautions are superfluous or even ethically unsound? At birth babies can be screened for a summary of their genetic future ("heart disorder-99%, life expectancy-33 years"). This raises the question, how much can we really know based on genes alone and almost more important, how much do we really want to know? Genetic discrimination is a growing practice amongst health insurance companies so it's feasible to apply that same discrimination to employment opportunities and other fields. As seen by the DNA analysis booth in the film, with a single hair sample a woman can cancel her date for Friday upon discovering that he has an 80% chance disposition to alcoholism. The cleverest prediction the film makes is the black market business of stealing another's genetic identity. With the new demand of genetic perfection must accompany a new supply. Wheelchair-bound Jerome Morrow's exemplary genes don't benefit him, so Vincent steals his genetic identity. He uses Jerome's urine and blood samples, plants his hair samples in his workspace and tries to erase his own presence as much as possible.The films shows personal triumphs or defeat against presumed genetic ability as an anomaly, but in our world nature and nurture have equally weighted roles when determining an individual. Personal histories and life experiences are just as pertinent to a person's essence as the unique nucleotide sequence is. Though born with perfect genes, Jerome only earned the silver medal. And though his genes give him the ability to run marathons, his crippled legs are the real determining factor. Vincent, who is born with a plethora of disabilities, still manages to swim farther away from shore than his genetically ideal brother in a game of chicken. The moral of the story is that genes are not entirely divinatory. The problem with the story is that no informed person believes that they are anyway. The Human Genome Project revealed that only 30,000-40,000 genes constitute the entire human genome ? a blow to genetic determinism. This limited number suggests that the present genes are incredibly complex (making it nearly impossible to be able to pick out a brown hair, green eyed embryo) and that maybe all the answers to the questions of humanity cannot be found in the double helix. Though science and technology improve exponentially, they know their limits, something the world of Gattaca failed to learn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic! See this movie no matter what genre of film you like!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I rented this movie, I thought that it would be quite boring, as it is about genetics and heredity. But it is anything but that. Ethan Hawke plays Vincent in a futuristic world, where you are discriminated against not by your race, appearance, or religion, but by your DNA code and who your genes meant for you to be. Vincent is desperately trying to join a space-exploration program, but his genes are faulty, so he takes on the DNA code of another "perfect" man. He is soon accused with the murder of one of the space-station professors which he did not commit, but somehow there is DNA evidence linking him to it. Many interesting things happen on his journey to achieve his space-travel dream, and he meets a beautiful young woman (Uma Thurman) who begins to question his identity. This movie is incredible, it has amazing special effects as well as great acting and beautiful futuristic-scenery (it was nominated for the Art Direction award at the Oscars as well as Best Screenplay). The film is full of drama and it has a little bit of every genre packed into it (drama, romance, sci-fi, and many more). See this film no matter what!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite an entertainment, but sadly nothing more. The story is great, unfortunately the director didn't quite catch the meaning of the plot, naturally, comparing to the classic, such as Star wars, Blade runner, etc.The leading actor Ethan Hawk should show some more of his acting talent; luckily, on the other hand, Uma Thurman is a pure diamond and gives a movie "a special touch" and she's definitely the best choice for leading female role.After all, not a bad movie, but i couldn't lose the feeling, that it could be much more than that....a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's written in the genes but spoken by mankind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billed as science fiction, this film is more like a moral enquiry into genetic engineering. This weighty issue is wound round a cute little story about Vincent (Ethan Hawke), a man endowed with a congenital heart defect which will probably kill him off by the time he's 30. He contrives to beat the system and get on board the next manned mission to Titan (one of Jupiter's moons), despite some obsessively tight genetic selection and fitness testing by the launch organisers. I guess I knew when I saw Gore Vidal as the director that things at mission control might be a bit sloppy but on the other hand the cops who are out to catch a murderer in the building were pretty committed. They do latch on to Vincent eventually but by then it's a bit late. Uma Thurman as the fellow elite navigator (but licensed only to go around the sun) doesn't have much trouble looking like she comes from another planet already. Ethan Hawke is fine as Vincent but I really enjoyed Jude Law in upper class Brit mode as the guy who has everything genetically but sells his identity to Vincent after breaking his back (I guess he ran out of medical insurance). Initially dismissive of Vincent, he is captured by his vision and audacity and becomes a loyal supporter.It is suggested in the film that maybe we should leave our destinies a little more to chance than is technically possible. Yet Vincent, in trying to make his dream of becoming a space navigator come true, leaves almost nothing to chance. Along the way he gets helped by various rebellious cogs in the technological machine who admire his spirit and say "well why not give the little bleeder a go." His chances of making it back from Titan might not be great but it's the trying that counts. If man can overcome genetic disability to such an extent then does it matter all that much anyway? Our basic nature, with all its flaws, is reaffirmed, and through hard work we gain the stars, as the motto says.This film lacked the depersonalisation much science fiction has, although the premises of Gattaca were suitably alienating. The production design was actually retro - Uma drove a Citroen DS convertible (the "Goddess") from the late 50s and the cops tooled round in Rover P6 sedans from the 60s. Both cars incidentally were the last word in motoring modernism in their respective eras. Vincent's apartment interior looked like something Sir Terence Conran would have done if he'd had a lot of space and a Hollywood studio budget.At the end of the day there are no easy answers to the moral and ethical questions genetic engineering throws up so one can't really expect a movie like this to do more than raise some issues. Perhaps one consolation is that however smart we think we are in manipulating those strands of DNA our creator will still have some surprises in store for us. Some "defects" may not be defects at all, in the context of the survival of the race as a whole while some "desirable" qualities may in fact be weaknesses. Being human, we can't help but plan, but when our plans go wrong it's equally human to say "what the hell."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A potentially terrible film made good by design and acting. CONTAINS SPOILERS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took several viewings for me to fully appreciate this film: the good, the bad and the merely eccentric.On the good side, the performances are amazing, from Gore Vidal as the Gattaca Corporation boss-type to Ethan Hawke as the hero to (especially) Jude Law as the crippled, self-hating Valid who helps him. Even Uma Thurman manages to shine, despite her part being so slender you couldn't see it if it stood sideways.The design is also stunning. I don't know whether they shot the whole film through a green filter or what, but somehow the future that we see is visually distinct without being all that different from the present. (Vincent's minimalist apartment wouldn't look out of place in present-day London or Manhattan.) The look of the film is a wonderfully understated elegance, not a hair out of place, reflecting the regimentedness of the characters' lives.On the bad side...well, first of all the science is seriously dodgy. Niccol attributes to genetics things which are only partly genetic, if that, and over-simplifies horribly. Anyone who actually knows about genetics will cringe a few times at the mistakes he makes.Also, the dialogue is appallingly banal. I found myself able to predict what the characters would say next -- the *first* time I saw it. And that lessens the credibility of the characters. Thank Goodness all the actors are so bursting with talent, or else this film would have been duller than ditchwater.And as for eccentric...well, where were all the passers-by? This future seems curiously empty. I know, I know; there was plenty of traffic, and the concert-hall was full, and there were the Gattaca employees...but these somehow didn't seem like real people, more like video constructs to make us *think* there were people around. I dunno, maybe it was just me.(spoilers ahoy)Another thing on the "good" list, for me, was the ending. Up until the very end, I was convinced this was going to be yet another individual-fights-the-system-and-wins film, the kind that Hollywood puts out so regularly with no regard for realism. Because, let's face it, when an individual fights a huge institution, the chances of said individual winning are minimal. Institutions can only really be fought by groups of people joining together in common cause (viz. unions against big business, environmental groups against polluters etc.). But the ending of Gattaca is neither the unrealistic "I fought the law and I won" ending nor the realistic, but downbeat "I fought the law and the law won" ending. Instead, it's the third possible ending: "I defrauded the system and got away with it, and this is a good thing, because the system is morally corrupt."This kind of ending is much rarer than the other two, because it's so subversive. It's not a huge leap from seeing the society portrayed in a film as morally corrupt to seeing *our* society as morally corrupt. That Niccol opted for the difficult, pessimistic, and yet not disheartening choice of letting Vincent get away with his deception without changing anything about the society itself or even so much as making a Bold Statement about genetic engineering speaks volumes about his willingness to take risks. It's not a conventional ending by any manner of means, especially when you factor in the suicide of Jerome.Speaking of which -- I don't think the death of a major character has moved me so much since Charlotte's Web. What a truly heroic act -- and from a character so previously unheroic! Due in large part to the charisma of Jude Law's performance, Jerome is deeply sympathetic...yet he has considered himself a failure all his life. He drinks, he indulges in bouts of self-pity, he expresses contempt for life, other people, and, in one particularly memorable scene, the planet Earth ("this ball of dirt!"). It may be a cliche that you don't know your strength until it's tested, but it's true all the same; and *we* don't know Jerome's strength until the very end.You might just think that it's a macabre and unpleasant way of committing suicide and no more, but think: as long as Jerome is alive, Vincent is not safe. There is always the possibility of Vincent getting caught as long as Jerome remains as, so to speak, a skeleton in his closet. Jerome, in fact, kills himself in order to set Vincent free, and does in it such a way as to make sure that no remains are left behind to incriminate Vincent, despite the intense pain this must have caused him.Now *that's* love. And evidence of a far more convincing and profound relationship than the tacked-on romance between Vincent and Irene. Let us not forget that Jerome gives Vincent a lock of his hair to take with him on the trip...when he wasn't going to need it for a DNA test. The greatest love story never told. But that's just my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Gattaca": A Four Letter Word</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gattaca": a name made up of the four letters biologists use to map the nucleotides in DNA.There are lots of great-looking "science fiction" movies out there, but a rare few that, deep down, have the DNA of "Gattaca." The stylish cinematography make this film like a fine painting. And like a painting, your heart and mind will be engaged by more than mere appearances.The best speculative fiction, in print or on film, is about people. The science and technology are only an allegory for telling the tale. That is not to say that the scientific premises of "Gattaca" are insignificant--we may one day have to deal with biases for *or* against genetically engineered people. But there is much more to this film than that.If you see "Gattaca" on DVD, be sure to watch the "Coda" in the "Lost Scenes" supplement. (Perhaps the filmmakers removed it from the theatrical release on the grounds that it would focus too much on the technology in the story, rather than the people?)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With the Will even mountains you can move, DNA be damned.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 'progress' of science has strewn the landscape of this world with silly and dangerous myths about human behavior. These myths are perpetuated with authority by the scientific establishment and in time they have the same stranglehold over society and even global culture as the religious authorities once had through their myths. One such myth has resulted from genetic research: that all human behavior, capabilities, character and potentiality is determined by that individual's DNA. Although it is not obvious in the movie, but I am positing here that there is an abstract force in human beings called WILL that is the driving force for intelligence that has almost nothing to do with DNA. It is that force that makes an individual do things that are seemingly impossible on face value, and beyond the indicated scope of the best possible DNA. And if you don't have the Will, even your potential intelligence that may be indicated by DNA is worthless. "Gerome had everything he needed to get into Gattaca, except the desire to do so."GATTACA is a very good satire on this myth and also how damaging this kind of scientific mythology has been to humanity. In the plot this has been done by projecting this myth to its logical extreme into a fictional future society that controls human behavior and assesses all human capabilities according to individual DNA by making it almost mandatory to produce off-springs that are genetically controlled by removing all genes that are associated with diseases or any potential deficiencies in the physiology of the offspring. Natural conception of off-springs is highly discouraged ? almost a taboo and any such persons are refused the top jobs. Vincent is natural born, with a short life expectancy and so he is a janitor, however he dreams of going to a space mission but is rejected only because his DNA isn't good enough, "I belonged to a new underclass ? no longer by social status or the color of your skin ? we now had discrimination down to a science".Vincent manages to get into Gattaca fraudulently by using the DNA of a 'perfect' person, but has to use all the precautions daily so that he is not detected as an 'invalid'. This builds up the tension and the suspense in the movie which lasts till the very end. Another interesting element in the dialogs or voice over is the frequent references to "they", meaning the scientific establishment that has defined human potential only in terms of DNA. "They won't believe that one of their own elite could have suckered them all this time. You don't understand?when they look at you, they don't see you; they see me (my DNA)." When Irene, who becomes romantically involved with Vincent discovers that he is an impersonator and also a 'God child' and not a 'science child', she is upset, angry and confounded as to how Vincent has been able to pull it off despite not having the potential ? the right DNA. Vincent confronts her bias and prejudice and shows her how narrow her thinking has been become because of 'them'. "You are the authority of what is not possible, aren't you Irene. They have got you working so hard looking for flaws that after a while that's all that you see. For whatever its worth, I'm here to tell you that it's possible."This is a must watch movie for those who suspect that the scientific establishment has abused its authority in the educational process of this now globalized culture to narrow down reality only into what 'they' think that 'they' have determined as valid knowledge. This is the presently unconscious terror that 'they' have unleashed upon this world, the terror of the most deadly kind of ignorance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most, if not, "the" most thought-provoking, interesting, underrated, and one of the best sci-fi films that I'd ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first I watched Gattaca in Biology class (which wasn't long ago); I literally fell in love with it. I loved it so much; I had to add it to my DVD collection, so I can watch it whenever I feel like it. After re-watching it today, I enjoyed it even more than the first time I watched it.STORY: Taking place in the future where the society analyzes people's DNA to see where they belong in life, Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke), a man born with a heart defect, dreams of going on a space mission to one of Saturn's moons. In order to achieve that goal, he works at the Gattaca Corporation and assumes the identity of Jerome Morrow (Jude Law), a genetic specimen who got paralyzed from the waist down.MY THOUGHTS: One thing that surprised me was that Gattaca was a box-office flop when it came out back in 1997. The movie had a budget of $36 million and it made $12.5 million domestically. The reason why it wasn't a financial success back in the day is probably because people were expecting it to be some kind of a space adventure like Star Trek or Star Wars instead of a thoughtful sci-fi film-noir. Despite the financial flop that the movie had got, it's an excellent movie quality-wise.The story to Gattaca is very original, well-written, and keeps your interest the whole time. The dialogue in this is fantastic; very thoughtful, very intelligent, and all in all, just excellent. The direction by Andrew Niccol is wonderful; the sets, the lighting, and the atmosphere of this world make the scenes look imaginative and noir-ish (it's a film-noir). The music by Michael Nyman is simply breathtaking. The themes of genetic engineering and achieving one thing in life were well-used.THE ACTING: Ethan Hawke delivers a terrific performance as the genetically subordinate man (Vincent) who wants to achieve an important goal in his life. Uma Thurman does excellent playing a woman (Irene Cassini) who Vincent becomes attracted to, and is one of his co-workers at the Gattaca Corporation. Jude Law was terrific as a guy (Jerome) who Vincent assumes his identity from.IN CONCLUSION: Gattaca is a fantastic sci-fi film-noir about genetic engineering and achieving one thing in life, and dealing with a man and the society around him. If you are into science or if you are a film buff and love science fiction but haven't seen Gattaca, I highly suggest you pick it up, it truly is a fantastic film.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent, thoughtful sci-fi film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some of the best sci-fi ever tends to be fiction that raises big social or political themes and often creates their own world. Gattaca is an very intelligence low key sci-fi film from then first-time writer-director Andrew Niccol.In the future people parents are able to genetically engineer their children to minimalist the risk of genetic diseases and even cosmetic issues such as eyesight, baldness and obesity. Doctors can find out from birth whether a child is at risk of any conditions. Because of this society is divided into two, the rich genetically engineered people who can land any job they want and an underclass of 'faith' births, people with the likelihood of having genetic defects, people who from birth destined to work in lowly jobs. One of them is Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke), a man who dreams of going into space, a man with obvious intelligence and determination but discriminated because it is predicted that he will die at 30. Vincent assumes the identity of Jerome Eugene Morrow (Jude Law), a disabled man with the right genetic make-up. Everything seems to be going well, Vincent has been picked to go on a mission to Saturn's moon Titan, but his life's ambition is put under threat when a man in murdered and Vincent becomes a suspect just because of his DNA.The obvious theme of Gattaca is the idea of prejudice that always been in some form or another. In this future race is not a way to discriminate but of course based on genetic make-up, believing that they are destined to a certain path in life no matter what their actually physical state or mental abilities. It forces an underclass into a vicious circle of low expectations and life of self-fulfilling prophecy. A modern parallel is the American Health Insurance industry where people are discriminated against if they have a pre-existing condition or dodgy family history and if its discovered that someone has been lying then their cover is ended, it a industry that looks to avoid paying out, it is a horrible amoral industry.Added to that police would suspect someone from the underclass because they have a tendency to be more violence, almost like racism in the police where they question someone because of their background intend of looking at other evidence. And someone could be cold and cunning to murder someone without being violence.But there is also a positive theme that despite any artificial disadvantage it can be overcome if someone is willing, determined and able enough. And that how I feel in real life if you are willing to work hard and keep trying then you should be able to achieve your goals.There is also a theme of identity, that someone has to steal someone else's identity so he could fulfil his ambition and deny himself. There is an even bigger issue because Vincent was pretty much rejected by his family because they did not support their son, wanted him to accept his 'limitations'. It could even be played that the son was rejected for being like mixed-raced or gay, but maybe I am just overreading it.Another idea explored is it man's place to play God with itself or simply let nature take its course? Wouldn't any parent want to give their child the best chance in live a good life. It is certainly an issue that is around today because of IVF and it could be taken further and further.I really like the world that Nicoll created. It was a deliberately understated world, a cold world and that makes this world more believable. There seems to be references to great sci-fi like A Brave New World and Metropolis particularly with the ideas of two different classes, the wealth upper class and the underclass that does all the grunt work. There is a period feel to the because of the cars and the dress, particularly the police who look like they are from the 1950s. He made really interest, intelligence film that does not drag at all and keeps it in a tight package.Acting wise there is nothing remarkable but the film the plot and the characterisation was able to make up for it. To me Jude Law was the best performer, starting off as a arrogant and better man who grows to be a more interesting and in-depth man and it was interesting to see him interplay with Hawke. Gore Vidal seemed to be decent enough actor for someone who is not a trained actor. Vincent himself was a very interesting and well development someone who is determined yet faulted, someone who is believable now, let alone in Gattaca's internal reality.A final little note, Michael Nyman provides an excellent classical score, added to the upper class, period feel to this film.If you are looking for a big action, special effects driven sci-fi film, Gattaca is not for you. Gattaca is a very intelligence sci-fi film, taking you into its own version of the future and society could change.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gattaca deserves more credits for all it is.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the breathtaking 110 minutes of Gattaca, I felt as if I've never seen a Sci-fi movie so fertilized, so masterfully written and executed.At the time of its releasing Gattace was rejected by me because of its lack in scale and thrills. Or more explicitly, it's neither Independence Day nor Titanic. And serious drama's marriage with Science Fiction had not been very successful with a few exceptions like Blade Runner. And Gattaca is not intended for 11-year-old.However, after all these years I only regret I didn't see Gattaca earlier. This movie had so much great qualities. From the very beginning, Gattaca had provided the audiences with a sad, blusman-like undertone in which the story expanded. Ethan Hawk's role had a puny, weak feeling attached, echoing the the millions of "nobodies" outside the big screen. When the story entered the 2nd Act, this sad, lament-like tone even sharpened like a very accurate prediction to the near-future, or more accurately, to our very present. Yes, Gattaca is probably the most beautiful lament for human civilization, explaining its crude, inhuman nature and the human souls' struggles in it. Nowadays it's the information era that whoever controls the information controls the world, and Gattaca built its concept on modern days and even expanded it further in a totally convincing way. Actually one can complain about the technically obsoleted visions for futuristic technologies, like the computers Ethan Hawke used are totally like kindergarten stuffs in a 2009 perspective. But anyone paying too much attention to those things very sadly missed the point of Gattaca. With limited budget and scale, it actually managed to absorb everything a functional society can offer into its simplistic but beautiful scenes. Like if you notice, the polluted, green-colored sea and the lifeless, metallic streets can make you sigh, and certainly touches your heart in a different approach than Star Wars or Aliens. Gattaca is a proof that a great sci-fi movie doesn't have to have flying cars or big explosions.I don't want to expose too much of the story, but can only tell you that this is probably the most stunning and convincing sci-fi story ever told on the big screen. Our world had long been dragged in that way for too long and this movie only followed the world's pattern and asked several hypothetical questions. The result? You will be awed. Phillip K Dick will also smile if he saw this.The characters are all great thanks to the superb directing and performances. Ethan Hawke for instance is great in his nervous, witted impersonating character, reflecting Jude Law's pessimistic and broken role. Uma Thurman and Hawke were really very electrical and made the audiences speculate in as many ways as the director wanted them to. Still, the supporting cast was also superb, drawing this beautiful pictures from all directions, and finally accomplished this one of a kind sci-fi story.I am actually lucky to see this movie back to back with Simone, which was also directed by Andrew Niccol. Now the two movies are both in my favorite Sci-fi collection.10/10. It deserved more attention by Academy than just Art Decoration set.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Throughout history, man is forever dreaming of being able to select his own off spring. Arguably, the reason being to avoid the physical imperfections of the past. Convinced this is the best of all possible worlds, science is striving to achieve what is likely to be a double-edge sword. Nevertheless, this futuristic film tells the story of two brothers. One is a natural born child named Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke) who is diagnosed with a heart defect which supposedly will prevent him from space travel. The second is Genetically selected Anton Freeman (Elias Koteas) who is born with the 'perfect' traits to insure a healthy and productive member of the elite. Learning he will be unable to fulfill his dream of becoming a ship's navigator, because of his 'imperfections' Vincent is determined not to be prevented by society's prejudicial restrictions. With the help of a specialist, he locates an ideal subject named Jerome Morrow (Jude Law) who is willing (for a price) to sell his identity. With this new cover name, Vincent begins his quest for space. However even as the years pass and he is finally selected, an incident takes place which endangers his efforts. The director of Space programs is found murdered and everyone working for the company is informed the Police will be on the premises seeking the killer. The movie is dramatic and the story proves exciting as our hero tries to beat the system, the police and the latests in scientific tools and methods. This includes Vincent's perfect brother who is now a determined detective. Audience members should be on the look out for the familiar faces of Ernest Borgnine, Gore Vidal and Alan Arkin playing Det. Hugo. The film has already garnered much acclamation, praise and due to its prophetic subject will in all likelihood, become a Classic. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It makes you think....and that's rare in a film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw GATTACA, I was amazed by the film because although it was mass marketed, it seemed to have a depth to it you just don't expect from films--particularly in recent years. In fact, this film was sort of an "anti-Hollywood film" because unlike the trend, this movie actually avoided special effects and costly sets--instead concentrating on the story. It was nice to see that a film wasn't "dumbed down" for the public but was designed to make you think and challenge you.The story is set in the near future. Space travel is more common, though who gets to travel is the problem. You see, genetic manipulation and perfection have become the norm and so only the very best and brightest specimens get to be astronauts. So, if you were one of the unfortunates in society who was NOT the product of genetic engineering, you cannot possibly hope to join the program but are cursed to be a second-class citizen. While this may initially sound crazy, given science's progress in recent years on creating "designer babies" where parents can not only choose the gender of their children but even the genetics, it seems quite plausible. The world of GATTACA could easily become our world in our life time.Into this snobbish world of space travel enters an interloper. Ethan Hawke plays a man who wants to be in the program but he's cursed with being normal. So, through some very complex fakery, he is able to sneak into the astronaut training program and tries very hard to remain undetected. Where exactly all this goes is something you need to see for yourself.As I mentioned above, this film really makes you think. I am a teacher and was shocked that many of my students actually enjoyed the film, even though conventional thinking is that such a complex movie is probably of no interest to kids--just old farts like me. Well, it isn't true and for once I am happy to report that a film dares to try to make you think! The only negative, and it's not huge, is the very ending. While I love low cost films, the clothing the astronauts wore when entering the rocket seemed silly and anti-climactic. Perhaps a few dollars more spent on the final scenes might have been money well spent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible Story That Will Make You Think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vincent (Ethan Hawke) is one of the last "natural" babies born into a genetically-enhanced world, where life expectancy and disease likelihood are ascertained at birth. Due to die at 30, he has no chance of a career in a society that now discriminates against your genes, instead of your gender, race or religion. Going underground, he assumes the identity of Jerome (Jude Law), who was genetically engineered but was crippled in an accident, and achieves prominence in the Gattaca Corporation, where he is selected for his lifelong desire: a manned mission to the planet Titan. Constantly passing gene tests by using samples of Jerome's hair, skin, blood and urine, his dream is within reach, when the mission director is killed - and Vincent's eyelash is found at the scene. With the once-in-a-lifetime launch only days away, Vincent must avoid arousing suspicion, while passing the tests, evading the police, and not knowing who he can trust.This movie covers many themes; imperfection (and whether there is such a thing), mortality, prejudice, and the power of human determination. The movie opens with a quote from the bible, "What God hath made crooked, let no man make straight." The jacket of the movie will tell you that it stars Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman, but the real star of the movie and the character with the most depth, is Jerome, played by Jude Law. Law gives a poignant performance as Jerome, once a genetically perfect, award winning athlete who was hit by a car and crippled from the waist down. He is a complex character, at once eager to once more have a purpose in helping Vincent achieve his dream, but at the same time, angry at the way his value as a person disappeared after his accident. In the end, when his help is no longer needed by Vincent, he makes a stunning decision that shows the audience the real impact of the society's hostility towards imperfection.</fullReview>

I loved this movie so much I showed it in a class I taught, Law &amp; Society, paralleling the discrimination to that of the Civil Rights Movement. It has the inspiration of Rocky, a quality story without unrealistic qualities, and great actors.Moreover, this is a sci-fi, future flick that does not "overdo" it. It does not give a date, only states "near future" and does not have ridiculously futuristic objects and philosophies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gattaca: 7/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a select few movies you are able to watch in school. Not only must they be appropriate to show in school, but they also must protain to whatever the students are learning. Ergo, about every student in a certain subject watches the same movie. That's the case with biology and Gattaca. It's centered around science, it's PG-13, and it's not boring; what else could you want in a movie to show to highschoolers?In the near future (a time period too often used), most parents decide to have children genetically, so they can alter features both internal and external, to make perfect children. Some don't, though. Those that are genetically created are called "Vailds"; sexually created, "In-valids". Clever, ain't it? An In-valid, Vincent (Ethan Hawke), always dreamed of becoming an astronaut, but couldn't because he was to die at about his 30th birthday. He finds a way, however, by changing identities illegally with Jerome (Jude Law), a brilliant scientist who is now reduced to a wheelchair. In addition, people think that Vincent killed someone at Gattaca, the space station. Did he? Will he successfully go into space?Futuristic movies are always fun, especially ones that actually could happen in the future (which is not the case for the epitome of sci-fi films, 2001: A Space Odyssey), and the possibility of genetically altered children is not far off. And thankfully it stayed plausible: oftentimes movies like this can get carried away in making a special effects show to lose whatever credibility or actual movie-going experience there was before. There were few, if any, effects here, which is a change to science fiction films. It's just a science fiction drama.Having recently learned about DNA and all in biology, I thought that the movie would have more about it, while about the only thing to it is how the DNA nucleotide letters A, T, C, and G are emphasized in the opening credits. DNA isn't really explained much in the movie, but I digress. As interesting as the concept is, Gattaca takes a while to get going, and it seems like a lot of the picture was missing from the full-screen DVD we watched. In addition, many of the characters are extremely undeveloped and exist only to either hurry the plot along or to spew out pithy quotes. And the worst part is, most of those characters are played by great actors, and they don't even get to act. What a waste.Don't let that last paragraph fool you, though. Gattaca is an entertaining drama, and it explores something that will most likely happen soon. If you aren't forced to watch it in school, I recommend it for something interesting to watch.My rating: 7/10Rated PG-13 for brief violent images, language, and some sexuality.</fullReview>

Sci-fi is full of great ideas and concepts, but for whatever reason, the genre produces very few movies that excite the emotions and draw you in in the same way as the best non sci-fi movies.Until this film that is.Beautifully shot in a retro-futuristic style, Gattaca conveys hi-tech in an almost timeless way. Years from now this film will still seem futuristic while other attempts at depicting the future will have become completely laughable. The sepia-tinged film stock infuses the film with a warm yet ultra-stylish feel.Add to that superb acting, a compelling story line and a serious message about genetic screening that looks more and more relevant every year, and you have one of the finest sci-fi stories ever put on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie which makes you think about genetics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gattaca is about a world where humans are genetically designed before they are born. When you want a child, there are two ways to become one. First, the natural way, two people make love and destiny will do it's job. Second, you go to a doctor and make sure that your ?manufactured' child will be very intelligent and disease-free, in other words it will be a perfect child.The main character, Vincent (Ethan Hawke), has come to earth by way of the first method. He has to live in a world where his kind of people, the invalids, are on the downside of society. Discrimination against them is not permitted, but it goes on as a matter of routine nonetheless (just like in our society). They have to do the dirty jobs, whereas the genetically perfect people are doing the intelligent and stimulating jobs. Vincent wants to be an astronaut and travel in space, but he is imperfect and everybody is telling him he will never be able to make his dreams come to true. But will he give up his dream? No, of course not. An important message of this movie is that Vincent is overcoming his shortcomings because of his strong spirit. He may be imperfect but his mind to achieve his goals is very strong. The question that this movie raises is what is more important: perfect genes or a strong mind. Anyway, Vincent cheats on the system by taking on an other identity, namely the identity of a perfectly cloned person (Jude Law). Together they fool the system. It seems that their plan is working and Vincent is chosen to go on a mission in space in a week time. But then? a murder occurs and one simple hair of the ?old' Vincent is found at the place of the murder. Will he be discovered?This is the beginning of an intense and highly gripping movie. It's not an action sci-fi flick, but an intelligently written and well acted movie. The movie has a cold and futuristic atmosphere in it, which fits perfectly. Almost all people who commented on this film are very enthusiastic about it. The only flaws some people see in it concern the plot. They think the movie lacks credibility. Well, I didn't bother. It's very well written and it makes you think (even afterwards) about the subject of genetics. And that is what I appreciate in a movie. That it makes you think and opens new insights on interesting subjects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far Out!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What begins as a brilliant exploration of genetic determinism as demonstrated by our current obsession with genetic engineering and the genome mapping, ends as cliched retelling of the "Outsider who makes good."Vincent is a "god-child" conceived without the aid of geneticists, in the backseat of a car. Soon he is placed in the prodigious shadow of his brother, "normally" and artificially-enhanced Anton. Vincent's dream is to become an astronaut but his predisposition to heartfailure and early morbidity prevent anyone from giving this ambitious young man a chance.He embarks on a desperate scheme to gain a new "genetically-acceptable" identity. All is well until someone is murdered at his office. The film is slow in places, the ending predictable, and the moral clear--you don't know the measure of a man until you know the man. The film was inspiring in places but flawed in others(I find it heavily ironic that the director uses preternaturally-attractive specimens like Thurman and Hawke to convince us that genetics don't matter.) I wish that the writer had avoided what was an unnecessary love story and stuck with what was really surprising about this movie--the recognition that outsiders do not want to gain entrance into the world that rejects them but a real escape from that world.All in all, highly recommended, worth the price of rental.</fullReview>

Ethan Hawke plays an astonishing role in this unforgettable masterpiece that will want you to adore your own self. The morbid mood of the movie, also presented by Uma Thurman, made me admire this movie more than the average person would not even understand it. She makes me want to watch movies more and more, but I fully adore Ethan Hawke's work.I hope he continues to be the same person he always is, and not have to resort to what he did in the movie. All he needed was what was inside of him. That is what makes a good actor. It is fresh talent, and that is Ethan Hawke had in this movie. Pure talent.Overall, Gattaca is a point that shows us that we do not have to be perfect in order to live in a perfect world, we have to have spirit. To achieve your greatest dreams, spirit always comes first. This is the only movie where I purchased the Original Score (conducted by Micheal Nyman) and enjoyed it thorougly.

		<shortDescription>Sheer brilliance in a triumphant story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At last we may have found a writer that can write without feeling he has to put all the typical Hollywood elements in a film (sex, violence, more sex, etc.) to make it a success. Andrew Niccol is an absolute a master of pen.Gattaca is not only a great story with a moral that actually demands one to consider one's own existence, it is also a pleasure to watch is it is so appealing to one's senses. It doesn't feel the obsession of feeding us the typical overly colorful and flamboyant scenery most Hollywood films offer. The cinematography is brilliant as is the script.Uma Thurman gives us her usual masterful performance in the role as genetically less then perfect Irene Cassini, a work colleague of the story's main character, Jerome Morrow, played by Ethan Hawke.Hawke is also quite convincing as Vincent Freeman, who's DNA has predetermined him to a life of mediocrity. Trying to challenge fate and change his destiny, he decides to trade identities with Jerome Morrow, played exceptionally by Jude Law (who was incidentally cheated out of an oscar-nomination for best supporting actor). Morrow was born with perfect DNA and was excelling in his athletic career - with a gold medal or two to show for it - when his spine was rendered paralysed due to an accident (?). The switch is no easy task as the era has state of the art technology and can use a single cell or eyebrow (anything containing DNA) to disclose one's identity. Morrow and Freeman go through extremely intricate measures to ensure that everything from the urine samples, blood tests and fingerprints, to the hairs on Freeman's head only confirm his false identity as Morrow.Gattaca is an inspirational and motivating story that teaches us to determine our own destiny and never to give up - no matter what forces are against us. It tells us that only we can make or break our future and that nothing can stand in they way of a determined soul - including genetics.The film's originality contributes greatly to it's intensity and ability to hold the viewers complete attention in suspense throughout it's entirety.I give it a ten, along with only a handful of films of recent age. (Including Niccol's other recent masterpiece, the Truman show.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superb sci-fi flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, it is possible to have a good science-fiction movie with very few effects. Gattaca is a wonderful cerebral piece that asks the question, "If a person is created with better genes, would the better genes make a better person?" Of course, we know the answer. Nevertheless, in this futuristic world of Gattaca, the genetic make-up of people helps determine the future of their lives. Traits such as obesity and heart disease can be weeded out during an in-vitro birth operation. If you have a baby the old fashion way, you run the risk of creating an in-valid -- someone who has a detrimental genetic make-up.An in-valid named Vincent (Ethan Hawke) does not want to be fettered by his bad genes. He works in a space center as a janitor, but dreams of more. He hires a DNA broker who creates a symbiotic relationship with a DNA donor (Jude Law) who has the perfect genes, but was paralyzed in an accident. Vincent becomes Jerome and is employed by the space center as a programmer. Soon, his excellent work is appreciated and he gets a chance to work on one of Saturn's moons. However, he has to avoid being caught -- women are interested in good genes and sometimes take hair samples to check out those DNA sequences. In addition, a murder has been committed to a director who was opposed to Vincent's mission and Detective Hugo (Alan Arkin) is consistantly checking blood, urine and hair amongst the employees.Vincent also falls in love with Irene (Uma Thurman) who genetic structure is not good enough to get her to work out in space. She has a potential heart condition. She does not know that Vincent/Jerome is supposed to be dead already. They have good chemistry together and make a convincing couple together (ha ha).The best relationship is the one between Vincent and the real Jerome. Jude Law is excellent as the ex-swimmer turned paraplegic who can no longer be himself. He has to live his life through Vincent.If there is any problem with the movie, it is in the way it tried to meet all ends. I do not want to give away any ending, but I felt that it tried to accomplish too much and should have left some issues "up in the air." These issues include the fate of the real Jerome and relationship between one detective and Vincent.Overall, this was a very good movie. It appears at a time where genetics and its use in humans is a reality and not just science-fiction fodder. Gattaca also explores human emotion and relationships with an intensity that is not normally shown in sci-fi movies. I was surprised at how good this movie is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better futuristic films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gattaca is a very good film. It has a well-executed plot, which could have gone horribly wrong if interpreted incorrectly. The directing is wonderful, as is the set design. Everything is pristine, peaceful, and perfect, just like the society they live in is supposed to be. I'm not an enormous fan of Ethan Hawke, but he did well in his role. I am not a fan of Uma Thurman, and I felt she was utterly unnecessary and seemed to practicing impressions of Data instead of Irene, the character she was playing. A character I really loved was by an actor I am unfamiliar with: the real Jerome Marrow as played by Jude Law. Law stole every scene he was in, so much so that I found myself getting irritated when he was not on screen. Law allowed his character to emit such deep bitterness, then slowly allow it to grow to tentative hope in the success of his plan. I hope to catch more films from this actor. Gattaca is definitely not perfect, and one of the more prominent problems is the limited amount of society you do see. I would have liked to see other aspects of society as it functions daily. An interesting film to rent, if you ignore Uma Thurman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best film I saw in 1998</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Men in Black or Independence Day comes another sci-fi movie, yet really different and certainly a great achievement. Gattaca is Niccol's first feature, and to have such a successful debut is really impressive. The subject of the movie is very interesting, as Gattaca deals with genetics, which is (and is to be) talked a lot in modern society. One of the interests of Gattaca is that it raises fundamental questions. It is really the kind of movie that makes you reflect. Gattaca is also undoubtedly a great entertainment. Niccol and his crew managed to create a world that is both fascinating and frightening. They also succeeded in making the suspense constant. It is cleverly written. And the actors give fine performances. I think that Thurman was a particular good choice. She incarnates beauty in a world which tends toward perfection. Unfortunately, the film hadn't the success it deserves. Yet I wouldn't be surprised if it became a classic. I think (and hope) that many people are going to discover that movie while released on video, and appreciate it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intriguing, humanistic science fiction thriller, with elements of science-fact</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A monumentally beautiful piece of dystopian-set science fiction, which uses its dual themes of cloning and identity to analyse a series of deeper themes pertaining to the struggle of the human spirit, and the all too pertinent idea that the average human may one day be phased out and made irrelevant due to the dangerous idea of biological trickery. The film also has a suitably twenty-first century discussion about issues of class - being a film that you could even argue makes sub-textual points about race and equality - as the naturally born humans with their flaws and inadequacies are denied the benefits offered to their more perfectly engineered counterparts. This is something known all too well by the character Vincent Freeman. Vincent is a 'god child', conceived in loving union by his mother and father at a time when modern genetics have made such methods of procreation obsolete. However, when it is discovered that Vincent will, without question, be prone to short-sightedness, heart-defects, and a life expectancy of only 30 years, his parents decide that their next child's genetic-outcome will not be left to fate.Thus, Anton is born; a tall, handsome, athletic young man, christened after his father. Anton will get only the best out of life, while Vincent, who embraces a secret desire to explore the outer-reaches of space, will be forced into a career in manual labour and the existence of second-class citizen. The description of Gattaca's central themes, its narrative drive and its characterisation make it sound like a cold and un-engaging film with too much focus on genetic debates and intellectual philosophies. This is simply untrue. Although the deeper themes and issues discussed are relevant and entirely fascinating given the current biological climate, Gattaca is essentially one part mystery thriller and one part detective story. As a whole, it works as one of the most humane and humanistic genre ever made, with its themes of underclass and ethnic discrimination - all-too familiar within our own society - presented as imaginative science-fiction.The world of the film and visualisation of it displays a keen eye and an intuitive sense of space from then-first time writer/director Andrew Niccol, who exacts a competent and visionary control over this highly ambitious project. Some have likened his approach to that of Stanley Kubrick, which is entirely misleading, especially since Niccol's film lacks the cold and clinical sense of cynicism so often presented in Kubrick's work, whilst also reacting against his subject matter to present the idea of actual closeness, both emotionally and physically, between his characters. Another difference is Niccol's evocative filming style, with some wonderful widescreen compositions by Polish cinematographer Slavomir Idziak, one of Kieslowski's major collaborators, who brings to the project his trademark emphasis on architectural space and evocative emotional landscapes distorted by colour filters, skewed angles and distancing perspectives. As a result, many of the images here are reminiscent of the paintings of Hooper or Conroy, with the depiction of a totalitarian state filled with dehumanisation owing a further iconographical debt to both Fritz Lang's Metropolis and George Orwell's 1984; but with a warmer, richer quality that grounds its human characters within this world, as opposed to simply distorting them.We also have architectural structures seemingly designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, combined with the retro-fifties fashion, cars and cityscapes that seemingly echo the world of Terry Gilliam's Brazil whilst also foreshadowing similar elements familiar from Michael Winterbottom's equally themed science fiction drama Code 46. All of this demonstrates Niccol's subtle ability to utilise his references and inter-textual inspirations so that they complement, rather than detract from the film's overall appeal. The director also manages the complex task of juggling the important themes that act as the backbone to the drama, the world that he is creating and the all important focus of his characters, in this instance, Ethan Hawk's central protagonist Vincent, Uma Thurman's co-worker/love interest Irene, and Jude Law's paralysed genius Jerome.Ultimately the plot boils down to Vincent and Jerome's symbiotic reliance on one another, with certain themes of loyalty, brotherhood, acceptance, identity, mistaken-identity, as well as the genetics debate central to the plot all presented within this central relationship. It is this relationship that also acts as the emotional centre of the film, and the main reason why you should experience Gattaca, away from the impressive design and prevalent social themes. The eclectic supporting cast is rich tapestry of famous faces, character actors and cult performers, with appearances from Gore Vidal, Xander Berkeley, Ernest Borgnine, Alan Arkin, Blair Underwood and Tony Shalhoub. Add these factors to Idziak's sumptuous photography and one of Michael Nyman's most heart-wrenching scores and the film's closing moments transcend the usual limitations of science-fiction cinema, with its emphasis on action and special effects, to create something entirely moving on a completely personal level.Niccol should be commended for never allowing the film to become trite of predictable, allowing the film to unfold naturally; still cranking up the tension on a number of instances but always giving the viewer something to think about. As Margaret Atwood's classic novel The Handmaid's Tale proved, science fiction works best when rooted in reality; when offering the viewer a believable human protagonist, such as Ofret in Handmaid, or Vincent and Jerome here. For me, Gattaca is one of the most underrated films of the 90's; a rare science fiction film that impresses on an intellectual and ideological level whilst simultaneously offering a highly interesting narrative with strong characters and a truly memorable use of cinematic design.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good sci-fi drama with a dash of thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Excellent cinematography. Excellent theme. The very idea behind this movie is very thought-through, and it is actually likely to happen in the not too distant future, as the movie states. The idea of people being hired for their good, trustworthy genes rather than their abilities is indeed a bit scary and unsettling(the trivia page holds one piece of disturbing truth). I think that's why the movie has so much emotional power; it's also a perfect display of how you can not, no matter what, defeat the human spirit. No matter the obstacle, the main character keeps fighting for his dreams. I don't know that I've ever seen a more moving, interesting science fiction-based drama. The pacing is deliberate. The thriller part, though very limited, is also quite good; I wouldn't want anyone to see this, expecting a thriller, but I will say that I, for one, enjoyed those scenes. Good suspense. The movie is realistically done, for the most part, and is very interesting. It has a good plot, great characters, is very well played by pretty much all of the actors and best of all, has a theme that pretty much anyone can relate to. It could be argued that Niccol is somewhat preachy, and he surely thinks he's right, which is up for debate, but the film comes off as more respectful of the audience('s intelligence) than S1m0ne. The writing is, at times, hokey, and the dialog... sometimes, the characters speak in clichés. I would recommend this to nearly anyone who enjoys dramas, especially fans of sci-fi dramas. It's definitely worth watching, for fans of the genre. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Trek out of Polliakof</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andrew Niccol's 'Gattaca' is a strange film, science-fiction with an aesthetic that lies somewhere between that of 'Star Trek', and that of Stephen Polliakof. This alone elevates it above the likes of 'The Matrix', but it also shares certain other characteristics with a typical Polliakof film: a slow pace, the heavy use of portentious classical music and a self-important seriousness not completely supported by robustness of thought. The result is stylish, but in places camp and ridiculously corny. It's also guilty of undermining it's own fundamental ideas by opposing a future of genetic determinacy with an appeal to meritocracy, as if the danger lies not in the power of the elite, but merely in the risk that the elite is wrongly constituted - genetics cast as the enemy of the American dream. Which hints at a wider failure - 'Gattaca' serves as a literal warning about the future, whereas the best science fiction makes us uneasy with the present.Among some enjoyably loopy casting, Gore Vidal plays himself, Jude Law plays a 1950s English public schoolboy, Ethan Hawke plays an all-American hero and Uma Thurman plays an alien masquerading as a stiff-necked goose. However, this review is probably over-harsh, 'Gattaca' is not really bad, in fact, it's bold and distinctive, but the stretch-marks show as it strains to satisfy both art-house and multiplex. Worth watching once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Discrimination and rascism in the near future...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why on earth would you want to watch a movie with a title like "Gattaca" ? I seriously don't know, because that must be one of the most neutral titles of the 90's. Well, let me tell you that this shouldn't be an indicator. Gattaca is worth at least one viewing and comes with a small recommendation of mine. It's a highly intelligent story with fairly good acting performances and directing. The story picks in on modern evolutions and that's why it's fascinating enough to keep you interested. Though it is still an exaggerated look towards the future, you fear it could be a possible scenario from time to time. That's probably the the best aspect about the whole movie. Other than most science fiction films, you feel more involved.SPOILERS AHOY !!.... In a ( and I quote ) not-too-distant-future ( I love that description ) people are no longer judged on their skin-color. Nor are they being judged on their intelligence, social background or past !! A perfect world without racism and discrimination, you say ? Think again. It's all a matter on your genes now. Normal people like you and me, who're a result of love between 2 people have no chances in this world anymore. They're too sensitive for diseases, heart-failures and overall the life expectation is very low. The ideal son or daughter now is something that you can compose yourself. Perfect in every possible way. Vincent ( Ethan Hawke ) is one of those old fashioned "God's babies". He dreams about going into outer space but he totally isn't qualified to do so. Therefore he makes a deal with a handicapted "überhuman" ( Jude Law ). They switch lives so that Vincent can make his dream come true and Jerome can keep up his way of living. Things are going perfect until one of the project leaders is killed. With modern ways of investigation the murderer doesn't stand a chance to get away with it and the credibility of Vincent becomes doubtful all of a sudden. Especially when the investigating cop is Vincent's "genetic engineered" brother...END SPOILERS !!!As you can see, a very promising plot idea. I'll be the last to say that this movie is bad but it surely has many negative aspects and flaws. I can appreciate movies that are mainly story-driven but this one could have used a bit more action. There are almost no exciting scenes and after a while you're easily distracted...Oh, look at that pretty bird outside...anyway, where were we ? Ethan Hawke is a good actor and I think he makes the smartest acting choices in Hollywood. You can see that he gives himself for 100 %. Uma Thurman is great as well and I doubted a few times if she wasn't a robot...For her character here that's a good thing by the way. The biggest surprise however was Jude Law. I'm not that familiar with his work since I try to keep away from movies like A.I ... I only saw Enemy the Gates of him before and that was good too. He's a very decent actor and there's no doubt he'll get very far in Hollywood within the next decade. The small roles of Tony Shalhoub and especially Ernest Borgnine are surely worth a mentioning as well. I suppose the rather large dose of sentiment in Gattaca was inevitable but still, it's rather annoying...that final swim test for example was way to fake in my opinion. Overall, worth a look and interesting up till a certain level. Not highly memorable, though. I just hope they'll never examine an eyebrow of mine...I'm not very interested in my life expectation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I did not like it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate it when it happens. You know what I am talking about. Everyone talks how great a movie is for more than ten years. You see it and you are disappointed. The movie didn't live up to your expectations. Don't tell me this didn't happen to you at least once.It happened to me when I saw 'Gattaca'. For more than ten years I had been hearing how this movie changed someone's life, how this movie makes you think, how it is the greatest sci-fi movie ever. I don't know why I didn't see it earlier. I saw it just a few days ago on the TV. And it really made me think. It made me think how incredibly unbelievable the whole story is. Sorry.Do you really thing it is possible for your genetic profile to be more important than everything else? More important than your talents and your intelligence? I don't think so. But even if it is possible there are a few more questions.If you are a parent and you know your child is going to die because of a heart disease what would you think about? Vincent's parents didn't even consider the possibility of a heart transplantation to save their kid's life. They considered the possibility of having a new kid. Yet they acted like they love their first son. Well... I don't think I have to explain why did this make me angry.About the medicine that was shown in this movie... I am not a doctor but I am quite sure something is not OK here. Well... The medicine has become so great so the doctors can predict what disease is going to kill you but they can't remove the scars caused by an operation? They can find if Vincent has some surgery on his eyes but they can't find if he is wearing contact lenses? There are a few more questions but I think that is enough. And why didn't anybody even look at Jerome's photo? No one even saw that Vincent's face is not even remotely similar to the face on the photo.About the characters... There are only two characters here and they were not as developed as they had to be. At least Law's performance was very good.There are some good things though. Jude Law was very good. The cinematography was stunning. And... That is it. 4/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nightmare Vision Of The Future</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The way in which a particularly determined man struggles against overwhelming odds to achieve his ambition, provides this movie with its powerful storyline but there's much more to "Gattaca" than that. This science-fiction drama is set in "the not too distant future" when genetic engineering has become so well-developed that the majority of human beings are designed, at conception, to be as close to perfect as possible. This is done through a process of genetic manipulation that eliminates any recognised defects to ensure that, throughout its life, the unborn child will enjoy extremely high standards of health, intelligence and physical strength. Children born by this process are known as "Valids" and for them, success is virtually guaranteed.Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke) was conceived naturally and a blood test carried out at birth identified that he would have a short life (30.2 years), attention deficit disorder and a weak heart. Consequently, he grew up in the full knowledge that he was disadvantaged and his limitations became even more apparent when his younger brother, who was a Valid, soon out-performed him in terms of growth and strength etc. Naturally born people, who are known as "In-Valids" are routinely discriminated against and only regarded as suitable for carrying out the most menial tasks in society. As an adult, Vincent finds employment as a cleaner at the "Gattaca Aerospace Corporation" and, at that establishment, rekindles his childhood dream of becoming an astronaut.An opportunity to pursue his dream presents itself when Vincent meets German (Tony Shalhoub), a DNA broker who puts him in touch with the genetically-superior Jerome Morrow (Jude Law). Jerome is a former top class swimmer who became paralyzed after a failed suicide attempt and is now prepared to sell his identity and keep Vincent supplied with the blood, urine, skin, hair and fingerprint samples he'll need to be able to pass himself off as a Valid. By this method, Vincent succeeds in getting employment at Gattaca where he prepares to be a navigator on a space flight to Titan and also starts a relationship with a beautiful co-worker called Irene Cassini (Uma Therman).Vincent's workplace operates a rigorous regime of frequent testing and by using Jerome's blood, urine etc. and scrubbing himself thoroughly everyday to ensure that he doesn't inadvertently lose any skin or hair, Vincent copes well with maintaining his deception. One day, however, in the week before his space flight is due to launch, the Gattaca director in charge of the Titan mission is found murdered and everyone involved in the project becomes a suspect. Things then get even more threatening for Vincent when one of his eyelashes, found near the crime scene, alerts the police to the fact that an unauthorised In-Valid had obviously been present and this person naturally becomes their prime suspect."Gattaca" has a hypnotic quality and characters that, because of the nature of their society, are very reined-in. The romance involving Vincent and Irene is often cool and controlled with any spontaneity in short supply. All this seems to support the view that the scientific advances that have technically "improved" society in this futuristic scenario, have also made it fundamentally less human.The blood test that enables doctors to predict the course of a new-born baby's life, the general acceptance of genetic discrimination (genoism) and the knowledge that there could be no turning back from the scientific advances featured in this movie, make it extremely chilling to watch."Gattaca" is intelligent, wonderfully thought-provoking and visually stunning. It also features some really good acting, especially by Ethan Hawke, Jude Law and Alan Arkin who's absolutely marvellous as a no-nonsense police detective.</fullReview>

Colors are mostly Absent, except in some Specific Shiny Scenes, The Pace is Ponderous at times, but the Tension never lets up, and Everything and Everyone is On Edge throughout.The Backstory of the Rockets and Launches and Need for it all is Wispy and Wonders about with Incoherence and the Murder Mystery is Awkwardly Included. But the Good Cast of Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, and Jude Law make the Difficult to Believe Believable. However, it's the Mood, Antiseptic Style, and Gloomy Atmosphere that Unsettles as this Off-Beat Film is one that has Staying Power with its Clever Concept and Unusual Feel.After Viewing You are Aware that You just Saw Something that Wasn't quite the Same as Everything Else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first 30 minutes or so of Gattaca are pretty great. We're introduced a not-so-distant (and relatively plausible) future world where "natural" birth is performed in vitro under the guidance of geneticists who carefully engineer/select the most genetically gifted and healthy zygote. From birth, people are identified and defined entirely by their genetic makeup and the diseases to which they are or are not predisposed. The film does a really great job of exploring the philosophical, moral, and legal implications of such a society, and the resultant discrimination that "invalids" - those who are born in vivo - face both in their health insurance and job prospects. There's also a nice underlying message that is touched upon: often times the best person for a job may not be the absolute smartest or healthiest candidate, but the one who is the most passionate about the work. It really is a shame though that, after a great setup, the story the film actually delivers is that of a by-the-numbers, mediocre sci-fi thriller. A good hour or so of the film's hour and 45 minutes is spent on a string of close-calls where our protagonist - an "invalid" posing as a "valid" in hopes of fulfilling his dream of space travel - evades authorities who are on his trail. That's pretty much it. There is barely any character development that occurs during this section of the film (or even after for that matter) and the juiciness of the world and its moral implications is neglected in favor of underwhelming "thrills" as Ethan Hawke thinks on his feet to evade being discovered.Uma Thurman is given essentially nothing to do. At the outset, she is a relatively intriguing character - possibly another invalid posing as a valid - and there seems to be promise of future development where we learn more about her. Instead, her character ultimately amounts to a love interest for Hawke so that we can have a melodramatic scene towards the finale backed by a sappy string arrangement. Her character goes nowhere and ends up being completely flat. Finally, there's that ever-so-necessary plot twist at the end of the film which I won't spoil, but feels extremely contrived and implausible. And even if it wasn't so contrived, the revelation ultimately doesn't even amount to much of anything in terms of character or plot development. It's basically just used for a laughably "climactic" scene which is meant to mirror a scene from earlier in the film. It all just ends up feeling cartoony.Still, credit where credit is due. At the very least, Gattaca did have some interesting ideas and a well-realized vision of the future that felt very plausible and saved the film from being absolutely awful. After a great opening though, it devolved into a flat thriller which ultimately nose-dived at the finale, squandering the potential it had to be a great, thought-provoking sci-fi film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gattaca (1997)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Uma Thurman pre-Bride and Ethan Hawke pre-stuck doing every Blumhouse movie star in a high-concept thriller about the human eugenics controversy. Gattaca takes place in the near future where "designer babies" are a social norm where parents can choose the most desirable traits of their unborn babies (athletic, tall, intelligent, etc.), and people with undesirable genetics are discriminated against. One man, Vincent, has dreams of space travel, but because of his inferior genetics, he is relegated to being the janitor at the Gattaca Aerospace Corporation. A chance of a lifetime comes his way when an employee at Gattaca offers to allow Vincent to assume his identity for a trip Titan. However, the murder of the mission director and a blooming romance with another employee threaten to reveal Vincent's true identity. Gattaca deftly blends its more dramatic moments with unique sci-fi thrills to give a smart little thriller. Although, because of its lofty ambitions and concept, the plot has to force some things to just work out so that it can keep moving forward. A couple of these instances could have been more thoroughly explained in a short scene since the running time isn't terribly long anyway. Another tiny issue is that the reveal of the murderer is pretty anticlimactic. With all the buildup, you'd expect a big surprise, but when it's revealed, it's quickly acknowledged and then forgotten about. The best thing about Gattaca, though, is its incredible writing. There's a lot of quotable lines that I'm sure have led to its status as a cult flick. Along with its ambitious ideas and engrossing plot, Gattaca is a taut, memorable cult sci-fi thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is dealing with social discrimination on the basis of genetics. Your DNA discloses what you can do, what you can become, in which social rank you belong. The coin has to sides: 1. Having the perfect DNA and for that reason being Mr. perfect is not the key to happiness. Sometimes you only wish to live the way you want as a simple - ordinary man, regardless what the others are waiting from you. 2. On the other hand, having a "bad" DNA makes you an outcast. No chance is given to you to become something else. The movie succeeds in presenting both sides!Moreover, another issue raises: choose the characteristics that you want to give to your child (colour of eyes, character, diminish the possibility of illnesses). Childs are no longer conceived physically but in a laboratory. It becomes clear that step by step some of the predictions the movie made become reality..Lastly, I was very enthusiastic about this movie, since it achieved all the above without the help of special effects!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Are our lives predestined? Or can we prove the naysayers wrong?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Within the first few minutes of the movie you are torn emotionally into pieces being shown a world in which one is discriminated within the first few seconds of birth. Gattaca was an incredible thought provoking movie on the tales of genetics and the future of possibilities of ways to discriminate one from another. Vincent was born naturally without the genetic modifications and is presumed to only live to the short age of 30. His younger brother Anton was born with genetic engineering and to be genetically superior. Watching the two grow was heartbreaking knowing the toughness of Vincent's life and to be destined to never fly to Titan. Unless...maybe there was a way to fake who you are? Vincent finds this way to become Jerome Morrow a near genetic perfection. Jerome was crippled and is unable to become a navigator and fly to Titan so he works with Vincent and transforms Vincent into Jerome. The plot thickens with the murder of the school director and Vincent has to be careful throughout the investigation to not be revealed as an "Invalid" person. Will Vincent get caught as an "Invalid" person? Will he make it to Titan?Overall, Gattaca is a movie I would recommend for the science fiction lover and pursuer of deep thought. Gattaca answers to both those realms as you decide what's right and what is wrong with the discrimination of a genetic engineering watching it through Vincent's eyes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw Gattaca, I'll admit it frustrated me a bit. Actually, maybe "frustrated" is too strong a word. Maybe I should say it perplexed me. I thought, Okay, the message about determination is great but what if Vincent gets a heart attack when the rocket to Titan takes off? But on my second viewing, I ignored that and some other lapses of logic (and I understand some people won't be able to do that and that's fine) and I really enjoyed this movie. In fact, I don't think that any other movie I've seen has affected me emotionally to quite the same extent. I also liked that while they could have made the movie incredibly serious, they chose to add some humor with Jude Law's character. I'm not saying it's a perfect movie. I would have liked some more detail about the world and I don't think the film noir aspect really works (and I'm a fan of film noir). But I'd say the positives outweigh the negatives in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>holds up as a smart piece of science fiction/speculation because it's about the characters before the style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gattaca is a very "stylish" movie. What does this mean? Even a film shot in someone's own house without changing the decor or done totally naturalistic is 'stylish,' so I think that in the case of Andrew Niccol's debut it's really about how the look pops out as something different than what we see. If it has any close brother or relative in how the look is approached Alphaville, THX-1138 or to a smaller extent Blade Runner is part of it, where the filmmakers, whether it's due to budget or some other artistic concerns (probably more-so the former, though this had a decent budget), use places and buildings and certain sets that have a futuristic setting and yet at the same time something that is a little more timeless as far as a look from the "past" ironically enough for the future (look at the clothes people wear, the classical music they listen to, other aspects - this is a "not too distant future" where things are meant to be perfect as possible for those genetically modified from conception, yet the past is still held as the standard for how to have, for lack of a better word, 'style').And yet for all of what I just wrote, not to mention Niccol's attention to compositions that are unique and daring (note that shot with Hawke and Thurman in bed with the ocean in the bottom half of the frame, not a VFX shot but a simple camera trick), it's not *about* that. Niccol is interested in the journey that this character Vincent-cum-Jerome takes when he impersonates another man (Ethan Hawke takes on Jude Law, who is the genetically superior but damaged would-be sports hero), and uses it so he can fulfill his dream to go into space.Why this is gets laid out in splendid detail in the first act, which is loaded with back-story but it's necessary to set up this whole world and the world-view of this protagonist: he is a "natural born", which is extremely rare (almost an anomaly), and when his parents decide to have a second child with less, um, 'defects', there's a competition that is born between the two. This leads up to the running analogy, in a way, of how people have to operate in this world who are not equal via going out to swim in a game of "chicken." There's a lot of story to Gattaca, which is on top of being a story if impersonation and subterfuge a crime story about a murder that happens at the Gattaca facility with an "Invalid Person" the suspect also kind of a potential romance between Hawke and Uma Thurman's characters, and an allegory for humanity itself. It's a little of Brave New World, but even as well a little of that movie also from 1997 Face/Off, which is 1000 times sillier than this film and yet no less a reflection of a certain world-view on how people operate when taking on 'another' persona.But the power of the film is that Niccol can tackle these different aspects not only competently, he shows virtuosity as a storyteller and brings in some visual splendor amid the sometimes noir-ish sets and backdrops (see also that moment where Thurman takes Hawke to see the sun rise with the view of those solar panels or whatever they are). Also, he's a solid director of actors, and gets a performance from Hawke that gets better every passing minute he's on screen, and especially Jude Law who has to play someone who is both "crippled" (but don't say that to him) and full of ego, which is a combination that makes him the most fascinating character here.If I look at any negatives it's that, as with many science fiction films out there, certain aspects in the story have to be taken with a grain of salt. It's one thing to have, say, a picture of someone who has glasses on in one photo and not glasses another and not see a resemblance (i.e. Clark Kent/Superman), but in a story like Gattaca it's a little harder to swallow. There are also other aspects to the murder case which make it the least effective part of the story, despite the presence of an actor as wonderful as Alan Arkin (being great at playing it straight, by the way, not much humor but tremendous personality for this detective all the same). Yet this doesn't really hurt the movie so much as just mark it as imperfect, which isn't necessarily an awful thing.Clearly, Niccol had a great idea, and went for the potential with a clear and interesting vision, and a real point of view to the parts that carried some social commentary - it's easy to read into how the Aryans looked at so many people in the past century through the scope of the story of Eugenics - and yet also as just the story of this man, trying to navigate through tricks (fake blood and pee and contact lenses, scrubbing his skin) to get to what he wants. It's cool (but not alienating) style and (intelligent and witty) substance on an even keel. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a very underrated and a brilliant film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watch this film only once as for a school paper. The more I watch this film. The more I understand the feelings between our main character, Vincent. Played by Ethan Hawke. He brilliantly play as this role of a person who is considered as undesirable character and that influenced him to become the best person he could. But no matter how he approach his life and what he can do. His genes just considered him as "in-valid" to get the job that he dreams of. Which is going to space. This film made me felt for the character so much that I happens to many people. The film is so cinematic because he is a janitor at the Gattaca Aerospace Corporation. And everyday when he clean the glass roofs the building. They he watches the rocket ship lift off and go into space and says to the audience the he was so close to gaining his own dreams to come true. Then one day he had a chance to be pose as a "valid" that works for the corporation and finally before that dream happens he gets caught in a situation that he is falsely accused of killing a employer. This film has some aspects of achieving dreams, and racism between the characters. When Vincent is posing for a valid to work at the corporation. Jerome (played by Jude Law) the man Vincent is posing as got into an car accident outside the country because of his superior genes failed him when he got second in a swimming contest and that drove him the point to attempted suicide. This script between Vincent and Jerome have the perfect chemistry. They take care for one other because Jerome and Vincent truly does change at the end of the film and it is very sad to see the very end of this film because Jude Law has done the role perfectly as the person who has it all and drops down the ladder because his genes did not work to be superior. And Vincent wants to get up the top but his genes were already inferior since the day he was born. There is a love story with Vincent and other side character named Irene (played by Uma Thurman). This character Irene also plays a huge role as for more an example for inferior and superior because of her problems that she is unfit but since she is born from the same superior genes. It helps the movie a bit of on what side Irene is on. The superior or the inferior. Either way her choice in the film is decided by Vincent's actions that he is not interested in her gene. This film is great for start to end. Even though the film is very slow pace. It tells the story very well done of this society that Vincent lives him. Also the ending of the film is very ambiguous. It made me thought about the ending with the doctor talking about his inferior son and he is great fan of him and lets Vincent to be on the ship regardless of his genes. And when he goes to see space for the first time. Which I can't spoil because I want people think genuinely about the ambiguous ending because what happens after he comes back to earth and continue poses as Jerome, what about the relationship with Irene, and does his life expectancy was a lie and his genes were superior than a machine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cannot see what the fuss is about. I see it as an over-commitment to be unique.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gattaca is one of the very few science fiction films with a one-of-a-kind world that's depth should have me excited before the title credits even start. Genetic engineering governs lives before birth; flawless people with high IQ's and highly resistant to illness. Ethan Hawke is not one of them. He's an In-Valid, someone born of natural birth, with bad eyesight and a dodgy ticker. This premise is stronger than most of its genre, but the depth of Gattaca doesn't end there. Hawke, the genetically flawed, helps out Jude Law, the physically flawed, by pretending to be him (blood, urine, hair strands, DNA and all) so that 'they' get the chance to pop to outer-space, because anyone imperfect is forbidden. It doesn't even end here! A murder is committed at the space station. All fingers point to the 'guy who's not supposed to be there'. Hawke spends most of the film trying to not blow his cover, whilst getting romantic with work colleague Uma Thurman.Gattaca is organised mess at its best (setup) and worst (plot) due to an over- commitment to be unique. A society of flawless beings who work like drones show that our flaws make up our personalities and sense of humour. Hawke and Thurman are more steely than wooden, whereas Jude Law's crippled genius is the only character with human instincts. Great promise, poor execution. I nearly felt as bored as the desk-workers at the space-station. Gattaca is in much need of a personality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Immaculate and multi-layered portrayal of a dystopian future that looks like the '50s!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the final credits roll to some beautiful and intensely moving theme music by Michael Nyman, the lucky viewer of this fine, fine film will realise he or she has been watching something that ranges far wider and deeper than it has seemed at the outset, or even through many of the earlier scenes. In fact, the full realisation of what we have here is one that only hits home fully maybe 10 minutes before the end, when it suddenly becomes clear how much loyalty, solidarity and goodwill have-nots might have for each other, given how what our DNA does or does not allow us to do can have surprisingly little in common with the places our dreams and innermost longings would like to carry us. Today, the lottery is still running, as we do not know everything about what our genomes condemn us to, or allow us to achieve - but is it not likely that the near-future will see less and less left to biological chance, with more and more "designer babies" and ever-greater discrimination between those who make the genetic cut and those who don't? This is what this film is all about (as well as about the role of chance, which can never quite be eradicated);and it tells its story in the gentlest and most minimalist of ways, so that its real significance somehow just creeps up on you. For some reason best known to themselves, the makers here have gone to extraordinary lengths to give a sort of 1950s sci-fi feel to this film about the near-future (it really must be the near-future, mustn't it? Given routine spaceflights, trips to the moon Titan and all the genetic scanning technology). The presence of guys not in their first flush of youth wearing old-fashioned looking outfits and marvellously played by titans of the screen like Ernest Borgnine, Alan Arkin and Gore Vidal further strengthen the impression, and only helps yet further as we convince ourselves that we are watching a murder mystery told fairly straight, as well as a traditional film about brotherly rivalry that goes back to primaeval instincts (Cain and Abel, Joseph and his brothers anyone?), and even a burgeoning love story, given the progressive (and actually pretty erotic) "warming" of a relationship with the ice-cool Irene, as played beguilingly by Uma Thurman. But then there is yet another thread in this rich tapestry - a symbiotic and ever-so-slightly homoerotic, but far more near-symbiotic, relationship between the two key characters of Jerome and, well, Jerome (as deftly played by Ethan Hawke and Jude Law). Disappointing to realise that this film did not even recoup its costs at the box office, though perhaps not surprising given that this is not a spectacular movie, and thrills and spills are (very largely) lacking. But this is a true piece of the film-maker's art: it looks divine, it means something, it tells its story with utter conviction. And the absolutely mammoth message it has to convey is nevertheless put across in a supremely subtle and sparing manner. It comes as no surprise that this is a film from Andrew Niccol, who also gave us the excellent "Truman Show". All credit to him, and to the whole crew, for this is as cool, smooth, stylish, deep and satisfying a piece of film-making as we could wish for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Aesthetics of Gattaca perfectly managed to combine movies's main idea with the means of its expression</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The world of "Gattaca" is stylized to the grotesque, it's minimalistic, aloof, cold and just as realistic as apple's outline drawing is similar to an actual apple. But this schematic image of the future society which is experiencing "eugenic revolution" best of all emphasizes the emptiness of externally (aesthetically) perfect forms (personal and social), stripped of their depth by illusion of total calculation and control of human destiny. In this sense, "Gattaca" is a sample of the purity of the genre of science fiction, in its understanding as the artistic interpretation of the possible impact of scientific advances on society. There is no need to portray wonders of futuristic technology in "Gattaca", all the attention and visual tools focused on the main - technological (eugenic) breakthrough and its possible social consequences.In this minimalistic and cold, seemingly perfect world of the future, where everything, even the human person, is estimated, weighed, calculated and built-in into the social mechanisms according to the "scientific methods", it turns out that the most perfect one, is broken mentally and physically disabled person who has lost all interest in life. On the other hand a "genetic junk", the heart of whom should have stop beating long time ago, is not only alive and well, but with persistence achieves his goals and is on top of the "scientifically- based" social pyramid in which he should be an outcast. And it's not so much because of the ambitions of the protagonist, but because of that elusive inner strength of a person which can not be calculated and measured by no technocrat geneticist, and which is vague and weightless, does not fit the mathematical minimalism, but outweighs all the scientific advances and cold calculation."Child of God," Vincent remains free (no wonder his surname is Freeman) in programmed and dehumanized world which is striped of Lord's granted free will, not because Vincent has any special skills or abilities, but because he has not lost faith in the freedom to choose his own destiny and courage to follow his choice, do not became a conformist. Here "Gattaca" managed to show much brighter and deeper an idea which a year later Alex Proyas tried to express in his Dark City.Special attention should be given to Michael Nyman's music and the aesthetics of the movie itself, which perfectly managed to combine it's main idea with the means of its expression.</fullReview>

Jerome has the special gene, but he attempted suicide out of despair. Vincent fights with his fate. He breaks the rule, but I can't help cheering for him. As same as I, Jerome supports Vincent at the risk of his life. The story becomes thrilling, but sometimes impressed by his supporters. In this film, contrasts of men are important. Firstly, the relationship between Vincent and his brother. Next, the relationship between Vincent and Jerome. The strength of friendship deeply moved me.Vincent takes over those relationships. I can't stand crying at the last. In the universe, all human is same. This film reminds us what decide human value and how grate our life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unsettling, Odd Fable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>According to a lot of the reviews, this movie is a solid 10/10. I don't think so. I get why people like it. Gattaca raises questions about fate and free will; it pushes back against systemic discrimination, a topic which resonated in 1997 and even more so now. There's a lot to think about in the movie. Jude Law turns in a strong performance. The score is beautiful, elegiac. So as a philosophical inquiry, or visual art, it's pretty good. As a story, though, it stumbles on several counts. There are a few dead-ends in the plot, with the movie setting its characters/story up for a particular turn of events and then just seemingly forgetting about them; a few tensions raised in the plot are never adequately answered. The characters in the movie (with the exception of Jude Law) do not emotionally respond to the plot like normal human beings; they are oddly flat, ignoring or gliding Vulcan-like over tragedies and heartbreak. The coolness of the characters is all the more unsettling in light of some of the wholly unexplored homoerotic and sexual tension in the film; I don't usually go out for psychological interpretation, but a Freudian reading of Gattaca would be illuminating, I think. The plot itself is a fairly heavy-handed fable. Another reviewer has noted that all the swimming scenes feel like the director is beating us over the head with the message of the story; this is true, and I'd add that Hawke's character's narration does the same thing. It may be a thriller, but it's also very nearly one of Aesop's fables. The final problem I had was that the movie felt very retro. The huge computers, the orange-tint white balance, the orderly, Spartan, wholly undecorated world of Gattaca, the classic body style cars: the movie feels like a sci-fi movie filmed in the 60s or 70s, not in the late 90s. Given that 1997 was also the year that Contact came out, and its sci-fi world does not feel retro (heck, Alien was made in the 70s and feels less retro than Gattaca!), I have to assume this is a deliberate choice. But why the filmmakers decided to make their film looking twenty years old when it was brand new, I have no idea. The total lack of atmosphere and clunky machinery contributes to the flatness of the story; against it, the characters (already pretty dull) seem less interesting, not more. At this point, I realize I seem like I wholly hated the film. I didn't. As I noted, there's a lot to think about, and I will probably be thinking about its theme for months to come. Also, even if I didn't agree with the filmmakers' artistic decisions, I did enjoy watching how they were put together. It's not a great film, but it's a decent way to spend a Friday night.</fullReview>

But as he got older his desire of going to space grew.i personally really liked the movie you could feel the tension throughout the whole film because you don't know what's happening next. All parts of the film were playing on earth at the Gattaca station. The music was very descent but appropriate. the characters fit really good into the role, bringing out perfectly their acting skills. the movie isn't that new, you recognize it while watching it, because of the special effects which aren't that great, but thats not of a big deal. the movie is very interesting caused by the different types of Genre mixed in, like of course Sci-Fi but also pretty funny with smart comebacks, love is also intended. i don't want to give away too much so i really recommend the film. it became one of my favorites.

		<fullReview>"Gattaca" is a science-fiction thriller of Andrew Niccol which has been released in 1997.There is Ethan Hawke as Vincent Luca/Jerome, Uma Thurman as Irene and Jude Law as the original Jerome alias Eugene. The movie takes about 102 minutes. You can watch the movie in German, English and french.The story is about Vincent Luca who struggles, as a "god-child", to become a Gattaca pilot flying to the planet "Titan" which belongs to the Mars. He changes his identity with Jerome Morrow, a former sport athlete, so that there'll be a big confrontation between the police and Vincent/Jerome.In general the plot is really exciting and it has got a lot of tension but the story sets at too less different location. Mainly the story is set at the Gattaca station which is boring to watch. The performance of the actors is really convincing. We feel(ed) like we are/were inside the story. A little bit boring is also that there aren't really much details in a lot of scenes which made the mood really quiet and boring. The camera-work and the cut of the film is surprisingly really good for the time in 1997.To summarize, we'd recommend for watching the film because "Gattaca" has got a lot of tension. In addition the performance of the actors is great and "Gattaca" shows a realistic and possible future which depends on technology. The movie is still not perfect but we rate the movie with 7 out of 10*.</fullReview>

The movie is about Vincent Anton Freeman who is been discriminated his whole life by everyone he knew, including his family, because he had a high chance of dying caused by a heart failure in a young age. Like black people are discriminated by society nowadays, the movie shows, that in the future might be other reasons for discrimination. At the beginning the movie is pretty sad but it gets happier while watching Vincentletting his dream come true. The movie is phenomenal and it fits the actions very nice.The acting of the actors are really convincing because you can sense, that they put their feelings int it. The setting is very fantastic,but you should be careful while watching the movie ,because it's really easy to get confused. It would be better if you watch it twice. All in all I think it is really an good movie, it has a good plot and it teaches you to never give up on your dreams. If you're a fan of sci-Fi movies you should give it a try.

Personally I feel the film was excellently played out, the themes it deals with, like prejudice, authoritarian or totalitarianism, genetic determinism and predestination are themes that should be dealt with more and the film presents them excellently. The film emotionally captivates you, and gives an inspiring message about working for what a person wants. My only critic is that in a society that has the technology to create the perfect human by modifying its genetic structure, there should be some way to cure or replace a spinal cord injury like Jerome Morrows. Of course without his injury the story would not make much sense but it is something that should be taken into consideration. Over all great movie, definitely worth watching and analysing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gattaca (1997): Dir: Andrew Niccol / Cast: Ethan Hawke, Jude Law, Uma Thurman, Alan Arkin, Xander Berkeley: Imagine this. You have a dream but regardless of your talents and abilities, a simple blood test can obstruct it all. Futuristic film with Ethan Hawke second to his brother in everything. A sample hair can dictate his job potentials that in his case turns out to be a janitor at Gattaca. His dream is to travel to space but his D.N.A. prevents it so he switches it with Jude Law who is paralyzed from the waist down. Trouble arises when a sample hair is found at a murder site. Directed by Andrew Niccol with imaginative writing. Top notch special effects create a futuristic world that highlights with the best of futuristic films. Great chemistry between Hawke and Law that becomes the strongest element of the screenplay. Hawke struggles to maintain his position while driven by his desire to be an astronaut. Law was paralyzed in a car accident yet is willing to assist Hawke using his D.N.A. Unfortunately Uma Thurman seems to be featured only as a romantic interest to Hawke, which is truly unfortunate since expectations for her are beyond that. Alan Arkin is also featured but many supporting roles are cardboard. This is about control and tagging identities against one's will. Effective futuristic thriller about goals and destiny, which D.N.A. cannot take away. Score: 9 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>GattacaBefore DNA testing came along everyone was guilty of whatever they were accused of.Thankfully, the advanced culture in this sci-fi movie has complete control over everyone's genes.Two brothers are born into a speculative future where eugenics weeds out the Invalids: Vincent (Ethan Hawke) is conceived naturally, while Anton (Loren Dean) has his DNA manipulated making him a Valid.While Anton becomes a cop, Vincent is a janitor at an aerospace company where he meets an injured highborn (Jude Law), who allows him to use his DNA to assume his identity.But when a murder's committed and Vincent's DNA is found at the scene, Jerome must keep his detective brother from uncovering the truth.Smart without being pretentious, thought provoking without being preachy, Gattaca presents a possible future that doesn't seem too impossible. Besides, if parents could design their ideal baby, future races would have no mouths or butt-holes. Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting Sci-fi Parable about Destiny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a near-future eugenics-based world, where one's genetic superiority defines their ease of success in society, Andrew Niccol's 'Gattaca' explores the story of two men who have been affected by it; too much was expected of one and he succumbs to pressure, and nothing much was expected of the other and he tries to go against those expectations to achieve his dream. In this hypothetical gene-discriminatory society, the film's essential theme is of one's value and destiny; whether we define it or someone/something does, ultimately, it's upto us.The casting is good, and the acting is commendable. Though it's a science-fiction film, it didn't need any special effects to explore its themes; it made use of the well-designed sets and captivatingly-coloured cinematography.The ideas explored in the film are intriguing and thought-provoking, but other than the lead character Vincent, whose description would take five sentences, other characters' descriptions would take just one. Especially, Irene (Uma Thurman), of whom we get to know nothing. Most of the movie is a cat and mouse chase, with characters dancing around the lines of morals and ethics, not that it wasn't entertaining.Overall, it's a film which is firm in its stand against discrimination, and inspires people to against all odds to fulfill their passion; an interesting sci-fi parable about destiny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's a subtlety in the design of "Gattaca" that really showcases the narrative's dramatic punch. Even with a modest budget, all of the locations really pop and the '60s retro futurism is a very striking look. And the dystopia it posits is understated, but still very scary; a future that sees science manipulating nature, where people with defects suffer genetic discrimination. It feels so close to becoming a reality.But the movie's real power (aside from the awful burden of perfection) lies in Ethan Hawke's dogged struggle to pass himself off as a "valid" to go into space. Sheer force of will, that's all he's got. And it's the kind of laser focus you just don't see every day. Beneath its cold veneer, this movie's got genuine heart. I swear, I can watch this movie if ever I've feeling down, and I always feel better. It's that kind of story. Both thought-provoking and soul-enriching.Hits me right where I live.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple Is Complex</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is common that filmmakers, when trying to create a 'thought- provoking' movie for audiences, they create extremely complex story lines and themes for the movie. These 'complex' themes and story lines, however, often end up lacking logic and have no connection to reality whatsoever, as their main focus are fictional elements showing their 'complexity' and forget to show any humane themes, which are simple.Gattaca indeed takes place in a fictional world, a future, but the focus of this movie its not in 'complex' fictional elements but rather on it's humane characters and how different situations affect their nature. In this case, the fictional elements are merely shown to illustrate the different situations the characters find themselves in and do not take over the whole movie.By not attempting to create anything complex, the filmmakers achieve complexity by simply showing reality, as reality is always more complex and shocking than fiction. Gattaca is a success, managing to show simple humane themes through science fiction, making justice for both things.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Gattaca' is that rare bit of speculative science fiction that never grandstands or feels preachy. It has the confidence in its story--and storytelling--to simply let the viewer think for themselves. As a result, the connection is stronger, more personal and the message resonates more clearly.With its combination of noir and retro futurism, 'Gattaca' is certainly a beautiful, but cold film. There's a mounting tension, but the emotional needle rarely ever moves.Despite this, and despite a few glaring plot contrivances, 'Gattaca' is still an interesting and thought provoking work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The main characters in the film Gattaca (Niccol, 97) are Ethan Hawke as Vincent Freeman, Uma Thurman as Irene Cassini, and Jude Law as Jerome Eugene Morrow. Gattaca's theme is Moral Philosophical Riddle, Social Problems, and a little bit of Human Dignity. The scene that best supports these themes would be in the beginning of the film, Vincent's parents conceive him out of love for one another the "unnatural" way of doing things, but the father did not want him to take his first name after the doctors tested his blood and gave all the conditions he would have and his expected death date. So the next time around they decide to do things the more "natural" way and leave no chance to the success of their second child, another son but with a more promising future, and he would take the first name of the father, Anton. This shows that there is a lack of human dignity in that you are already classed before you even get a chance to make a name for yourself. At birth you are sorted into either a Valid, or Invalid. The Invalid's go to Gattaca (97) to work as Janitors, while the valid work on space missions, or do other important missions. The invalids are never even given a chance to prove themselves in the valid world. All you need to pass an interview to get a job in the space missions is to give a blood sample and you are in. This is an example of how the social problems are prevalent in the film. Moral Philosophical riddle comes in when Vincent an invalid decides to impostor himself as Jerome, a crippled valid, so that he can land a job with the space missions, and fly space ships. This is the gray area that allows an invalid to be successful in a valid world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't see this at the cinema when it came out because initially I thought it was a remake of Battlestar Galactica, and then when I saw the trailer I thought it was a remake of Saturn 3.But having just watched it on the TV (there was nothing else on) I now know I was completely wrong.Some interesting concepts in there about your genes deciding your future (but then they always have, e.g. there's not many fighter pilots with glasses or ugly models), and some nicely done plot points and small twists. And there are some truly great moments when Jude Law and Ethan Hawke are together. Not quite so sure about some of Uma Thurman's moments though, or the motivation for her character (why wouldn't she dump a liar and cheat in it, especially if he manhandled her on their 2nd date as much as Ms Thurman's acting would suggest).But one of the best things about the film imo was it's ending. Both uplifting (Vincent attains his goal despite his genetic disadvantages) and sad (Jerome's death) at the same time, with one final undercurrent... During one of Vincent's speeches to Irene he says his heart is already 10,000 beats overdue (for failure) and his final monologue about leaving the earth suggests he thinks he's not going to make it back.But despite all the good things in this film, nobody's going to see it if they get the wrong first impression, which is presumably why it bombed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Few weeks ago I've watched the science fiction film "Gattaca", which was released in 1997. I think "Gattaca" is one of the best drama films, which I've ever seen. First of all, this film shows a not so far future, where genetic engineering is common part of life. It is a "perfect" world, where no place for imperfect people. The plot of the story is simple, the hero wasn't born in a test tube, that is why he has disadvantages in the "perfect" world, but also he has a huge dream and willpower. The story is extremely intelligent.It is very provocative film and it makes you wonder. In conclusion, I would like to say, we all have ever doubted yourself. And if you think that you haven't place in this world then look "Gattaca". Look at hero who defeated the whole world without destroying. He defeated himself. Despite the fact that he isn't perfect. Just live. Because your willpower never betray you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shame this movie wandered into space</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1. The topic of genetic discrimination might be more topical in the future but it wasn't in 1997, which is why it flopped at the box office.2. Genetic science has moved on since this movie was made and proved some of the film's assumptions to be untrue. We all share the same genetic material but some genes are turned on in some people and turned off in other people. One of the goals of modern science is the ability to turn those genes on and off at will.3. There isn't much acting to do. Jude Law had the hardest role to play and played it well.4. Several plot flaws such as why don't the authorities have everyone's home address? Why can't they detect alcohol and nicotine in Vincent's bloodstream?5. If Vincent is concerned about genetic faults holding back his ambitions he should watch a movie like Precious to truly understand the effects of physical discrimination.6. Why would anyone want to go to Titan? There is far less there than on Earth.7. Had nobody noticed that many of the greatest scientists were physically imperfect (e.g. Einstein and Stephen Hawking). So there is no relationship between physical attributes and mental attributes. In fact, physical imperfection may result in mental perfection.8. Great to see Alan Arkin again. Just a hint of his Catch 22 style. Such an underused actor.9. I suppose this movie appeals to self conscious pretty 20-somethings who feel that a blemish on their skin is a negative attribute.10. Is it true that physical appearance holds people back in their working careers? The studies show it does. Unfortunately, the script failed to go there. It could have but instead it wandered into space.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High Concept, Average Execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gattaca is based on the idea that some people are genetically engineered to superiority. It follows Vincent, a man who poses as someone with better DNA to qualify for a trip to space. This is incredibly important to Vincent and he risks his life for it, but it flows in a somewhat awkward way.I wanted more focus on the relationship between Ethan Hawke and Jude Law. Often movies are criticized for unneeded love interests. I often disagree with this, but Gattaca didn't need a love story. It added nothing and actually distracted from the main point. The good moments of seeing Vince as a character were bogged down by the overly-present score. How prevalent music is in a movie is a directorial decision, but it was another distraction here.The ending was almost exactly what you'd expect. Pull out of this review now like a mofo if you don't want to hear it. Vince tries and tries over the course of the film to get to space, when he finally does, not much has changed. He's the same guy. His lover is left back on Earth, but he'll just be back in a year, right? The only real sadness at the end is Jude Law's suicide, but that isn't all that important since there were only a few scenes that looked at him as a character. But those scenes don't do a whole lot to make Vincent or the audience care about Jerome.While Gattaca is a fairly well done movie, it has its flaws. Too much time is spent on Vincent's childhood and a whole lot of focus is put on his brother. When it turns out that his brother is alive, nothing is changed. Even Uma Thurman's character was another one of the things that added fat to a movie that began skinny. This movie doesn't run at 100% all the way through, but it's not bad.Gattaca felt too movie-like. It had its tropes it stuck to. It's not bad for a story to have tropes common to its genre, but hey, form over content right? The form of Gattaca was off. In spite of all of this, there was a decent movie sticking its head out of the flak-filled water. It hangs in the space above okay and below pretty good. Gattaca is enjoyable, but don't expect any stellar storytelling. This movie shot for the moon, but landed somewhere in between that's alright, but not amazing, but pretty good, I guess.</fullReview>

Like In Time, but far less melodramatic and less contrived, which, by the way, was also written and directed by Gattaca writer Andrew Niccol. He is a very imaginative guy. Gattaca was his first. The Truman Show was his second script. Number three: S1m0ne about the problems arising from a CGI "perfect woman," which he wrote and directed "In Time." Complaints: Ms. Thurman is so understated, it is as if she sleep-walked through principal photography. The clothing of spacepersons on their way to the launch is strange.

		<fullReview>Well, even thought I'm not much a fan of sci-fi productions, I must admit that "Gattaca" is a film that really caught my attention. From the get go, the plot proves to be quite entertaining, due to the curious lives of Anton and, of course, Vincent. The story is able to make spectator think about things like immortality, technology, feelings and life in future; much of what Gattaca's creators do can be related to the utopian desire of living forever. Vincent Freeman is a GREAT character that tries to stand out in a company whose members are scientifically made, while he is just a normal guy with possible heart problems. It's beautiful to see someone THAT strong-willed like Vincent, who had to kill a lion per day to reach his dream: going to space. The cast is extremely professional, with highlights to Ethan Hawke and Jude Law, of course. The only actor that seemed out of place was Uma Thurman; sometimes it feels like she's too normal to play the character she's been given. There are suspenseful scenes, like when Law's character crawls upstairs in order to help his friend getting away with murder, which is what brought intensity to the ending. In my opinion, "Gattaca" is one of the best sci-fi made in the nineties, beating even modern pictures like 2013's "Gravity". Congratulations for the team!</fullReview>

I think this is a landmark movie. Similar to the fear of robots the "Terminator" movies gave people, gattaca gave people a fear about the future of genomics technologies.Aside from the health and privacy concerns with using genomics information the movie did not touch on the potential benefits of the technology, such as the concept of "DNA romance"; matchmaking people based on the compatibility of their DNA.

		<fullReview>Simply, I loved Gattaca. Stories where new forms of discrimination have always intrigued me, but genetic discrimination feels so relevant. Vincent's story was emotional and tense. SPOILERS AHEAD YOU'VE BEEN WARNED. However, there were things, plotwise, I thought needed clarification or even to be improved upon or scrapped. Some scenes, like the initial love scene and then next-day rejection between Vincent and Irene, needed some refining while others, like Anton and Vincent's end scene, could have used a touch more closure. I was also both saddened and a little annoyed that Jerome chose to kill himself at the end; you'd think he would have learned from Vincent that even if someone tells you you can't because you're weak, that doesn't mean its true. IMO he should have amounted to something greater at the end, when Vincent came out(?! It was unclear) Overall it was a great movie so long as you don't overthink the scenes; I had myself convinced that the janitor had something to do with the murder; that he suspected Vincent was Jerome and that he was spiteful about it. After all, the police got a hold of the cup that he took from Vincent in that one scene...it disappointed me that they took conventional roots in a movie that had roots in the unconventional. Nonetheless, Gattaca was an excellent movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Film review ? Gattaca Welcome to a time in which people will no longer be differentiated by their mere appearance but by the genetic code, which distinguishes between invalids and genetically modified people. Andrew Niccol's Gattaca presents such a future scenario, where the technical development has made it possible to read and detect predispositions for all kind of diseases. At the birth of the protagonist Vincent Freeman the nurses reveal that he has a predisposition for a heart disease and therefore a short life expectancy. As he is an invalid, he doesn't get the chance to reach his dream of becoming a spaceman whereupon he assumes the identity of Jerome Eugene Morrow, an athlete,who is disabled because of an accident. After this compilation succeeded, he gets the chance to become included in a space program of the organization Gattaca, where he also fell in love with Irene, an employee of it. Shortly before Vincents first space flight, his superior becomes murdered. As the police also determines with genetic methods, he gets threaten that his real identity may become apparent. His younger brother Anton, who is genetically modified,appears and due to an athletic combat, Vincent is able to convince him of his staying power , which induces Anton to keep his knowledge about the identity of his brother. As the real murderer is detected, , the space mission takes place. But while Vincent's dream becomes true, his friend Jerome Eugene commits suicide in his own incinerator. Gattaca describes a society , in which people's certainty for their dreams depends on whether they are valid's or invalid's. Niccol wants to criticize that aspect of the differentiation and hopes that he is able to encourage his audience to think about whether it is legitimate to defame naturally received people in society and to influence their development. In my opinion the movie is very complex because of the convincing performance of actresses and actors and audio-visual elements. A highly exciting science fiction dystopia that may become reality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very convincing scenario of the future</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gattaca" is a 1997 science-fiction film, written and directed by Andrew Niccol, starring Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman. It presents an allegedly utopian, however anonymous and impersonal future, in which the male and female gametes are being profiled and combined manually to eradicate the possibility of genetic dysfunctions and to ensure that only the parents' best heritable features are passed on to the next generation.Vincent Freeman is born in the absence of any of those modern techniques and as a consequence, he has a heart defect, is myopic and his life expectancy is only predicted to be 30.2 years. Conversely, his two years younger brother Anton, whose faith was placed in the technology of genetic engineering, is perfectly healthy and constantly outstrips his brother in various aspects. Being an 'Invalid' ? the opposite of the genetically perfect 'Valid' population ? Vincent is confronted with genetic discrimination, whereby his lifelong dream of flying into space recedes into a far distance.Vincent swaps identities with Jerome Eugene Morrow, a former member of the space agency Gattaca, who has perfect genes but is limited to a wheelchair as the consequence of a serious accident. Jerome, providing him with his urine, blood, faked fingerprints and hair, enables Vincent to circumvent the strict and permanent genetic controls that are daily routine order at Gattaca. Vincent alias Jerome Morrow is assigned to a one-year mission to Titan, a Saturn moon, but when a director of the Gattaca cooperation becomes the victim of murder, an eyelash of the innocent protagonist is found near the crime scene. Vincent attracts the attention of the police, threatening to blow his cover and initiating a race against the clock.Gattaca features a whole range of alarmingly realistic future scenarios in a convincingly modern and sterile world. The allegedly plain and simple storyline, featuring the sheer impossible rise of a genetically dysfunctional protagonist from rags to riches, from a cleaner to a visionary astronaut, only scratches the surface of the film's message. The future world presented in Gattaca is supposed to warn the spectator and be a monument to the research in genetic engineering. Moreover, it visualises the hidden problems and consequences of complete genetic control and leaves the spectator with something to recapitulate and a bad taste in the mouth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing for true sci-fi fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To model the genetic code to create better humans would be a revolutionary breakthrough in medicine, but not as unrealistic as it might seem, even in 1997, when the film "Gattaca" by Andrew Niccol was published, but even more so today. Combining perfect physical health with the best prerequisites for intelligence, we could give our children the best possible start in life. But which social problems can arise from such a breakthrough? What if not everyone is born as a perfect human? In "Gattaca", this leads to the creation of a new underclass, whose members can never expect companies to hire them for high positions, as their genetic code makes it too risky. The protagonist Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke), one of these so called "faith-births", wants to go to the top nonetheless. He buys the identity of Jerome Morrow, a man with perfect genes but a broken back, to get into the space administration complex Gattaca. Everything is going well for Vincent, until one of the other employees is murdered and Vincent's real DNA is found in the building. Can he keep up the disguise and his social position? Watch the film to find out."Gattaca" has a very unique sci-fi atmosphere that makes you think it's sets and Gattaca itself could really exist a few years from now, and that the story of the film is a warning of social dangers to come. This all is even though some things look like they are directly from the nineties, like old-fashioned cars that only had their driving sounds replaced. The main reason for the plot also seems to be made up out of thin air. Vincent is not a "faith-birth" because his parents couldn't afford or otherwise had no access to the necessary technology to give him better genes, but simply because his mother didn't want it and rather placed Vincent's fate in God's hands. This is not only a poor explanation but also puts the viewer in a much less critical perspective towards the supposedly unjust society of "Gattaca", which still is cold and unjust, but not a bit more than Vincent's mother was stupid. How the genetic modifying works is not explained at all in the film, which may make it uninteresting for true sci-fi fans, but that is not the focus of the film anyway. Instead, Niccol put a lot of work into the characters. For example, Vincent has a brother who is not a "faith-birth". His relation to him and their constant fight over who is the better and more capable human being continues to get the viewers attention throughout the film."Gattaca" truly is not one of the best films ever made, but definitely not one of the worst either, and I would basically recommend it, though people who expect real science-fiction or real social criticism should probably steer away from this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film, even with the ambiguity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this film, I think its one of the most thought-provoking and stylish sci-fi films of the past few decades. Rather than just repeat all the praise/comments that previous reviewers have posted, I will get straight to what struck me about this film is the retro-feel of much of it's design. This film is set in an imaginary future yet the film is as much a homage to the styles and sheens of 1950s/60s sci-fi. The elites dress like the early Beatles, everyone seems to drive Cadillacs, the detectives wear film noir hats &amp; overcoats, even the space rockets seem to have lifted straight from a 50s sci-fi comic. As well as a thought-provoking study on what it means to be human and how limitations are often imposed by others, the film seems to be a love-letter to both classic and B-grade sci-fi, from the shiny design of 'Logan's Run' to the cheesy, lovable awfulness of 'Mars Needs Women'. Having said that, this is one of my favourite films of the 1990s. Even the few baffling parts of the film don't bother me (like they bother a friend of mine who always complains about the final scenes where Ethan Hawke is boarding the space ship- 'he's still wearing his ordinary clothes, where's the space suit? And why hasn't he done any astronaut training? And why didn't he even bother to say goodbye to Uma Thurman?'), I like films that leave you wondering and thinking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gattaca a space-age (futuristic) city has a research center that specializes in aerospace research that embodies specific characteristics which allow people with perfection to be employed. Only those with perfect genes have access to better jobs. But children who carry natural genes, which are designed without the help of science, are known as natural or invalid inevitably are in turn rejected, isolated, and nevertheless pushed into poverty, with a prospective for a low job ranking. Parents have to define ways of helping their children in attaining an ideal life. This is where we meet Vincent (Ethan Hawke), supposedly a natural child with less perfect genes, with big dreams of one day going to space engages the help from Jerome Morrow (Jude Law) a paralyzed former swimming star. To beat all odds, both men enable one another the opportunity to achieve something desired and stump the laws that run Gattaca. In order for Vincent to thrive in Gattaca, Jerome provides him with his biological samples, hair, urine and blood that qualify Vincent in passing the DNA test requirement. Hence Vincent then enrolls the facade of being Jerome after undergoing psychological and physical changes. Then there is Irene Cassini (Uma Thurman) a charming young woman who in spite of her perfect design suffers from heart issues and seems to be falling for Vincent but at the same time is trying to find out who he really is. One other film that has the appropriateness to the theme is Elysium which shows the determination of certain individuals embattled to reach the space paradise habitat Elysium for state-of-the-art health-care and citizenship. The scene where as children and yet again as adults, Vincent and his brother Anton (Loren Dean) are competitively swimming seems to be the motif that shows determination can help in overcoming genetic shortcomings because Vincent sees his brother Anton and society rejecting him for his imperfections. There is a high angle shot for the swimming scenario because we are able to view Vincent and his brother from an aerial view.Overall the film is brilliant with cast displaying a composed mannerism while playing their parts in a way that goes to show that each is determined to achieve their desired goals by all means possible. The actors' performance is sterling because they make their characters to be believable. The theme shows that science can be manipulated to fit the interests of the protagonist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gattaca (or How To Succeed In A Corrupt Scociety</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine a society where corruption is so rampant that all the good careers are reserved for the elite and their offspring.Now imagine a making a perfect analogy for that problem in a movie. The result is Gattaca.The main character's problem is being considered 'Less Than Perfect' by his society, and thus unfit to lead the career of his choice, and which suits his skills, because such career is reserved for those who earned the right to it by birth. Those who were 'born lucky'. It could work as a great symbol of racism, but on deeper level it actually dissects all the aspects of a corrupt society where your career is determined by your family ties (genetic composition) and not at all by your skills.The main character did not only train himself to earn the skills needed for the career he wanted, but he also done the extra effort of designing a perfect lie. Which is how to win in life if you are not born a fortunate son :) Think about it.For delivering that message in such a and beautiful and touching manner, the movie, and everyone in its cast, deserves a big Kudos.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gattaca is a beautiful film.It touches on themes of discrimination, prejudice, possible dangers of technological progress and the life of those who are left behind. The film's yellow tone accompanies the melancholic nature of the film. The ending of the film is very beautiful in the way that it allows the main character to escape from hostile earth and probably achieve a good life for himself somewhere else.It's plot seems a bit contrived and unoriginal, though. Another problem is that Uma Thurman's character never manages to become important.8 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hit and miss for me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gattaca had always been one of those cult favourites which I'd never seen but was always intrigued by. It has some great science fiction concepts, which can be expected from the writer of The Truman Show, here writing and directing, but Gattaca doesn't have the emotion that Truman was able to conjure. It's a highly engrossing film yet subtle, with rich set decoration, photography, score and a devotion to detail. I really enjoyed the simple goal of the protagonist, Vincent played by Ethan Hawke, and his simple desire to go to space. How he overcame the initial obstacle of his predicted fate was fascinating, but other obstacles were convoluted and not as engaging.However, I wasn't convinced by the scenes of him socialising with Uma Thurman or Jude Law's characters as it came off as awkward or not well developed. It didn't seem like the character had a way written in him to pull off those scenes. However, I loved the sci-fi ideas of how the future can be predicted through DNA. I've always wanted to see them explored in film. The first act was the best scene, with the prologue and then the growing up montage, although it's a shame that the film's climax returned to a homage to the montage which seemed really immature with a predictable twist. There's a great short film in here somewhere, with a bit too much excess to pad it out to a feature.7/10</fullReview>

The world has become a Gestapo-like in it's enforcement of social strata based on tightly enforced class matters. A young man finds a way to 'pass' as someone else and upsets the social establishment for his own goals.*Special Stars- Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, Jude Law, Alan Arkin, Ernest Borgine. *Theme- Being yourself instead of others is the best truth.*Trivia/location/goofs- Locations: Marin County Civic Center, Sepulveda Spillway. Look for the ripped shoulder jacket seam when the policeman gets attacked and then it magically repairs itself.*Emotion- A complex and heavy duty film plot tackling some major questions of our modern era. Interesting to see and understand the lesson that the director wanted the viewer to think about after seeing this film. This is an important film theme and could be more than more can handle, but worth seeing to open you own mind on these societal issues.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I would like to state that the musical score in this film was incredible and I still remember the musical motif to this day.I believe this movie was a great story about the strength of the human spirit and how it can more than fully augment deficiencies in genetics.I don't believe the stark portrait of the future depicted in this film will actually come true, as I don't have such pessimism about the humanity of humanity. But, I believe in certain group think circumstances, it might come true. Whatever the case, I think the movie gave a great portrayal of what it is like to be deemed genetically inferior.The main character's hard work and endurance to reach his dreams gave a universal meaning and message without coming off as too corny. Also, I didn't think his plight and efforts for greatness detracted anything from the message. Often movies try too hard at pushing their universal message that the story ends up being horrible and the message ends up being overly done.This movie can help inspire all to believe in hard work and dedication while showing that the spirit is the strongest thing a human can have.The only one flaw I felt in this movie was the swimming competition with his brother. After already beating him once, beating him again was useless. They should have saved him beating his brother for the second time, having him lose the first time in his youth. This would have made it more powerful. While the swimming part was a bit corny, I couldn't think of any better way it could have been done.Finally, I believe Jerome's suicide at the end really solidified the meaning of spirit. He has felt his chance at greatness passed and has lived on through the main character, thus completing his life.</fullReview>

This film was directed by Andrew Niccol and published in the year 1997. "Gattaca" deals with the story of two men, Vincent and Jermoe, who exchange their identity because Vincent has a big dream which he can only realized with the healthy and physical properties of a gen-manipulated person, like Jerome. I think it was really hard for me to follow the story of the movie because you are glad about to understand the last scene and in the next you get so many new information that you are confused once against. In spite the film was very exiting and you always want to know what happens next. Perhaps the most poignant scene in the film is in which Vincent preserve his brother Anton out of the water because he is threaten to perish.

		<shortDescription>Humanity lives on despite the rule of biogenetics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Science fiction is defined by its plausibility, and this is genuine sci-fi. It's a very plausible extension of existing oppressive government/social rule combined with technological advances in biogenetics. The world depicted is selecting men and women to do such tasks as space exploration on the basis of genetics. Their training and surroundings, while artistic in exterior effect, nonetheless are robotic. The chosen elite persons are under the thumb of authority, regimentation, genetic testing, and identification at all times. The situation of those that society says are genetically inferior is similar, but they are like the proles of "1984". They are consigned to menial tasks. Humanity is being suppressed. Mating has become a matter of genes, not heart. Aspirations are channeled by genetic capabilities, not dreams, will power and human determination. Human emotions exist but they are being hampered and dampened.Into this world comes a man who is genetically inferior to his brother and to the elite but who aspires to go into space travel. He is not hampered by his limits or fears, so that he even outlasts his superior brother in their racing contest. The human spirit triumphs.This is what makes Gattaca a beautiful story. It is that the human spirit comes through despite all, and begins to break the bonds of society's impositions that are being promoted by science and government. Even the murder of the director of the travel training facility is a sign of this rebellion, and there are other clear signs as well. But the story focuses on Ethan Hawke's personal struggle and challenges to pass himself off as a superior by using genetic material from someone willing to sell it to him who was in the elite before becoming crippled.The story takes a strong neo noir turn when the director's murder disrupts the usual routines and Hawke may be found out as Alan Arkin persists in ad hoc genetic roundups and tests.The story is simple yet powerful. It's easy to understand and beautiful. It's the story of a man wanting to be free to aspire and not be classified and pre-determined by genetic probabilities.The main thing I did not like about this film was the last few lines. These didn't fit the main themes at all, in my opinion. They actually make little sense in the context of the movie and work against the themes. These lines are "They say every atom in our bodies was once a part of a star. Maybe I'm not leaving; maybe I'm going home." These lines are NOT about human spirit. They are materialistic. They are about the material universe, making it out to be some kind of home. They are viewing the human being as atoms. This is not spiritual at all. It is a denial of God as a person and the human being in his image. It is more in keeping with the ungodly roboticism and anti-humanity society that Hawke is leaving behind. I cannot fathom why the writer, who otherwise did an excellent job, chose to end the film with these lines.The performances I regarded as adequate and not much more. The story shone above the casting and the direction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great directorial debut and a science fiction experience of the highest sort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In times, when most of the science fiction movies specialize in alien invasions and put too much emphasis on special effects, Gattaca comes as a film, which possesses the best feature that this specific film category could possibly have to offer - an idea. An idea actually so believable and scary that the use of the phrase 'not-too-distant future' in the beginning is perfectly appropriate. It's a time when bioformed people are superior to all those, who are naturally born, and thus, prone to various infections, disorders or diseases. Parents are able to choose the perfect characteristics of the newborn prior to its birth, making him or her an adequate addition to the hierarchized society. It's a truly provocative concept, which might really seem not that inaccurate, as we live in the times when genetic modifications are becoming more frequent and easier to execute.This was definitely a bad time for little Vincent (Ethan Hawke) to be born. With a bad eyesight, heart problems and life expectancy of only 30 years, he is categorized as an 'In-Valid' and forced to work as a cleaner in a space center in order to earn some money. His big dream of flying to Saturn one day would probably never come true, if it weren't for a mysterious and highly illegal program, which lets an inferior man assume the identity of a, so-called, Valid, distinguished human being (with his permission). That's the moment when Vincent meets Jerome (Jude Law), a perfect example of a bioformed person. However, due to a car accident he is no longer able to walk. He wants to help Vincent to chase his dream. He supplies him with blood and urine samples, pumped-up heartbeats and all the other objects that will transform him into a different man. Vincent is really close to achieving his goal, but a few days before the flight one of the supervisors is killed. It puts his whole plan in jeopardy, as he (the real Vincent) quickly becomes the prime suspect. The tension increases, because he might be caught any minute. The game of cat and mouse with the police begins, and it turns out to be more surprising than one might think.Gattaca, apart from presenting a futuristic idea about our society, is also a rich and complex character analysis. It shows two completely opposing personalities - Vincent and Jerome - and how their perception of life differs from one another. The former is an overly optimistic dreamer, who would do exactly anything to chase his lifelong goal of traveling to space, even though most of the invalids generally accept their place in the hierarchy. The latter is a man, whose whole world collapsed with one tragic incident. He became suicidal. However, when he started to spend time with Vincent, and gave him means to achieve his dream, he began to realize that when Vincent will finally make it to space, he would actually accomplish the same thing. As he put it in his own words: 'I only lent you my body - you lent me your dream'. All in all, Gattaca is a great position in the science fiction genre, because apart from the thrilling and spellbinding storyline, it tickles our imagination with its brilliant, but frightening ideas of a futuristic world. And in all this it is also able to offer great cinematography, convincing and impressive acting, terrific music, and a really touching ending. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Gattaca" is one of those rare films that completes its main theme. The film's principle, "There Is No Gene For The Human Spirit", is the core of this futuristic thriller foreboding the adversities of genetic engineering. Andrew Niccol wrote and directed this little (less than 2 hours) film so well that every aspect of the film successfully unfolds and ties together perfectly from the opening sequence of a person's "particles" to the distant particles in space.The film gets better after the 2nd and 3rd viewing, and I have seen it 5 times since it was release. The narrative technique, which I will not reveal, was very effective especially because of an "element of surprise" that is revealed close to the end. Ethan Hawke is a proving to be a GREAT actor with his multitude of roles (in movies like "Reality Bites", "Dead Poets...", "Great Expectations", etc.), Uma Thurman is perfect for her role, Gore Vidal is very effective as the aloof director of Gattaca, and Alan Arkin is quite funny. The Art Direction is marvelous, but you'll have to see it for yourself.</fullReview>

The movie deals with human perseverance, but not annoyingly so. You will root for the good guy in this movie, without question.The main character reveals his plight earlier than in "The Island", and it feels like we are part of some secret that no one else knows. There was no part of the movie, where the idea that "everything could go wrong, right now" is not there. It is enthralling all of these "almost misses", especially when supplemented with the subtle way that the movie twists.The score is well done as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A near perfect movie about imperfection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gattaca (1997) was written and directed by Andrew Niccol and, though it passed under the radar of the general audience, it is an intelligent and stylish science fiction movie.Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke) has dreamt of venturing into space all of his life and has worked hard to become qualified for it. The only catch is this: Vincent was born naturally, which is against the current practice of being genetically engineered. People born naturally are labelled 'invalids' and are discriminated heavily against, putting them in a lower class and with no chance of attaining anything great in their lives. All the prominent careers go to the 'valids', the ones who have been given the best genes from both parents and these can go on to do pretty much anything they want to.Vincent finds an opportunity to take a valid's identity, a practice that is becoming common in the black market. He meets up with Jerome Morrow (Jude Law) who has a very high genetic profile, but was rendered wheelchair bound after breaking his back. Vincent can now use Jerome's identity as a valid to get into Gattaca where all the space missions are run. In order to pass as Jerome he needs constant urine samples, blood samples, hair samples etc to pass the constant tests that keep Gattaca free from invalids. He also tries to get rid of any of his own DNA by cleaning his workstation constantly and taking vigorous showers and minimising any dead skin that could give him away.After a gruelling interview process (literally just a urine sample) Vincent gains access to Gattaca and soon comes in line to venture off into space. All goes well until the final week before the mission when the mission director is murdered. Police investigating find an eyelash belonging to Vincent who has been missing since he took up Jerome's identity. Vincent is innocent of the murder but the police don't know that and, besides, catching him will reveal that he is an invalid posing as a valid.We now have Vincent's struggle to remain unnoticed by both the police who suspect him to be a murderer and testing everyone for DNA, and the Gattaca Corporation from discovering his true identity. What I like about this movie first of all is that it is set in a semi- plausible future. If we could genetically engineer our children if we wished, how would the natural 'inferior' people be treated? Technically they are inferior but does anyone have the right to discriminate against them? Racism and sexism seem to be done away with to make way for a prejudice on a genetic level and your parents' choice in reproduction methods will affect your future. These are obviously the themes that the movie explores the most but there are numerous others that it deals with from human spirit, 'what is perfection?', personal identity and sibling rivalry to name but a few.The whole movie looks great, from the stylish suits and outfits that could come right out of a 50's noir movie, to the sets which, again, go for style rather than the 'hey this is a sci-fi movie, let's go crazy' craze of bigger budget equivalents.The acting is good all round; Hawke is a confident guy despite his 'disadvantage', Law is the depressed guy despite his 'perfections' but learns much from Vincent. Uma Thurman, looking more elegant than ever, plays Vincent's colleague and love interest well, you never know her agenda and as she gets close to discovering the truth you're unsure as to how she will respond. The support cast is equally as good by the likes of Alan Arkin as the detective, Xandar Berkeley as the doctor who does the daily tests and Gore Vidal as director of Gattaca.Anyone wishing to watch a movie that is intelligent, yet not complex at all, looks fantastic and raises many issues for you to ponder over afterwards should definitely catch this movie. The pace is perfect, it's an interesting set up, well delivered in its execution and definitely needs more attention than it got at its cinema release.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie for all who are Genetically Imperfect (all of us)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Made by the same director of The Truman Show, Gattaca, a film set in "the not too distant future," shows how humankind's blind faith in technology and genetic science will compel us to create a two-tier system of the human race: the genetically enhanced, "Valids," and the nonenchanced, "Invalids." Gattaca is a world where humans are no longer measured by their moral character but rather by their DNA, their genetic code. Dating, jobs, health insurance, reproductive rights are all monitored by the government, which wants to keep the "Valids" pure and uncontaminated. Our protagonist, an "Invalid," must use his human spirit--courage, love, tenacity, cunning--to transcend the strictures the government has imposed on him. More specifically, he wants to live out his dream of space travel, but he has to assume the identity of a "Valid," and the movie goes to great lengths showing us the pains our hero suffers in order to live out his charade. Thus the movie pits human character against blind faith in science in a film that, without ever preaching to us, shows the dangers of dehumanization in a world where technology is supposed to lead us to Paradise.</fullReview>

Having a weaker heart or bad view can be determined in the first minute of your life. People are divided between valid and non-valid. Being valid opens any door for you whether being non-valid shuts down any chance for having a good status in the society. However being valid also make everyone expect perfection, being first, being over achiever, never losing. If you are valid you have to support the bargain of your perfection and 10 times more the disappointment of any failure. ...So who wins? This is where yet another "something" we cannot understand comes up - "spirit". So they say spirit has no genes. But is spirit enough to compensate for your good or bad genes? Gattaca movie makes and good attempt to answer this questions. Andrew Niccol, the director of the Truman Show brings on the scene a believable appearance of how world will look like ...a while from now.</fullReview>

Vincent's dream of entering Gattaca, a sort of futuristic NASA, to fulfill his dream of traveling to space will force him to become an impostor with the help of crippled genetic-master-piece Jerome.Gattaca is a noir film set in a retro-future that uses the elements of both genres to offer an allegory on the superiority of the strength of the human spirit, willpower and "heart" to pursue your dreams and overcome difficulties over genetic perfection. Gattaca is also a story on the need of the individuals to remain such, with their virtues and defects, to avoid creating meaningless amorphous societies.A world like Gattaca is not only possible, but it is already happening. When the movie was shot, the mapping of the Human Genome was still an unfinished project, and many of the things that we know now were unknown then. However, the film explored with great thought and inventive the effects of human genetic selection and improvement, and posed many of the questions that we are already asking, +10 years later, regarding genetics and its use in medicine and conception.Visually speaking, the film has a terrific cinematography and framing of the images, with great hues, toning, and a 50s-60s ambiance, architecture, interiors, and wardrobe. It is very minimalist, with clean lines and metallic textures that create a sophisticated atmosphere and mood. The music by Michael Nyman is subtly enveloping, very classy, and truly adds a lot to the mood of the film. In fact, the movie looks as fresh and modern today as when it was released, - an achievement in itself.The acting is good, especially by Jude Law as the sarcastic heavy-drinker good-natured Jerome, and Ethan Hawke as dreamer calculating impostor Vincent. Alan Arkin is very classy as Detective Hugo. Umma Thurman is OK as the shy, clever and elegant Irene; she and Hawke had a great chemistry on camera, which really reaches the viewer. There are cameos by the always terrific Gore Vidal, as Gattaca's director Josef, and Ernest Borgnine, as Gattaca's head janitor Caesar.On the negative side, the investigation and suspense part of the film are somewhat predictable with a few flaws in the storyline, and there are a few lacunae regarding the life of some of the characters that I would have liked developed or at least hinted.The name Gattaca comes from the initials of the 4 essential chemicals that are the basis of the DNA: GTCA.A sci-fic suspenseful film that will both entertain you and make your think. A modern classic of the sci-fic .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful yet underrated gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having not seen this sine it first came out I though it time to revisit it. Made back in 1996, this sci-fi film tells the story of Vincent -played by Ethan Hawke- who is born with defects and so can never travel into space to fulfill his dream. He decides though to try and pays to take on the identity of Jerome (Jude Law) who has perfect genetics and therefore is a ticket to the stars. Jerome has to supply Vincent with urine and blood samples all of which may be tested at any time at the Gattaca Institute. Vincent has also ensure that he has no loose hairs or skin that may be found and analyzed breaking his secret. His fake perfection leads to a place on a mission to Triton and a romance with co worker Irene (Uma Thurman), but when a murder at Gattaca occurs a stray eyelash of Vincent's may expose him and bring his dreams crashing down.It's best to describe this as perhaps art-house sci-fi. There is no big brash special effects, there is no need, for it the story is really focused on the human side. Hawke is excellent as Vincent, his transformation from Vincent to Jerome is subtle yet brilliant. Uma Thurman has little to do with Irene and perhaps this is a character that could have been further explored. The idea of genetic manipulation and the strive for perfection is cleverly woven into the fabric of the film and yet it never over does itself, there are no super human freaks and the suggestion of a genetic divide is a subtle one, but hints at the dangerous potential are made with a performance by a 12 fingered pianist. The 'Not so distant future' is presented with less focus on technology but more on idea of genetic advances although there are little hints at what is to come, such as electric cars and phone watches.The artistic side of the film is brilliant and gives the reason I call it art-house sci-fi. Beautifully photographed with subdued colours, often browns and greens, there is a stylish, sleek and ultra modern look to it. Clean lines and simplistic style abound in sets as well as the use of some fantastic architecture it all helps give it a contemporary look that is both familiar and unfamiliar. Scored by a restrained Michael Nyman, the music is beautifully suited.The film is perhaps one of the finest yet underrated sci-fi films that's provides for a fascinating yet laid back thriller, that is ultimately quite moving.More of my reviews at iheartfilms.weebly.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely excellent example of the artform - a film that will stand the test of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My only sadness is that it took me this long to finally get around to seeing this film on DVD. This is one of those exceedingly rare works which will stand the test of time, as one of the most compelling examples of the scifi genre' ever produced in this context.The science fiction concepts of molecular medicine and synthetically enhanced selective genetics utilized to sculpt an emergent social order have been in the minds of many for decades, and in fact are now becoming a science fact, as is so often the case with scifi concepts in general.What makes this film so interesting is the completely original way in which this core concept was woven into a story that is compelling on so many different levels.From the very start, the viewer is drawn into a complex drama of conflicting personal agendas, passions and social confinements encountered in this world of the not too distant future.Of course, Uma Thurman is spectacular in this work, but the caliber of acting and emotional engagement with all of the characters in this film are absolutely first rate.If you are looking for a gaudy action film with endless special effects and blazing pyrotechnics, skip past this piece of work, as you will find none of this here. In fact, this is one of the most sparsely decorated films of the scifi genre' I've ever seen, and yet this aspect is not even noticed.What is relevant here is a marvelously well crafted story, acted and directed as well as could be possible to deliver a viewing experience which inspires thought and introspective long after the closing scenes of this film.This is one of those rare pieces I will view more than once, perhaps quite a few times over the coming years with various friends and situations . . . and for me, that's saying a lot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As Ebert says in his review, it is about ideas. In fact, this film and "Blade Runner" have that in common. They are films about ideas, the human condition and where our folly and arrogance might lead us.The world in Gattaca is already upon us. In India female fetuses are aborted to get a male heir. In Western societies blue eyes and blonde hair are often requested. We have practiced genetic engineering by purpose breeding in plants and animals for some time. In plants we seem to have done very well. In animals not well at all and some of the intended results have been dangerous rather than funny. Still, we press on. The question centers around whether or not we are right to meddle with genetics to engineer a "better product". The movie is filled with good people relegated to servile status because they were not engineered. Even Jude Law's character, a arrogant product of that engineering who became flawed by accident, becomes quite sympathetic as the movie progresses."Blade Runner"s future is further off yet we are headed there with reckless abandon. That question is even more troubling. Having engineered a sentient machine superiour to ourselves and intelligent enough to create an assembly line to reproduce itself do we have the right to destroy it? Taken together they are a frightening indictment of where we are headed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Understated and outstanding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a beautiful, political, somewhat polemical and very WASPish film.Set in a not-too-distant future where the genetic engineering of children in the womb has become commonplace, Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke) is a baby born naturally, without any alterations or improvements. Unlike his scientifically designed younger brother Anton, Vincent has DNA remarkable only for his high chance of dying young from a bad heart. That unenhanced genetic code is an anchor on Vincent's life. In this new world, they don't judge you by your ambition or even your achievements. All that matters is the biological potential built in to your genes. Without the right DNA, Vincent is lucky to get a job as a janitor. But still he studies and trains and dreams of getting a job at the Gattaca corporation and getting on one of their rocketships and flying into space.Vincent, however, will never be able to do that as long as he remains Vincent. So instead, he has to become Jerome Morrow. Vincent enters a black market world where people assumed the genetic identities of others. Jerome (Jude Law) is a artificially conceived superman who lacked the will and the drive to live up to his physical and intellectual gifts. Then he was crippled and became the perfect match for Vincent. Jerome will provide Vincent with his identity and physical samples of his blood, hair, urine and skin cells, so Vincent can use Jerome's DNA as his passport to Gattaca and the stars. In return, Vincent will support Jerome in the style to which he's become accustomed.It almost works, until a mission controller at Gattaca is murdered. The police investigate and find some of Vincent's inferior DNA, making him the prime suspect. But will they be able to figure out that the Jerome who works at Gattaca and is about to leave Earth for a trip to one of Saturn's moons is really the "de-gene-erate" named Vincent?This is a visually subdued but very good looking movie. It very much follows the future sensibility of 2001: A Space Odyssey, where the world-to-come is clean and cold and unadorned. Gattaca's look is more corporate than antiseptic, however, and isn't too concerned with trying to realistically represent a possible future. It's more stylized, which I think that makes the imagery of Gattaca striking and memorable in a way most sci-fi films are not.The cast features some fine work by the fairly young Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman and Jude Law. Thurman, as the woman who falls in love with Vincent, feels trapped by the limitations of her genes. Law is excellent as a man burdened and tortured by the expectations of his own genetic perfection. Hawke takes on the most challenging role and pulls it off almost without flaw. As Vincent playing Jerome, he has to show the audience emotions and thoughts while making us believe no one around "Jerome" can see them. Ernest Borgnine shines in his few moments on screen and Loren Dean, as the cop investigating Vincent, manages to embody what the audience is suppose to dislike about this future world without ever becoming a two-dimensional pawn of the script.This story takes a very dim view of trying to build better human beings and creates a frighteningly possible future culture of genetic entitlement, but writer/director Andrew Niccol didn't just make a piece of propaganda. What he did was imagine a world of DNA prejudice that is no different from the petty bigotries that have swayed the minds of Men since the very beginning. He does suggest that a bigotry backed by the most advanced science may be more pernicious and hard to challenge than any other.Gattaca is a wonderful movie that might not "click" with everyone because it keeps its emotions hidden and restrained. It's very powerful message is more interested in engaging your mind than in tugging on your heartstrings. But if you're willing to open yourself up to it, this is a film that can move you on a very deep level.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the not too distant future, science can determine a person's future health simply by taking a drop of blood from him/her at childbirth. Vincent Freedman has dreamt about going to space since he was a kid, but the tell-tale signs in his genes will never let him come even cose to the spacecraft. He swaps identities with another lonely individual (who has flawless genes) and begin training for the Gattaca space programme, but how long can he keep it a secret? especially with the numerous tests that the trainees muct take.Gattaca is essentially a film about humanity; what does it mean? Who decides what the 'perfect human' is? is it right or wrong to judge people based on knowledge of fate? Vincent may not be the right physical specemin, but he has something in him which could not be more human: a dream. Vincent believes he can cheat fate, to achieve his goal. It takes quite a believer to be someone like that.Ignoring a small dose of silliness (or to put it more lightly contrivance) to the storyline, Gattaca succseeds in being not simply involving, but heartwarming. Not many science fiction films go for that (most are either action or horror oriented). Gattaca belongs in the same bunch as Close Encounters and Contact. It is a fairly adult movie. It is not flashy, or dazzling or with have anything to show off, it is simple and direct (in part because it is Earthbound up until the last two shots) but mostly because the project is mostly character invested. That is not to say that Gattaca is not a pretty picture. It is well shot and full of nice compositions. Its design bears the minimalist art approach to the conception of the future.Gattica is a film worth noting for science fiction goers. it's not a long movie, but it requires perhaps a bit of patience. If you have that, Gattaca won't disappoint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A marvelous love story between two people. Love for being human.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gattaca is an extraordinary movie. It is a love story between two people that while seeking perfection?either in the perfect man or in the perfect trip to the stars?are reminded of their own imperfection by people who are supposed to love them, not to put them down. Society has been transformed by scientific progress into a Platonist ideal. Genetics transforms humans into perfect organism. There is a generalized cult to perfection. Rationality prevails over emotions. But it is a myth. The perfect beings win silver medals, not the gold. The perfect sibling cannot out swim the weaker brother. The perfect director of the space program turns out to be a murderer. And the lovers to be, who at the beginning offer hair specimens so that the future partner can run tests and decide whether to engage or not, discover that love trumps perfection, that in the midst of imperfect humans lies the fertile ground for love to flourish. It is a rebirth of Luddites, this time proving the quest for perfection to be, not an impossible dream but an impossible nightmare. At the end, the lovers discover that they do not need to decode the partner's DNA to make the rational decision of whether to l-o-v-e or not to l-o-v-e, they just need to love. The caring doctor testing the urine knows that the specimen submitted by Vincent, the normal human being pretending to be Jerome, the perfect human being, is a fake. But he has profound human reasons to ignore the test results; to treat the quest for perfection for what it truly is: a big farce.The word GATTACA has the letters of the four amino acids that weave human DNA.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine but Fatally Flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fine film. Even an important one for anyone having to deal with discrimination of any kind. The acting is compelling, as is the music. But as fine as it is, there is a fatal flaw, and as important as it is, it becomes distracting because of the increasing improbabilities. The first 10 minutes sets up how literally hygienically controlled down to the cellular level every human being's life is in the future. Then, when you are prepared and intrigued to see this premise explained, sloppy scripting prevails and the rest of the movie is seeing trucks driven through yawning plot holes to the point...literally...of distraction. You soon stop caring because it's obvious the plot is going to ignore itself to get to the expected conclusion. What could have been powerful becomes a series of "Why" rather than the "Wow" the first few minutes promised. So why do I give it such a high (8 out of 10) score with this "fatal" flaw? Because I was born with multiple birth defects (cough, cough) years ago. My parents were told I wouldn't live but I did. And a lot of things that shouldn't &amp; couldn't have happened did. It turns out fatal flaws don't stop you from enjoying life if you have the will to live. And the improbable isn't impossible after all. This film, for all its plot holes, gives that message and it's one worth spreading because it's true. I know because I've lived it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I finally got around to watching this movie over the weekend. 12 years after its release. I found it has stood the test of time quite well, and I'm sure will remain a classic for many years. I only knocked it 2 stars for being somewhat predictable/cliché at times. Ethan Hawke gives a great performance, as does Jude Law. The final scene was quite memorable and touching. The musical score was superb.I was a little sad when I read here that the coda paying tribute to some of the great "de-gene-erates" in history was cut from the final movie (it had apparently been in the final scene/credit sequence). Having watched the Blu-Ray version, I expected that to have been added back, but it wasn't- at least not in the version that I watched. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, a very interesting (and eerily believable) peek into humanity's not-too-distant future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inspiring tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I discovered this gem of a movie released back in 1997. Directed by Andrew Niccols, who directed one of my favorites - Lord of War, Gattaca is a movie that weaves elements of sci-fi, romance, suspense and drama around the theme of human spirit.The movie's tagline "There is No Gene for The Human Spirit" reverberates in the rousing tale of its protagonist, Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke), an in-valid living in a future of genetically tailored humans who dreams the impossible - of flying into space. Asthma, a weak heart and physical frailness do nothing to deter his courage and perseverance to succeed. As he overcomes his challenges through his will, he inspires his stronger, more-gifted friends by the resilience of his spirit.More at me blog http://ratnaabhishek.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Definitely a film that gets better with age. I love me my sci-fi noirs, so of course I am predisposed to love this film, but what makes this film different is its message. It's very subdued and quiet, but its commentary on humanity and science is quite moving and is quickly becoming more and more relevant. The visuals are nothing noteworthy, even if they're quite beautiful, and the acting - apart from Jude Law, who is terrific - is nothing special, but the story that is told - complete with the fantastic dialogue - makes this film all the better. It's not flashy, it's not very original, and it's not exceptionally visionary, but it is a very moving film and one of the best sci-fi flicks of the past ten years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Science than Fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gattaca is a Science-Fiction movie without fighting Jedis or fire explosions in space. The movie comes along with a calm introduction but the tension rises about the whole movie and it is not because of very impressing scenes its more because the movie feeds you little pieces about 101 minutes and you can never be sure you know now everything. This movie is more realistic because it deals with science that we can have in 20 or 30 years too and so it plays with our fear that this movie will be real for us in some time and we will live in a world where we are divided in genetically perfect and imperfect people.Vincent Freeman's dream is to fly to Titan. But that is impossible for him because he is a so called Invalid. An Invalid is a natural born child which is genetically imperfect and he has no place in society. Vincent is born and the doctor diagnosed a heart problem because of this Vincent will die with the age of 30. His younger brother Anton is a Valid and he always is in competition with him. Only one time Vincent wins against his brother. When Vincent is grown up he works at Gattaca as a cleaner. His dream becomes even stronger there. Vincent meets a man who brings him to Jerome Morrow. He is genetically perfect but after an accident he needs a wheel chair. Jerome Morrow sells his identity to Vincent. Vincent uses Jerome's hair, skin and fingerprint for the tests at Gattaca. He becomes a job there and after a while he is a first class navigator. But then a murder happens and there a strict controls. The police find an eyelash from an Invalid and there are more tests now. Vincent has to be very careful. He just has meet Irene. She is a beautiful women and not as perfect as she seems. She has a heart problem too. Vincent likes her but to hide his real identity has now priority. There are no special effects in the movie but a lot of very impressive scenes and visual effects like the scenes where Vincent getting himself ready for work and he prepares his whole body. The setting is mostly in the rooms of Gattaca or Jerome's house. There is always a very futuristic and cold design. The colours black and silver dominate everything. The soundtrack fits so good that you cannot remember it at the end of the movie. It is not noisy. The music is like Vincent at Gattaca. Not obvious but always there. The costumes and the makeup are very reserved. They wear only suits at Gattaca. Only when Vincent goes out with Irene she wears an evening dress. The movie has a lot of symbols. Even in the name Gattaca. The name is made of the first letters of the four nuclein bases Thymine, Adenine, Guanine and Cytosine. This four build our genetic code. The stairs in Jerome's house have the shape of our alpha-double-helix. This is the shape of our DNA. In my opinion this is a good Science-Fiction movie but not one of my favourite movies. I like the fact that they did not use violence to make it more impressive for the audience. I think it is good to show what can happen even to genetically perfect persons like Jerome who tries to kill himself because he lost one time a game and that someone like Vincent can achieve his aims even he has not the conditions they want. Gattaca is a movie you want to see more than one time. It cannot become boring because of the lot of symbols and details. I do not like the fact that the movie has the same clichés like most of the Hollywood movies. There has to be a love story. Actors and actress are fabulous looking. I think the movie would be even better without involving the love part because there is no need for it. And after Irene finds out that Vincent lied to her, she does not appear another time in the movie and you do not know what she thinks. I think the movie will be less interesting if you are not interested in genetics because it is a lot about specific working with genes and technical terms.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Triumph of the Human Spirit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Welcome to the 21st Century, an era when things aren't that much different, but people are. Consider all of the birth defects that such an approach can bring about. While it would be unreasonable to outlaw sex for the purpose of producing offspring, be aware than any children so conceived are almost certain to be "in-valids" - genetically imperfect and ill-suited to be productive members of society. There is a better, more rational way; a method that will guarantee health, stamina, and physical attractiveness. Shortly after they were married, Vincent's parents decided to start a family the "old-fashioned way", without any help from test tubes. The result was a boy who was diagnosed as 99% likely to have a heart defect. That rendered Vincent ineligible for all but the most menial of jobs. But his dream was to work at "The Gattaca Aerospace Corporation" and participate in the first-ever manned flight to the moons of Saturn. Vincent locates Jerome Morrow, a genetically superior individual who was paralyzed as the result of an accident. He agrees to sell Vincent his identity (including blood and urine on demand, fingerprints, hair, etc.). So, equipped with Jerome's genetic resume, which guarantees him work anywhere, Vincent applies for a position at Gattaca. He is accepted and quickly proves his worth to everyone. A week before doing the mission, he becomes a suspect in a murder investigation and his carefully-guarded secret is in danger of being exposed. One of the things that impressed me the most about GATTACA is its ability to keep the level of tension high - there are enough little twists and turns to keep the audience involved. Ethan Hawke (Vincent) does perfect work, proving his ability to carry a film and reaffirming his high charisma level. Jude Law (Jerome) has a star-making presence, and it's his scenes with Hawke that give the movie its emotional core. Uma Thurman (Irene) is slightly underdeveloped, but the story isn't about her. However, she gives a lot of depth to the flat, cold character. In my opinion, things get a little strange as the movie nears its climax, when Vincent's relationship with his brother comes back into view. The big dramatic culmination is a swim race, which is a bit silly or just too easy. Other things just seemed too simple within the futuristic setting. "If they can do that, why can't they do this?" Unlike most recent science-fiction, Gattaca actually gives you something to talk about on the way home, and you're certain to think of it again the next time you clip your fingernails and buff away some dry skin. It's successful sci-fi without showy special effects, it's a thriller with character-driven thrills, a futuristic fable without blood. Although it's portrayal of the upcoming century is grim, "Gattaca" serves up one of the most thought-provoking societal forecasts ever depicted on film (like "Equilibrium" with Christian Bale). Overall I would rate Gattaca a 9 (out of 10).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great and powerful film! This is one of my favorite film of all time. I can watch this film over and over again and continue to be amazed. This film is about a young man named Vincent Freeman who is played by Ethan Hawke who was born genetically inferior to his younger brother Anton. He is a love child who was conceived in the back of his parents car when he was born his parents were told that he would not live longer than 32 years of age and that he had a heart condition. The generation that he lived in many of the children were born via in vitro fertilization and the parents chose what trait they want to see in their children like either they want them to be athletic, artistic, tall, the shade of eyes, color of hair and etc. So, his parents after he was born did not want to take the chance of having a child like Vincent so they decided to go to an in vitro fertilization clinic and have the perfect genetic son. When Vincent was born, his father was so ashamed of his son genetic inferiority that he blatantly chose not to name him after himself instead he named his second child after him. Vincent as a teen wanted to be an astronaut and dreamed of flying in space, but new that with his genetic inferiority and heart condition that it would not be possible. Throughout his childhood, he was treated by his parents as sickly and got sick of it. One day, he and his brother always played this swimming game who can go further without getting tired and Vincent always lost to his brother, but he finally won. So, after beating his brother, he runs away from home and realized that although his brother is genetically superior to him, he is not as weak as he was led to believed. Vincent meets Tony shaloub character who is willing to give young Vincent the opportunity to fly in space by devising a scheme that involves Vincent taking over Jude Law's character Jerome Eugene Morrow identity in return Vincent takes care of Law who is crippled after botched suicide attempt. Eugene is genetically superior to Vincent. Majority of the film involves Vincent trying to be inconspicuous, him and Eugene working together like Eugene giving him his hair, urine samples and Vincent scrubbing himself ritually so his DNA is not found in the facility. Vincent works hard and finally gets selected to fly into space, but Tony Shaloub's character gets murdered and the race is to find who did it and Vincent's DNA is found in the facility while he is trying to stay in the background and do the job that he loves. He is a suspect and the detective running the investigation is his younger brother Anton whom he has not seen since he left home. The overwhelming theme of this film is whether genetic perfection is right and should we put the laws of God into scientist hands? Is having a genetic flaw a reason to be discriminated against? Should we allow our handicap to hold us back? Well, Vincent did not so should he be praised or punished for his deceptions? The acting was superb! I became a big Jude Law fan after seeing this film. It is one of his best works. I was always an Ethan Hawke fan growing up and he did not disappoint me at all. This is the film where he and Uma first met. The chemistry between them in the film is great. If you have not seen this movie it is a good film to rent or better yet it is a great film to have in your movie library. This movie deserved some accolades, but was overshadowed by other good films that was released that year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Gattaca' is an excellent film, not just for science-fiction fans but for everyone as it offers not only a unique insight into subtle prejudice against a 'minority' section of society but also offers a bleak look into a possible future if humans interfere too much in the procreation process that nothing is left to fate.Set in the not-too-distant future, Vincent is a 'god-child' born without any genetic manipulation thus condemning him to being seen as weak, sickly and obsolete in a society where genetically-enhanced children are the norm. Fuelled by dreams of travelling into space, Vincent refuses to accept his destiny lies in manual labour work, the only jobs open to one who is considered imperfect. Instead, he turns to the criminal underworld where he assumes the identity of Jerome Eugene Morrow, who has the perfect genetics which could take him anywhere were it not for the fact he was crippled in a car accident, in exchange for a percentage of the wage he will make working at space organisation Gattaca. But just as the pair think everything is running smoothly and Vincent is within days of achieving his ambition of going into space, their world is thrown into chaos when the mission director is murdered and the police start to close, threatening to blow Vincent's identity.Ethan Hawke did an excellent job portraying Vincent's quiet determination to achieve his goals and overcome his 'disability' of being genetically-imperfect and in showing that genes don't take into account hard work and a fighting spirit. Hawke's performance was well compliment by Jude Law as the arrogant, darker Jerome, a man who had everything handed to him on a plate thanks to his perfect genetics were it not for the lack of hope that brought him down. And Uma Thurman provided an interesting character in Vincent's love interest Irene, who comes to understand that a person's DNA doesn't make a difference.In a world where designer babies are becoming a very real possibility, 'Gattaca' certainly raises questions about how far are we willing to go to create perfect children and how much we should leave to fate lest we develop a race of clones who are unwilling to accept anything less than perfection. This is film that keeps the audience thinking about the issues raised in the film and what is it we want from the future. It also offers a look into what it is to be disabled in society which underestimates the abilities of those less-than-able and the prejudices, both direct and indirect, they face.'Gattaca' is a film not only for the sci-fi geek but also for those who enjoy a good philosophical debate over the future offered in the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>why do you think they used that? I was thinking in the first one, it was to show Vincent's insignificance compared to his brother, and maybe a power struggle...Also, did you notice the yellow light used continuously in the film? Kinda creates an eerie feeling, what do u reckon? I saw the swimming compeititons as being a motif in the film to show how determinition can override genetic possibilities. i guess theer really is no gene for the human spiritThanks for your time</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest Science Fiction Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Human aspirations take on two forms: the desire for the physical (that which we can perceive with our senses), and the desire for the spiritual (dreams, hope, love, faith).Science has always been forced to fight to make sure that it does not entirely dispense with the spiritual, and art has strained to incorporate the material as part of itself. At the extreme of each, we get stunning failures. We have art that is meaningless because it does not speak to us in any meaningful way, music and cinema that has no grounding in reality and cannot be understood by us because there is nothing about it worth understanding. And we get science at the service of ideas that dehumanize us, that disregard our spirit and dreams.Gattaca gives us an example of something that has already happened many times before: the desire for the perfect physical entity, whose existence is preferred to that of the 'normal' human being. The interesting thing about such ideas is that they start off with a concept of a perfect human being, which is nonsense, and apply this concept to reality, which cannot accommodate such an idea. Moreover, the idea of perfection is a dream. Science, when it aims for perfection without considering the imperfect subject, is dangerously removed from reality and too reliant on its own dreams.The only difference between the film and reality is that, in the film, that dream of science appears to come closer to reality. But of course it's not. Hawke's character, citing Jerome's accident, states that you cannot control fate. Precisely. Reality will not accommodate any dreams wholly, and will always provide proof of their invalidity. When you meddle with genes, you are not creating a new society; you are creating the appearance of a new society. When, before, segregation and prejudice occurred along racial or ethnic lines, in Gattaca, it is along genetic lines. Hawke's character states that prejudice has been made a science. Exactly: science has given into a false dream, and has decided to operate within that parameter. And within that context, it is not a matter of serving humanity, but of bending humanity to serve science's own dream. If that can only happen in a few cases, then prejudice in favour of those who come closest to the dream is legitimate.At its core, Gattaca looks back to the racialist science of 18th and 19th century Europe and America, which insisted on classifying human beings along racial lines, with the white man at the top, and everyone else progressively below him. Above all, we have the crimes of the Nazis as an example of how science can be bent to conform to fundamentally prejudice notions about humanity. The black doctor in Gattaca smiles when he reads that the couple wants a "fair-skinned" boy. As hard as the film tries to show us all the different races, given humanity's racist past and present, it is safe to assume that in a world such as Gattaca's, within a few generations, the majority of humanity would probably be white, and majority male.Vincent, Hawke's character, demolishes the entire scientific structure of his society by possessing a dream. Given that Gattaca's society is based on a scientific dream, the presence of another dream becomes a threat to its hegemony, and indeed, is essentially a "why". Why can't someone travel to space if they want to, and if they have the wits about them? Vincent displays a great deal of cunning and wit in making his way through life to achieve his goal; his success is as legitimate as anyone else's, and in fact, much more praiseworthy, because he ran against the odds. This should not make us think that he is weak: he is absolutely not weak. This is not an underdog winning the big fight. From his society's perspective, he is weak, but that's only because his society emphasizes the material and physical. But that's only part of being human; as human beings, we have our hopes and fears, dreams and loves and faiths. Those things are at least as powerful, and in significant ways, more so, than the material and the physical. That does not mean that the physical and the material are not important, but they are important in a different way. We need both to function as full human beings. Consider a painting: the artist needs to be aware of the physical environment that he or she is drawing, as well as of the physical apparatus he or she needs to draw with (the paints, the canvas, the brush, his or her own eyes and fingers). But the artist cannot free the physical object from its physical constraints and imbue it with something more unless he or she uses his or her imagination. Most of the people in Gattaca look at their world as it is, and accept it. Vincent (the name means 'victor' or 'conqueror') triumphs because he combines the world he sees around him with the world of his imagination, and in doing so, brings about the creation of a new world, namely, one in which someone like him can travel to space. Jerome is lifted up by Vincent's dream because it realizes his dream as well, namely, that of reaching his potential. In a significant way, Jerome becomes fully Jerome through Vincent, because their dreams are made to become the same. Irene (Thurman's character) is also lifted up by Vincent, because in him, she has an example of someone who, like her, is weak, but who has triumphed in spite of the limitations imposed upon him. And on a broader level, we are all lifted up by his dream, because in making his dream real, he makes real that which we all aspire to: the actualization of our dreams and the triumph of our hopes over despair.This is one of the best science-fiction films I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Are you paranoid about the future with "designer babies" or genes which predispose one with "defects"? What happens when everyone is expected to genetically engineer their offspring? What if you don't?? How do you think you'd end up competing against someone who was genetically engineered to be stronger, smarter, better-looking and more talented than you are? Could you rise above it, or would you be among the outcasts? This movie really makes you think about the future of our world if designer babies become the norm. Very good acting. Very good plot. The direction is impeccable. An enjoyable watch and a "makes you really think" movie. You gotta see it; and, once you do, you'll wonder why you haven't seen it before, and how much does it cost to get a copy???</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My all time favourite film. When I first saw it on the large screen I was stunned, I couldn't believe a film could be so perfect. I've watched my DVD copy many many times and my opinion has not changed. The music is beautifully appropriate and understated and the acting is controlled and well paced. The retro style sits comfortably alongside the futuristic framework and the main theme of genetic selection, manipulation and discrimination has become increasingly visible in our daily lives over the decade that this film has been with us. Relationships - parental, fraternal, platonic and erotic are beautifully directed and the conclusion, the vindication, the justice is so powerful, so right. Moving, uplifting; simply perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie reminded me of brave new world of Aldous Huxley.It is obvious that the race of pioneers(in the movie) is a genetically programmed superior race of human beings which corresponds to the category of A double plus humans of the novel. The point of the movie is that human spirit can overcome social and genetic engineering, it is an belief that comes near to the soul/body dichotomy and solves the problem by emphasizing the primacy of spirit over matter.It a neoplatonist and Christian solution of the problem although cloacked in the vestiges of secular humanism. The novel of Huxley makes a case for spontaneity as opposed to planning in the end, a point the movie also makes but one can not, drawing from individual social experience, no matter how restricted, but point out the powerlessness of the individual will when confronting established social structures, even more so in the future when they will be genetically controled and sanctioned.It is an Utopian movie no less beautiful for that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Rare Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andrew Niccol's talent is breathtaking. This is a film that easily achieves art status, something very rare in moviedom. I laugh when I hear certain movie theaters referred to as "art houses" just because they show foreign or indie films. Phooey...that genesis seldom guarantees an artistic film, just something different, and frequently different means boring and/or appealing to man's most base instincts. Regardless of the conceit many in the movie business have about their profession, thinking they are "artistes" creating art forms, movie making is essentially a craft. A movie is a composite product with many different ingredients and some writers, directors and actors craft more compelling or entertaining or spectacular compositions. Because it's a collaborative craft, we as an audience don't get to see the singular genius of one person, the way we can hear it in a Mozart symphony or see it in a Renoir painting. Only once in a blue moon is a movie produced that raises the bar for quality, ingenuity, a unique visual translation, deep human relevance, and a lofty ideal all the while presenting an intriguing story for the audience to chew on. When all of these elements come together, you have a film that can be called art and Gattaca is one of these. We see Niccol's spark of genius in all its glory because it's his story directed with his vision.The murder mystery and powerful political statements are what drive this beautifully scripted and well acted drama that keeps you glued to your seat. The sleek art direction and wonderful score are icing on the cake. That Niccol could write such a meaningful story about government control and artificial reality, mount it on the screen with such style despite its small budget, and then keep us in suspense with a murder is an amazing feat. There is no gratuitous violence, sex or foul language; instead there is intelligence, substance and originality. It's a shame, really, that it was marketed as sci-fi because that created a vacuum that this movie didn't deserve. It no doubt disappointed the typical sci-fi fan and was ignored at the time of its release by those movie-goers not interested in what they assumed would be another space-blaster flick. I was one of the latter. It would have had a bigger buzz if its tagline was "Murder still happens in utopia" because that says it all - politically, socially, and genetically.As other reviewers have noted, this is a movie that begs for repeat viewings because it has a sly and elegant way of piercing your jaded consciousness with important messages. And it manages to keep your attention every step of the way. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most moving films of the last decade.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a profound conflict that runs throughout Gattaca -- superficiality versus true depth. The citizens of the film's dystopian society are beautiful on the outside, but in contrast to the aesthetic societal standards of today, beauty on the surface is not enough here. Humans have been genetically engineered to be perfect, right down to the very cells of which they are made. This adds an additional layer to the outside/inside conflict with which we are all faced in 2006; today, there is beauty on two levels: the bodily level and the spiritual level (i.e., "the person inside," as a simplified description). In Gattaca, these layers still exist, but the third is perhaps most important -- beauty on a cellular level.Vincent Freeman, played by Ethan Hawke in a nuanced and moving performance, is a testament to the fallibility of genetic engineering. At birth, he was never given a chance, his parents having been told with 99% certainty that he would develop a heart condition and die by age 30. He has always dreamed of leaving the world that is so prejudiced against the naturally born, the flawed, and finding his place in the infinite realm of space. However, the hotshot scientists at Gattaca -- the preeminent aerospace institute of the era -- let him in only to be a common janitor. Why invest in someone so certain to fail?Vincent is not content to watch, day after day, as manned rockets are sent into space to do the research and exploration for which he so desperately craves. He knows that despite what geneticists and doctors have said, he is "as good as all, better than most." With the help of a shady underground businessman (Shalhoub), Vincent takes on a new identity: Jerome Morrow. The real Jerome (Law) had been a world-class swimmer before an accident left him paralyzed, confined to a wheelchair. Vincent changes his hair, gets colored corrective lenses, and follows an austere daily regimen to eliminate traces of his own "in-valid" DNA, to be replaced by conspicuously placed samples from the genetically flawless Jerome. When the narrative picks up, Vincent, posing as Jerome, has a prominent place at Gattaca and is one week away from taking a year-long voyage to Titan, one of Saturn's moons. With the murder of a director at Gattaca, however, his secret identity is thrown in jeopardy; crime scene investigators are determined to find the culprit, and a rogue eyelash leads them to the in- valid Vincent Freeman, whom nobody connects to the Jerome Morrow they know and respect.From this premise, which is created subtly and smoothly by Niccol, Gattaca truly takes off. Thurman's performance as Vincent's love interest, Irene, is pitch-perfect; she plays the character with a coolly detached elegance appropriate for the futuristic dystopia while maintaining a sympathetic air of humanity. The relationship between Hawke's and Thurman's characters feels genuine (as it should, considering the actors' subsequent marriage), and that between Vincent and his cellularly perfect brother Anton (Dean) is complex but easily understood on a basic, universal level. Many moments between the brothers are among the most poignant captured on film, especially in the science fiction genre (of which I am not normally a huge fan, but this movie is just remarkable).I have watched this film several times and have yet to tire of it. Though many pictures have been able to pull off sleek, futuristic looks, few of these have anything below the surface. Gattaca does, and it packs an emotional punch. There is a remarkably small number of movies that feel nearly perfect to me; Gattaca is one of them. I would not change a single thing about it even if I could. The characters are fully developed, the plot is intriguing and compelling, the cinematography and sets are beautiful. What is truly amazing about Gattaca, however, is its ability to develop and show its viewers something absolutely vital: what it means to be human.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of my favourite films of all time!! The film is addictive from the acting, cinema-photography to the haunting music of Michel Niman. The whole film is in gold... you'll see what mean.It starts with Vincent growing up having to battle his way through life as a god child (a normal birth) and to be second to his genetically enhanced brother who has no problems breezing through life.Vincent always drawn to the planets and as he left home without telling his family, he pursued his dream by becoming a borrowed ladder in Gattaca the elite of the genetically enhanced society, with the help of Jerome Morrow's(Jude Law)enhanced DNA. Because of his passion he becomes the cream of the crop. There is a murder in Gattaca and it is fixed on Vincents eyelash (you'll have watch the film to understand this).Basically it's about a film where anything is possible. But when this film finishes you will feel empty as you want to know what happens next.But as a narrow down the story line is excellent the performances from Ethan Hawke, Jude law and Uma Thurman compliment this film.An awesome atmospheric wonder... a cult classic..go watch Lee</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would like to say first of all that i have never commented on a film before, however after just seeing this for the first time i felt compelled to do so. In my eyes this is one of the best films i have seen in many years, I just can't believe how little i had heard about it. This is a top class film which mixes in many genres and avoids becoming too complex as it retains a clear narrative structure throughout. Having seen Niccol's Lord of War last year i wasn't expecting a film with as much substance as Gattaca. Niccols addresses important issues that are still relevant in 2006; Technology vs. Nature as scientists manipulate genetics to create a more exceptional human being etc. Strong performances all round enhanced the overall experience of this film, but the aspect of the movie that really stuck with me was the sheer brilliance of the visuals. Approaching a ten years anniversary and not a hint of questionable CGI in sight. Gattaca displays the future in such a beautiful way without exaggerating the stereotypes of science fiction landscapes. As a result of this it is far easier to involve yourself in a world that actually doesn't seem so displaced from our own. Without a doubt the finest directorial debut i have ever seen!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thought provoking and visually delightful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this film about three times now and have also just recently purchased the DVD. It is a film for the thinkers out there and combined with the cinematography provides for a delightful experience. The settings, backdrops and architecture are visually stunning and provides the film with its artistic aspect. The dialogue is purposeful, well constructed and avoids cliché. Additonally, the acting is applaudable, in particular the performances from Ethan Hawke and Jude Law. The whole film falls together well from beginning to end almost with some sense of symmetry.I think that it is often the underrated and lesser known films that are the best, and this falls in that category. I enjoy films that are thought provoking, artistic and different and this film clearly fits the bill. Whilst it is classed as a science fiction thriller, I think it is more a science fiction drama with suspense. Often one associates thriller with a large amount of action, and this film is far from an action flick. It centres more around the dialogue and themes. For those into highly suspenseful, action packed movies the pace of this film may seem a bit slow. However action is not what this movie is about.This film is highly recommended and well worth seeing just for the experience. The DVD also contains some cool extras such as scenes cut from the original (which are interesting), a trailer and mini-documentary (which is like an extended trailer with snippets of actor's comments).Another good film that has some similarities is the often misunderstood "A.I.". That film is highly thought provoking, artistic and full of great visuals. Whilst Gattaca's themes are clearer, A.I.'s are more subtle, perhaps deeper and more complex. But that is fine, the films have different stories and purposes and both achieve their aims well. I rate Gattaca a good 8.5 and one well worth adding to your DVD collection.</fullReview>

I will not go into spoilers, but this is really one of the most intelligent films I have ever seen. It makes you think. There are different classes of good films. There are films which give you great laughs. There are films which give you a good time. And there are films which haunt your minds. I prefer the third class of good films. Gattaca is definitely one of them, even one of the best of them. Personally, I just can't understand, why or how anyone cannot like this film. Yes, it is slow and yes, there is almost no excitement. But this film isn't about fast pacing or excitement. I would be disappointed, if it was fast paced or exciting. This film is not meant to be that way. And anyone who defines a good film=exciting and fast pacing has no taste at all. Good films are defined through their stories, their ideas, their images and their acting.

		<fullReview>I have the DVD, both Wide and Partial screen versions on flip sides, with Dolby 5.1 sound. Very nice picture and sound.Set some time in the future, where the accepted way of procreation is via embryo selection, including splicing in desirable traits. Children born this way are "valids", those who are old-fashioned love children are "invalids." Vincent (Ethan Hawke) is an invalid with great ambition, even though his genetic code predicts a good chance he will die young. He wants to become a space explorer but no one will give him a chance, given his shortcomings. The movie is what he tries to do about this. Superb Sci-Fi concept, and executed with minimal special effects.SPOILERS. A janitor, Vincent finds an underground business "renting" identities. Jerome Morrow (Jude Law) has superb genetic fiber, was a world-class swimmer, but lost use of his legs, and now confined to a wheelchair. Jerome moves in with Vincent, whose legs are lengthened 2 inches surgically, he gets colored contacts, and artificial fingerprints with a drop of Jerome's blood for the ID entry to his new job at Gattaca, the space travel contractor. He straps on a bag of Jerome's urine for random testing. The modern hand-held machines carried by officers can identify someone from any source of DNA, even a fingernail or a hair.Uma Thurman as Irene Cassini, fellow Gattaca employee suspects Vincent/Jerome but his cleanliness routine, plus selective depositing of the real Jerome's debris, keeps her in the dark. They eventually develop a relationship. Vincent comes close to being discovered several times, as police investigate a murder in the workplace. Each time Vincent prevails, and boards the space mission, a year to Saturn's moon, with a launch window that comes only every 70 years. Gore Vidal is Director Josef, who it turns how had killed the man who was threatening to cancel the mission.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very nicely done Sci-Fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gattaca is one of the purest and most well-done sci-fi movies I've seen in quite some time. In Gattaca, we are presented with a future in which one's genetic code determines one's place in society. Any genetic imperfection can lead to discrimination in jobs and society in general. It's an interesting concept and the movie explores it pretty thoroughly.The main character is Vincent (Ethan Hawke), whose flawed gene code is holding him back from pursuing his dream job as an astronaut. He is aided by Jude Law's character, who has not succeeded in life due to an accident despite his exquisite gene code. Hawke and Law both do great jobs, and the movie is further augmented by a strong supporting cast, including Uma Thurman and Tony Shalhoub. The plot is occasionally predictable, but overall engrossing and believable.What's nice about Gattaca is the consistent attention to detail. Consequently, there are no gaping plot holes or unanswered questions. You can tell that writer/director Andrew Niccol really thought things out when he made the movie. Furthermore Gattaca remains true to its ideas and themes by never degenerating into mindless action or cheesy romance (yes, there is romance and a bit of action but it's certainly not excessive or distracting). All in all, it's a great watch for people interested in genetics as well as people interested in prejudice in society. I give it an IMDb 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant film, with a highly relevant theme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not going to describe the plot here. Others have done so already. I wanted to point something about the characters that not all may have noticed. The meanings of the names, that the writer/director has given the characters, perfectly describe their role in the plot:'Vincent' means Conqueror. 'Anton' means Worthy of praise. 'Eugene' means Wellborn, born lucky. 'Irene' means PeaceAlso (I think this has been noted already), the title GATTACA is solely made up of A,C,G and T, like the human genome is. When the credits in the beginning of the film are shown, the A,C,G and T of each name appear first, after which the rest of the name 'fades in'. In other words, within the first minute the emphasis on genetics shines through to those that pay close attention.The only things in this film that I felt were a little too dramatic were the swimming contests between Vincent and Anton. Although they did serve a purpose in showing Vincent early on, that he could beat the odds regardless of what he was always made to believe. Nonetheless, I think this film is a masterpiece because of its intelligent and nuanced script. For instance, the method of recruitment by means of genetic analysis is not legal in the near future that GATTACA depicts, but that doesn't mean it isn't used by employers. There is no formal distinction between the upper and lower class, but there is a practical one. The writer didn't take the whole concept and implementation of genetic discrimination too far, he didn't make things outrageous. And that's where the strength lies. To those who read this and think to themselves "yeah whatever, these things could never happen in the real world" I would like to point out that things awfully similar to these did happen in Nazi Germany some 60-65 years ago, be it with less sophisticated technology. Placing the story in a near future allows people to view the film without direct reference to their personal experiences. Combined with the perfect musical score this film makes an impression that lasts. The scary part is when you realize just how relevant the film is.</fullReview>

I don't think the movie is wholly inaccessible to older moviegoers, but the concepts at work - especially those focusing on biotechnology and the human chromosome - simply seem too foreign to people who grew up before their rise to prominence. The subtlety of Gattaca, from the title (consisting only of the letters which represent the codons of DNA, GATC) to the brilliance of capturing a not-so-distant future without resorting to being a pure "sci fi" movie escaped me the first time I watched it. However, looking back, 10 years later, Gattaca can be considered among the greatest movies of the last 20 years. It would be tragic for us to not remember it as one of the great, forward-looking movies of its time; I believe it deals well with a new theme in film-making that few movies have been able to capture without seeming campy and over the top (Jurassic Park) or being too boring to mention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>for heart - the sky is not the limit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the movie on a channel I hadn't even heard of it before and didn't know what to expect. But I loved it from the moment it begun. The things I love about this movie is the way Vincent(the lead character played amazingly by Ethan Hunt) risks everything to do what he truly feels in his heart and no one else believed it was possible. The conflicts Vincent has with his superior genetically born brother, his relationship with Irene (played by Uma Thurman looking really beautiful, and his talks with Gerome (Jude Law) are worth watching. The scenes that I love most in this film is the one in which Vincent and Irene look at sunrise by its reflection on a million solar panels as if you are watching an ocean of light. The emotions is this film are overwhelming and I still feel the same way whenever I see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Out of this world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gattaca" is an uncommonly intelligent, thoughtful and interesting science fiction movie.It raises many questions about its topic, genetic engineering, and is perfect for a time where you read daily about the latest crossbreed between tomatoes and daffodils, the latest cloned cat, eat genetically grown food every day and can conceive your children in a test tube.This should be recommended for showing in high school freshman biology class.The story takes place in "the not so distant future" where parents are able to duplicate a process that only nature and two cells of 23 pairs of chromosomes each could do previously, selection of traits.In biology class they taught us a new human cell has 46 groups of genetic material out of a possible 172 from both parents.What a universe of combinations.The parents in this movie are able to engineer children to become as genetically perfect as their eggs and sperm allow.The plot involves a man created in the old fashioned way who wants desperately to go into space.For someone made naturally,he doesn't have such bad genes at all but in his world, would be passed over for a thousand healthier, even more intelligent people.He takes the identity of a man with perfect DNA and applies for work at a space station as him.There is a murder at the space station before a scheduled launch, the police are called in to investigate and the disguise is in danger of being revealed.This does seem a little bit creaky.Questions arise: In an advanced world like this, they still haven't found a cure for paralysis? Asronauts still aren't obsolete by this time? We know perfectly well already that there is nothing on the moons of Saturn and they don't? They are still sending launches over there? Other than that, this is a very good movie.Jude Law is a standout here and so is Uma Thurman is lovely as the love interest.Already it is possible to grow embryos and select the best ones to be implanted-that's how diseases like Down Syndrome are prevented.If this kind of technology were accessible to everyone how many would take advantage of it? How many people want their children to be smart, pretty, healthy, successful, wealthy,tall and strong?A star studded Hollywood movie with brains is a big rarity.I kept waiting for it but there is not one single chase scene, not a single explosion, no moment where The Girl Finds Out and is offended because The Guy Didn't Tell Her and walks out before The Big Crisis brings them together, no Big Speech about the evils of discrimination and big climax involving a last minute boarding of the ship after the hero is detected and chased down the runway by cops.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will always remember this movie. I rented it a few weeks after my first son was born and it has changed the way I think forever. It shows how easy it is to abuse science and change the way we live our lives. Folks, this could happen in our lifetime! I heard that companies already use genetic research to check out some executives!The movie is also recommended for those who likes to see how and underdog ("genetically week person") comes through when nobody gives him a chance. it shows the power of will! I love the scene when the week sibling challenges his stronger brother one last time.Jude law and Uma Thurman is excellent and Ethan Hawke gave an Oscar worthy performance. I cannot believe how this movie is not ranked in the the top 100. I give this movie a rare 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One hallmark of a truly good movie is that it leads to other good works and such is true of "Gattaca". I have become an instant fan of not one, or two, but three of this movie's main actors. All have gone on from here to produce superb performances in better than most movies."Gattaca" combines what movie-buffs like me love most. An all-star, -- physically beautiful --, young cast, heroes, villains, brotherly love and rivalry, a struggle against government oppression and all set in a not-so-unlikely, not-so-distant disturbing future-world.Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman, two of the best actors of their generation (particularly Miss Thurman), give superior performances. The two main stars had an obvious chemistry both on and off the screen (They married and had a daughter). Although not a block-buster, the film has enjoyed a cult following and is a popular rental.This movie like all good science fiction relies on a good plot full of human drama that could just as well be set in present-time under slightly different circumstances. The backdrop, lighting and futuristic architecture and even the sound is spooky and eerie. I loved the formal dress everyone wore that more than anything else contributed to the future feel of the movie. The only distraction though is the presence of automobiles that look too much (but don't sound like) cars of this time.I found it impossible to ignore British actor Jude Law in this film -- particularly the second time I watched it. This movie was Mr. Law's first big break after doing numerous independent films as well as Broadway (for which he earned a Tony nomination). Mr. Law's character is pivotal to the storyline, and his eventual demise is a heartbreaking subplot to the main story. You may not at first recognize him, but you will recall his other subsequent roles in "A.I", Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, and "The Talented Mr. Ripley" in which he plays Matt Damon's love interest.More recently he has made "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" starring opposite Gwyneth Paltrow. That movie is next on my list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Genoism: a waste of human capital</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because "We now have discrimination down to a science, It was the moment that made everything else possible." Ultimately, Gattica is about the unconscionable waste that discrimination by whatever name takes on us as a society, as well as individually. Reference Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis' (1927). At the dawning of the Nazi menace, nay heralding it, Lang foresaw the subjugation of massive portions of society simply on the basis of prejudice: religion, politics, education, mental capacity, ethnicity, sexual-orientation, and other real yet, in the great scheme of things, meaningless distinctions. Eugenics was a failure for the Nazis and, ultimately, it fails to work for those in 'the not too distant future'. Gattica seeks ? and to an overwhelming measure succeeds ? to show us how devastating Prejudice is on the individual as well as the society. In the world that engenders Gattica, the structural marginalizing of vast segments of the population on the basis of genetic credentials dismisses the contributions of those deemed 'degenerate' out of hand and flattens the drive of those considered 'superior' ? it's all in the genes so I have no choice, it's all predetermined, preordained. It is not. And the amount of wasted time and resources expended in trying to conceal or repress human nature is revealed for the travesty it is ? how much Good could be achieved with all that wasted human capital? One shutters to think. And think is what Gattica asks you to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The look of Gattaca</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people seem put off by the look of this film. I think I was too, before I saw it. At first, I thought it had low production values. What I realized watching the film is that this is a retro future. This is what the future was supposed to look like from the 1950s. That's why it's set in buildings by Frank Loyd Wright. That's why everyone is so stiff and proper and dressed in suits. That's why everything is so neat and clean. In the workplace, all the desks are lined up in perfect rows, and everyone sits up straight in their chairs. Even in the rocket at the end, people are wearing suits and sitting up straight. This is the 1950s idea of perfect. It's also the 1950s idea of discrimination. Is there a black person anywhere in this film? I'm surprised so few people make the connection between the discrimination Vincent is fighting and racial discrimination. If there's a flaw to this movie it's that there's no action. This is Science Fiction Drama -- a very rare sub-genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gattaca is an excellent movie. At the beginning I didn't expect to see such a fantastic film on TVB pearl 930. This film has all the things that a good film should have. It's exciting, though provoking and surprisingly romantic. I really like the idea of the film. The things that determine one's success is hard working, insistence, and faith. More importantly, he should be determine and believes that he can succeed. Having inherent disadvantages does not indicate one's future. We should create our own future by our hands! Though Vincent has genetic imperfections, he never gives up. He does not want to be the person that everyone thinks he should be.In the story, no one support Vincent. Even his parents think that he should give up his dream and His brother wants to arrest him. Nonetheless, he never gives up. Although he uses an illegal way to achieve his goal, I think he did nothing wrong because he is using his own power to achieve his goal. All he did is just lie about his genes. He is supposed to be dead in 30, and cannot do vigorous exercises because of the deficiency of his body. He works hard to increase his body strength and finally pass the physical tests. He seizes every opportunity to succeed. It's not his fault but the society's. I really appreciate his spirit. 'There is no gene for the human spirit'. I really want to have the passion like him.Moreover, this movie is both exciting and romantic.This romance is developed between two unlucky people. Vincent and Irene both have inherent genes deficiencies as they are both born in a 'natural way'. At first, Irene does not know the secret of Vincent. She thinks she has fell in love with the most perfect guy in the world. Although there is a risk of being discovered, Vincent dares to tell Irene his secret. After knowing the secret, Irene doesn't give up Vincent but stand by his side and support him. I really think that this relationship is very romantic, especially under this tough background. In this competitive world, many people are wearing masks to hide themselves. It's very difficult to trust a person thoroughly. Honestly, I am really surprised by how exciting this movie is. This movie does not have exciting scene such as explosion, bloody scene of killing people or alien attacking the earth. The whole movie is very smooth. The pace is not fast but you will never feel bored. It gives me the feeling of excitement. When watching the movie, I was so eager to know whether Vincent can succeed as there are so many barriers to stop him. Furthermore, this film makes me think a lot. I imagine one day if people really have the ability to create a super baby who is intelligent and will never get sick. Is it good for human? I don't know. It is an interesting topic. Personally, I do not want it to happen. Life is interesting because it is unexpected. But one thing that I am sure is that discrimination must exist. In fact, discrimination always exists in the world. People judge a person by the color the one's skin, gender, sexuality, or even ages. I wonder. Are those things really reflect a person's quality? Of course not, that's why I hate discrimination. There is no double that we should not judge a book by it's cover but how many people can really do it?I highly recommend people to watch this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some may say that this movie had too much content for it's own good but I say it had every element that a good movie should have - rivalry, romance, deception, rebellion against an unfair system, etc. As far as I'm concerned the premise of the movie is about one thing and one thing only - and this was clearly stated in the best line of the film: "in this world we no longer judge each other by the color of our skin, we now have discrimination down to a science." The movie is about one man's struggle to prove a system wrong, and it is done in a very clever way. It's true that this film lacked the special effects that are a prerequisite for most sci-fi's, but on the other hand it had something that most of the other films lack: a strong story and an even stronger message. This film is definitely one of my favorites and I highly recommend it to all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Andrew Niccols, Gattaca is a thought provoking master peace of modern cinema. It tells the story of a not so distant future, an ideal world with out disease, famine, a world were genetic perfection is possible. A world were the people who are not born of this new way of genetic perfection are oppressed and are treated as if they worth less the nothing. Gattaca tells the story of Vincent, a man who chose to defy a system were the genetically superior rules, he goes far and beyond what was expected of him. He does this by assuming the identity of a member of the generic elite, so that he can have a career in space travel, all seems to be going well and Vincent dreams are just in his grasp, but a week before his mission, a murder marks Vincent as a suspect and his true identity could be revealed.Gattaca has some amazing cinematography, that helps create the fake plastic world were individuality is not possible and every one is a perfect clone, with a life premeditated before the second there born. Starring Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, Alan Arkin and Jude Law, with a compelling story Gattaca is a must see, it was one of the better science fiction movies of recent years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many people commented on this as a cheesy, overdone Science Fiction flick; I find this movie to be quite the opposite. The plot-action is satisfying, and the symbolism throughout the movie is substantially effective in adding to the cinematic experience. The minimalist aesthetics in the movie are appealing, and also add to the general ambiance. The intellectual aspect of the movie is significant. Added to this are the small surprises and emotional appeals, both being quite important in the impact of the movie. Although the love plot is weak, they're first attracted for seemingly little reason, it radically alters into a dynamic driving aspect for some parts of the movie, and allows us to see into the characters with excellent depth. This movie is written most excellently, with the cast doing an excellent job. This movie is superb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>GattacaThis film is in a small league of brainy Sci-fi films that include 2001 and Solaris to name my favorite examples. I admit I had no interest in the film until my wife convinced me it was good. Gattaca is a film which unlike the matrix uses Science Fiction to make a statement about a fictional future that is already happening.I saw a few reviews on here that pointed out the use of rockets, 50 styles cars as if to point out how `fake' Gattaca's future looks. Well I have to give the `duh' award to the viewers who feel the need to point this out. Unlike minority Report where spielberg assembled scientists to try and make it look like a possible future this is not the point of Gattaca.I don't think for one second Andrew Niccol believed he was making a film about future history. Every element of the story existed to express the filmmakers fears of a world where genetic engineering was taken to it's horrifying limits.The film is an amazing debut and yet I have not seen Niccol match it. He paced the story with a perfect timing. The casting was brilliant with excellent performances from Thurman, Ethan Hawke and as always Jude Law. I am glad the film also used minimum special effects it keep the focus where it was meant to be the characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DNA</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most interesting movies I've ever seen. Gattaca hasn't the characteristics of a Science Fiction movie. The only thing that could classify it to this genre is that it's talking about genetics. The lack of special effects and the gaps in plot are overtaken by director's ethical approach as far as genetics and the change of the genetic code are concerned. By showing the pros and cons of the DNA analysis and by referring to a not so far future, Gattaca informs the audience about the possible misuse of genetics. Unfortunately, the movie wasn't a box- office hit and most cinemagoers don't even know that it does exists!!!It is also great movie for semiotic analysis, especially the frames with the ladder in Jeromes house and of course the names: Freeman, Eugene, Irine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of my favorites.Sounds simple, but it is. This film is an ode to self achievement, friendship, earthly love as much as human world demise and hate. This film appeared to me like a poem or a fable. Not the funny kind, it seriously shows how a competition spirit can make the world go perfectly wrong and how sheer will can thumb one's nose at elitism.No gunfights, no gratuitous struggles. In this fictional world, the characters are incredibly human. The mix of the cars old designs and the space-ship sounds they do made me think about Huxley, obviously because of this 50's/60's vision of our future it gives. An incredible way to make this future so close to our modern world (even more now the human genome is mapped).I think this film can be seen on different aspects according to the mood of the spectator, and it's surprising how emotional it is to see the way the hero discovers some people helped him make his dream come true. Some mute sequences, glances exchanges that the camera underlines, tell more than any sentence. That's precisely what makes movies not to be compared to books.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Conflict between man and society's caste system and expectations.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie explores the possibilities of genetic manipulation and the effects it will have on the social structure of the future. The main characters are Vincent Anton Freeman (Ethan Hawke), Jerome Eugene Morrow (Jude Law), Irene Cassini (Uma Thurman), and Anton Freeman (Loren Dean).In the future, almost all newborns have been genetically manipulated to be smarter, stronger and healthier. This leaves all those people that were born without manipulation to become the lowest caste in society - having the most menial jobs and excluded from all important positions in life. Vincent was born naturally while his younger brother wasn't. Vincent begins to learn the prejudices of life from his younger brother Anton (Named after their father). Vincent desires to be an astronout working for the Gattaca Corporation but is excluded due to his genetic makeup, not by his abilities. Vincent must then steal another identity from a genectically superior man (Jerome Eugene Morrow - a JEM) to attain his goals and dreams. Jerome is genetically superior, but he is a biplegiac and confined to a wheelchair. Embarresed by his handicapp, Jerome agrees to lease his genetic byproducts (Hair, blood, and urine) to Vincent. Together they both strive to beat the system and put Vincent on a manned mission to Titan - one of Jupitor's moons. Apposing this action is Anton Freeman, Vincent's older brother who has become a police detective. Irene becomes Vincent's love interest even though she doesn't know Vincent's true identity. This movie is full of questions and extrapolates on the What If's - many scenes in the movie can be viewed from different prospectives and the answers are for you to decide. The movie also makes you think of all the possibilities in your own life and what can be done, no matter what the odds. The ending is great and heartwarming making the movie a complete success.Please note that the title of the movie is GATTACA, and the 4 type of cells that make up a DNA strand are G's, A's T's and C's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vincent (Ethan Hawke) is one of those who were conceived naturally and in this DNA-dominated futuristic world, he was born to be incompetent- with a congenital heart condition and is destined to die by the age of 30. He dreams of travelling in space, teaches himself and is transferred from one place to another to do manual work- and he ends up being a caretaker at Gattaca, the corporation associating with space travel, using the finest men and women, chosen according to their genes. Vincent assumes the identity of Jerome (Jude Law), a wheelchair-bound former swimmer (his disability is due to an 'accident'...actually, NOT an accident at all, as you shall see when you have seen the film), using samples of his hair, skin tissue, blood and urine to become one of the Gattaca people, plus Vincent's determination to undergo the intense training. Right before his assigned mission takes off, the director is murdered and Vincent has accidentally left his eyelash in the premises. Now the police have the evidence and they begin to search for the murderer. Vincent's safety is at stake.When Vincent finally reaches the outer space, he opens the letter which Jerome has left to him...as Vincent's dream becomes true, Jerome has gone to the opposite direction, the other path...with his silver medal and his broken heart caused by being 'the second best'...As I used the word before, the film is very futuristic. Discrimination now is about your genes, rather than your gender, race or religion. But Vincent makes it. He proves that he can get what he wants, as long as he refuses to give up. The movie is magnificently written and made, well acted by Ethan Hawke, Jude Law and Uma Thurman. Hawke is smashing at playing strong characters (eg 'Alive'), Law is very convincing as the depressed former athlete and Thurman as one of the Gattaca people whom Vincent meets and falls in love with, realising the somewhat stunning truth. This film is a moving journey of the human spirit, towards both direction- up there or down the road. Simply spectacular. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is Science Fiction!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gattaca illustrates the very fact why I like science fiction. The following are either explored or accepted as fact: . DNA sampling. retina scanning. abuse detection (but cohol and smoking are alright). genetic enginering. space travel (1 year round trip to Titan!). social acceptance of deviants (either physical (criple) or in their DNA) Gattaca takes these premises and explores some ramifications of it. It plunges you into a society where at any point your body may be examined (You are obliged to bleed, piss, or open your mouth (but not for free speech!)). Tests are infallible and when tested after birth (if natural) you are designated to a certain society level. This society also discriminates: if you are a DNA defunct you no longer have access to top jobs. Given the above, someone (who doesn't live up to the standard) tries to follow his dream and uses illicit means to do so. A nearly perfect DNA sample has broken his back and is restricted in a wheel-chair (Ah, a question here: society also dislikes invalids? Here the premise breaks down, his genes are still very valid. Even if a body breaks, cannot the genes propagate? In stead the genes are used to perpetrate a scam). So here we have a society striving for perfection and en individual trying to be good in that society. And then the plot thickens: there is a murder. Perfect society is not perfect! The rest of the film unravels as any detective story, although it tries to take a very high-brow and mono-chromatic approach at it. And, trust me, my-opics can cross a road (even at night) without glasses! And the surprise ending is: I will not spoil it, but for me the film should have ended sooner and left a far more sinister near-future. All in all this was a look into a what I would say is a fascist/totalitarian society. Absolute control and unless you don't live up to certain measurements, you are not allowed in. Recently the US has introduced bio-metrics to people entering their country. Watching Gattace made me think. (Read the above paragraph). I have to re-watch this to see how the color scheme works. Given the tension the protagonist and his accomplice are under, the lack of emotion is understandable. And given the intrusive society, this also extends to all the other characters. We all walk in the different societies we live in, but whatever society we live in, you cannot keep us down. I recommend this film for any one who is interested in seeing how society changes with science. Another film coming to mind is Soylent green. ***1/2 out ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must see for those who appreciate subtle movie making.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie, many of the people who I saw it with commented on the believability of the movie. They felt that Niccol made little or no effort to stick to the laws of physics when making the movie. I feel that if you walk out of this movie feeling this way, you have missed the whole point. Gattaca is not a science fiction movie, but rather a movie about today's society that uses a futuristic back drop to convey its ideas.So, if you expect to see Apollo 13 when renting this movie, you will be very disappointed, but if you are rather expecting a movie that makes an Orwellian statement and is set in the future, you will be pleased.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I neither rave (too cool) nor groan (no glaring errors), I enjoyed this movie for its understatement. I was expecting a Blade Runner-, Soylent Green-, 1984- or Brazil-style dystopia. It was a pleasant surprise that the In-Valids are neither condemned and hunted down, nor consigned to an Outland where they are poor but happy, just kept out of the good jobs and lifestyles - which didn't look like much fun. Outer space didn't seem like such a great deal either, except as a symbol.And I liked the glaring symbolism of the helical staircase, but would it be such a struggle for veteran paraplegic Jude Law to climb it by hand?The only real niggle, a cremator with an On-off switch INSIDE it?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a smart, savvy science fiction story. As a science teacher, I show this film to my top students as a kick-off to discussions on genetic ethics. Each time I see the movie, I find more great reasons to share it with my students.The science in this film is as good as Hollywood science gets. This is a possible future that could potentially be very close. Using modern genetic research, this film touches on possible abuse and misunderstanding of our genetic information. We even get a glimpse at a caste system based on the genetic haves and have-nots.I tell my students that each of us has the unique chance to see exactly what our own set of genes is capable of. As the tagline of the movie says, "There is no gene for the human spirit." We can be greater than the sum of our chromosomal parts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was exceptional. The plot, storyline and character development is excellent. It's relevancy to our reality runs deep(particularly what is to become). The artistic aspect of this movie is simply brilliant. While it tells the tale of Vincents journey of deception into the genetically elite, the abstract insinuates everyone knows his ploy while also reflecting OUR genuine reality. The world has been contoured, so to speak, by the genetically purified and elite. This group of so called, superior bred humans, are actually cursed by knowing their exact limitations which is the movies abstract underlying tone. Vincent shows us that though knowing for certain you are above the normal expectations of the normal, having no true measure of limitations is what truly makes you superior. Instead of going into detail about this movies plot and storyline, I choose to get to the core of the story. Everyone knows/suspects what Vincent is doing and are not only amazed, impressed and secretly envious of, they have a deep respect for him which is unsaid. Knowing you will reach certain limitations in everything you do would likely be quite unsettling and have an emotional consequence most of us would never want to know. This is unsaid through the film but if you are sharp you catch on to it. On top of this there are scenes that just shove this in your face. When percentages say you WILL live this long, meet these projected abilities (exc), the same measuring system saying you MAY, leaves for an untold future. Uncertainty of the future leaves the recipients of this information with the power to overcome what may be. You make yourself in the word of Gattaca, as long as you are not the foretold and so called elite. This film is worth owning for countless reasons. Rarely do I find a film worthy of comparison to music such as (god forbid) Stairway to Heaven or Hotel California. I will watch this movie from time to time for the rest of my life. It's ashame it didn't receive countless awards or even better yet a sequel. SEE THIS FILM!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... before technology starts to dehumanize us - hasn't it started already ?This movie is for those of us that still believe that movies is about story-telling more than anything else. Believable characters (not those that can leap tall buildings) and situations that have/can/could actually occur.Gattaca is more interested in the latter (thus science-fiction) but for those that follow developments in that field - it sends a chilling/haunting message : if technology far out-paces sociology ... we are all looking at a chaotic future, one where - I for one - would not want to live in.This movie is thought-provoking, and challenging (for those that aren't too dazed with hollywood's constant barrage of flashing/strobing CGI effects (? la Matrix or Armageddon - where it is easier to train a oil rig operator to be an astronaut than vice-versa ... sure).The movie craftily blends personalities against desires, the drive to attain perfection vs the pitfalls of actually obtaining it through a genetic shortcut.There is sooo much in the movie - once has to see it to understand how much it contains.Having a child with a rated learning disability, I have attempted to memorize one line (*** possible spoiler for some, I doubt it without seeing the movie - but guidelines are guidelines ***).

		<fullReview>Every few days I listen to the news and hear some new breakthrough in genetics. Each time a shiver runs down my spine as I think back to Gattaca and how eerie it is to watch a piece of science fiction unfold in real life.Gattaca is on the surface a well acted, well crafted movie that did not take Hollywood by storm, perhaps due to the lack of sex and violence. Perhaps due to the lack of in your face special effects and explosions, perhaps because it is much more that it appears on the surface.Gattaca is a scary extrapolation of present day technology into the not too distant future. Space travel is merely a device in the story and I honestly believe we will see more of the world of Gattaca coming to life long before we are regularly commercially travelling into space.The fact that I still think about this movie years after having seen it and the fact that each time I hear a news story I recommend it to more people is testament to the thought that went into crafting the story. Modern in the extreme, yet somehow also disturbingly 50/60's in the use of some of its vocabulary and imagery, Gattaca is one that no science fiction fan, and no fan of great movies should pass up. Rent it, better yet buy it, because I can guarantee that you will watch it again, several more times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Science Fiction for all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In literature as well as cinema, science fiction is a genre that by and large has never held much allure for me. There are however some exceptions to this predisposition. "Gattaca" is one of them. It's thankfully free of the cliched earmarks often employed in a self aware, quasi parody fashion.In order for science fiction to work, one should become unaware of the genre and become engrossed in the action, which simply happens to take place in the future. This lends credibility to what is by definition, fantasy.Within the cold, austere and beautifully filmed sets, "Gattaca" possesses a core of emotion. The theme of striving towards achievement against adversity is one that will resonate with many. Ethan Hawke strikes the balance between confidence and vulnerability in an assured performance which must surely rate as one of his best. Uma Thurman's somewhat robotic statuesque presence and icy blonde veneer is used to great effect. The wheel chair bound Jude Law is, as ever a compelling actor to watch.As proven by his ingenious screenplay of "The Truman Show", writer and director Andrew Niccol possesses an exceptional creative talent. In "Gattaca" he gives expression to his vision with much assurance and flair.This is science fiction for all. </fullReview>

This movie is a fantastic study of what may happen if we decide to "choose" our children through genetic mapping.Only the good genetics get the good jobs. Natural births end up as janitors, and such.But one mans sheer desire to go to space, and challenge the system is what this flick is all about.Ethan Hawke's character was a natural birth child that didn't have the pre-requisite genetics to get a job in the space administratioon. So, he borrows someone elses genetics. Use of blood/urine/hair/skin cells, etc to fake an identity. All this comes to play just before he is supposed to take off on a space mission - and a coworker is murdered. The investigation throws in a few sparks.Great film.....</fullReview>

The monitor with fertilized embryos on it with a doctor telling parents which ones are male or female, diseased or "clean", and the ability to splice out the "imperfections" has already arrived in many a fertility lab across the country.I also appreciated the irony in the use of terminology in this film. Jerome was considered "VALID" even though he was an INVALID. Vincent was considered "IN-VALID" even though he possessed all the traits of someone who was VALID.I give Gattica an 8/10.

		<fullReview>In many ways, I was sceptical about this film. The plot whilst interesting does not seem a source of entertainment. The cast while adequate did nothing to draw you in and the director, Andrew Niccol's follow up film was the slightly flacid S1m0ne.So much so, I had to wait for the DVD to hit the sales before I took a chance.And I am so glad I did, the film isnt really about the consequences of genetic engineering or the drawbacks of humanity trying to reach perfection. The film is about just one thing, spirit.Paulo Coelho's book the alchemist claims that if you want something so much, the whole universe conspires to help you reach your goal. Whilst the plots of that novel and this film are poles apart, the attitude to life and the hope they entail are one and the same.In many ways I find it hard to understand how this movie is so overlooked. some of the shots, the ambience and the overall feel of the movie are amazing and would overwhelm directors with twice the experience of Niccol.A haunting masterpiece, I urge you to check this movie out.

		<shortDescription>The most beautiful movie I've ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a word, this movie is stunning. I think that is the word that best describes the plot (and the thought-provoking subjects it brings up), the acting, the direction, and the artistry of the film. The story of this film is, all at once, sad and uplifting, scientific and ethereal, logical and surreal, futuristic and realistic. And it effectively uses daunting themes from the current time to flesh out a future that is plausible, and maybe even likely. Though it seems cliche, it is difficult to discuss Gattaca without comparing it to Huxley's "Brave New World". Both are excellent, character-driven essays on the perils of messing with human genetics and creation. The art direction of Gattaca is gorgeous! The use of the camera is terrific. The choice of the Marin Civic Center, a Frank Lloyd Wright-designed building, as the Gattaca corporation's setting is the most appropriate use of an existing location ever in a film. They couldn't have come up with a more fitting look on a sound stage if they had all the space, time, and money in the world. Likewise, the use of the Avanti and Citroen cars (the Citroen turned into a convertible, and sound effects used to render both cars "electric"), and the costuming and hair were all used so creatively that they evoke a sense of the near future rather than the past that they actually come from. These elements also physically represent the beautiful, yet sterile, world in which the story takes place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning, there are some SPOILERS in here:If this movie could be seen as a contribution to the gene-typing debate, it would be a good one against it. Just look at how the guy gets into the fiercely competitive space academy - by a fake urine sample. No interview, no aptitude tests, no nothing. Still he outperforms the (equally) carefully selected candidates, proving that motivation beats a high IQ or a perfect body (healthwise, anyway ;-). I know, it's just a movie, but the not-so-distant future is to close to todays society to feel comfortable, with the insurance companies denying insurance to children that are deemed "high risk" and medical companies putting out gene-altered crops where they hold the patent. As for realism, I'd say it's quite good. I saw the movie with a friend that holds a doctorate in chemistry, and she wasn't to upset. There are a bit to many blood and urine samples in the movie to feel quite realistic, but it underlines a elite-thinking police state where those with "bad" genes are seen as the usual suspects. As for the 5-minute gene-typing going on in the Women's room to see if they have a genetically good catch, I found it hilarious.</fullReview>

Realising that his humaneness will get him very little in life, he tries to extend his boundaries by taking over the genetic make-up of someone who has an extremely good genetic make-up. The film takes on such issues as genetics and designer babies, whilst also uncovering the deeper emotional aspects of reaching potential and imperfections.

Yet I was sucked in visually throughout the film and if it came to my local rep theater I would certainly go see it on a larger screen. You know casting and acting are excellent when afterwards, you could not imagine anyone else playing the roles.As it being SCI-FI or not, its certainly on the border. Although the genetic engineering in the film is beyond what we can do now, you know its an all too believable extrapolation from the social mores of today. Genetic discrimination? You bet. There is all sorts of legal medical discrimination throughout our society-- just look at the insurance industry... There are already a battery of psych and drug tests done at job interview time, why not gene tests.I think this film should be included in anyone's cannon of important films-- both in its treatment of an issue we are just on the cusp of and simply as an extremely solid film artistically.</fullReview>

The most moving part was that of the physician surprise-testing Vincent (alias Jerome)'s blood for genetical identification, only seconds before his long awaited launch, discovering his true genetically unimproved identity and revealing that all the time he suspected such - and apparently supported the young man's struggle against the unfair (to say the least) system. Vincent meanwhile is so preoccupied with this discovery that he doesn't hear the man telling about his son who seams to be in the same position.The moment the viewer is sure that Irene is sympathetic with Vincent's fate is when she barely audible gasps: "so your a God's child?". And finally his brother, who is investigating a murder of which Vincent is wrongly suspected, comes to terms with Vincent when they test each others stamina (swimming) and Vincent's diamond hard will saves his brother life again, after which the brother understands Vincent deserves what he has fought for (and that the discriminating rules and laws are therefor void). I liked the story, the sympathetic way all characters (in the story's society) interact and the visual form in which the story was cast. There was a slight feeling of repetition caused by the otherwise well belonging and always very, very subtle background music. This sparse use of music was perhaps the biggest virtue of this picture.** end of spoiler ridden part **</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Gattaca" is an impressive film that uses the sci fi avenue of approach to illustrate a person's ability to step beyond the obstacles and barriers established by society's obsession for perfection and order. In this futuristic world of "reason" and "order", man has developed technological methods of enhanced genetic engineering that allows society to create human beings artificially. In this world, a person's intelligence, stamina, endurance, and life expectancy are all genetically programmed before birth. Society has established human beings that work and perform at levels dictated by their genetic code. Unfortunately, an individual's intelligence and wit are predetermined by their genetic caste; in this world society no longer discriminates based on race, gender, or ethnicity.At this pinnacle, we have the daring Vincent. Vincent is a member of society's lowest genetic caste: humans that have been naturally concieved by a mother and father. Throughout his life, Vincent is instructed by his parents and the world that he is only fit to perform custodial low class jobs. However, Vincent is throughly determined to become an astronaut for the dynamic Gattaca Corporation. Through years of self education, self improvement, and espionage, Vincent elaborately changes his entire identity and infiltrates Gattaca to become its most respected scientist.The plot spins us through different twists and turns as Vincent increasingly becomes targeted as the prime suspect in a murder investigation. On the passing of each day, he risks everything, including the preservation of his secret identity, to complete his mission: a manned rocket flight to Titan."Gattaca" is a brilliant film that truly shows the determination of the human spirit. Of course, we are also introduced to the insecurities posed by our own society; our fears and judgements that propell us to try to create destiny right down to the very gene. This is a great film that illustrates many questions about the limitations mankind places upon itself as it falls subject to the limitless avenues of science and discovery.</fullReview>

One man, Vincent, is born a natural birth. Despite the limitations society puts on Vincent he is still able to achieve something that no one else is able to achieve. When a person's potential is being measured before birth, Vincent proves that a human comes from the soul, not the DNA.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's true that the look of the film is mainly retro with only a little in the way of futuristic effects, but I think that adds to its charms, and many lauded sci-fi films have had distinctly retro looks (Brazil, for instance). And although the overt premise of the film is how an overwhelming reliance on genetic data might affect life, it's really much more about the character of the three protagonists, and how they cope with the varied ways in which life has dealt them each a bad hand.The acting of Hawke and Law is involving and I found myself deeply moved by their characters. The film is also helped by a haunting score.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gattaca an touching film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best movie I have ever seen. Recently I read some reviews saying the movie being related to Christian spiritual religion belief. Well I never saw the movie from the religion views and think that the movie be best viewed from the human spirits and pure living just like the theme- there is no gene for the human spirit.U remember Vincent's pain, despair, anger toward life but then most importantly his dream, determination and hope. His refusal to surrender to his fate was sad and true, his extreme approach and desire toward his dream was uplifing and inspiring. People had alway said that actually, success is 20% intelligence, 30% hard work and the rest 50% pure luck. I guess u can put that into Gattaca.It was nice to see both Vincent and Eugene made peace within themselves toward the end of the film. Maybe what matter most in life is happiness and peace within oneself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is perfect! Sure, the plot reminds basically the ones of many others (a weak boy must become someone else to make his dreams come true) but the story is still something very different from any other, very touching, especially in the end. And the way it's told: The details aren't being underlined like in so many other films, and they really don't even need to be highlighted.Best thing about the characters is that none of them is a real "bad guy", which usually seems to be essential in almost every movie. People - although they are stiff, uniform-dressed and faceless - are like real people with their hopes and dreams. Even the investigators are just doing their jobs, not trying to ruin Vincent's life.And we mustn't forget the use of colors and shapes - this movie is a real piece of art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen this movie several times and have shared it with several friends along the way. We've all found it fascinating and have enjoyed discussing it long afterwards.The concept of the film, can humans produce a better product than mother nature, has been done before (and in fact, weren't the Nazi's doing the same thing, more or less?), but it is very germane in today's world where cloning and genetic engineering are becoming ever more prevalent.The movie portrays this future as cold and impersonal (the colors are very cool), but the developing relationships are anything but. I highly recommend this film, particularly for people interested in the psychological impacts of genetic engineering. Sci fi fans used to the action of films like Star Wars or Star Trek might have a hard time adjusting to the pacing and meaty story line. And if you're not a sci fi fan, don't be scared off. This is not about space travel, cool ships and lots of gadgets. It's about people and relationships, trust, and self confidence. Give it a try!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gattaca places the human spirit over our mere genetic foundation. It is both inspiring as well as encouraging, while substantiating that will power, desire, and our deepest aspirations are indeed a matter of belief and fortitude, which is more significant and profound than some formulated measure of a persons worth.The fact that "Gattaca" only achieved average recognition is tantamount toward the conformist mentality that is conditioned to accept a notion that we are bound by some predisposition in life whether it be our genetics or some element called "fate".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>GATTACA is by far one of the best movies I have ever seen. The first time I saw it I was very depressed to think that this is what our future could look like. After watching it many times after that, I realized the movie is more than just a grimm depiction of the future. It shows us that it is possible to do whatever we truly want to do. All that it takes is willpower and the passion for it. If you have that, then anything is possible.Michael Nyman's score really helps drain every emotion out of the listener that is possible. He uses very simple melodies to draw out this emotion, rather than write bombastic, over dramatic scores that draw the attention away from the characters and the story. Everytime I listen to this score seperately, I always think of what is going on in the film and I am filled with the same emotion as when I watch it. The music becomes the different characters and situations in the film.If you ever get the chance, watch this film. Hopefully it will make you think about what you really want to do in life. And hopefully it will help give you the willpower to make it happen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Feels like it's based on Issac Asimov's Naked Sun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard of Gattaca, I thought, `Great, another friggin' mafia film - wonder if Joe Pesci is in this one too?' Then I saw the trailer on TV and thought, `Wow, someone finally made a sci-fi movie about the book of Revelation and the future of coding humankind - pretty cool!' Needless to say, I wasn't prepared for what Gattaca really was -- Brave New World, A River Runs Through It, 1984, Metroplis and The Waterdance all rolled into one Kafka-esque rollercoaster. Still, had I known the prophetic Gattaca was a `feel-good' story about overcoming one's handicaps, and living one's dreams, I might've shied away.Originally christened The Eighth Day, the story takes place in the future where genetic engineering has become the normal design of populating Earth, thus making natural `godchildren' outcasts. Test-tube babies rule, and `faith-birth' kids become segregated janitors and menial workers, regardless of their talents and/or intelligence. All diseases and defects are factored out immediately before conception. Like Brave New World, Gattaca presents an intellectual, but terrifying account of the future, conceiving a streamlined civilization where contemporary concepts of independence, racism, social class and virtue are challenged.The protagonist of the film is Vincent (Ethan Hawke), a man who challenges the system. Due to the fact that he was `born,' he naturally has bad eyesight, heart problems and a short life expectancy -- he's an ``In-Valid' by birth. Since Vincent does not accept his fate - he solicits an illegal DNA broker and makes a deal with a perfect, but paralyzed outlander named Jerome (Jude Law). As part of their deal, Jerome provides Vincent with blood samples, urine specimens and an identity, and Vincent, as ``Jerome,'' secures a job as a programmer, eventually working his way up to astronaut, thus fulfilling his life-long dream.But here's the catch - there's a brutal murder inside the department and the area is swept clean, with only the eyelash of an In-Valid found. So begins a devilish game of cat-and-mouse as Vincent evades a complicated series of computer checks, security investigations, check-points, drug-tests and interrogations. The science-fiction factor is absorbing, but like most American movie-goers, I've become accustomed to the superficial elucidation of Star Wars, Alien and Independence Day. In that respect, I find Gattaca to be highly untried - the most `action' onlookers get is Hawke punching a cop in the face! Still, it's not as dull as it sounds. Hawke solidifies an otherwise mediocre career with his performance (outdoing Reality Bites and Alive), but Uma doesn't have much of a character to work with - her ho-hum role could have easily been filled by your neighbor!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still my favorite Film, despite many Excellent Ones I've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a simple "sci-fi" flick. It's not about special effects or weird concepts of genetics in the future. It's about a man named Vincent who overcomes his supposed "fate" through sheer force of will, who will not accept anything less than the full attainment of his dream or death. There is a scene in the film where Vincent is swimming out into the ocean, competing in a game of chicken against his genetically "superior" brother, and winning, despite the fact that his genes say that he should be too weak to be alive at this point, let alone swim against his brother. The brother asks: "How are you doing this, Vincent? How have you done any of this?" and Vincent replies: "I never saved anything for the swim back." That's the movie right there in that one scene. That's the way a movie should be made. I've seen a lot of what are considered to be the greatest movies of all time, art house films, foreign films, and the best award winning films that Hollywood has to offer, and this is still the best. This is the only film that consistently makes me tear up at the end, with the possible exception of Schindler's list, and I'll let you know that I am an extremely stoic guy. I don't know, maybe this is the story of my life, symbolically, or maybe it's the story of how I intend for my life to be, but this movie is very special, and especially if you are a person who has had to overcome hardship, I recommend a close viewing of this film. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

Ethan Hawke is both inspiring and endearing as the 'Inva-lid' who conquers not only a prejudicial system but the determinism imposed upon him by nature. However, Alan Arkin betrays the absurdity of Hollywoods particular hierarchy by convincingly acting the pants off most of todays 'A - list'. The film owes some of of its aesthetic beauty to Frank Lloyd Wrights architecture - its a testament to his futuristic vision that a building designed and erected by him in the 1950s should be an appropriate setting for 'Gattaca' and a film not only shot in 1997 but depicting a future possibly a hundred years from now. This film gets better with repeated viewing so buy it on DVD - and dont let it sit on your shelf gathering dust (and eyelashes).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very watchable sci-fi film on the future of genetic engineering and its possible social ramifications. This story seems to get more relevant every day. The possibility of social prejudice of "perfect" humans as opposed to "natural" humans is well explored by the same guy who later wrote the script for THE TRUMAN SHOW. (It's certainly a big improvement over ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, and shows far more charm!!!)Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman make a good team (they married later on in real life as well); and Ethan handles the central protagonist with a good mix of energy and intellect. This is also the film that introduced me to the wonderful talent and cinematic presence of Jude Law.I suppose the big problem most people have with this movie is the slow pacing and the aire of self-importance associated with this story. Be that as it may, I think it dramatizes the issues very effectively, and is very thought-provoking. I hate to put it like this, but I think this is a film that should get made, even if it doesn't turn out to be commercially popular (he says, having vehemently supported some of the most extravagant "popcorn" movies ever, and being a complete sucker for tight-paced action scenes and LOL comedy!).</fullReview>

Both in the materialistic, be it the use of stones as primitive weapons or the development of nuclear weapons in our more recent history, and physical sense. Gattaca takes this idea to the next level; it paints an all too horrific picture of our future.Like many science fiction movies of their time I think the true majesty of Gattaca will be seen in generations to come.

		<fullReview>Gattaca is not only a good sci fi movie, but also a good movie. The story is set in the future, genetics have advanced, cars are fast and we can explore deep space in this movie. The thing that grounds this film in our reality is that it is about humans. The people inhabiting this world may be genetically perfect but even they have problems and dreams. Jerome (Jude Law) has dreams that have been dashed and si a deep character. The film follows the struggle of Jerome/Vincent (Ethan Hawke)who plays the role perfectly. The film concentrates more on the idea of Jerome/Vincent's struggle to attain his dream rather than showing us wonders of the future world. The idea of genetics and how identifying people by their dna hits close to home in an age when we have things like the human genome project. This film shows us how human spirit and sheer will to attain dreams are more important than our physical selves. This movie may be a sci fi movie but unlike other sci fi movies out there it does not stoop to the level of being a mind numbing action film or a piece of special effects eye candy. It is a film that is meant to be viewed more than once for the ideas it presents and for the beauty of its shots and sets. This is how the sci fi genre should be approached in film.</fullReview>

However, from the opening credits I was spellbound. Niccol's assured direction of both the camera and his actors give the film a confidence that is dissimilar to the arrogance that other films (not necessarily of the genre) have. The dialogue is minimal - compared to other sci-fi films I've seen, anyway - which lets the actors do their stuff not restricted by heavy dialogue heavy handed in 'science fiction jargon'. The leads, Ethan Hawke (understated), Jude Law (dignified) and Uma Thurman (beautiful and pensive) all give great performances that are among the best of any of their respective previous work. Slavomir Idziak's cinematography is beautifully muted and adds enormous atmosphere where atmosphere is a must. A great film worthy of any praise heaped upon it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gattaca is an oddity. It's a big studio sci-fi movie with little action and few special effects. It does have a suspense plot, of sorts, that sometimes seems a mere afterthought. Gattaca is very stylized, however, and puts forth some intelligent musings about class distinctions in the not-too-distant future. The society portrayed is one in which genetics are everything. Humanity is divided into two classes: the Valids and the Invalids. Valids are the chosen ones who have been genetically perfected via laboratory procedures and scientific know-how. These beautiful people get preferred treatment in housing, are given the jobs that count and, no doubt, would have little trouble securing a table at The Mesa Grill. The Invalids are the rest of humanity, the poor underclass with the usual human flaws. They're stuck with the lousy jobs, cramped apartments, childhood illnesses, bad eyesight and body fat. Our hero, Vincent (Ethan Hawke), a lowly Invalid, is not happy with his predestined future. He wants to be an astronaut, not a janitor. This rebel with a cause will resort to the extreme measures necessary to fulfill his dream. Houston, we've got a problem. First time writer/director Andrew Niccol makes an incredibly poised debut. Gattaca is refreshingly low-key and intellectually engrossing, certainly a rare bird in a noisy, no-think genre. The moody musical score is by Michael Nyman. Mr. Hawke may be a bit too much of a dreamboat to be an Invalid, but Uma Thurman and Jude Law are perfectly cast as superior specimens of the test-tube type. Alan Arkin adds some old-fashioned, sinister fun to it all as a nosy detective out to solve a murder. Take note: Gattaca may be the only time you will see Ernest Borgnine and Gore Vidal in the same movie.</fullReview>

The acting is good and the plot very intelligent and thoughtful. "Gattaca" and "Contact" are my favorite science fiction films of the 1990s.Who should see this film:-- sci-fi fans: a must-see-- action / thriller fans: good if you're attracted to theintellectual themes, or can enjoy the suspense even if stuffisn't constantly blowing up-- drama fans -- this one is safe, the science and actiondon't get in the way of the deep themes-- anyone else, if you're ever going to try a science fictionfilm, this would be a good oneI'll give "Gattaca" a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantabulous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A classy science-fiction film that doesn't rely on little green men, bland space rogues, constant explosions, or inane babble about warp drives.Gattaca has very stylish, trendy visuals which look sophisticated enough to be set in the future, yet close enough to our own time to look very real and authentic, with a comfortable moving plot that manages to focus on a good drama about an underdog/ugly duckling struggling in a hi-powered society.The sciencey bit is convincing enough to be accepted, and the film seems genuinely fresh and compelling. Easily as seminal as 2001:A Space Odyssey. Anyone who says that this film is bad simply wouldnt know a good story if it came and sat on their nose</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Important sci-fi film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pros: Sets, script, cinematography, acting, costumes, message.Cons: A bit unrealistic.Gattaca (name derived from letters that make up a DNA chain, guanine, adenine, thymine and cytosine) is an important film because it tells us what might happen in the future if we are not to careful. The scary thing is that it is beginning to come through as the Human Genome Project is complete. Ethan Hawke plays an "invalid" because he is concieved the natural way. He has a 99% chance of heart failure before the age of 35 and because of this he is discriminated. Through luck, He comes upon Jude Law who is concieved the accepted way and a perfect human if not for the fact that he is paralyzed. Hawkes assumes his identity to get into the Gattaca space facility. Unfortunately he has his younger brother, also concieved the acceptable way hot on his heels. Uma Thurman plays his love interest. Very important film because it addresses important social questions without going off in a rant (DOGMA and BULWORTH are guilty of this crime). It essentially shows triumph of the human spirit even though there are obstacles in our way. Required viewing for anyone with a genetic defect. Probably the best science fiction movie of the nineties.Premise: Hawke is investigated fo murder in the Gattaca space facility.Gattaca was nominated for a sole Academy award and Saturn award.Grade: 10/10 (Science fiction with heart).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intelligent and Thought Provoking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amazing. One of the most thought provoking and intelligent films made in the 1990s. Gattaca is one of the films that you can watch over and over, and still does not lose it's impact and meaning - it is as intellectually perfect as it is aesthetically pleasing.Like the "Truman Show" in the way it embeds thoughts and ideas into the mind - Gattaca, his first release as both screenplay writer and director shows Andrew Niccol to be someone to watch.The film is full of those touches that set it apart from others. The way that the cars are classic forties and fifties models, albeit, rechargable with electricity; the soft, warm camera and the thoughtful narration. As for the actors: Hawke (Vincent), Law (Jerome) and Thurman (Irene) were excellent and Berkeley (Dr Lamar) was a great touch in the script.A perfect film of the future, asking questions for today. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say I really love this movie. Mainly because it was refreshing to see a sci-fi movie that didn't have to have creatures from outer space or worse, people in costumes using words that didn't apply to this century or planet!!Gattaca didn't need to have a lot of special effects to get the whole story across. This too is a great turn in form from the sci-fi movies of today. All it needed was great actors to relay the great story line just like the classics.i can't really understand why IMDB would also sub-catagorize this film as a thriller? The only thing that i could see would "scare" people is that the truth of the matter is that were approaching the the technolgy that's depicted in the movie. So it really isn't a sc-fi in per say. It is a sci-"non" fiction.</fullReview>

The security standard is higher than today and you can almost go nowhere without giving your identity. But the film also shows that nothing is perfect. Somebody always finds a way to cheat the technology. These things are disturbing, because when this will happen you live like in a prison. You will almost have no freedom.

		<shortDescription>Understated and Elegant - Surprisingly Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me the grapevine works: when lots of people recommend a film, it generally means it's not going to be rubbish. However, nobody plugged Gattaca (it was on the bottom shelf at Blockbusters....)Hence it was a real surprise to discover this understated and undeniably elegant production. With a view of the future which couldn't be further from Gilliam's 'Brazil', Gattaca presents us with highly-stylized and restrained world in which architecture, design and even human behaviour have taken a clean, stripped-down and minimalist bent.The potential ramifications stemming from our current interest in genetic engineering are presented coherently and convincingly. Indeed, the total hopelessness and lack of self-determination witnessed by Ethan Hawke's character throws the problems of the world's underprivileged (whether physically or economically)into sharper focus.For a first attempt, this film is exceptionally good. There are a few small criticisms which could be made: the first part of the film regarding the two brothers' boyhoods is unnecessarily long and the context too vague. The clash in visual styles between this and the main part serves no real purpose. It would have been better to start off straight at Gattaca and use flashbacks. It would also been better have a bit more context in and around Gattaca, to emphasise its privileged status - a bit like the clash between the dirty chaotic streets in Blade Runner and the God-like perch of the Tyrel offices.But I don't want to be too harsh!If you can imagine a cross between Chariots of Fire, Brave New World and 2001 Space Odyssey - this is it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first came across this movie, I had no idea what it was. Didn't recall it being shown in the cinemas, didn't remember any promotion or commercial for it. To me, it was just one of those "quiet" movies. I watched it without any expectations. I think this is one of the hardest movies to review. The performances of Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman were impeccable. The story engaging and surprising. This movie is a gem, but not an obvious one. It makes you think and recognise so many trends in our society, that could make our world into the world of Gattaca. And that in itself is scary. "Gattaca" is a modern day fairy tale, it has a lesson that we should learn before it is too late.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film makes you think about the importance of nature. Men want to be God, but they do not understand the magic of a sum of genes coexisting with a soul. As the TAG line of the movie Gattaca says, `There is no gene for the human spirit." In the future, where genetic engineering can create perfect human beings, a boy has a dream: to travel in space. However, it is not possible, because he is genetically imperfect, an invalid, he is one of the last natural born ones, those who are a genuine fruit of love, because had no genetic alteration. People receive a rate according to their genetic profile, and the invalid ones only can get unappreciated jobs, being discriminated by the society. Is it a better humanity? Time has come to reflect on our future, to see whether genetic engineering is contributing to transform human beings into humanoids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great sci-fi that deals with imminent problems of genetic engineering, and how a human spirit deals with it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What better name to name this sci-fi than Gattaca? G,A,T,C, the four bases of our genome, is what made us human, and look what kind of world we will end up with when we tamper with science. Yes this may sound very frightening to some, but, even in a seemingly unhumane world run by the too-perfect people, there is still hope, for "the no gene codes for the spirit"I liked the opening line that said something like "we tamper with mother nature, but maybe, mother nature wants us to tamper with it". I guess rather than offering a pessimistic view of the near future, the movie actually makes me think that, even in if humanity lives by g.e. in the future, we would manage to cope with it. Not just because we are the all-too-great-humans but evolution itself would make us adapt to the changing environment. And on top of that, there's spirit, or consciousness, or whatever it is that makes us human beings.The acting by Jude Law (his deep eyes!) and Ethane Hawk was great, though it took me a while to figure out what's Uma Thurman doing in the film =).there's something i wanna say about Jerome's legs, if medical science is going to be so advanced, do you think a person's broken legs can't be cured? but that's only a little tripping stone cos the movie actually delivers the future is a rather realistic way, one that is easy to comprehend and thus makes u feel and think.The line that left me with the greatest impression: "the reason i win is because I don't save anything for the way back". so in our primitive age of g.e., shouldn't we just surge ahead in research instead of putting so many checks and thinking over every move? Anyhow, there would be no way back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a future where people are measured by their DNA, and where only the genetically-engineered are respected, one man born "the old-fashioned way" is determined to pursue his dream.Gattaca is intelligent science fiction. There are no spaceships or lasers. The sci fi is a plot device that allows writer/director Andrew Niccol to extrapolate real-world advances in genetics into social issues that we are only now beginning to foresee. The technology depicted is understated and simple, leaving the viewer to focus on the emotional struggles of the characters.Like The Shawshank Redemption, Gattaca is a study of inner strength and personal resolve. I agree with others who compare these films. This is a story of sheer will overcoming injustice.An excellent sleeper of a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my favorite movie that I have to show to my friends because, more often then not, they are completely unaware that it exists.It puts forth one of the most chilling visions of the future ever realized, one in which a single scale of dead skin can decide your fate. The cast is incredible (of especial note is Jude Law at his sarcastic best), and the production design is unreal. They managed to make the setting appear to be halfway Millennial and halfway of the 1950s. The juxtaposition of fifties "innocence" and twenty-first century paranoia becomes crucial to the film's message.I've tried very hard not to give anything away, but I will say this. If you weren't a little put off by the Human Genome Project last summer, watch this movie immediately. You *will* be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a practical sci-fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i watched this movie during English class at college recently, and was stunned. after all, i thought, i've seen some sci-fi that is practical.for years sci-fi that i saw, esp. in movies, have been mostly about aliens, transformations and world domination, and i got really bored out of it. now i see that there're more practical issues. think of it: we've never heard reports of a real Godzilla, but we're having numbers of test-tube babies right now. for that i love the opening words of GATTACA: the not-too-distant future. the film actually makes me shudder, as i'm a biology student myself, and knows pretty clearly where bio/genetic technology's can bring us to - a paradox out of our very own wisdom. that's what GATTACA wants to reveal.GATTACA itself reminds me of THE MATRIX and THE BICENTINENTIAL MAN. similar they are because we more or less have heard of their issues: genetics, virtual reality, robotics. but GATTACA is unique. it is NOT heroic (and i liked it). Vincent had much of courage but his Invalidity haunted him until the end; Jerome was a doomed character; Irene should have been developed further for she seemed only a babe (though i really liked her). but Ethen Hawke and Jude Law had been excellent, they had a sort of dark brilliance. Jude had an especially chilling expression. it felt like he was watching the Valid world which he no longer could enter from an Invalid's eyes. (he deserves his name on the top 50 beautiful people list)i was far more than impressed by the opening credits. it took me quite a while to figure out what the things that fell slowly on the ground were, but that was sure a very special effect. and Michael Nyman's music was as catching as ever. (think of THE PIANO) i was wondering why this movie was not shown in Singapore when it came out, maybe genetic engineering is too far-fetched for people? GATTACA deserves a place in the best sci-fi. what it's about is not a matter for biologists only. (imagine if one day we must all g.e. our children...)for those who are really, really not interested in practical sci-fi... watch it for Jude, i shall say.</fullReview>

A society much like our own but in which screening in the womb is taken to its logical conclusion. Not only are genetic disorders such as Down's Syndrome ruthlessly eliminated but anything considered undesirable by the parents.But science is never perfect and even amongst the genetically perfect there are imperfections. Thurman with her heart problem, Jude Law an Olympic silver medallist.A theme of the story is that knowing the truth can be limiting in itself. Thurman knows that genetically she has a heart problem so doesn't push herself physically, doesn't strive for greatness. But for Ethan Hawke knowing he is far less genetically perfect is a liberating experience to achieve things beyond the dreams of most people. Before his space flight he is already, genetically speaking, 10,000 heartbeats passed his sell-by-date.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superior, thought-provoking sci-fi thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!" Get it at Amazon.)Andrew Niccol, who wrote the screenplay for The Truman Show (1998), directs this superior sci-fi from his own script. The result is a well-plotted, character-driven science fiction thriller for intelligent viewers, a pleasing combination of worthiness not always associated with the genre. This is science fiction that will play with mainstream audiences as well as with afficionados. From Michael Nyman's beautiful and complementary musical score to the clever opening credits in which the letter codes, "g, a, t, c" (for the chemical bases of DNA--thus the movie's title) shimmer and glow in the names of those credited, everything in the movie is professionally done. There is little violence and virtually no sex. I would say this is a perfect flick for the kids except for the embedded "ads" for cigarettes and booze that mar some of the early scenes.Ethan Hawke stars as the genetically-challenged Vincent Freeman, an "In-Valid" conceived in the back seat of a Buick Riviera instead of through the fine art of the genetic engineers who now dominate society. His dream is to go into space, but his genes, in this meritocracy based on genetic endowment, fit him only for cleaning the bathrooms. Yet he has a monstrous drive to succeed, and when he strikes a deal with the genetically superior Jerome Morrow, a "valid" who is in a wheel chair with paralyzed legs, to use his identity, body fluids, hair samples and urine to fool the genetic screening devices of the Gattaca Aerospace Corporation, he is ready to fulfil his dream.Uma Thurman plays his love interest. Her statuesque beauty and her exotic features are perfect for the part of a futuristic babe in a retro fifties landscape of gray flanneled over achievers. (Actually they aren't gray in dress, but in their uniform adherence to the corporate mentality.) Jude Law as Jerome, the wheel-chair bound "Valid," is perhaps the star performer, bringing subtlety and a bitter, but somehow uplifting verisimilitude to the role. A puffed up Gore Vidal (who incidentally once wrote, "after forty the death watch") is Director Josef, and Alan Arkin is a street wise homicide investigator from another era.The interesting question asked by this movie is, could a caste system based on genetic endowment be our future? My vision of the future is that of a "brown society" in which everyone strives to be the same, but in which small subtle differences of appearance are increasingly appreciated. If every movie star looked like, say Jennifer Lopez, however beautiful she is, I would nonetheless find particular delight in a Penélope Cruz or an occasional Reese Witherspoon. This sort of pressure would keep some variety in the gene pool. I also think that a society in which the genetic endowment of its members is too widely separated can only lead to class hatreds resulting in violent conflict and ultimately genocide, most likely by fiat, so that the survivors will be genetically rather similar. Possibly humanoid types will be genetically engineered to do the baser work of society. These creatures may be thought of as organic robots, not as bonafide members of society, thereby raising another question, what is it to be human? A society greatly stratified in terms of wealth can exist, as the present society shows, but a society in which the difference between haves and the have-nots is too great is not stable and eventually leads to revolution (there being a limit to the number of people that can be put in prison). Furthermore, as this movie suggests, just which qualities of character, appearance and/or ability are the most valuable? And when such qualities become abundant, might we then have a need for other qualities now made scarce? Finally, as is asked of the notion of I.Q: "intelligence for what?" Is it more powerful in an evolutionary sense to be "intelligent" or to be healthy? Is it more adaptive to have a powerful drive to succeed, or a powerful urge to procreate? Tough questions that the very talented Andrew Niccol might consider when making his next movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching this movie again for biology class, I'm ashamed to have rated it a nine... an 11 is much more fitting :). It's beautifully shot, beautifully decorated, beautifully scripted and the acting is superb. Minimalism in motion pictures is a rare commodity these days, yet this movie lets the plot and the performances speak for themselves rather than throwing eye candy at the viewer. Jude Law and Ethan Hawke are superb in this movie, and Ethan Hawke shines as well, although his delivery seemed just a touch too boy-scout-ish. Oh well... that's a very small qualm with an exceptional film. The plot, centered around a horrific future of genetic segregation and oppression, is excellent. Overall, Gattaca is a beautiful, innovative and unique work of art, and after watching movies like this, one has to wonder how relative cinematic pieces of garbage like A Perfect Storm and Pearl Harbor can break box office records when movies such as this exist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is really thought-provoking. It's a believable portrait of what our future can be: a world where our DNA will be our own identity (isn't it yet?), where everything we do can be traced. It's also a wonderful story about diversity, friendship and dreams.The cast is well chosen, with Jude Law and Ethan Hawke well fit in their roles of "outsiders". Andrew Niccol is going to be one of my favorite writers/directors: Truman Show is a masterpiece of writing and Gattaca is both very well written and directed.I should have seen this in a theater.

		<fullReview>This little gem of a low-budget sci-fi, set almost entirely inside the wonderful Frank Lloyd Writer Civic Center in San Rafael, also still looking extremely futuristic and beautiful -- some fifty years or so later -- just gets better and better, as people realize where our current science is going.An attractive group of stars, Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, and Julian Sands -- plus a thoughtful script -- as opposed to a disaster-driven, non-stop actioner. Check it out. People are now being scanned at major events by computers -- the visual recognition technology remains crude at the moment, but digital sound used to be looked upon as inferior, too. Stores want to scan you too, for lots of reasons, and you can bet employers are thrilled with scanning and monitoring you in lots of new ways.As to digital sound, what happend was -- a few years passed, the sophistication of the digital equipment became a thousand or a million times greater -- and now we're starting to use this same techno-ability to do other things besides creating super-hi-fi sounds. Now we have the beginnings of high-def TV, increasing use of the same technology for cellular phones and lots of other things which were just pipe-dreams a few years ago.So it's easy to laugh off, but laugh now, laugh well while you can, because the time's just around the corner where this will be our reality.Just think what will happen five years from now with increased speeds, memory, and improved software -- we may have a situation much like that shown in Gattaca; a genetic's-obsessed society, enabled and enforced with extreme biotech sensors. It's another way of maintaining the power in the hands of the few, decreasing access to democracy and to judicial appeal, etc.We've already lost democracy, at least at the national level, so erosion of individual rights and privacy will simply accelerate. Dark visions of our future, such as "Gattaca," help brace us for the fight to regain our rights which lies ahead if we are to re-establish a humanitarian society.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie to visit, but I'll hate living there</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a movie, Gattaca works well: It's got a murder mystery, identity-switching suspense, a love interest, thematic unity about the value of humanity, tremendous but understated visual style. But the biggest thing about GATTACA is that it's science fiction only in the sense that Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea was before the atom was split and Hyman Rickover came along. The movie gained a flurry of attention among science-fiction enthusiasts and other "geeks" -- chiefly because it's an intelligent story. Science fiction can consist of more than ray guns, space ships, and foam-rubber prosthetic makeup -- at its heart, it's about ideas. The implications of science and technology and how people interact with it and because of it is the heart and soul of the genre, and GATTACA is a superior example.For better or worse, we'll probably see in our lifetimes most if not all of the implications and plot background elements this movie touches on. Rather than spoil the movie's impact by relating how it portrays them, I'll leave as an exercise to the reader to consider the long-range implications of being able to genetically design your offspring, if you've got the resources to do so, and what happens to more traditionally conceived children.This movie is worth seeing not once but twice -- first to enjoy as a conventional story (for the thematic reasons noted above) the second time to take in the fine performances by Jude Law and Ethan Hawke. I also liked Alan Arkin's supporting role as a homicide investigator and Gore Vidal as GATTACA's director; but then, I'd pay money to watch and listen to these two dramatically interpret the ditching instructions for a 737.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Science fiction with soul</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amidst the unimaginably abysmal science fiction that has come out over the past few years, Gattaca was a truly welcome relief. It's science fiction of the old school -- about science, about the consequences of it, the morality of it, the equity (or lack thereof) of it -- not Cowboys in Space. How refreshing: not an alien in sight.The best movies work on more than the level of plot. They also touch something underneath, carry a subtext. Gattaca's overt message, that people see what they expect to see and will overlook or ignore what doesn't "fit", is beautifully drawn through the scenes of Vincent's growing up and the pursuit of the murderer. Less dramatically but no less powerfully drawn is its subtext: that genes do not predict character or drive or ambition. In fact, the movie hints that the "valids", those who have been genetically engineered, come to expect their superior performance and do not feel as though any extra effort is required to excel.Uniformly solid performances by Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, and Jude Law. Also, the art direction was wonderful in that it sculpted a world as stylish as the valids themselves, but which housed flaws as corrupting as the heart conditions and other propensities to illness that couldn't quite be eradicated. Nice touch.The film was handsomely directed by a director who has learned to leave the camera alone and allow action to occur in front of it. (This is also a welcome relief from frenetic jump-cutting, cameras circling actors, and other attempts to make scenes visually interesting. Sometimes, as in this case, the acting, story, and sets are good enough in themselves.)If you want aliens, lasers, spaceships, and other artifacts of the genre as it appears today, forget this movie. You'll be bored. Go watch Stormship Troopers or Mission to Mars again.Otherwise, engage your brain as well as your heart when you sit down to watch this one. It's smart and moving.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant, unappreciated gem. Destined to be a scifi classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a world where at birth your life expectancy and probabilities for every genetic disposition out there can be estimated through 1 drop of your blood, it seems impossible for "in-valid" Vincent to achieve his burning ambition to be an astronaut. Being naturally born, as Vincent is, leaves you more susceptible to weaknesses, imperfections, and diseases. This is the basic conflict presented in the 1997 profound film Gattaca. Vincent's father tells him "Son, the only time you're going to see the inside of a space shuttle is if you're cleaning it." as Vincent is studying up in hope of becoming an astronaut and flying to Saturn. Throughout the film it seems that Vincent has no chance, but the burning ambition this dreamer has is stronger than anyone's "potential" alone (potential is heightened by genetical enhancement, the "valids" all have their genes "perfected"). Vincent may not have the potential that the "valids" have, but he has the dream. This film is so inspirational and is hauntingly beautiful. As we come closer and closer to mapping the entire human genome one must take this film's messages seriously, this may not be as fictitious as it seems. Back when the film was made, we were nowhere near where we are today with genetics. The film is absolutely brilliant and definitely ahead of its time. I won't give much more away, but see this film and share Vincent's dream. As Eugene tells him late in the film (this is one of my favorite quotes from the film), "I got the better end of the deal. I only lent you my body -- you lent me your dream."</fullReview>

This movie makes a person sit back and think and see if we really want Science to progress further and further for Genome sequencing, and Genetics in general.  This film was beautifully filmed with wonderful colors and settings. For taking place in the not so far future, the sets I believe where dead on. There was a sense of advancement, but at the same time rigid guidelines for society, workers, and buildings . Acting on all parts I thought was great. Jude Law and Ethan Hawke gave great performances. Uma Thurman was beautiful as ever and gave another strong performance. Little special effects which sets the movie apart from other Sci Fi movies. I can honestly say this ranks in my all time favorite Sci Fi films. The movie flows wonderful and doesn't seem to drag by at all. I highly recommend it to any Sci Fi fan.

This is the kind of film that Hollywood should be making: intelligent, smart, rich, etc. Everything about this movies is great. All the performances are top-notch; Ethan Hawke gives one of his best performances, while Jude Law makes an excellent debut (in his first American film). Michael Nyman's score is gorgeous, perfectly suiting the mood and atmosphere of the film. Andrew Niccol should be making more films! Everytime I watch this film, which is often, I catch more subtle depth and metaphors.Do yourself a favor and see this movie, that is, if you want an intelligent, enriching film, which isn't afraid to be subtle, beautiful and brilliant all at the same time.I can't say enough good things about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most beautiful and original films in history; possibly my all time favorite movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every now and then, I get bored of movies. I see so many in any given week that I forget exactly how wonderful they are. I love many movies, but there is only so much a man can take. It doesn't matter whether or not I like or love the movies I am watching; I will always get bored after a while. So, at the end of every week, I pop in a movie that I not only like, that I not only love, but a movie that is magical to my heart. Sometimes I need this reminder to show me why I love movies in the first place. Only a handful of movies are worthy of a place in my heart: The Shawshank Redemption, Leon, The Day the Earth Stood Still, Ronin, Predator, Rushmore, Three Kings, Pulp Fiction, and Gattaca. Not all of those movies are the greatest thing ever made. I still think the Godfather or Saving Private Ryan are tied for the best movie ever made. The above mentioned movies are films that appeal to me personally and have sentimental value.(Oh, I may have left out some movies in the previous list, so I will probably kill myself later for leaving them out.)Gattaca is a great movie for many reasons. But if I had to pick my favorite part of the movie, it would have to be the music. Music in cinema can add to a movie or destroy it; it is that fragile. It is there to surround the movie in warmth and atmosphere. Sometimes movies overuse music, making the music try to create the emotion that the movie can't provide by itself. This is a form of cheating. But Gattaca uses its music to add to the atmosphere. And what an atmosphere.Gattaca is a classic science fiction movie. There are two types of sci/fi: true science fiction and action science fiction. The difference is that true science fiction has an idea, surrounded in atmosphere that takes the audience to another world. Action science fiction is a movie with a very high budget, a famous action movie star (Stalone or Arnold), a nice gimmick-idea, no logic, and a lot of cool special effects. I like both kinds of sci/fi. But the former is the most rare. Therefore, Gattaca is a rare movie indeed.Let me talk about the technical stuff. The music? The music is some of the most beautiful tunes I have ever heard in a movie. Hey, Trevor Rabin! Try doing this and you may make it out of doing all of those Brockheimer movies.Cinematography and Production Design? Green is the color of the day in Gattaca, with yellow mixed within. The film is filled with future-esc ideas and gadgets, but it looks like something out of the 1950's. The cars they drive, the furniture, the glasses, everything looks like something from Leave it to Beaver, but with future-esc twists. Overall, it's brilliant and absolutely gorgeous.The story? How original is this! This movie is made to scare you using logic and reason. The movie takes place in a 1984-esc future that is not too unbelievable or far off from our own. Brilliant. (Note to the uneducated: by 1984-esc, I mean the book by George Orwell, not the year. you putz)The acting? Oh, this is stuff of dreams. We have Jude Law at his best, Ethan Hawke at his best, Gore Vidal who is great as usual, Elias Koteas in a strong silent type character and pulls it off flawlessly, the beautiful Uma Thurman, who really pulls off her character, again, without flaw, and many, many other people. Even Tony Shalhoub is good!The movie is beautiful in every sense of the word. It is written beautifully, shot beautifully, it's beautifully acted, directed, scored, yada yada, I could go one for paragraphs! It's a real shame this movie never got the attention it deserved.Andrew Niccol is a film genius. His film is filled with emotion, intelligence, beauty, and suspense. After all, what do you do when every cell you have can betray you?10/10(YEA, A TEN! YOU HEARD ME BUCHO!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly unnoticed, underrated and powerful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is wonderful. I make it a point to avoid most sci-fi movies just because I've never been a fan of most of the ones I've seen. However, I was amazed at how touched I was by this movie when I saw it in the theatre four years ago. It wasn't a "sci-fi" anymore than it was any other type of movie. It was everything rolled into one and it made the technical stuff a lot easier to handle when you added the romance between Hawke and Thurman (who I believe hooked up during this film, had a child and got married...?) But it took another viewing of this recently to cement my thoughts on this wonderful film.Anywho, the point is that this film is amazing and amazingly underrated, probably because it appeared to be a sci-fi in the previews, etc. The actors are what make the film. The chemistry between Hawke and Thurman's characters is fantastic (apparently they felt it too, hence the child). I particularly love the way Thurman handles her character's emotions and thoughts without saying a word. She completely nailed the persona of Irene-- just watch her expression when she appears at any time on the screen-- it's astounding.However, Jude Law is the main reason I added this comment. He is such an amazingly talented actor. This was the first time I had ever seen him in anything and he completely fascinated me. His character, Jerome Eugene *is* this man. Law becomes him. It is breathtaking to watch. The physical factor alone of playing a paraplegic and doing the scene where he climbs up the stairs alone is great, but by the end of the film, I was overwhelmed with emotion for this character. Law is incredible and I would say one of the most underrated actors in film today. Mr. Ripley definitely brought him more of the fame he deserves.One of the other most underrated actors in film today is Alan Arkin, who has been around for decades. He plays the lead detective in this film and he is one of my all-time favorites (the fact that I have a personal connection with him makes me somewhat biased though :) He does an amazing job in this film as well and I would recommend any movie he's involved in.Overall this film is incredible. It's *that* good. And it's extremely underrated so if you're reading this and you haven't already- GO SEE IT!</fullReview>

The plot is tense and gripping -- a combination of brotherly rivalry, ambition, romance, crime-story, dreams thwarted and realized, and all these different stories fit together well.

		<shortDescription>Intelligent, moving science-fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The one thing that sets Gattaca apart from almost any other science fiction film is the amount of humanity and emotion in it. There have been a lot of good sci-fi films, but the one thing that is rarely done in the genre is to take a personal story and set it in a futuristic world. Sure, looking at cool special effects and high-tech gadgets can be entertaining, but if you want intelligent, moving sci-fi, the check out Gattaca.Gattaca takes place in the near future, when genetic engineering has allowed parents to determine characteristics of their child before it born. The story is about a man named Vincent (Ethan Hawke) who was born the "old-fashioned" way, and his struggle to achieve his dream of flying into space. He uses the identity of a man with incredible genes, who happens to now be crippled (Jude Law). As the launch date nears, people come closer and closer to finding Vincent out, including his love interest Irene (Uma Thurman). The entire cast gives great performances, especially Hawke. He does a great job of conveying Vincent's determination, while also showing us his "softer" side.Andrew Niccol's directing was very good, especially considering it was his debut. His screenplay is also very imaginative, something that Niccol seems to be quite good at (he followed this with The Truman Show). I also liked the sets and the art in the movie. It had that sleek, modern look we expect from sci-fi, but also had kind of a 1950's look to it. Again, different than what you expect from sci-fi. There are no really flashy special effects, but the story doesn't need it. They would just take our attention away from the story, which is what's important here.This is one of my favorite films of all time. I've always liked sci-fi, but this is one of the few films in the genre that manages to be have a touching, personal story. It is about the struggle for freedom, even when there's discrimination down to the genetic level. And it is about following your dreams, no matter who tells you that you aren't good enough. Of course, these themes aren't entirely new, but Gattaca takes a fresh approach to them, and makes them very powerful. If you see the DVD, check out the deleted scene titled "Coda," it really drives these points home even harder.All in all, Gattaca is a great movie. Even if you don't normally like sci-fi, you will enjoy Vincent's moving story set against the futuristic background. See it!Rating: 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Set in a not too distant future, the story is that of Vincent, a naturally conceived man in a world where genetic engineering is the norm, and his efforts to achieve his ambition of space travel against the odds.Unusually for a modern science fiction film, it does not rely heavily on computer generated special effects. Its highly competent players, instead, tell a compelling human interest story.The picture painted is futuristic yet has a pronounced 1930s Orwellian appearance induced by the wardrobe more than anything. The sinister gene police in the movie could be compared to 1984's own thought police.I greatly enjoyed the film. That it was so capably produced, acted, directed and edited is self-evident in the final product. It asks important questions of those who would seek to tamper with our human makeup and sounds a warning to those legislators in whose power rests the ability to bring Vincent's world into being.It is a curious coincidence that, like the "valids" in the picture, I can find no fault in it.

		<fullReview>Most people would miss it, but the writer credits a classic Heinlein book "Starman Jones" in his scene with the Navigational Texts. The story is completely rewritten, with Genetics as opposed to trade guilds, but the story retains the same hard kernel while being completely new. I cannot say for sure it is the best adaptation of an old classic SF story to the modern screen, which amazingly was completely rewritten in the light of over fifty years of Science and history. I will guarantee it is in the top 10.The acting ranges from solid to good, though I suspect the reason the movie is a Rental Sleeper is because with no real big names and no Oscar level acting, it just wasn't a hit on the big screen. The appropriate, but still low-level, of well done special effects translates just as well to the small screen, and that seems to be where the movie is making it's mark.

		<fullReview>Gattaca is not for hard-core sci-fi fans. There are no alien monsters, no Darth Vaders. Instead it is a movie about us. The plot is set in the future to provide an extrapolation of the perceived present. The world of Gattaca is more soulless, more class polarised, less humane than our own. It casts a harsh light on today's social mores.Ethan Hawke and Jude Law are both superb in their roles. Their characters reflect the flaws in Gattaca's (and our) society - Jude, the gilded but gelded; and Ethan, the flawed but unflinching.The direction, musical score and cinematography all work to provide the brutal truth behind the polished surfaces of Gattaca.If you see Gattaca looking for Han Solo or Lt. Ripley you will be disappointed. See it instead for a new perspective on how to live your own life.Now read the tag line for this movie again.</fullReview>

One difference in Gattaca is that the film exists in a very plausible world, perhaps a world we will see in twenty, thirty, or forty years in the near future. Genetic manipulation of the unborn is the common practice, to eliminate illnesses, malfunctions, and give the children chosen to survive the best possible advantages in a world where people are judged not by their accomplishments, finances, or status, but upon their very genetic code. Women steal cells from dates in anything from saliva left from a kiss to a stray hair, and genetically sequence their potential suitors to find everything from heart rate to IQ to estimated time of death.In this world is born Vincent, an intelligent, sensitive young man with ambitions of working in the space program. Vincent is also a "God-child", a child born without genetic assistance with a heart condition and early death potential. Vincent's goal is entrance into Gattaca, an elite corps of space explorers that oddly looks more like a group of lawyers than astronauts. Gattaca is more than a film about one man's attempt to beat the system. It is also a story of two halves of a man becoming a whole, body and soul, and in the end what they share is something that fuels the fires within many of us; the search for the unknown. One of the most remarkable moments in the film is when the director of Gattaca is being questioned by a police investigator in a room where the employees of Gattaca are undergoing athletic tests on treadmills and other exercise equipment. The director mentions that now with modern genetic altering, he can expect perfect bodies with minds to match, and that his purpose in all of these tests, from the exercising to routine urine samples, is to make the employees of Gattaca meet their potential. "And if they exceed their potential?" "No one exceeds their potential," the director quickly retorts, "It merely means that we did not accurately judge their potential in the first place." Are we the sum of our parts? There are many important questions raised in Gattaca, and every person who ponders what a strange creature man is should treat themselves to this film, an extraordinary debut from director/writer Andrew Niccol.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderfully restrained insight into a bleak future</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just watched Gattaca for the umpteenth time and i really can't get enough of it. I've been a science fiction fan since I first saw the B movies of the 50's but this film is better than Silent Running, Dark Star et al.What makes it so good is that it draws you into world which at first seems ideal. Then inch by inch it exposes the darkness and by that time you are hooked.It is made all the more interesting because the things portrayedthis film are being discussed in reality and we have to decide whether we want a world like this.The acting is beautifully restrained especially from Ethan Hawke, Jude Law and Uma Thurman but there are no bad performances even down to great Ernest Borgnine as a cleaner.The sight of the men and women sitting aboard the spacecraft as it heads towards Titan, still in their pin-stiped suits as if their genetic superiority will even protect them from the vacuum of space is a fitting end to a great film10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An amazing film, everything is superbly done and rendered accordingly. For the people who have seen it, do you ever wonder where they got the name of the film. My theory is from the 4 DNA base names - Guanine, Adenine, Thymine, and Cytosine. Coincidence? I don't think so. This just occurred to me as I was reading through a biology textbook about DNA. Also another point, most of the outside scenes are in orange, what does that mean? Anyway I am too much in love with Uma Thurman (she's a goddess)go watch the film just for her!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gattaca is a vision of a dystopic future, where the genetically engineered are known as the "Valids" and are the social elite. Those who are born naturally are "In-Valid" and are considered second class citizens. It's a brand new phase of discrimination.A wonderful experience, Gattaca uses the most simple statements to portray the deep emotions embedded in it. From the melodious and gentle theme music, to the tone of conversation, to the orderly and clean environment, Gattaca strives to trim the unnecessary details and give the viewers the emotions and triumphs that the protagonist endures and encounters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is as good as Dark City and the Arrival. And like those two I just mentioned, it didn't get the credit it deserved. I only hope it becomes a science fiction classic. The movie begins in a futuristic Utopia where most people are genetically engineered. Ethan Hawke stars as Vincent Freeman; a man labeled "invalid" because he was born naturally. But trying to make his dreams come true, he takes the identity of Jerome Marrow; a genetically perfect human being who was crippled in an accident. And using his identity, Vincent becomes one of the elite at a place called Gattaca.The movie is rarely violent. Yet there's a lot of suspense. Some action. It never gets boring. Rarely gets ridiculous (if ever). And it has not one but two great twists at the end. It is a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gattaca is a great film. The plot is simple but engaging and all of the performances are first rate. Unlike its mega-budget sci-fi counterparts, the producers of Gattaca obviously spent more than twenty bucks on developing a decent script. FOR ONCE the viewer is treated to realistic, fleshed out characters who you can actually empathise with. Those responsible for such atrocities as Mission to Mars, Deep Impact etc should sit themselves down in front of Gattica and learn something about film making.Ethan Hawke is good in the lead role, but Jude Law is absolutely sensational. The supporting cast (including Uma Thurman) doesn't put a foot wrong and the result is a clever, thought-provoking film which holds your attention throughout. I cannot understand why this film has not received more praise than it has.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a strange one, a movie I like with a lack of set pieces and visual battles, that relies purely on plot and good acting. I think that's why I like this film so much, and could watch it again and again. There is no real centrepiece, it's just a constant stream of interesting ideas, personal struggles against a higher power, and powerful character acting.The overall premise about one man doomed to failure trying to succeed against all the odds against a big eugenic Government machine is familiar treading ground, and there have been a glut of books, TV shows and films about it in the past, but the way that this film relies purely on concentrating on the character's personal struggle, rather than seeing him murder half the Establishment and take over the world, is refreshing to see. The man has a simple aim and he sets out to achieve it using all means above and beyond his disposal.I really can't rattle on too much about how good the script is, and how good the acting is - it really does underpin this film, which would have been reasonably good based on plot alone. Basically, if you want a "thinky" for a couple of hours, you can do no worse than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gattaca was a brilliantly written film about the dangers of a strive for perfection in humans. Eugene had no desire or passion to live, even though he was most fit for life. Vincent, on the other hand, was an "invalid" who beat the odds predicted at birth and imprinted in every chromosome of his body. Both the "chicken swimming" and the crossing the road without contacts are parallels to Vincent's life. His life is full of risks and blind moves. The movie presents truths of life that few movies can do.</fullReview>

Like I said, it is a very fascinating idea, and not too far-fetched, really. Uma Thurman is perfect as the distant and restrained character she plays in this film.

		<fullReview>Gattaca is a brilliant film that really swept me off my feet.Niccol's vision is completely realistic in the light of recent achievements in the field of genetics. It is quite time the general public sat up to the realities of genetic engineering, the new power that we are discovering and could subsequently abuse. And having a beautifully crafted and thoughtfully scripted film about something other than city-chomping, genetically mutated monsters does help. Especially when it also deals with deep human themes and raises relevant questions about ethical issues and when it is loaded with fascinating symbolism and subtext enough to keep the reflective viewer occupied long after the final credits roll.Another thing about Gattaca that endeared it to me: the profound emotional impact it has, especially with the help of the excellent musical score. It wrung tears out of my eyes, and after the crying I found that the film had awakened dormant intellectual and artistic instincts within me. I had never before managed to appreciate the finer aspects of filmmaking. It led me on a meaningful journey of discovery and insight, and stirred by Gattaca, I asked myself questions I had never bothered about before.Now, as I mull over the richness of the film, I realise that Niccol has created a masterpiece, extraordinary and deserving of more attention than it got. (Which was an outrage, considering its depth. Or maybe it got way out of depth for some?)Before watching Gattaca I had the idea that movies basically served as amusement options on boring days, to be enjoyed for the brief 1 to 2 hours of their duration and later to be forgotten. Needless to say, after my first viewing of Gattaca, enough of my old conceptions were blown away to drive me to the video store again and again. Watch and be prepared to think, or you'll be missing the best part of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gattaca is a major triumph. Not so much science fiction as science eventuality. Everything scientific is at least theoretically possible, and most ideas are rock solid. As a scientist, the film fills me with dread. It is always the scientist who is blamed for perversions of science, whereas we all know that it is the money-makers who are among us, scientist or no, who are to blame. I think it is of utmost importance for suffering to be alleviated by genetic therapy - I had a friend who suffered and died from cystic fibrosis. However, considering genetic traits from short-sight to dwarfism as defects I believe is wrong. The remit of the film is that some traits are not in the genes - well, this has yet to be proven! However, I think that ultimate survival of our race depends on variety. To analogise very, very, simply (sorry!) imagine if we were infested with swarms of insects that killed everyone above, say 4 feet tall. It would only be the dwarves who survived. In the distopia of Gattaca, the human race would die out in this case, as all dwarves would have been executed before conception. The film is a warning, but alas, one which will not be heeded. I predict that such pre-conception genetic screening will be commonplace within the next 5-10 years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly my All-Time Favorite Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my second review of Gattaca since my first one was extremely short. Gattaca is probably the most underrated movie of all time. It's also very possibly my favorite, along with Dead Poets Society and The Shashank Redemption. The movie has absolutely no flaws whatsoever. Everything about the movie was so amazingly original. I was also blown away by the acting of it. I have tried to see every movie with Jude Law in it after seeing his exceptional performance in Gattaca. He is also such an unknown actor, but he's so talented (It's fantastic he's nominated for an Oscar for Talented Mr. Ripley). Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, and Alan Arkin also give such rich and excellent performances, too.The film is about Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke), who is born what now is the natural way, but in the future is uncommon. The natural way in the future is simply cloning a baby and letting the parents decide everything (gender, hair color, skin, personality) about the baby. Vincent has one simple goal: to go into space, but because he's not "valid" and has a 99% chance of heart failure at the age of 30, Vincent can only find work as jobs like janitors. But one day, he finally goes to extreme measures to surpass the standards for a place called Gattaca where people train to become astronauts. He illegally changes his identity and borrows the identity of a superior clone by the name of Jerome Morrow (Jude Law), who is incredibly strong, but gets into an accident and paralyzes his legs. Jerome gives Vincent samples of his body to help him pass for his fake identity (blood samples, urine pouches, hair samples). Vincent is getting away with his illegal crime until a mission director is brutally murdered and a detective (Alan Arkin) finds Vincent's eyelash in a corridor, and when they find out that it is the eyelash of an invalid, the detective gets closer and closer at finding Vincent's true identity.Gattaca is a brilliant and stunning drama that I am completely outraged that it is such an unknown and underrated movie. It has such a fantastic script, such powerful performances, and an amazing music score that it definitely deserves recognition as a film that proves that the bounderies of science fiction are limitless. Oh well, at least most of the critics enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good movie in one of the finest traditions in the science fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sorry for eventual errors in my english. I consider Gattaca a very good movie in one of the finest traditions in the science fiction. I am talking about the "distopian" (negative utopia) tradition which includes Orwell's 1984, Huxley, Fahrenheit 451 e Blade Runner, just to cite some great examples. The future painted in such masterpieces is always shady and in many ways sad. Andrew Niccol, who wrote The Truman Show, exhibits an admirable talent handing the direction and script. He is a good promise in my opinion, not yet fully perceived. About the movie: it is beautifully photographed, very well acted. The plot, focusing in a new form of discrimination: the genetically perfected "Valids" vs. the naturally born "In-Valids", is intelligent and opportune. I subscribe the movie's lemma: there is no gene for the human spirit. The movie proves that.</fullReview>

The writer didn't fake it by overlooking something that should have happened like in most other films.Gattaca was a completely under-rated movie. Easily the best movie of the year. I think the reason it was overlooked at the Oscars and by some critics is simply because they did not get it. It was so far and away better than most other films that it was ignored. It should have won an Oscar in about every category. Ethan Hawke was very believable and did an excellent job.

		<fullReview>Andrew Niccol truly has a flair for writing profound scripts that are ignored by the Academy Awards. Both this and his more recent film, The Truman Show, are packed with some very heavy themes and symbolism. And both movies are fascinating and full of emotion. This movie's premise happens to be one of my favorites- the flawed Utopian society. Much like Huxley's Brave New World and Orwell's 1984, this movie tackles the problems associated with technology taking over our lives completely. Vincent's (Ethan Hawke) struggle against the system in this movie shows that the human spirit can triumph over anything. The most moving parts of the movie I found to be the races with Vincent's brother Anton. Vincent's line at the end of their final race sums up Vincent's persona perfectly, describing his reason for his constant struggle against the odds. Strong supporting performances by Jude Law and Uma Thurman make this movie in my opinion an instant classic. Truly an underappreciated piece of cinema. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where to begin?That Gattaca was overlooked at the box office is a travesty, due in my opinion to inept marketing. This movie does so many things well, including: 1) providing an intriguing view of the near future, NOT just in terms of technology, but in terms of social mores and their effect on basic human interaction; 2) offering an absorbing murder mystery; 3) giving the viewer a love story, but not too much of one; 4) and perhaps best of all, delivering a big message in a subtle way, that the heart can still count more than the mind.Gattaca isn't the fastest-paced movie, and people looking for a space shoot out movie will be disappointed. Instead, Gattaca offers a well-thought-out allogory of one man who wants to achieve a goal and who must overcome not only his own real shortcomings but the discrimination of a society which honors perfection and nothing else.The performances of the actors are restrained, reflecting the tone of the film's society. Jude Law is magnificent as the man who was everything society honors but who didn't have enough heart and strength to live up to the expectations demanded of him. Law is finally getting the attention he deserves today, starring in The Talented Mr. Ripley. This is a thinking person's sci-fi movie. It is also a mystery. In the end, it is confirmation of a belief we all want to cling to as individuals while our society as a whole seems to be marching on in another direction.Take a look at Gattaca. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The human spirit is under assualt in the not so distant future in this stylish and very thoughtful science fiction drama. A first major effort by New Zealand writer/director Andrew Niccol, produced by a group including Danny DeVito, Gattaca is easily one of the best, although overlooked, films of 1997. Gattaca portrays a world where class and race barriers have finally broken down only to be replaced by a new order of genetic superiors and `de-GENE-erates'. The film centers around an inferior-born protagonist, expertly underplayed by Ethan Hawke, who enters into a complex pact with Jude Law, a seemingly perfect human who has everything and yet nothing having only achieved second place in a world that despises even the smallest imperfection. Ethan Hawke dreams of space travel, to leave behind a world where he has no place. The two men hitch their destinies together and, against all possible odds, both escape their worlds through a most unusual and loving partnership. Along they way there is murder, a love triangle with a stunningly futuristic Uma Thurman, sibling rivalry, and plenty of suspense.Gattaca also features small roles by Gore Vidal, Alan Arkin, Ernest Borgnine, and others. On all levels, this is a beautifully crafted film. The sets and locales are modern in the style of early Sixties' internationalism, the music compelling, the lighting and cinematography superb, and the screenplay first rate. Gattaca is an intelligent and sensitive tale of the human spirit triumphing over science.</fullReview>

In this sense it portraits a society divided in a "valid" upper class made of genetically manipulated people and an "in-valid" lower class in which work interviews are replaced by blood or urine tests and in which lovers can exchange hairs as a token of their love. The fact that an "in-valid" person such as Vincent is in fact more intelligent, stronger and even more sexually gifted than many "valids" may be an over-simplification, but it does not detract to the movie. Second, the movie's "decor" is quite unusual, being much more similar to Truffaut's "Fahrenheit 451" than, for example, "Blade Runner" or more recent, more spectacular movies. In brief, one of the best science fiction movies of the last decade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest sci-fies of the '90s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a fan of sci-fi movies. Not at all. I hated "Independence Day" and other similar films. However, "Gattaca" really surprised me by its intriguing story, and I think it is maybe the second best sci-fi of the '90s, just after "Contact".The story may look a little nonsense, but it is all metaphorical and symbolical. With a great screenplay, great direction and good acting, the story really works out and convinces the audience, at the same time being touching because of its dramatic side. So I think that it's difficult to understand why the film was not very successful.I highly recommend "Gattaca" if you liked "2001" and "Contact". In my opinion, it is a small classic that should have been nominated in the main categories for the Oscar.</fullReview>

The whole cinema was really enshrouded in a prevalent atmosphere of sadness while i was watching the movie. Loads of suspense and tension also. But the best was the message that the human spirit triumphs over everything... Very stylish, very scientific, and yet very human. But somehow it wasnt a very popular movie. Sadly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first it seemed odd that the astronauts should go to Titan in business suits. On reflection, though, this is to judge things by our own times and technology, in which manned space travel is rare and risky. Contrast this with a launch rate of 12 a day or more i.e. routine, like air travel. I imagine also that the astronauts were only going as far as a Low Earth Orbit space station, at which time they would transfer to a much different craft and possibly change clothes.P.S. Excellent movie. 8 out of 10. I can't believe that this movie's Stealth Marketing [TM] (-: is such that I have only just heard about it and watched it (and then only rented on a whim).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gattaca belongs squarely in the "future noir" category right next to Blade Runner if for no other reason that they both have a lot to say about science, the quality of life, and the Frankenstein complex. Both Gattaca and Blade Runner both fail to live up to their noir potential in the search for increased marketability. &lt;P&gt;If it fails in other regards its because it reached too far at too many themes: predestiny, genetics as destiny, nature vs. nurture, class distinctions based on birth, an Orwellian state, and the meaning of freedom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Explores timely issues regarding gene based civil rights abuse.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gattaca is the story of Vincent[Ethan Hawk], a man who tries against all genetic odds and social prejudice to enter into an elite space navigator training center (Gattaca). His success depends upon the willingness of a genetically superior paraplegic and his own subterfuge. His task is complicated by many daily genetic analyses required to work at Gattaca, a romantic attraction for Irene [Uma Thurman], another Gattaca navigator, and the murder of a project director days before a long awaited (72 years) launch. Gattaca is a murder mystery and science wake-up-call in one.The themes presented by the filmmakers are timely and raise questions regarding genetic manipulation as a societal practice. The film could easily take place fifty years from now, and highlights class division based on a new technology that confounds most persons today.Gattaca is informative, and filmed with careful attention to detail. The slow pace seems appropriate when one considers the time one needs to absorb the tide of ideas in this film. You might even appreciate the appearance of Ernest Borgnine as an observant grounds keeper and cleaning person.If you are a scientist, the film will delight you with its insight. If you are a parent, you will want to see what the future holds for our children. If you are a community leader, then you might experience fear and concern.Gattaca is not a film to miss. It is your future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was two months ago that I saw this movie so I shall have to do my best to give an accurate account. But here I go. First I want to say that the scenery is really great. It fits the atmosphere of the movie very well. It is a story about a society in which all life is regulated and in which there is no place for you if you don't fit in. Not because there is some kind of Big brother who watches everything but because the people wanted it that way themselves. They chose to have perfect children via genetic engineering. Now there is no place for "accidents" or natural born people anymore. There is no place for people that are born from love anymore. The struggle in the movie is against that system, against all odds.The whole movie seems to have a kind of style or dignity about it. It is a believable story. Well what can I say more, I quite liked it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful original in the sci-fi genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are in the mood for science fiction but want something different from Star Wars, you should see Gattaca. It was appraised by critics but ignored in theatres for some reason. Set in the near future, Gattaca is the story of a young man named Vincent Freeman, who longs to join the space program Gattaca and travel to other planets. All his life he's loved astronomy. It's all he can think about. But he lives in a day and time when unless you are genetically perfect, you are not allowed to do anything but be a janitor. And that is what Vincent is stuck with. He was conceived the "natural" way, and born with a serious coronary defect. So Gattaca is beyond his reach. Even his parents say so. Why should society waste its resources on you when you could die from a genetic heart disorder and Joe Blo over here has a heart perfected by genetic engineering??? But Vincent cannot ignore the call of his dreams. The discriminatory society in which he lives will not change any time soon, and in order to be accepted as a worthy candidate for Gattaca, he must cheat. He assumes the identity of one of the genetically elite, and pretty soon, is living his dreams within Gattaca's walls. With an exciting mission to one of Saturn's moons just a breath away, the director of the program is brutally murdered. A hard-nosed investigator (Alan Arkin) and his assistant (Loren Dean) are everywhere, interrogating everyone, determined to find the killer, and Vincent becomes terrified that his true identity will be revealed. Hawke is wonderfully subtle but very compelling as Vincent. Also among the cast are Uma Thurman and Jude Law. I simply love Michael Nyman's music score and would love to see any other films he's provided the music to. This movie is also one of a kind in its production design, from the strange green-gold lighting to the weird little futuristic cars they drive. I found Gattaca to be the kind of sci-fi that is much more cognative than noisy, comaprable with the works of Ray Bradbury and the stylishness of Ridley Scott's sci-fi movies. If you're sick to death of ID4 and the like, try Gattaca. It's really refreshing and intelligent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>[WARNING: Movie reviews cannot be written without spoilers. You have been warned.]Gattaca is a disturbing look into a possibly ugly future. Of course, one always thinks, "that can't happen here." Normally, I would agree. However, when I see "baby boomers" hauling their children to public schools in mandatory uniforms, my dread of a Draconian future becomes less unrealistic. As of this writing, a Jewish high school student was barred from class in Mississippi because he was wearing the Star of David. Apparently, school authorities determined the star could be interpreted as a gang symbol. If we keep up this nonsense, our future will be bleak.In the world of Gattaca, an individual's worth is measured by his DNA, hence the name of the film (i.e. A,C,G,T). Merit, no longer plays the prevailing role of determining what cream may rise to the top. It is all predetermined by "well meaning" parents who select the best of their progeny to succeed them.The film follows our protagonist who is a, "borrowed ladder." He is aided by an elite, "valid," who can no longer function in his predetermined role.Along the way, we meet many interesting characters who challenge the unquestioned state of affairs. The twist and turns of the movie make it feel like a thriller from bygone days. The conservative dress and dialogue, along with drab colors contribute to a historic feel. In addition, the score, which out of context has been panned by music critics as repetitive, perfectly balances the feel of the film.Because the film centers around a "who-done-it" plot, I dare give away any more in this review. Suffice to say, this is perhaps the best film of the decade.</fullReview>

Hawke's character is genetically flawed and thus forced to live and work as a menial laborer. He manages to disquise himself to get a job working in the privileged side of society, but when a murder occurs, things begin to unravel for him. At the same time he meets Thurman and begins a relationship that also has him worrying about being discovered for what he is.

		<shortDescription>an extraordinarily lyrical and moving sci-fi film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this age of _Independence Day_, _Armageddon_, _Starship Troopers_, and similar mega-budget monstrosities that substitute an all-out assault on the eardrums for thought, _Gattaca_ stands out as one of the few sci-fi films of recent years that will stay with you long after the taste of popcorn has faded. The issue is thought-provoking: does human achievement correlate directly to talent, or in some way do our "deficiencies" motivate us?The acting is quite good: Ethan Hawke projects a compelling mixture of determination, resignation, and fear. Jude Law is a major talent who steals every scene he is in. Uma Thurman is given more to do than just look pretty. And watch for the magnificent Gore Vidal doing one of his occasional in front of the camera turns (though he is not used as well here as he was in _Bob Roberts_).Some comments here have suggested the film has no sci-fi special effects. However, if you pay close attention, you'll note elegant touches, such as how the retro-look cars purr in a way that reveals they don't use conventional internal combustion engines. The film-makers wisely avoided any silly choices in architecture (the corporate buildings are appropriately blank even as they appear to aim for openness) and clothing/consumer goods (the one fashion trend the future is always guaranteed to bring is nostalgia). The look of the film overall is very stylish, what I would call noir-futuristic, and almost every shot has a sort of burnished quality to the lighting that somehow conveys the sterility and regimentation of the society. Similarly, the way that the astronauts all look to have been cast from the same mold, even though they are of different racial backgrounds, is oddly creepy. Deserving of mention, too, is the haunting score, which without seeming repetitive uses recurring musical themes to tie scenes together thematically.In short, this is a sci-fi film for adults, with a story and themes reminiscent of classic works of the genre by Philip K. Dick, Frank Herbert, and Ray Bradbury. It is also, finally, moving in a way that films can never be when they suggest that all of humanity's problems can be solved if we can only set off a big enough explosion. We root for Hawke's doomed man with a dream, determined not just to fulfill his potential, but to exceed what society would call reasonable expectations. And while the ending is not the sort to make us cheer, we may only hope that we do as much with the hands we are dealt.</fullReview>

It had a good story to it, and I think that everyone should watch this film to show how much people really are obsessed with the perfect being. While the not perfect beings are left out of the picture. Even though it takes place in the not so distant future, it's actually very similar to these times today. How if people don't think someone's not 'right', they just throw them away like a piece of garbage (not literally), or how 'society' today is still going through the whole discrimination subject, how people are just treated like nobody's unless they're "perfect".All in all, it was a great film that I enjoyed watching.

Everything about this film shines and comes together to make one of the top ten of 1997.Both Ethan Hawke and Jude Law have great performances in this film. Without these huge performances, this film would be nothing more than beautiful sets and an interesting plot. Andrew Niccol's debut in the director's chair is very impressive and all the more astounding since he also wrote the screenplay. Perhaps most important about a film of this genre is to not be overlong. Gattaca flows very smoothly and never lost my attention.I would fully recommend this film to all.

		<shortDescription>A sci-fi film so profound- some geneticists are using it to reflect on their work.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are sci-fi films about "space adventures" and there are sci-fi films about "ideas". Gattaca qualifies as one of the best sci-fi films about social ideas.It is the story of a man who struggles in a futuristic society where status is determined solely on genetic perfection.This movie is one of the best at masterfully conveying the writer's opinions on the impact of genetic engineering on humanity. In fact, it is so convincing that some geneticists are using this film as sort of a "guide" when they consider the social implications of their work. Nightline (with Ted Koppel of ABC news) had a feature on "genetic engineering and cloning" (2 years ago - I think). The Nightline feature showed a group of geneticists that wrote a set of ethical rules for themselves AND they labeled it "Gattaca...something" (Sorry...I don't recall the exact name of these "ten commandments" but the word "Gattaca" does appear in the title - as a reference to the movie).Gattaca is one of those films that you can't just label as "science fiction". It should be labeled instead as "social-science fiction". And it is social-science fiction at its best from beginning to end. The word "classic" may be overused - but not in this case.Intelligent and imaginative! This film reminds me of why I watch SCI-FI !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big Brother has changed his uniform.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't fully explain why this film made me so tense on first viewing and can only assume that it's because it's extremely telling of what may be. Despite this film's predilection with the 1940's, it remains throughout science-fiction at its best. It seems that the tidy suits and classic cars are a homage to books such as 'Brave New World' and '1984'. Though this time (as we are informed in the opening caption) that it is in the not too distant future and so, we, with our recent advancements in the field of genetics, can fully appreciate the horror of this 'utopia'. This time Big Brother doesn't need to monitor us with cameras when he can predict with an accuracy measured in percentages, what we may be capable of, where we have been and what we have touched. What I find especially astounding about this film is that it triumphantly uses a narrative by the main character. Which as we all know ruined 'Bladerunner' prior to its 'Director's Cut'. Instead of the voiceover being an annoying and patronising aspect of the film it allows us to sympathise with a character who is living in a particularly cold and antiseptic environment. Vincent's floating lamentations carry you along with his dream and I suspect that is another reason why I found it so taut with suspense, I wanted him to succeed. I won't go into the plot or the details of this film, as I always find it annoying when people do so, because if people are reading a review then they have more than likely seen it and if they haven't then it will only spoil the plot for them. So I will concentrate on the artistic and therefore subjective aspects, namely Andrew Niccol's direction and Slawomir Idziak's photography. The look of this film is absolutely enchanting, it always seems as if the sun is setting in every open-air scene and it's so very dark and clinical indoors. The colour of the film is very similar to that of 'Good Will Hunting', a sort of sepia sunset which, appears warm and yet, we understand it is so very cold. There is also the dreamlike swimming scenes, which only adds to the feeling that you are on another world. Also the setting of the GATTACA building with it's lines of perfectly, faceless, clockwork drones gives us the impression of another world, another time. Then there is the sublime acting of Ethan Hawke and especially Jude Law, who adds an element of humour to the whole proceedings. It's so hard to distinguish between good acting and wooden acting in this film, because the characters themselves are somewhat dehumanised and wooden. If you want a sci-fi film with space cruisers and intergalactic aliens then look somewhere else. If you want a tale of human determination and sacrifice which uses technology and the future merely as a backdrop then sit yourself down in total darkness and watch this stylish piece of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thriller with a Sci Fi angle to it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once in a while a film comes along with a familiar story with a different angle on it. Gattaca is great. The familiar part is an outcast wanting to be part of a 'superior' group and risking everything to do so, yes you guessed it he falls for one of them and faces many dilemmas and tricky situations. The SCI FI twist to the story is great, if a little complex but it makes very good viewing. In my view this thriller was unfairly criticised as it is a very well made film, one I recommend highly. Good to see Ernest Borgnine back on our screens, if only in a small role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really cannot understand the comments of those who didn't like this movie because it didn't have spaceships: this is science fiction, not space opera. And as science fiction, this is the best film since Bladerunner, without a doubt. The premise is excellent and timely, but it is the subtlety of of the plot which is magical. Add to that the seamless matching of this plot to the imagery, look and cinematography of the film and you have a winner.The three central performances are very good indeed: and sparks really fly between Hawke and Thurman: you can tell that their relationship is real. Jude Law turns in another wonderful performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely loved this movie. It was breathtaking. The storyline was flawless. It's about the "Not to Distant Future" when babies are genetically made to perfection. An "invalid" (a human not genetically made) faces several problems in trying to become what he is not in order to achieve his goals. This movie shows how strong discrimination can be and how far you can get by listening to yourself, not others, and never giving up. It is truly inspirational. Great performance by Ethan Hawk as an imperfect man in a perfect world. Jude Law is scene stealing as a "Valid" man who shows that even physical perfection can't bring happiness. After all this movie's tagline says it all... "There is No Gene for the Human Spirit"!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sci-Fi in which the special effects don't take over</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't think the premise of "Gattaca" (1997:*** out of ****) was that far-fetched. We haven't quite "progressed" to outright genetic selection based on DNA, but "valids" and "in-valids" are pre-selected on a class and economic basis all the time. I thought the writer-director could have injected a little more humor and satire into his script, but I admired him for not going overboard on action and special effects. There are a lot of good little visual details (like the pianist with 12 fingers) that will make the movie a good one to watch on a repeat basis. Even the murder mystery is handled in a restrained way. All this subtlety is probably why the movie flopped at the box office. The DVD also includes some outtakes and "first drafts" of scenes that didn't make it into the film, including one that apparently makes it clear sooner in the story that the young detective is "Vincent's" long-lost brother. Incidentally, the movie doesn't examine how the police fit into this new world. Are they valid or in-valid? I would think that Vincent's genetically superior brother would be among the Gattaca elite. Composer Michael Nyman provides his usual soothingly repetitive new-age mood music.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A S/F Movie with a Point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As another reviewer here has said, the BEST science-fiction is that which makes a point, has a lesson to teach and does it in a fashion which gets your attention. Gattaca did this, initially with an ad I saw in USA Today which should have shocked the hell out of anyone who read it, then with the work itself.Gattaca is less about the the Frank Lloyd Wright-esque sets or the virtual lack of special effects or the absurdity of astronauts saddling up to sweat 9 G's on a trip to Titan in Savile Row suits, but about what happens when man so genuflects at the altar of technology that he forgets the temple which is himself. It gives one to wonder whether, if man were to genetically perfect himself, would having nothing to overcome lessen that piece of work which is man? In a deleted post-script, available with the DVD, this point is hammered home with the example of several people who succeeded DESPITE their DNA sequences, among them Abraham Lincoln, Albert Einstein, Ray Charles and Stephen Hawking. Life gave them lemons; they made lemonade ... or whisky sours, perhaps!"There IS no gene for the human spirit," so says the tagline, and that IS the point.</fullReview>

There is an important moral message projected in the plot --- that anyone who works hard and perseveres will be successful.Jerome is an interesting character. As Vincent explains: "Jerome suffered from a different kind of burden, the burden of perfection."The intense sibling rivalry between Vincent and his genetically enhanced brother, Antoine was emotionally moving. I cried happy tears for Vincent both times when he defeated his brother in their game of chicken --- when they would swim out to sea as far as they dared.Good science fiction makes you think --- to put the pieces together that makes the plot understandable and entertaining.

		<shortDescription>Cautionary tale of a dark future</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My friends can't believe this film choked me up. I'm not the type to weep at a film. Most scenes of sentimental emotional upheaval leave me feeling a little bored and sometimes even annoyed. Tear jerkers need not apply.I saw this film at the 1997 Toronto Film Festival, which was special in two ways, as it was the first film of any Film Festival that I'd ever been to, and secondly because I had the most unexpected teary reaction at the end of the film. Spoiler guidelines prevent me from revealing it, but in case you've seen the film and wonder what I'm talking about, it has to do with dream realization.It's a cautionary tale of where gene manipulation at birth might lead us: to a society of discrimination based on DNA. The film was beautifully shot, and an engaging futuristic tale without the silly customary one-piece uniform with the red banner from left hip to right sholder and the knee high boots which we have come to know, love and mock. This film's futuristic elements were subtle and not too distracting, yet at the same time, thought provoking and interesting.It's not just a tale about goals and social limitations, but about sibling rivalry as well. It features small roles yet poignant performances from Alan Arkin and Gore Vidal and a stunning performance from newcomer Jude Law.Home video watchers might enjoy renting/owning the DVD as it has a few extras that are worthwhile and interesting, including a hilarious outtake where the good doctor sneaks a taste of a "urine" sample, a behind-the-scenes comic relief moment in an otherwise very serious dramatic film.</fullReview>

I was impressed at Ms. Thurman's depth and breadth of character, as well as the explorations and implications of near-perfection in genetic counseling and therapy.What the taglines and trailers don't tell you is that GATTACA is as much a murder mystery as science-fiction cautionary tale.

This really isn't all that far off, I'm sure I will see the type of problem described in this movie at least start to show itself toward the middle/end of my lifetime.Plus the visuals were amazing...I love it when someone gives me a creative look at what the future looks like (Dark City was great) and not just the same ol' bad-copy-of-Star-Wars look.

Except for wrapping things up too neatly at the end, this is quite an intriguing film. I think it didn't do too well because it was sold as a thriller, when in fact it's a genuine science fiction film that doesn't cheat on the science (okay, maybe the Titan flight, but I attribute that to it being a low budget film). It paints a credible, and quite frightening, view of the future. And I think the love story worked because, like in 1984, it asked, in a society like this, is love possible?</fullReview>

Also, everyone at the end seems to agree that that system is messed up, but don't bother to try doing anything. They just shrug their shoulders and keep going through the motions of the old system. Why? In addition, it seems far-fetched that anyone would hire anyone solely on the basis of his genetics; there are always non-genetic factors to consider.In short, though the idea could make a good movie, this particular movie is poorly thought out.

It succeeded.Gattaca's future world was not so far flung to make it unbelievable, it could be just around the corner. The settings definitely made you believe that such things could indeed be happening before too long. It is a story that gives a pointed look at both genetic engineering as well as discrimination.The acting was good, not great, by Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke. The story was what really made this film. A frightening look at the future that you don't so much as ask if it will happen, but when it will happen.The only bad points I could state about this film was that it was billed too much as a "sci-fi action adventure" - it was hardly that. If you went into this film with that expectation, you would be disappointed.Also, the entire Titan mission was explained so sketchily with such vague ideas of why we were even bothering - that it was distracting anytime they mentioned it in the film. It could have easily been written out of the film with little impact to the final product. People going to Titan in business suits?!? A film with a story this good didn't need to resort to a "space mission" plot piece to reel in sci-fi-ers.</fullReview>

This score has to be one of the most beautiful and adequate ones I've ever heard in a film. I got a copy of the soundtrack after I saw the movie and I was captivated for weeks. I would like to quote Andrew Niccol when he describes the Nyman' score in the inner notes of the CD:"Film music is best when it says something that the actors and the picture can not express.

The movie "Gattaca" is an excellent movie with a good story that gives you something to think and talk about after the show. The fact that it is made in a very stylish manner (somebody from the crew must be a big fan of Philippe Starck´s) and enacted by beautiful people like Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke does not exactly make it less enjoyable. The future, populated by genetically engineered people, is inhumanly perfect and beautiful, but also cruel and unforgiving. The story shows that not everything in life is about perfection, especially love and excelling accomplishments. In terms of style, the movie frequently quotes classical future-doomed predecessors like Metropolis, 1984 or even Fahrenheit 451.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An analogue to the movie GattacaThe movie Gattaca presents us with a future where it is the norm to be born in vitro. Children are selected at their pre-zygotic stage of development to be as to close to perfect as possible. Through genetic screening and manipulation, parents are able to select the best of their characteristics for their offspring. Those children who are born the old fashioned way, from their mother's womb ("natural birth"), are considered invalids by society and are forced , through genetic discrimination, to serve at the lowest totems in society.Although the movie had a typical happy Hollywood theme, "there is no gene for the human spirit," I saw the idea of genetic predestination as more than science fiction. I have come to realize that genetic predestination is indeed the future. Our society is moving in a trend of greater and greater complexity. As such, we have been forced to create more and more specialized fields of study to handle this knowledge overload. For example, three centuries ago there was just "one doctor." Now, the term "doctor" has been divided into hundreds of fields with hundreds of sub-categories. A doctor can refer to a medical doctor or a Ph.D. recipient. In the medical field, a doctor can be specialized as a surgeon, further specialized as a neurosurgeon, further specialized as a pediatric neurosurgeon and even further specialized as a pediatric neurosurgeon of the endocrine system. With the increasing wealth of technology these specializations are rapidly expanding.Now, with so many genetic experiments (i.e. cloning, human genome project, etc.) underway, it will soon be difficult for governments to contain and control such crucial and sensitive knowledge. There are too many mediums (i.e. the Internet, satellite, cellular communications technology) of knowledge dispersal available to keep anything a secret for long, especially technology capable of so much monetary value. Much like the legalizing of alcohol, the government will have no choice but to classify the human genetics projects, such as "perfect test tube babies," as acceptable. Regardless of the ethics, the government must accept it to regulate it. It is with this acceptance of human genetic manipulation that the normality of in-vitro, genetically engineered human development will occur.In time, to counter the information overload, people will be engineered from birth to play specific roles in human society. People will become specialized from birth to study subgene X in human chromosome Y. It is the most efficient system, and our own rapid progress will mandate its use. We will, in essence, become eusocial colonies like those of bees and insects, where individuality is shunned and all efforts are made for the progress of the society, as a collective.Gattaca was indeed science fiction. However strong the human spirit may be, it will succumb to the pressures of "social progress." We just may develop a gene for the human spirit.</fullReview>

An excellent script, well-acted all around (Alan Arkin and Jude Law as stand-outs), and brilliantly executed. A heart-felt drama disguised as a futuristic sci-fi thriller.

		<shortDescription>How rare, a science fiction film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While there were other great movies of 1997, I'm placing Gattaca at the top of my list. It's unusual to see an actual science fiction movie, a movie that explores science in an intelligent manner, and this year there were two: Gattaca and Contact. I also liked Contact, but Gattaca swept me away like few movies do these days. And with the deluge of big-budget special effect showcases that are hitting the screen, it's very refreshing to see such a well-thought out movie. The same attention to detail is evident in The Truman Show, causing me to anxiously await more from Andrew Niccols.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gattaca is a rarity in film today, a film that not only encourages the audiance to think but demands and rewards it. Discussions after the film reveal multiple interpretations and the thirst to see more of Niccols world. Ethan Hawke (always a reliable performer) turns in the best performance of his career as the inspiring Vincent. Thurman, Law, and Dean all turn in well-judged performances as the three main supporting players. Their characters are all well thought out and distinct, and offer us a dynamic view of Niccols world. Director Andrew Niccol (A New Zealander) has established himself as one of the most exciting new talents out there. I can't wait for his next film.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect little film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gattaca" is one of those rare films that completes its main theme. The film's principle, "There Is No Gene For The Human Spirit", is the core of this futuristic thriller foreboding the adversities of genetic engineering. Andrew Niccol wrote and directed this little (less than 2 hours) film so well that every aspect of the film successfully unfolds and ties together perfectly from the opening sequence of a person's "particles" to the distant particles in space.The film gets better after the 2nd and 3rd viewing, and I have seen it 5 times since it was release. The narrative technique, which I will not reveal, was very effective especially because of an "element of surprise" that is revealed close to the end. Ethan Hawke is a proving to be a GREAT actor with his multitude of roles (in movies like "Reality Bites", "Dead Poets...", "Great Expectations", etc.), Uma Thurman is perfect for her role, Gore Vidal is very effective as the aloof director of Gattaca, and Alan Arkin is quite funny. The Art Direction is marvelous, but you'll have to see it for yourself.The haunting music of "Gattaca" brings pictures of scenes from the movie whenever I play the soundtrack. This is my favourite film of 1997 after "L.A. Confidential" because "Gattaca" explores the apprehensive possibility of a phenomenon that would affect us in our time; genetic perfection versus the uncertainties of fate. "Gattaca"'s one-track narrative endeavor towards its theme seems more compelling and passionate than Truffaut's "Farenheit 451". I would be very interested in Niccol's work after "The Truman Show"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film about the injustice of class systems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gattaca didn't even finish in top 100 highest grossing films of 1997, yet over the years it has forged a reputation as a minor classic. It's now often listed among the greatest Sci-Fi films of the 90s. It's a story that takes place in the near future where genetic engineering of fertilized eggs allows the parents who can afford it to produce genetically optimal offspring. Children born in this way are considered "Valid" while those who aren't are labeled "Invalid" and are forced into a permanent underclass. Gattaca is about an Invalid who dreams of becoming an astronaut, yet has no legitimate means of achieving this goal no matter how hard he works or how qualified he becomes. All that matters is his DNA, and so he has to find a way to circumvent the system. Gattaca is surviving the test of time because of how well its message resonates. It's clear that the class system depicted is unjust, and despite the fact that it's a story of someone who wants "in" (to the system) rather than "out," what it has to say about the power of the human spirit to overcome great odds, as well as how artificial class divisions actually are even when (or perhaps especially when) based on genetic "superiority," more than justifies the film's limited scope and perspective.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I got the better end of the deal. I only lent you my body. You lent me your dream."In Andrew Niccol's directorial debut we are invited to imagine a world where humans are categorized according to their genetic make-up. In this world, genetic engineering is not only a possibility, but a very common thing. Society now classifies people according to their DNA, and social classes are determined by it. It is not a future too hard to envision considering over history we have categorized people according to the color of their skin, their race, or their gender. Niccol creates an interesting sci-fi premise by using this sort of allegory of our society and combining it with some action and romance. I have yet to see Niccol's Lord of War, but from what I've seen his debut film has been his best. He had an interesting cast to work with as well. Ethan Hawke plays the lead role, Vincent Freeman, who was born with inferior genes and therefore not expected to live long. He must settle for unimportant jobs, and no matter how hard he tries, he is unable to achieve his dream of traveling to space. Those jobs are only available for humans with superior DNA. Jude Law plays a supporting role as Jerome Murrow, a man born with perfect genes, but after suffering an accident he is left paraplegic. Vincent assumes Jerome's identity and by deceiving DNA testings he is able to follow his dream and is assigned on a space mission. It's an engaging premise despite some flaws, but it is much more intelligent than some recent sci-fi Niccol films.Ethan Hawke gives a solid performance, but he doesn't really stand out here like he has in some of his other films. The best thing about Gattaca is its sci-fi futuristic premise which manages to thrill and keep the audience in suspense. Jude Law doesn't add much to the story, but he is always an interesting presence. Uma Thurman plays Hawke's love interest and gives the plot a romantic side. Her chemistry with Hawke is what makes the film emotionally engaging, because without her Vincent isn't really engaging on his own. The film succeeds thanks to its strong narrative (written by Niccol himself) and the way it manages to adapt current prejudices in society to a future we don't want to look forward to. It gets its point across of cautioning us and delivering meaning in a similar way that classic fairy tales did when our mothers read us the stories when we were kids. It has become a classic for some over the years. It's not among my favorite films, but it was an enjoyable ride and i'm glad I finally got around to watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gattaca is a research space facility where the elite work and the bonus is travel to the stars. At this point in the future our lives and career paths are chosen by eugenics. But that's not going to stop Ethan Hawke.Loren Dean and Hawke are brothers. Dean was a special test tube baby, but in the case of Hawke, mom and dad brought him into the world the old fashioned way. Dean made sure Hawke knew he was the product of inferior breeding and he got his ticket punched for a job at Gattaca. Hawke works there too, as part of Ernie Borgnine's janitorial crew.As a film Gattaca offers us the proposition that even with eugenics one still can't determine abilities. But you have to be able to fool the DNA monitors and Hawke gets a crash course in this from Tony Shalhoub. And he even gets a girl that normally shouldn't be in his league in Uma Thurman.Gattaca which got an Oscar nomination in the Art&amp;Set Design category offers an intriguing possibility for the future, a future I certainly wouldn't want to see come to pass.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie may have been inspired by Chloe O'Brian, the first genetically selected human. Chloe was born in England in 1992 to parents who already had a child suffering from cystic fibrosis and wanted another child with a guarantee of better genes (just like in the movie).Hundreds of genetically selected children have since been born. Of course we're only doing one gene at a time at the moment and only a half dozen or so fertilized eggs are analyzed for each couple but it seems likely that these numbers will go up.And calculating odds of heart disease or math ability or longevity is surprisingly easy. Scientists would not even have to understand why a particular set of genes implies math ability or whatnot, they could do the whole thing statistically. Develop quick sequencing and then collect a lot of data and that's that. (Remaking Eden by Princeton professor Lee Silver explains everything.) I hope the science background is useful for IMDb readers. As far as the movie goes, it's thoughtful science fiction and it watches almost like a stage play. There aren't a lot of special effects or action scenes. It makes its point and leaves you to your thoughts.Would you conceive 10,000 babies out of your genes and then pick "the best of you" to be your baby? It would be hard to resist. So is the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Few people realize nowadays that genetic selection of descendants could be so harmful. At the present moment, many people only see that we can choose the best of our gens, for example, to avoid genetic sickness, and that is something that could already be done. The film develops what could happen if we allow that. The deepest reason against genetic selection, in the film, is that one can do better with a will of steel than with the best genetic abilities. About the well done performance of all the characters, I prefer the work of Jude Law, whose life itself has no sense, although he is genetically perfect, but he recovers the interest borrowing his identity to a non-genetic-selected boy. I recommend you to see the film because it claims your attention all along the film, you won't be boring at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suspenseful futuristic thriller, handled intelligently for the most part. The sets are impressive and look impeccably clean and shiny, but without appearing plastic or phony (as in the various crappy spin-offs of "Star Trek", where everything looks like it's been built by Lego toy-manufacturers). Most of the movie seems to be covered in a veil of yellow, which gives it often a unique look. Hawke is okay (especially considering his lack of charisma), Thurman is quite bad ? totally wooden, so it's Law who steals the film; plus a good supporting cast (Shalhoub and Arkin).The film brings in interesting ideas, but isn't always entirely credible. For example, Hawke's picture is displayed all over the building, and yet no one recognizes him on the photo because supposedly no one pays attention to photos anymore. Everyone may focus primarily on fingerprints, urine samples, blood, and the like, but surely a photo is a photo and no cop in the past, present, or future is likely to ignore it as a means of aiding an investigation. The fact that Hawke's own brother doesn't recognize him in his numerous visits isn't too credible, either, notwithstanding that they haven't seen each other in a while.he story is very good, however, and the mistake of portraying all the "valids" as emotionless, ruthless robots, was not made; Thurman gets round to accepting Hawke, Law becomes a good friend, and even Hawke's sample-taker turns out to be extremely helpful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Futuristic Suspense Flick, with Great Cast, Shines!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gattaca, a 1997 sci-fi flick, stands out with a fine cast and a unique approach to exploring an old problem: prejudice. In this setting, a person is judged at birth by his probabilities on a genetic 'measuring stick' (for want of a better term). Your resumé is your genetic profile. Society grimly monitors the movement of people via random 'DNA' sampling.Enter Ethan Hawke as Vincent, a young man with a 'deficient' profile, but the owner of great dreams for work in Space Exploration. Can he beat the 'system?' He manages to penetrate the higher echelons only to be confronted by unwelcome probing after a baffling murder.I have enjoyed the enlightening comments here at IMDb about Gattaca. It's a film for deep(er) thinkers, which may explain why it has been overlooked by the 'professional' critics, and the public at large(?).Anyway, there's nothing like a film with great actors sometimes taking smaller roles, and delivering. Consider: Tony Shaloub (a black marketer of an unusual service) - Shaloub is now the proud lead in the quirky detective show 'Monk' Jude Law - (plays Ethan Hawke's 'business' partner) - Tony-Award winner - Gattaca was his first major roleErnest Borgnine - Oscar for 'Marty' 1956! (Borgnine seems to be 200 years old but was actually born in 1917)Uma Thurman - 'Uma Oprah Oprah Uma' fame Alan Arkin - (plays a detective in a crumpled raincoat, looking like he just stepped off the set of a 1940's film noir..! what a quirky twist in a futuristic setting)Elias Koteas - (Vincent's dad) - one of the best actors no one knows.. check out his photo here at IMDb - it looks NOTHING like the character in this film! lol - but I just caught him in a 2006 'House M.D' episode capably battling it out with Hugh Laurie. also did a 'spot' role in 'SIM1ONE' with Al PacinoImpressive! 9 out of 10.Movies that 'grab' you often have great casts. Put 'duds' or 'glamor boys' in those roles, and the production becomes quite forgettable.I'll end with this quote from the film - and I hope you find it as poignant when you hear it: "I didn't save anything for the swim back."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sci fi is usually corny, a few futuristic trappings wrapped around a horse opera. This movie, however, is a realistic creation of a future world where DNA shapes lives. DNA is used for routine identification, routine spying on people to find out where they have been or to identify strangers, determining likely medical history, personality traits, even penis size. On a date, partners share hair samples so they can have them tested to see if the other is suitably perfect. A job interview consists only of a supervised urine sample. You can get anyone's DNA tested at the local Photomat.It is a world obsessed with perfection in genetics, cleanliness, architecture, appearance, athletics, manners... The obsession with DNA generates a class system based on genetic perfection.The hero (Ethan Hawke) cheats on DNA testing to give himself a chance at space flight, a privilege normally given only to the genetic elite.The tension comes from the web closing slowly around his deception despite his elaborate efforts to evade. There is no running, shooting, head bashing (well a little) or car chases. Yet the suspense is unbearable. It makes the movie uncomfortable to watch.There is a juicy cast of some of my favourite actors including: Alan Arkin, Tony Shalub, Gore Vidal, Ethan Hawke and Jude Law. Two of the characters, brothers, have 4 different actors (perhaps more) each for four ages, which gets a bit confusing.The movie is like Blade Runner in that it creates a complete believable world, but this world is all serene brushed stainless steel and polished woods, evoking the sterility of an airport for the ultra wealthy.</fullReview>

People have been engineered to be perfect and yet they seem to be those with the most problems.Human determination can overcome fate. "Vincent" is born as a 'faith-birth' meaning that his mother and father conceived him naturally. Due to this fact, he stands no chance of being as likely to thrive, let alone survive, as those programmed by their "local geneticist".

		<fullReview>..."Gattaca" seems even closer to being reality. An almost unnerving story of Vincent Freeman's (Ethan Hawke) plan to go on a space mission is well done, if bizarre. Genetically "imperfect", Vincent is borrowing the identity of the genetically "perfect" Jerome Morrow (Jude Law), to work at the Gattaca corporation. Meanwhile, soft-spoken Gattaca employee Irene Cassini (Uma Thurman) is having a hard time getting to know Vincent; it's sort of ambiguous as to whether or not she suspects him.Nowadays, I guess that we should worry about the usage of genetics to discriminate; the Nazis did it. Anyhow, director Andrew Niccol creates an almost dreamlike world in this movie. As it was, this was released around the same time that the Rolling Stones released their "Bridges to Babylon" album, and some of the songs there reminded me of this movie. Maybe that's just me, but I interpreted it as such. A very interesting movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hi, to all, who watched Gattaca! Before I have seen this movie, I thought about the title and the main topic. Therefore I expected a science fiction movie, which takes place in the future. Accordingly I awaited future towns, highly developed cars and the normal future stuff, but I was disappointed in this aspect. The background and properties are normal, the cars were models out of the 80's. Moreover the space flight, which Jerome worked hard for, was very unspectacular. Altogether you get the feeling, this film could play now, in this moment and not far away (like the first chapter is called). Maybe the director wanted to achieve this, that it becomes clear, that biological technical engineering will come soon and with this, the problems the film contents, too. Furthermore the film doesn't only treat the problem of biological technical engineering, because it copes with all these normal human feelings, like love, hate, the will to win or to be better as others, pressure of expectations, lies and so on. Besides like every movie it has a love story between Jerome and Irene, the competition between Jerome and Anton and a mystery death of the director. All in all I think the director would have done a good job, if he had wanted to show the problem of the biological technical development and the consequence for the society.I wish you a lot of fun by watching this movie - it is one of these movies, which force you to think about it.</fullReview>

It is a thoughtful science fiction film about a future, where it is possible to change the genes of embryos so that the parents are able to order their perfect child. The very logic consequence of that is, that only the genetic changed persons have the chances to do every job they want to. With the following problem deals the film: What is then about the natural born persons and their dreams? And what happens when a natural born person penetrates into this perfect world? This person is Vincent, a natural born janitor at the space program Gattaca. He has a heart failure and because of this only 30 years to live, but he wants to go into space. He knows, that he has no chance, so he makes a deal with Jerome, who has perfect genes, but was paralyzed in an accident.It seems like the author could have look into the future or he knows exactly the mankind, because the film is frightened real. Everybody could imagine, what it would be like, if genetic engineering comes so far. The actors are doing their jobs great and the direction is wonderful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gattaca is one of the most underestimated and underrated movies of the 90's. I don't know why. Maybe it's because it covers genetic manipulation. Maybe people fear its message.The movie takes place in a "not so far future" where society is affected by genetic discrimination. Anyone who's not 'pre-ordered' by his parents has genetic flaws and isn't as perfect as 'pre-ordered' children are. Like this they will also not be chosen for Gattaca, a space program. But Vincent, a 'godchild' - meaning that he wasn't genetically engineered - working as a janitor at Gattaca, hires someone to change his identity into Jerome's, a genetically high potential Olympic swimmer, who has become crippled, because of an accident. That's Voncent's chance to get into Gattaca, even with his 99% heart malfunction chance before reaching the age of thirty. But when he meets Irene he gets more problems than he expected.Gattaca conveys a dark, sterile atmosphere that makes us fear the possible near future, because it all seems so realistic. It predicts a world that must be stopped before it even starts.Gattaca was even nominated for an Oscar for the best direction, but unfortunately crashed by Titanic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** I like movies that take place in the not-too-distant future. It allows for repetitive viewings for years to come, primarily because audiences will always be able to believe that the future they are witnessing may be right around the bend. As great a film as it is, "2001: A Space Odyssey" predicted advancements that never came - which, in retrospect, all seem quite dated. It's still an undoubtedly great film, but the wonder of the technology has somewhat diminished - but when a film says it takes place in the not-too-distant future...you can never say it predicted wrong.Gattaca is a futuristic space station that employs perfect people to work on perfect missions to space. Vincent (Ethan Hawke) was a rare child, an embryo not edited in any way, shape or form to improve characteristic traits. As soon as the child is born, blood is taken and analyzed. It is predicted that young Vincent will be overweight, suffer from heart problems and die by the age of 30.It never happens. Vincent, as a young man, is healthy - physically and emotionally. He doesn't suffer any breakdowns, his heart never fails, and he is simply a normal human being. He wears glasses on his weak eyes, and that is the only indication that he is somewhat human after all.Other children, including his brother, are taken after conception and placed under the care of scientists who can alter genes and take out such unwanted traits as obesity, harmful physical conditions, and damaging addictions that could cause the soon-to-be-born individual's future self.Vincent dreams of becoming a space explorer, of joining Gattaca and traveling to distant planets. His dreams are all ruined, though, because he is not perfect like everyone else. So what do you do if you can't fit in? Buy your way in.Vincent pays a crook (Tony Shalhoub) to find an individual with good traits who would be interested in swapping identities. He does, and presents Jerome (Jude Law) to Vincent. Jerome used to be an Olympic Silver Medal swimmer until he became paralyzed from the waist down. His injury was not reported in the United States, but rather overseas, and so Vincent assumes Jerome's identity, copying his features and mannerisms and so on and so forth so that he can pass as Jerome and be accepted into Gattaca.Tricky stuff is involved, such as occasional urine samples and daily blood checks (to see if the workers at Gattaca are "Valid" or "Invalid"). Jerome pees into bags and draws blood, and Vincent pays the rent in exchange for his favors. They both think they may have a chance at a future when Irene (Uma Thurman) starts to suspect something and begins a dangerous love affair with Vincent, that only ends in truth.Andrew Niccol's flair for technological advancements of the future shines through in "Gattaca." He's the man responsible for the Jim Carrey vehicle "The Truman Show" and last year's funny black comedy "S1m0ne." This is his finest achievement, a story deeply rooted in both the present and the future. It bears a message that everyone should be given a shot, irregardless of physical conditions, and it also presents us with amazing futuristic contraptions and settings. It's a very good movie.There's something I've noted about Andrew Niccol movies, however, that is harder to spot but nevertheless very present in "Gattaca." It's a superficial feeling. I sensed it in "The Truman Show," "S1m0ne," and again in "Gattaca." It hit me just now that it's the wide gaps in the man's screenplays -- in "The Truman Show," my enjoyment in the film was hindered by its almost ludicrous example of how a television show based solely around one man might exist. (Truman would have to be pretty naive not to notice certain things when he was younger, and not only that, but the entire idea has many plot holes that I usually don't care about but couldn't shrug off.) "S1m0ne" had the same sort of moments where you had to stop a minute and say, "Wait, hold on...what? Come on!"But "Gattaca" moves so fast and with such self-assurance that you never have the time to stop and wonder about the numerous plot holes in the plot. I liked "Gattaca," despite its minor flaws, and it's the rare type of film that actually means a lot of things on a lot of different levels.4.5/5 stars.- John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GATTACA (DIDIER BECU)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andrew Niccol, director of The truman Show, offers us here a science-fictionmovie but for those who wanna see aliens and spaceships better not see this... It's set up in the late 90's in where having children through the old way (you know the birds and the bees) is out of time as due to technology they can produce the perfect people (is that still sciene fiction???). Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke) is the child of the old way and his dream to become an astronaut is totally impossible due to his problems with his heart. As they only want perfect people he changes his identity with an athlete Jerome (Jude Law) who spends his life in a wheelchair. Everything goes perfect till some days before the launch the police (who are more a sort of futuristic KGB) discover that there is an intruder with a false identity around... It's clear that this movie has more to do with sentiment rather than action or any other genre, and how beautiful it all might look, it is at times quite boring and that's due to the performance from Ethan Hawke who acts more like some statue that doesn't move a thing and same can be said about Uma Thurman. I noticed that most of the reviews here are very good but just don't get it that much, it's just a movie that goes like a turtle...very slow and what is passing our eyelids is beautiful but after seeing a statue for some minutes you just go away, not?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie of the DECADE!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have no idea what to write for this review, because Gattaca literally left me speechless the first time I saw it 5 years ago. I left me speechless every other time I've seen it since. This is perhaps the most perfect film of the decade of the 90s. There have been so many movies in the past that have attempted to show a "grim look at the future". The 13th Floor, Soylent Green, 1984, Logan's Run, THX-1138, any of the original Planet Of The Apes films. Gattaca does it just as well, if not better than all of those.The writer and director, Andrew Niccol, who wrote The Truman Show and wrote and directed Simone, is arguably the most imaginative film-maker to emerge in years. Niccol is like a super genetic cross breed between Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg.The world of Gattaca is one where most humans are genetically altered and enhanced before their birth, making them stronger, smarter, better looking. Ethan Hawke plays a man who never was genetically altered. People like him in the movie are called God Children or De-Gene-erates. He takes on the identity of Jude Law's character to get into the space program of Gattaca. Fooling everybody, he's days away from going into space when the Mission Director is killed. At that point the movie becomes a bit of a futuristic murder mystery. There is next to no action in Gattaca, yet I can't help but be tense and excited during the whole movie. The threat of Ethan Hawke's character being discovered as a fake (or borrowed ladder as they're called in the movie) creates so much tension that the movie doesn't need any real action. The themes of the movie are simply brilliant. Themes like accomplishing the impossible against all odds, and overcoming physical setbacks to defeat those who are made to be better than you. One line in the movie sums all these themes up best."I was never more certain of how far away I was from my dream, then when I was standing right next to it".I also love how Jude Law's character of Eugene/Jerome, was made and engineered to be almost superhuman, yet he's all but failed at everything in his life. There's a perfect contrast of the two sides of characters in Gattaca. Gattaca avoids being preachy or making the engineered humans clear cut bad guys. It's so refreshing to see a movie with a real great idea behind it, and a small degree of intelligence and thought, instead of these stupid dopey sci-fi action films like Tomb Raider or the remake of Rollerball. In my mind, Gattaca holds up as the best film of the 90s and one of the all time greatest Sci Fi films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did anyone notice that the title is a DNA sequence?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit I didn't. Someone had to point it out to me.This is a depressing future, not so much because of what it would be like to live in it, but because of what it says about the way humans make choices. After most of the secrets of genetics and embryology have been cracked, and it's possible to give a person any viable genotype at all, you'd expect to see wondrous things: natural-looking purple hair, men with Roman-statue faces, women with all manner of different breasts - even such things as tails, manes, and hobbit-like feet. In short, you'd expect variety. But in the future we see here everyone looks the same - and it's not even an interesting or particularly attractive same. It comes, I suppose, of the fact that parents would tend to chose genotypes for their children the same way they choose names: with no higher end in mind than to make sure their child is as ordinary, hence as unlikely to be teased at school, as possible.So the gag about the twelve-fingered pianist, while cute, doesn't sit easily with this vision of the future. If the world contains twelve-fingered pianists it probably contains other marvels as well. Where are they?My short verdict on "Gattaca" is that it's a visual success and a sonic failure. Michael Nyman has written (as he usually does, only this time it's worse) the kind of new age music you'd expect to listen to when someone asks you to close your eyes and imagine you're lying on a tropical beach: lousy as music, and ludicrously out of place in a film that is NOT telling us to breathe deeply and relax. And all the first person narration (and believe me, there's a lot of it) could be removed from the soundtrack and NOTHING would be lost. First person narration rarely does any film any good; here it makes Vincent come across as whiny and unreasonable. He has a heart condition that makes it hard for him to be an astronaut, because there's an excellent chance he'll be killed by the flight. Does he really have the right to complain about unfair discrimination? Gattaca won't hire him because he has a medical condition that makes him less qualified than others - and you can see their point of view. You'll note that in order to get hired he must lie not only about his genes - if that was ALL he had to lie about, then Gattaca's hiring policies would indeed be unfair - but about his brute physical properties. He must, for instance, hide the fact that a little exercise makes his heart beat alarmingly fast. If Niccol had removed Vincent's peevish comments about the social policies of the future he would have been free to tell the more interesting story: that of someone who, justified or not, wants so badly to go into space that he's prepared to sacrifice his life for it.And it's not so much THAT he complains in his voice-over; it's the WAY he complains, with unbecoming self-centredness and cheap sarcasm. As it happens, Niccol could have worked this into the story. Consider...SPOILER AHEADThe central plot complication is this: the director of the institute is murdered, and Vincent's cover is in danger of being blown by the massive forensic investigation that follows. Now we're not actually told that Vincent ISN'T the murderer. He had at least as much motive as anyone else (indeed, the very same motive as the person who actually did it), and what the police say as they speculate is true: he IS single-minded, and somewhat irrational. He's also capable of violence. When he's challenged by a policeman at a crucial moment he doesn't hesitate to beat the guy up. I was thinking - and for the sake of the story, hoping - that Vincent would turn out to be guilty. Perhaps there's nothing wrong per se in making Vincent innocent (although it does strike me as the less interesting path); but the WAY in which Niccol exonerates him is by pinning the crime on some other character who seems to have been chosen at random. They discover he's guilty because of some last-minute forensic evidence they ought to have spotted earlier. How convenient. And the extended investigation (good in itself) unfortunately allows Niccol to spend more time on his "sibling rivalry" subplot, which ought to have been dropped entirely.I'm making it sound bad, which it isn't. The nature of Vincent's quest (he simply wants to escape the Earth, even if, perhaps especially if, he dies), makes us want him to succeed, and the way in which he succeeds is worth watching. To say the film is poor social criticism is unfair: at its heart it's not social criticism at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a manager for AT&amp;T, fast-tracked for middle-management, and a volunteer fireman/EMT in my spare time. Then my genetic heart disease reared its ugly head, and everything changed. I am now disabled, and unable to work. What if I had known about this heart problem before I started with AT&amp;T or the fire department? I am positive I would have had a vastly different, much lower paying job, and probably no medical or disability benefits. Fortunately, I have great benefits. However, if genetic testing had been done by my employer, they would have seen this, and probably not hired or promoted me. That is life now. Gattaca shows the probable future outcome of current genetic testing. Let us be very careful of the road we are now traveling down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good effort (but could have been better)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gatacca is a different kind of sci-fi . It has no action but it describes a society of the near future . It is obvious that the filmmakers back in 1996 already knew about the soon-to-be-announced cloning and the revolutionary decodisation of DNA so this is not simply a prophecy-film (of a possible future) but a WARNING film for a time that we all going to live very soon . This society consists of the "valids" : genetically "engineered" people whose parents payed money to scientists and had the opportunity to have the perfect child . The valid 's genes were modified in that way , so the good characteristics (physical and mental) would be enhanced to maximum and the defective genes (like for diseases) would be erased to minimum (so the odds for e.g. a heart attack would be negligible .) . As a doctor says in the beginning " Not even 1000 natural conceives would be able to accomplish this result ". The basic story is focused on a base called Gattaca in which future astronauts are trained . Of course all of them are valids . Invalid people are strictly forbidden . The hero portrayed by Ethan Hawke is an invalid who wants to be an astronaut desperately . Of course the members of Gattaca undergo very frequent DNA controls . They have continuous blood or urea tests and there are DNA sensors which can instantly (with one touch on the skin) tell if a person is valid or invalid . Hawke however managed to trick the base with the association of a valid ex athlete who after a tragic accident is paralysed and stuck on a wheel chair . If you want to know how they managed this fraud then see the movie . I am afraid that there is no more to say . The direction and art direction are subtle . Ethan Hawke gives a solid performance . The whole atmosphere succeeds in giving the message 100% : the racistical distinction in a sort of Orwellish society . But unfortunately that is all . There is absolutely no plot. OK I understand that the intention was portraying a not too distant future and it was done perfectly .But movies always need a reliable plot . Don 't get me wrong I was not begging for action scenes , alien attacks or so . I was hoping for more dramatic tension or more details about the way these people lived .Vincent 's character should be analysed more . Jerome (Jude Law) easily steals the show as the handicapped athlete because he is the most interesting and reliable character . His psychological drama is fully developped . He was born to be perfect but fate (and luck) had other plans . Jude Law gives the most memorable performance of the film. Uma Thurman is awful here (and you should know I am a big fan of hers)She is the decorative love interest . This romance story along with a murder mustery sublot for which Hawke is a suspect and nearly be revealed as invalid , are hopeless tricks to fill the screen time (emphasising on the apparent lack of plot) . The whole package seems unfinished and sometimes boring . If it wasn 't for Vincent 's narration the second hour would have fallen flat . That is of course until the end where we have a family reunion . Gattaca was a nice try . It managed to be an independent movie with a message. But it could have been soooo better . It worths a look even for the ironic gag in the final scene . See it at least for Jude Law .GATTACA 7 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something for us all to think about</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gattaca was a movie I did not expect to like, however, when I saw it for the first time rather by accident, I was enthralled from the beginning to the end. As I watched it for the next dozen times over the next couple of months, I kept noticing more things that I liked about the movie.First, I liked the story. Genetic discrimination. How much more pertinent can you get? The real world is nearing the cusp of a new era, and genetic engineering is going to be one of the primary concerns. The way that Gattaca depicts genetic discrimination is something that is totally possible, and makes for a great basis.As I watched again, I realized how well the director did making the audience concentrate on what he wanted then to be concentrating on. There were some special effect in the movie, but they were so transparent, that I had to specifically look for them to see that they were there. This is something that I value highly in any movie. Obviously it detracts from any scene when you can see the visual discrepencies of a computer generated object. I could go on for hours raving about well done effects.Beyond the technical points of the movie, it was still a perfectly done piece. I enjoyed the character development. The acting was good, and never seemed contrived. The director did well to not include flashy futuristic gadgets that would have made the movie look gaudy. Since the story was nearly independent of what was on screen, the director decided to make everything with a minimalistic look, which was great for funneling the audience toward the characters. The characters, after all, were the crown jewel of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intelligent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a year where aliens (Men in Black), explosions (Face/Off, etc) and disasters (Titanic) were the things in the theatre, it is rather surprising that this movie, a small thoughtful science fiction that relied on story and not special effects, was made. Andrew Niccol has proved himself, with this and The Truman Show, to be one of the most imaginative writers around. His handling of this story is remarkable. Though a murder triggers the story, it seemingly has nothing to do with the plot. The cast is excellent. Ethan Hawke was the only choice for his role, and he plays it well. My favourite performance came from Jude Law, the delightfully acidic man who helps Hawke in his quest to become an accepted member of Gattaca. He plays the role with relish, like a person who is thoroughly enjoying sticking it to the system. Michael Nyman's score is awe-inspiring. It's worth watching the film for the haunting melody. It works completely in the film, and stands incredibly well by itself. How it was passed over by the Oscars remains a mystery. My #2 film for 1997.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an intelligent SF movie with an eye for ethics and perseverance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good direction, good acting, interesting visuals, intelligent plot, an ever-current topic in science and ethics, and a tribute to human perseverance. No explosions, gun fights, chases, or great conspiracies; no wonder it didn't do too well, and no wonder it rises into the best few SF movies of the decade. SF, here, means intelligent, thoughtful, and speculative, not blasters and aliens. Gattaca is a critical view of the possibilities of genetic science in the wrong hands. Pro-science and a technocrat to the heart, I still found the handling of the issue thoughtful and valid; it calls for caution, but it is not alarmist. The humane content - friendship and dedication - plays a major role without being forced.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Encore gives Gattaca 2 stars and I agree with them. The movie is stylistically beautiful but the characters and dialog and plot only work with convenient selective use of technology.Space travel and immediate blood DNA testing are available...but Jude Law only uses an old manual wheelchair. There are no PCs, no IPODS, cars are still basically the same combustion engines as we have now...there are no mass amounts of people...except when it is strangely convenient to need to construct a scene where the protagonist must run through cars on an interstate which exposes his poor eyesight...which means the female protagonist must park a convertible in a position where this is constructed.The list is endless. The characters are one week away from leaving for space for a long time and they do...what? Sit at a cubicle all day long and go to stylish events at night? Every set piece every where on the planet...even the alleyways...are immaculate. No one speck of dust. Not one person owns a pet.The concept of the story is there and many people are obviously willing to overlook the massive amounts of plot failures and wooden dialog required to make Gattace. This person can see through all the massive amount of convenient construction. Nice try, but really ridiculous. Blade Runner (directors cut without voice over) was the same basic conceptual story done in a different context and it was so much better</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...but also watch it critically</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found the film Gattaca interesting, but I think, that it is very important to watch the film with a critical view, because it is a warning for our whole society. In our future there shouldn't be bioformed children, because the negative aspects outbalance the positive aspects. Of course it is in some cases good to improve the genetical code, so that the person will not become ill. But Humans will not limit their possibilities. Everyone wants to be perfect and achieve more and more to become the best like Jerome. But that isn't possible. There can be only one person who is the best. So the movie shows us, that people will be under big pressure in the future, if there are bioformed people. Although some people in the movie are perfect, they aren't happy because a cold and impersonally atmosphere dominates and there will be big differences between bioformed and "normal" humans. The example of Vincent shows us that godchildren can achieve the same aims like "perfect" people, but they aren't accepted in Gattaca's Society. I think that's very alarming. A Godchild will not have a value in our world. That's what the movie shows us, but nevertheless i think, that many people will watch the movie to have fun. Maybe they like the exciting plot with its dangerous ideas and strange attitudes about life. So the creators of Sci-Fi-movies have to arrange the story in order to achieve their goals in a way of underlining the critical aspects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting Conceit Falls a Bit Short</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gattaca" is a more than usually intelligent sci-fi film that isn't quite done justice by its uneven script. The film obviously pays a debt to Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World," but "Gattaca" actually creates a somewhat more realistic vision of a future society than does Huxley's book. Here, parents are able to genetically engineer their children into perfection from birth, and while genetic discrimination is not legal, the process results in those with superior genes having available to them advantages that do not befall the genetic inferiors.As long as the script sticks to the pseudo-thriller plot that finds Ethan Hawke buying the genetic identity of Jude Law and then trying to cover up his fraud, the film is fairly engrossing. However, a story line involving sibling rivalry is handled very awkwardly and threatens to derail the picture about three-quarters of the way through, and a love story feels obligatory and only half-way developed. Still, the production design is stunning and almost worth sitting through just for its own sake, and a mostly engaging plot makes for a pretty entertaining film.Grade: B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disappointing. In places down right silly. In a future where humans are either born "naturally" or genetically engineered to be perfect, a young astronaut-in-training (Hawke), predestined to die in his early '30s, poses as one of the physical elite to achieve his dream of space travel. Not an unfamiliar theme but it did have promise. Science Fiction is suppose to strain your imagination but not believability. It just doesn't work. The blocks of the film come unglued because you just can't believe the methods. I didn't care for anyone for any reason. Just a waste of good film stock.

		<shortDescription>A good movie that could have easily been better... SPOILERS!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I liked the look of this film, the concept and the issues it raised. But, I got the feeling that a lot of it must have ended up on the cutting room floor. It seemed compressed in places where the plot could have used better development...1) They should have portrayed more fully the conflict that would have been created between the brothers after the young Vincent saved Anton? They led up to it, with Vincent showing his resentment of his brother's favoured status. But, after he rescued Anton, he just takes off, no apparent reason given. This rescue was the key to Vincent's attitude and the brothers' estrangement. Up until then Vincent was in his place as the underdog; resentful (because he was the older of the two but still weaker), but accepting (in his place). When the rescue occurs, everything changes. Vincent has proven to himself that he isn't deserving of his status as inferior and Anton would have never been able to accept that his 'weaker' brother had to rescue him. This new order of things could have drove the brother's apart, which would have better explained why Vincent leaves home... So why not focus more time on this 'post rescue' conflict?2) I thought right from the beginning of the murder investigation that Anton, recognizing his brother as the suspect, would try to throw the street wise detective Hugo off track. Doing so at first, because he wanted to confront Vincent on his own terms, outside of the law (for Vincent's abandonment of his family and to put him back in his place) and then, gradually trying to protect him (as the brother who had saved his life) as he eventually became aware that Vincent was not the murderer. All the while struggling with his own issues (he's my brother/I'm a cop, I love/hate him...) This would have made for a much more Shakespearean type of tragedy... and the interaction between Anton and the ever more suspicious detective would have made for even more suspense...3) Couldn't Irene's underutilized character been better used to add suspense to the story and her own resentment developed into making us wonder more about whether she would betray Vincent? This sub-plot was touched on, but also seemed truncated.4) Did an entire sub-plot with Earnest Borgnine get chopped? He could have been used as either an ally or foil to Vincent (and he would have been the only person at the space agency who knew who he was and he WOULD have recognized him). But, instead he barely registers.5) A final conflict/climax between the brothers was necessary (which would have been made all the more tragic by Vincent being unaware of Anton's help in thwarting his capture). But, did it have to be that lame rehashing of the swimming/rescue incident? Wasn't once enough? (and as pointed out by others, it stretched your ability to believe he could survive it, given his weak heart) Why not have the climax involve detective Hugo too, with Anton perhaps saving Vincent from exposure/capture (thus repaying the his rescue) and maybe even being mortally wounded in the process...All of the above suggestions/observations weren't things I dreamt up after the fact... It's one thing to come up with completely subjective improvements to a film after you've had time to dissect it... But, I was led by the film itself to believe these things might/should happen... That fact is another (very frustrating) thing altogether and I was a bit disappointed that the film seemed to take so many shortcuts just to reach a tidy conclusion in the allotted time...sluggo</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually impressive but intellectually disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went in to this film with no prior knowledge of what it was about (no easy task in this day and age of give the farm away trailers and a constant barrage of TV propaganda clips). I generally found the plot absorbing for at least the first 45 minutes, but it tended to drag a lot and was rather predictable once you got the gist of what was going on. Ethan Hawke as the lead was immensely boring and monotonic, Uma Thurman as the romantic interest was not much better. Jude Law walked away with the picture in the acting department and the art direction took second honors with a view of a squeaky-clean regimented future. I think the best part of the film was the opening titles actually. There were many plot absurdities and nonsensical aspects to this view of a possible future which detracted from the overall impression as well, but nothing any more absurd than the resolution in ID4 :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's the Code Kenneth?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are several distinct types of science fiction. Probably the least interesting is the type that identifies one single thread or idea from current society and then performs extreme extrapolation into a future so we can see the results, usually negative. You can do this two ways, either to extrapolate everything else in society into the future world, creating a complex futureworld fabric.Or you can be lazy, or in the case of films cheap, and just extrapolate that one thing. In this case, everything else stays the same. Same elevators, food and so one. That's what we get here. There is no future, and actually some of the extrapolation is into the past as in the 50's style corporate suits.So we end up with some really unbalanced plot devices that hamstring the story and blunt the effect. For instance is it likely that DNA will be checked just to get into the building, especially by drawing blood? Already, we have relatively cheap biometrics that are more accurate than DNA.Is it likely that there would not be equally extensive psychological profiling and brain monitoring?The point is that this is poor scifi, on top of being less than excellent in other respects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Took me a long time to get around to seeing Gattaca, but as its reputation has improved with age, I bumped it my list. After watching it, I'm not sure why I did that. The film certainly looks great and director Andrew Niccol has an assured visual style, especially for a first-time director. But the script is bad, laughingly so at times. Some of the dialogue between Ethan Hawke and Jude Law is oaken. And Hawke seems to misread the tone more than once, but his appeal has always eluded me and watching Gattaca didn't change that assessment. Stronger performances would have made the plot, which has more holes than a pitch and putt, easier to digest. There is a great film to be made about the ethical questions Gattaca raises, questions which date back to Huxley, but the folks involved here weren't up to the task.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gatta-ca n he get up?Andrew Niccol's movie Gattaca from 1997 is a future based drama and science - fiction film with Ethan Hawke (string as Vincent Freedom), Uma Thurman (string as Jrene Cassini), Jude Law (string as Jerome Eugene) and Loren Dean (string as Anton Freeman)witch lasts 101 minutes. The story is about a man, who wouldn't be allowed to go up to space as himself with his heart illness and other usability, handicaps, talking, taking over another identity, this way he'll be able to realize his dream. It's a pretty good plot in my opinion because many things like future technology and architecture play a huge roll in this movie. But also a conflict between two different kinds of people causes a split ten society. There are "godchilds" with mental or physical illnesses, and valid people with a minimum risk of these illnesses. Because of that the in-valid people have to do other jobs, very bad jobs, compared with valid-people. But some e parts of the movie are not completely catching. Also a love story between the two main-characters is included but it does not bring a better plot. At some point it's a normal movie, easy to understand and follow, which makes it a bit boring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>to quote one of the other reviewers, one Katherine: "the part of Uma Thurman is so slender you can't see it if it stands sideways"yet she is giving top billingEthan Hawke - Uma Thurman - GattacaMore correct: Ethan Hawke - Jude Law - GattacaI bought the DVD for Uma Thurman. I was immediately disappointed by the cold, somber look. It took like forever for Uma to thaw out and let her hair down and then all of a sudden the movie got watchable for a while. But only for a while. Okay, so the movie has a message. Got it. But so what? The thing is kind of a dork. Yeah, I was struggling for the right word, but that's it.Pardon me, I wanted Uma. Instead I got Jude Law. Blegh! What there was of Uma, took a while to come out properly, but it was worth the wait (and the wait was ******g terrible what with baby-faced Jude and all)I had only seen the TV spot of GATTACA all those years ago, and I suppose it must obviously have included that Ethan- dragging-Uma-by-the-hand-down-the-back-alley scene and that was what I had build my expectations upon. The movie itself is of course a far, far cry from this one well-filmed scene.I'm sorry, however inspirational the message might be, this is a boring tedious mostly cold fish. Unattractive in most places. Uma does transform majestically, yeah, but the movie doesn't.It doesn't!It might have a warm heart (only because of its message), but it doesn't!Remains a belly-up stinking cold fish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exposition Handled Sloppily</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Gattaca' was another film I essentially knew nothing about when going into it, apart from the fact that it explores 'genetic engineering'... and that Ethan Hawke stars along Uma Thurman in it. Therefore, once again, my initial sceptical feelings evolved around whether 'Gattaca' will undertake a profound and simultaneously candid approach to such an elaborate and thought-provoking topic, or whether it will take itself too seriously to the point where it becomes cringeworthy. Unfortunately, the film became 'messy' throughout and felt moderately pretentious, and thus ultimately leaning towards the latter approach.First and foremost, I want to go on record by stating that I praise the film for what it attempts to explore; 'Gattaca' is woven with intriguing themes and topics throughout, as well as arguably some nice social commentary. However, despite Ethan Hawke's great acting as the protagonist of the film, the exposition and development of his actual character feels rushed and slightly forced; Niccol manages to provide just enough information for us to be somewhat invested in his story, but not enough to be truly affected by it. Furthermore, the 'technology' and 'laws' that surround the film's plot seem too unrealistic, which also makes the film feel dated. Yes, I acknowledge that one of the possible points of the film is to ask the audience questions and thus provide the potential social commentary... essentially providing the "what if..?" scenario. However, for me personally, the unrealistic circumstances made me less attentive to the film's message.Although, as mentioned previously, the themes explored as well as the overall plot are engaging enough to make for a decent watch. Additionally, Jude Law's character is greatly compelling throughout, his acting doesn't disappoint either and towards the end of the film creates praiseworthy suspense. The final act of the film is indeed the film's biggest achievement; it is continuously enticing and simultaneously nerve-racking in parts. Unfortunately, the actual exposition and development leading up to the final act felt like it was handled 'sloppily'. There is not much point in mentioning Uma Thurman's character, as she honestly doesn't contribute to the film's plot significantly apart from added and unnecessary "love" conflict. To conclude, 'Gattaca' is a mediocre approach to a great idea; it still manages to be an entertaining watch overall but never reaches its full potential. It stands as a simply decent Sci-Fi film, nothing 'special' although it tries to be just that... I would recommend it for simple enjoyment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>compelling premise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "the not-too-distant future", eugenics has segregated society. Valids are people born from genetic manipulation. Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke) was born as what's derisively known as invalid with only a life expectancy of 30 and a second class life. His younger brother Anton is born with genetics help and exceeds him in every way. The last time he races Anton, he rescues Anton from the sea. After that, he runs away and eventually works as a janitor at Gattaca Aerospace Corporation. German (Tony Shalhoub) is a criminal dealer in genetic identities and Jerome Morrow (Jude Law) is a paralyzed valid. With Jerome's genetic samples and surgeries, Vincent starts impersonating Jerome in order to move ahead and finally travel into space. When the mission director gets killed, Vincent becomes a top suspect while he's scheduled to launch. Co-worker Irene Cassini (Uma Thurman) becomes interested in him.The premise is terrific like a great Twilight Zone story. It's a bit slow in the first half. It needs to be tightened. The style is a throwback without much CGI or unnecessary flash. I do have a couple of questions. Do genetic enhancements make people dress the same? Also wouldn't they get the ID immediately after finding his hair? It seems like a society that keeps track of those kinds of information. The acting is solid although it's a lot of stone faced work anyways. Overall, this is a solid effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tempering Technology with Wisdom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gattaca addresses an important topic for our times and it explores this topic masterfully, which makes it all the more unfortunate of the perspective that the film takes.I have worked coaching athletes for my entire adult life. In my expert opinion, it is obvious to me, and I assume to the general population also, that there are 2 kinds of people: those who are genetically gifted but motivationally challenged and those who are genetically average but highly motivated. Either one has an equal chance for success and they both have challenges to overcome.The storyline of Gattaca is a direct and clear-cut exploration of genetics versus motivation. The film skillfully illustrates the faulty thinking that genetics are everything. Genetics are important, but they are certainly not the only factor in deciding the worth of a person. The future society portrayed in Gattaca discarded this notion and we, as the audience, benefited from observing their failure.This film would be a masterpiece if it had stayed with simply exploring genetics versus motivation, but sadly this was not the case. Gattaca also disparages the pursuit of genetic improvement. Reducing or eliminating hereditary diseases is not something to belittle. Genetic manipulation can certainly go to far, but using our technology wisely is the key. If only Gattaca focused on this, then we would all have been the wiser.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not my cup of tea</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, in Honors Biology, my teacher announced we we're going to watch this movie. (Since we are in the DNA unit) Teacher said: "This movie was a flop at the box office"....already I was worried. What the movie basically plays off as, is a romance-drama slash murder mystery. I do not sense an entire lot of "sci-fi" within the movie. The movie opens with an un-needed 35 minute flashback/life story of our main character. To me, I like how they based the movie around his backstory, however, it was dragged out for too long. Other than that, when the murder-mystery subplot enters the movie, to me, it lags, and doesn't keep up a fast pace, and is pretty slow moving. At certain points, Uma Thurmann even seemed like a character just added for time, it could have done without random romance scenes between her and Ethan Hawke. Towards the end, the movie offers decent twists and turns with characters, Ernest Borgnine does a solid job as the mission director (Sadly, his screen time does not amount to a lot). Overall, I was expecting more of a science fiction movie, and basically what it is, is a romance/drama. Only go into this if you're a fan of romance and/or drama movies. Sci-fi is pretty lackluster here.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gattaca is an interesting movie that takes place in the future and has a crazy story. This film offers a lot of action and romantic scenes. Gattaca is directed by Andrew Nicol and released in 1997. It deals with a story of a young man named Vincent, who would like to become an astronaut and his dream was to fly into the space. He has a life expectation of 30 years because of heart problems.Vincent was naturally born and not with a perfectly changed DNA like most of the other people in future. And because his heart problems isn't he able to work in the spaceshuttle center. So Vincent takes the identity of the athlete Jerome to work in his dream job. At work he fells in love with the woman Irene. In these situations Vincent sometimes gets in complicated situations and has to improvise. Finally I can say that this is an all around film that offers 1.30 hours action, dramatic and romantic and a really interesting story. So this film is absolutely worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are looking for a good film which contains a mix out of exciting action and touching romance scenes, to watch you definitely should watch "Gattaca". "Gattaca" is a future film directed by Andrew Niccol and released in 2005. It tells the story of a young man named Vincent who has a life expectation of about 30 years because of heart problems. But his younger brother Anton is healthy and always better in everything because his patten's selected his DNA when he was born. This approach is something normal and common in the future. Vincent always wanted to work in a space shuttle center but also knew that they will not take him because of his physical conditions.This film is surely worth seeing if you like science fiction films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's all in the genes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the not too distant future most children are created in vitro having been genetically screened to ensure they are of the highest quality mentally and physically; those few who are born the old fashioned way are destined to live menial lives as they are unable to pass the genetic tests required to get any good job? even though such testing is officially illegal. Vincent Freeman is one of these 'God-Children'; as a child he dreamt of going to the stars and as an adult he got a job at Gattaca, the agency responsible for space exploration? as a cleaner. One day though that changes; he meets a man who puts him in contact with Jerome Morrow; Jerome is perfect; just the sort of person Gattaca wants; it is just too bad he is paraplegic. For a fee Jerome will provide Vincent with the various samples he will need to fool Gattaca's stringent ID systems. Having taken Jerome's identity Vincent starts working at Gattaca. He fools the systems for some time; then shortly before his dream is to become true there is a murder at Gattaca and a sweep of the crime scene finds one of his eyelashes? one of Vincent's not one of Jerome's. The police are soon looking everywhere for him? except in among the perfect elite workforce. Eventually though they start to look even there; Vincent must hope they don't find him or find the real killer before he is launched into space and far beyond the long arm of the law.This is an enjoyable science fiction film that even those who don't usually like science fiction can enjoy; it isn't full of techno-babble? all we really need to know is that genetic scans are routine and there is a prejudice against those that aren't quite perfect; in this world genetic screening as replaced eugenics as the way to create 'perfect' children. While there is a murder this isn't really a whodunit; it is about whether Vincent will get away with being somebody he isn't. Vincent is a good protagonist; a man who is forced to be obsessed with cleanliness in a sterile looking world where imperfection would keep him in a menial job even though he has the skills for the task. Ethan Hawke does well in this roll although I thought Jude Law did even better as Jerome; the scene where he drags himself up the stairs is exhausting just to watch. Uma Thurman does a good job as Irene Cassini; Vincent's co-worker and love interest. Other notable performances come from Gore Vidal and Ernest Borgnine. Writer/Director Andrew Niccol did a great job creating a world which is modern in a sterile way yet has old fashioned touches such as the policemen wearing '50s style hats. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to people who enjoy serious science fiction or just want something a little different.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Beautiful Penis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With all due respect to Ron Howard and John Nash, that could be the subtitle of this movie. For it is that randomly endowed aspect of the protagonist's genetically "imperfect" body that probably ultimately saved him. Ethan Hawke, at 27, was arguably at the peak of his own physical (and sexual) prowess when he made this movie in 1997 (and found in costar Uma Thurman the mother of his own first set of randomly generated spawn). The admiration for Hawke's character's junk induced in the doctor/lab tech who regularly observed and tested his "borrowed" urine would ironically pay off in the end, when this same corporate functionary looked the other way after Hawke's character got caught without his genetically engineered sponsor's pee during a random test right before he was to blast off for Titan.Despite the veiled and not so veiled references (in a movie featuring the late Gore Vidal, no doubt) to penis size, it was probably this white coat's homo-erotic attraction to Hawke's character, as much as his admiration for Hawke's ability to overcome his genetically assumed fate through sheer Nietzschean will that lead him to smile and tell Hawke, "You'll miss your flight," after he failed the pee test and revealed his true identity. As far as this man is concerned, Hawke had already revealed enough of his "right stuff" to warrant being given a chance at fulfilling his dream of space flight, despite his state sanctioned biological shortcomings.This movie is interesting, but its view of a potential eugenics dystopia is typical fantasy. Do you think a society so advanced that any genetic imperfection could be removed from lab generated babies could not, also, using advanced stem cell, or other therapy, cure the accidental paralysis of Hawke's genetically perfect sponsor? Also, how can you account for the almost universal access to this technology? Hawke's parents appear to be folks of modest means, yet they can easily make a "designer" child out of his younger brother?The reality with this sort of thing, if it ever comes into being, is that in a Randian society like ours, it will only be available to the very rich for generations at best, then afterwards the upper middle classes, but never everyone, unless government policy (and money) ala National Socialism promote it as a universal method of procreation (and only then likely for certain government approved ethnic or existing socioeconomic groups).And certainly the premise (reinforced by comments from Hawke's penile admirer in the conclusion while discussing his own "perfect" son) is that this method of making babies may not be all it is cracked up to be.Do you think a society where a large segment of the people can choose the traits of their children will, in the end, be one composed of hardy souls able to adapt to whatever fate may throw at them? Or easily resist conquest from a society of folks who make babies the old fashioned way?If thoroughbred horses are any example, people is this type of society will likely be very beautiful, never bald, mostly blonde, everyone will play the piano like a virtuoso, and they will all be fragile. I doubt, in the end, their technology would save them from the barbarians at the gates, or their own underclasses. But, of course, that is the point of this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plenty to like in a flawed film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally had a chance to see Gattaca yesterday and it was not a waste of my time. Sure, the story has several flaws. It just isn't very convincing as a plea against genetic selection, as the point is not very strongly made. The brother versus brother plot is not very interesting and gets more and more far fetched as the film continues, up to the superfluous and rather pathetic final swimming contest. Those dudes aren't tired, they don't even look like they know what that is. Also, the parallel events of the lift-off and the suicide are too predictable and poorly executed. There's more that isn't altogether right, but hey, it's a story and there were good points too.I liked the love story. Even if it's just because I like to think of Uma Thurman in love with, well, anybody. Why not me then, eh? I liked these two people, I hoped everything would turn out alright for them and I hoped neither of them committed the murder. After all, i wouldn't like to be rooting for the bad guy/girl. I liked the cars, too. I liked the idea that, if we build electric cars, why not have 'em look like the prettiest cars ever made? Like the Citroen DS (I had me one of those, the first car I ever drove. It was great, the bent windscreen, the dash, the standing accelerator pedal, fourth pedal for the parking brake, the turning headlights, the steering column shifter. Wow, what a car.), the Rover p6 or the Studebaker Avanti. The field with mirrors for solar power was also pretty good and I liked the fact that the she-character thought of it as beautiful. I like to look that way at windmills myself, even those stupid modern things.That said, the film also looks great. I was going to say it looks real, but then I thought of the detectives in trench coats and hats and I thought, no, real is not the right word. It looks good, it looks like a world you can accept for real. Something that is presented you, that you can project your own thoughts onto. That's no mean feat.I thought the acting was great throughout, from Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman dancing to the guy in the wheelchair struggling up the winding stair case (well, he was out of his wheelchair there). Only, why did the other guy suddenly appear in the downstairs room? Where the heck did he come from? I didn't know Gore Vidal could act, but he does a fine job as the director.As to the general plot, should or should we not develop an improved human being, it is interesting to note that in the same year this film came out in Europe, Michel Houellebecq, the french author, published his great novel 'The elementary particles'. In it, he states in a rather dry manner that we will choose to do so. According to Houellebecq, it's even the only way out of our current predicament of chaos, wars and general misery. The film unwittingly makes rather the same statement. I mean, who wouldn't choose to be part of that elite group, live longer and healthier and be part of a safer and sounder system? (eh, does anybody notice how the women select their partners these days? Talk about ruthlessness... ) As I said, the film is rather ambiguous and can't (or won't) choose between dystopia or utopia.So, all in all, though the film is flawed, it's actually the flaws that contribute to making it a thought-provoking, sympathetic film. Seven stars for that. Why not more stars? Well, there's the brother thing. Also, I find that payoff 'I never saved anything for the swim back' quite excruciating. On the other hand, I just read a review of somebody with major birth defects who says the film is important because it sends the message that the improbable isn't impossible. And then I know the story of Neil Young and his kids, especially Ben. Alright then, eight stars it'll be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are some qualified actors (there's Mrs. Thurman, in another good role; Jude Law, who absolutely and astonishingly dominates the cast;--and of course there're also the cameos, Borgnine, Arkin, Vidal?very noticeable ?) in this ambitious, classy, good?looking Sci?Fi movie; I have found the lead character entirely dis-likable, and possibly also tritely acted. For Vincent?Anton, I would of liked Pitt or, in another epoch, the young Delon; someone more slick and charming. Jude Law is, on the other hand, the one who does a wonderful, astounding job. His role is truly iconic; and it's not that he was favored by the script ;he simply is a distinguished, inspired actor. Borgnine is ,if I may say so, again typecast. Arkin is good and like a hound. Again, it is Law who simply dominates the set; a fascinating performance, and exquisite. Some consider this movie to be overly clever and ingenious; I have found it, on the very contrary, rather conventional. Yet, for my dear readers' sake, I should be fair: GATTACA is impressing, moving, very touching?mainly due to Jude Law's unusually intense and striking, even astonishing performance.Jude Law, a superior actor, achieves this surprising thing, that he turns his Jerome into the real leading character of GATTACA.He gives charm, depth, humanity and coherence to his character. Law is unexpectedly good. Hawke tries a sort of a Dickensian character, but the script was not such as to allow this.</fullReview>

It's metaphors are poetic, the game of chicken between the two brothers, Jerome travelling in the incinerator, where his medal turns to gold, Vincent's relationship with his brother.The art direction is very clever. Gattaca doesn't show us a whole new world, just a modified version of our own. It uses existing architecture and design to create a futuristic look. Its all very subtle and everything is implied. Brlliant.As a movie it is superb, acting, special effects, writing etc, all superb, at the end of the movie you'll feel that it doesn't really matter. Its purpose is to deliver a message, which is has done and done well. It really didn't have much special effect, which will certainly bore some, but it shows that it wants to evoke a feeling that differs from excitement for once; it wants to get you thinking.The only reason this film has collected dust for so long is because people are scared. They're scared of what this means, they're scared to think and most of all they're scared to admit that this could happen. Simply sublime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the top five greatest films ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No movie has ever depicted the power of the human will and ones desire to persevere through impossible odds better than Gattaca. In a spiritually bankrupt and genetically perverse future, Vincent (Ethan Hawke) is determined to overcome all odds made possible by genetic profiling in a world that tells him he is unfit and inferior. Does he have what it takes to succeed, or is he what his genetics say he is; an undeniable failure? The acting is a bit dry save ( Jude Law's character Jerome). The environment is neutral for a futuristic sci-fi film. A good idea if you ask me since this film will retain re-playability for years to come without feeling comedic like other futuristic sci-fi movies that were over the top in their portrayal of the future. The story would be nearly flawless had it not been for the consistent extraordinary circumstances Vincent seems to luckily overcome due to laughable police work at the Gattaca facility. It seems that law enforcement is "Genetically stupid" in the Gattaca future. But the Visual Effects, the Climax of the story, the character tie-ins, environment, soundtrack, editing and direction is tops and makes this film a rare gem that makes you pay homage to the creativity of the human mind regardless of film budget. 9 1/2 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good sci-fi movie ,with an excellent cast including Ethan Hawke,Uma Thurman ,Jude Law (Eu-gene got it?),Alan Arkin and Borgnine.Strange how Hawke took Law's name as Damon would do later in "the talented MIster Ripley" .Vincent has a dream but the world he lives in is an inhuman nightmarish world where everyone is checked .Look at those men and women when they walk along endless corridors.They all look alike,they make me think of robots ,it looks like Lang's "Metropolis"(1926) .The hackneyed subject of the Cain/Abel bros is completely renewed here and the best scenes are perhaps the day and the night swimming.The last pictures are very poetic,dreamy and moving (I'm setting off on a journey too,says Law).This is a must for fans of clever sci-fi.Influenced by Lucas' "THX1138 " ,"Logan's run" ,Niccol succeeds in making a wholly original work,which sustains suspense (and emotion) till the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is simply no word that adequately describes the excellence of "Gattaca". Ask me for the best science fiction movie ever made, and I will not name "Star Wars" or "2001:A Space Odyssey", but instead this film. Ethan Hawke burst on to the scene as Vincent, a naturally conceived child in a world of "designer babies". Due to his imperfect genetic status, he cannot win the woman of his dreams (a slinky Uma Thurman, who met future hubby Hawke on the set), nor his desired job as an astronaut for the Gattaca Aerospace Corporation. Desperate, Vincent uses the aid of a "Blood Broker" (the delectable Tony Shalhoub) to help him switch identities with a genetically superior paraplegic named Jerome (Jude Law, simply brilliant in his breakout role). But a Gattaca official is murdered, dreams are endangered....Rarely does a movie come along that is superbly acted, eye-poppingly designed, and intensely thought-provoking. No wonder director Andrew Niccol (nor any other) can't top this milestone in filmaking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why does Jerome give Vincent his hair in the end?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a question: Why does Jerome (real one, Jude Law) give Vincent (Ethan Hawke) a lock of his (Jerome) hair in the end? I can see many possible reasons (friendship, genetic material, etc) but none of those reasons are "clicking" with me. Is it because that way he's taking a bit of Jerome himself into space? But then why would he say "don't open it until you're up there?" As a token of friendship it also falls rather flat ; I mean the guy had two lifetimes worth of blood from Jerome already. I'm not sure if there is something hugely symbolic that I'm missing. I thought maybe since Jerome incinerates himself that it's a piece he will have, but again that doesn't make sense when Vincent already has two lifetimes worth of body samples from Jerome. Perhaps I'm reading too much into it, but it seems odd that the director who paid attention to everything else would not to this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Most Intelligent Films Ever Made!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gattaca is about a man named Vincent Freeman. He was born as an "in-valid" which means he is not a genetically modified human as his brother is. Ever since Vincent was a kid, he had a dream of going into space. However, Vincent was born with a 99% chance of getting a heart condition. This meant that Vincent's dream of going into space was not possible. He met a man named Jerome Morrow. This guy does not have any defects of any kind. So Vincent and Jerome work together and succeed in turning Vincent into Jerome Morrow. His dream was now possible. However, after the murder of the mission director, Vincent accidentally leaves an eyelash at the scene! So to elude capture, Vincent must take special precautions in order for him to continue pursuing his dream of going into space. With the authorities hot on his tail, Vincent must make some tough decisions to keep him from getting caught and quite possibly be taken away from his dream which lays just off in his horizon.Gattaca in my opinion, is the best sci-fi thriller of 1997. It combines characteristics such as action, suspense, and some good science and is all wrapped up into this truly enjoyable bundle. Even though this is a Hollywood movie, it has some great science which can be used in so many different ways. I watched this movie in science class today and let me tell you, this movie was a great asset to what we were learning about in class. I actually learned almost as much about DNA in this movie as I did in class!! Ethan Hawke, who plays Vincent Freeman/the fake Jerome Morrow, gives us an amazing performance in this film. He should have won the Oscar for best actor in 1997. Since seeing this movie, I truly appreciate Ethan Hawke much more than what I used to. I have discovered that he is an amazing actor and I will definitely remind myself to buy/rent more movies in which he stars in.The director of this film, Andrew Niccol, does an amazing job at directing this film. I believe this man should have got the best director Oscar for this film. It boggles my mind that this film is the first film in which he directed!! This is a sign of what's to come. I believe Andrew Niccol will become the next big thing in Hollywood. He certainly has gotten off to a great start!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A future dystopia that doesn't quite go far enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gattaca remains one of my favorite movies years after I first viewed it. The idea that we could screen people based on their genetic predispositions is fine, and that we could genetically enhance people at the moment of conception is great. While the "feel good" idea that Ethan Hawke's character can overcome all his obstacles just through the force of his will may be great for Hollywood, I think it far more likely that pharmaceutical companies will develop ways to enhance people after they're born.Look at physical competition, why is "doping" against the rules? One of the arguments is that then we'd only be testing chemicals against each other, but aren't we already just testing training and genetics against each other? So Gattaca proposes a world where the rules are fixed at birth. How would physical competition work in the world of Gattaca? When two runners ran a race, wouldn't we just be testing who had the better geneticist at birth? In the end, Gattaca asks the time-honored question, "Do we have freewill, or are our paths fixed at the moment of birth?" That question has been around since Greek tragedy. In fact, at times Ethan Hawke's character reminds me of Orestes, wrestling with both inner demons and outer ones, in the form of the Furies.</fullReview>

Although the story is not that impressive, it doesn't need to be, it would have distracted, and the theme was adequately sympathetic. The yearning for a better life and the simultanously putting of the motifs 'nobody's perfect' and 'everything seemingly perfect is flawed', totally works for me.Everybody should see this one, and not only Ethan's fans, even if he's very cool.

It touches in a way most films don't and is very subtle. It doesn't act as a shout out loud Sci-fi but a very important one, keeping questions on the increasing use of genetics, and the uplifting moral of human spirit, bottom line to get all the touches and understand it completely you need to watch it twice through, I think it is underrated beyond belief and recommend anyone to watch it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Normally I'm not into Sci-Fi, but because this movie got such a high rating on this website (7.5/10 at the time), I already had it on my 'To See'-list for quite some time. A couple of days ago, it was finally shown on television and I didn't have to think twice about watching it or not. I gave it a try, willing to be surprised by it.Vincent is one of the last babies that were born out of love and who was never selected to become a disease free, super intelligent, extremely good looking, long living man. He needs glasses and is believed to die at the age of 30, which makes it impossible for him to build up a career in space traveling. Society only wants the best and most perfect humans and discriminates all those with lesser genes, but Vincent outsmarts them by assuming the identity of Jerome, a near perfect man who got crippled in an accident. No-one knows about his true identity and trough studying hard, he almost reaches his goal: a manned mission to Saturn. But then the mission director is killed and evidence of a 'lesser' and unauthorized human is found near the body. Now Vincent has to avoid the police and pass even more tests that monitor his health and entire life without knowing who to trust and trying to avoid getting caught in order to fulfill his dreams...Despite the fact that I'm not a Sci-Fi fan, I must say that I liked this movie. That has a lot to do with the relevance of the story. Today almost all you here in news items about the scientific world are DNA and gene-related. This isn't just an impossible story, this is something that could really happen in the future. Selecting babies in function of their capabilities, discrimination because of your genes,... It might be closer to reality than what we would like to believe and that sense of reality is something that really appealed to me in this movie. Also more than OK is the acting. With people like Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, Jude Law,... they had a very promising and talented cast, but as we all know, that's still no guarantee for success. This time however it worked and together they lifted this movie to a higher level. It's thanks to the interesting and well-written story that these good actors did such a nice job. The one can't exist without the other and that's something that many Hollywood directors still don't seem to have understood. Andrew Niccol has though and he has made a very fine movie out of it. I give it a well deserved 7/10.</fullReview>

But in my opinion the possibility of a world similar to Gattaca's society is not probably. I think that human mankind will not permit a society structured like this. Also because movies like Gattaca show us the negative aspects and let us think about philosophical and ethical Problems connected with our future.

We think it's good to watch "Gattaca", if you know some background information about genetic technologies. Although the film was published in the year 1997, the plot is still actual today, because genetic engineering becomes more and more important in our life.

		<fullReview>Gattaca is a quite interesting movie that deals with serious future-society problems, especially the discrimination against less perfect people, in this case the natural born ones. It tells the story of Vincent who is an inferior one caused by his high probability of getting a deadly heart-disease at the age of thirty, so he's forced to do low-class work though he's very talented and skilled (Even more than his genetic perfect brother). His dream is to get into Gattaca, a space-center, and fly to the stars but because of his genetic profile he is, as an "invalid", not healthy enough to get a job there, except cleaning the toilets. So he gets a fake ID, including blood samples and stuff. It works till a director of Gattaca is murdered and detectives find an eye-lash of Vincent who's from now on the main suspect.

In a world where the very DNA structure of your genes are currency.Built to Order... One step closer to God. Perfection? How would this affect you?

		<fullReview>I am guilty of not seeing this movie yet, but I have finished reading the script just moments ago. You can bet I'll be renting it soon. I feel very comfortable giving this movie a top-notch grade before a viewing because the story strongly parallels Victor Hugo's, 'Les Miserables', which is my favorite novel of all time. Andrew Niccol even names one of his characters Detective Hugo. Whether coincidence or not, both stories address the struggles of a protagonist who painstakingly covers his tracks to protect his true identity. In Jean Valjean's case, he is a convict masquerading as mayor. For Jerome Morrow, he's hiding his "in-valid" status and desperately trying to secure his position as a first-class astronaut. For anyone interested in reading movie scripts, Mr. Niccol doesn't disappoint. It reads more like a short story than your typical screenplay, something a writer/director can get away with since he's shooting it. For any Victor Hugo fans, I strongly recommend a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>great, great movie....... too magnificent..... fabulous..... amazing..... if u like futuristic movies, this will b you are one not 2 b missed..... deals with issues of discrimination etc........ Ethan Hawke n Uma Thurman r a great pair..... their chemistry on screen is good.......... enjoy, have fun..... meaningful values has been included in this movie...... amazing 2 see how Ethan Hawke's character escape the whole web of mess without killing himself int he process. This movie makes us aware of the constant rivalry that exists between siblings and that we are always fighting for attention and love from our parents in life. Regardless whether in our studies, physical appearances, social life. This movie shows something a little bit of extreme but it is just to exaggerate how frightening is it for it to happen. A brother has his parents affections due to his carefully chosen genetic perfections over his brother who is born naturally but is considered by the society as someone who has disease and does not meet the requirements of the superior society. Ultimately, the society wants a create a superior race of itself by ostracizing and isolating those natural born. I love a quote from this movie, "There is no gene for fate", we can't control our destiny, we could only determine our way of leading our lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant story and beautifully pieced together</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a person who is sick of underdog movies, sick of clichés and all that jazz. When I was told about Gattaca it sounded like some cheesy Sci-Fi thriller, like any other movie. We watched the beginning of the film during biology, and I was compelled to finish it. I could give a detailed plot summary, but there are other faculties on this website that can do that. Gattaca is beautifully written and brilliantly directed. Ethan Hawke gives a stellar performance as Jerome/Vincent, conveying the stress of his situation in his eyes and forehead, while passing off an aura of perfection like the rest of the characters. Jude Law, using his own accent for once, gives a convincing and heartfelt performance as Jerome/Eugene. Thurman was not quite as good, but her performance, especially near the end, is one of her best. The story is genius, with me on the edge of my seat. You have to force your way through the first half an hour, which is far easier if you are a scientist, but after that it is smooth sailing. There are incredible twists and turns and you get a sense that Spielberg lifted a few ideas from this for Minority Report. But the movie is not about the action, it's about how an underdog can play at perfection. It didn't feel like a Cinderella Story, it felt almost real. It was reassuring, but captivating nonetheless. The music follows the movie through resonating in every scene giving a feeling of hope, yet despair at the same time. I cannot recommend this movie enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gattaca is the a futuristic story about a new kind of prejudice. In a world where everyone is engineered before birth, a child who is born in old fashioned way stands little to no chance of success in life. Vincent plans to change all that. He was born with a something like a 95% chance of heart failure by the age of 30. His dream of traveling into space is something everyone considers impossible for him. Since he knows he will never get into the space program Gattaca, he seeks other illegal ways around the system. Considered an outcast, he embodies everything that the human race has lost and needs to regain in this adaption of the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time i saw this i enjoyed it, but did not appreciate the depth of it until a 2nd or 3rd viewing. Essentially the film is about the dying spirit of humanity, in a world in which people are defined by a statistic. Ethan Hawkes character (Vincent) is a man amongst automatons, one of the last of a dying breed in a relentlessly scientific dystopia. Cleverly, those such as Vincent who are born without the aid of genetic modifications are called 'godchilds'; for it is essentially a belief in something more than genetics which precedes their existence. The film skillfully balances a number of themes such as faith, friendship and a emotionally resonant picture of a possible future. As a viewer you share in Vincents dream in the same way Jude Laws character does and yearn for his escape to the uncertainty of space in which nothing is predetermined.The acting is of a high standard amongst the entire cast but it is Jude Law who excels in his portrayal of the tragic Eugene, he perfectly balances the superiority complex of his character while remaining likable and a subject of pity. The musical score perfectly captures the ambiance of the of the environment while soulfully embracing Vincents hopes and the heart of his humanity. The sets and cinematography are excellent. The writing and original concept are what is truly worth watching the film for.I recommend most highly especially to the patient intelligent viewer. 9/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What does the title mean?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to see this film because of its mysterious title. Did it refer to GATT and the WTO? -- a totally globalized world where people are ants under the thumb of "market" forces and those who manipulate them? It was intriguing to think that someone had surreptitiously created such a timely and prescient expose.Eight years later, I finally saw the film on HBO last week. While it was a centrally controlled world, I still don't really know what "Gattaca" is named for. Is it GATT? Alternatively, perhaps it has some connection with the four parts of DNA (G-A-C-U or whatever), which seem suggested by letters on the Vincent's ID. Does anyone know? I thought this film had a lot of charm, unlike so many films today, and I would have liked it to have been still more widely seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gattaca is by far the best futuristic movie I have ever seen(if not the best movie ever). One of the reasons I like it so much is for it's somewhat old fashion style. I have heard other people criticize the movie for that, but I think it works great. I loved the movie the whole time I was watching it but I was worried that as happens in many movies that start out good, something was going to wreck this movie. After watching it I can say that I wouldn't change one thing. It amazes me that this movie is not among the best 10 let alone the best 250. The cast is great. The story is great. The screenplay is great and the directing is great. It may be my favorite movie of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whenever someone asks me the inevitable question of what is my favorite movie of all time more times than not GATTACA is always the first film to come to mind. The aristocratic Jude Law practically made this movie for me as without him the captivating cinematography, excellent acting and transcendent story would of all have not been as engaging without his performance.This movie speaks to my soul because I myself was born with a terminal condition that would keep me from being all that I would want to be in a future like that. But what some other people seem to miss is that Niccol wasn't being literal in his depiction of a discriminating future based on genes. He chose to use DNA because all human beings would be susceptible to the bleak future he painted for the "God Children". Niccol was probably more speaking about the discrimination that already exist in our society and how it parallels to the actual events of the movie allowing more people to open their minds. Skin Color, Creed and Religion are all tools that we use to discriminate against other human beings in modern times. This is where the movie becomes more philosophical because Niccol dares to suggest that we will forget about all of those particular ways of popular discrimination in the future when a persons DNA becomes all the more important than what God you worship or your skin color.I believe a lot of people see different things when they watch GATTACA and this is what makes this movie so deep and engrossing in levels that cannot be imagined. This is why I love it because what you get from the movie maybe focused on something totally different from what I got because there is so much going on there.10/10 "If its one movie you see in a lifetime it should be this one."</fullReview>

I worship the groundsdirector Andrew Niccol walks on because he orchestrated a movie about perfection in a way that was no less than just that. As a sad little person who always unintentionally finds "mistakes" in EVERYTHING!, I was stunned with the scale of utter brilliance of "Gattaca". It was beautiful, the most beautiful movie I have ever seen. Everything, every camera angle, spoken and unspoken word, every musical note was exactly how it should be, the only way it could be. I'm exaggerating a little, but no doubt, you get the point. But most of all, the true reason for this post is the message it holds. When a person wants something so bad nothing can stand in his way!It's sad that I just realized that I'm not as strong as Vincent was, I confine my secrets and desires and never even have the guts to show them to myself, let alone the rest of the world. "Gattaca" is a wonderfully beautiful movie I'd recommend to anyone.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Niccol's film is a terrific piece of cinema, and a chilling warning for the future at the same time. With elements of Kubrick and Hitchcock throughout, a great soundtrack, brilliant performances by Hawke, Thurman, and Law, and a terrific script, it is hard to believe that Gattaca never did better on a world scale. (i.e. in winning awards, etc.) The Social Values discussed throughout have never been more relevant for such an emerging era, and the thought provoking discussions that are fuelled by this film are seldom matched. Nevertheless, it is not until you actually delve into the heart of this film (no pun intended) that you realise its brilliance... until then it is simply a splendid piece of science-fiction. An excellent film, best watched with interesting people (or on your own). Do not watch this film with anyone annoying, dull, or incapable of thinking "outside the square".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a world where most of the people are geneticly engineered comes the story of a "Regular" man whose dream is to go into space. the movie shows how he overcomes the difficulties and pursue his dream in any means despite him being different in a world where everybody is perfect. The movie also emphasizes the society's discrimination towards those who aren't perfect like everyone else. Clearly one of the best movies ever made thanks to its wonderful cast and crew. This Movie is also an obvious proof of how great a science fiction movie can be without almost any special effects. The movie is extremely recommended and I think that even people that don't usually like this genre will like this movie.i gave it a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh, where do I begin about this movie. This is one of the best science fiction films ever made, certainly one of the best movies ever made in the 90s. The storyline is fresh, witty, and sublime, those factors are very rare in Hollywood, especially now more than ever. I could honestly say this is a perfect film, I was clapping at the end, and when you do that, you know it's special. The cast is great, Ethan Hawke is the lead character, you have to understand that he could be on the best actors we have if he got more good projects, Training Day was a good pick-me-up, I hope he continues making good movies. His character is sympathetic and dynamic in this movie. Jude Law is one of the best supporting actors ever, and he goes alongside Hawke perfectly. Also we have Academy Award winner Ernest Borgnine in a very small role, but his conversations between him and Hawke represent a very important theme of the movie, hope and escape. Uma Thurman is a really great actress, she is good here. Finally we have Alan Arkin who is the detective, conducting a search inside Gattaca.You will be amazed how this movie was shot, it has great camera work. The script is bulletproof, and the themes about life that this has to offer will stay in your mind for a long time. Thsi movie has so much to offer the viewer, and it appeals to a wide variety of people. Perfect 10/10 for this movie, go see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a well-crafted story that did not do great in the box office. As a writer, the storyline is always my key focus in a movie. As a film freak I like the other stuff too. Ethan Hawke as the lead and Jude Law as the man behind the man behind the man are excellent in the film. Alan Arkin is still one of the greatest actors; he plays a detective investigating a murder at Hawke's job site. Gore Vidal as the director, Ernest Borgnine as the head handyman, Loren Dean as Vincent's brother, Elias Koteas as Vincent's father, Blair Underwood as the doctor/geneticist in the beginning, (and even Tony Shalhoub makes an appearance) do wonderful jobs.The movie uses the future as a background for Vincent's (Hawke) struggle in a genetically-enhanced world. The thrust of the movie is about overcoming culturally-enforced handicaps and prisons and is relevant today and tomorrow and forever. The story is perfect. Perfect. Every detail is necessary and every element adds to the movie. The final swim scene between Vincent and his brother Anton is masterfully drawn and the artistic culmination of the film.Rent the movie, buy the DVD, or subscribe to IFC and wait as long as it takes for the movie to be shown. Ten out of 10 stars or thumbs or monkeys.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gattaca ranks near the top of my favorite films. It never fails to make me feel like I should never give up trying to reach my own goals, despite the difficulties. And I love the way that Irene, after suddenly discovering Jude Law in place of Ethan Hawke, still stands up for her man, and helps him when the "Hoover" cop is after him. Gore Vidal is perfect as the ambitious, murdering Director. His remark to Anton, that "nothing that would prevent one from being a police officer, for example", when Anton questions him about the mental capabilites of the Gattaca workers always cracks me up. And the musical score is fantastic and suits the film perfectly. Lastly, I love the way Irene and Vincent wake up the night after being together, and as she washes her face, she believes (incorrectly) that Vincent has committed murder, yet she still loves him and protects him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most gorgeous science fiction film I have ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beneath it's gorgeous cinematography lies a truly remarkable look at science and the direction that genetics and genetic engineering could possibly lead our society. We are sent into a world where the foundation of social and political structure is matter-of-factly controlled by genetic engineering as an integrated part of our lives. We are introduced to characters developed so finely and a plot so unique to the genre that we forget that we are watching science fiction and become deeply involved in the struggle of the protagonist on a very intimate level. Not since Blade Runner has science fiction provided such intelligence in dialogue and sensitivity to the inner emotions of the characters. Ethan Hawk is very believable and extremely personable as the main character. He is portrayed in masterful contrast with Jude Law who delivers the pathos of his character to a degree never before seen in a science fiction film. Uma Thurman is stunning as the object of Hawks tension and provides a perfectly mysterious character. Layered with the main plot is a very smartly developed sub-plot that keeps the momentum of the story from ever falling flat. A slightly predictable surprise ending is not the least bit distracting to the overall presentation. This is the most believable science fiction film to date. The acting is superb. From the opening titles to the closing credits you are mesmerized with stunning visuals. There is nothing over done and nothing left behind. The movement of the story is consistently paced with no gaps in the development of ideas. If you like monsters and action-packed adventure in you sci-fi soup, this is not your film. But if you are looking for a brilliant story, an intriguing plot, believable characters and thought-provoking message delivered by some of the finest actors of our time, you will not be disappointed.John H.

It was visually and musically perfect, and the central relationship between the Hawke and Law characters was excellent, but the technical side was very faulty. A society that's paranoid about identity testing by DNA, yet always uses the same fingertip for blood samples and takes minimal precautions for urine sampling, so that the hero can easily trick the tests? An exercise tolerance test beatable by faking the heart rate recording (like you could also hide breathing rate and sweating)? A serious congenital heart defect that allows vigorous exercise because the plot requires it? Space missions with astronauts wearing business suits? This is a common problem with SF films: a good idea distorted into some kind of arty allegory because its makers weren't prepared to think through and portray realistically the technical practicalities of its hard-science premise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a striking and disturbing minimalist future</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't read all the other user comments, but I agree with almost all that I did read. A few additional thoughts:One of the oddities of this film is how sparse its on-screen elements are. The cast is small, almost like a stage play, and every set almost seems to have been deliberately scrubbed of any extra objects or people. (The one place where this seemed distractingly improbable to me was inside the apartment/house where Hawke and Law lived. There were absolutely no sources of entertainment visible, at least that I noticed; this does not seem plausible for the human race. Even the most driven must surely relax once in a while, no?) In most of the scenes there are only 2 or 3 people; when there are more, such as in the Gattaca "work room", the rest are almost a backdrop, doing nothing at all to distract the viewer from the primary players. In that sense it reminded me of some comic books I've read, and also of some "artist's conception" drawings of buildings being planned -- you know, the ones where there are, say, 3 people walking across a giant skyway? There are a number of scenes just like that in "Gattaca". Other than the parenthetical note above, I approve.The whole cast was indeed very good, but I have to single out Jude Law. His portrayal of the once-golden boy, now hopelessly broken yet still alive, is riveting. I can't think of a more compelling performance in recent memory. I disagree with whoever said Thurman and Hawke weren't very good here; they were exactly what this film called for. Their restrained emotions beneath affectedly placid exteriors were just what one would expect in a repressive society (regardless of what form the repression takes). Hawke's character was easy to sympathize with, and Thurman seemed very human beneath an almost-too-cool exterior. (FWIW, I'm not a great Uma Thurman admirer; she's fine and all, but "not my type" I guess. She did a nice job here, and that's what I liked.)This movie also had one other thing that I haven't heard anyone mention: the pace. It is slow. Surprisingly, it doesn't become boring; the feeling I had was similar to watching a "pan" of a nature scene or perhaps something from "Qoyaanisqatsi" (sp??): as things pass before your eyes, you have time to let them sink in before the next one comes along, but not so much time that you lose interest. It is remarkably well-paced throughout, focusing one's attention on just the right details for just the right amount of time. Both the pacing and the minimalism contribute to that. The other reason it works so well is that the concepts are disturbing enough to merit substantial consideration.Not for everyone, perhaps, but if you have a super-MTV attention span, "Gattaca" is a worthwhile view.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The themes in this movie are treated with incredible grace. The film makes its point without being forcible, and still manages to be an entirely entertaining story, with very real characters that the viewer comes quickly to care about.What's more, this film look beautiful. The artistic direction in this film has a remarkable quality that is very consistent. I can almost believe this is what the world will look like in the future. The makers have carefully chosen sets, costumes, etc. that are not too "contemporary" or specific to a particular fad -- this film will not look dated in 10 or 20 years.The film deserved more credit than it was given. It was my vote for "Best Picture" and other awards as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gloriously different science fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How many science fiction movies have been made in the last decade? Thousands... now how many of them actually bothered to do a little science reading before hand? Almost none of them.Gattaca is different - you know that as soon as the credits rolls at the start, there is the music, a beautifully simple and emotional piece by Michael Nyman; the opening graphics with their cool blue colour scheme seem to have come from an arts movie and then the movie starts.Gattaca is a discussion of the genie of genetic engineering that we are about to unleash. We will soon have the power to make our children into the people we always wished to be. Provided we are rich enough to pay the bills. Those who can't afford it, will become an underclass, almost a different species - apartheid through science. What if we are on of Gattaca's In-valids but we want to be one of the chosen few?Gattaca has a side-plot about a murder that is used to drive the narrative, but to be honest it isn't terribly well thought through and could have been left out - the main storyline is more than good enough to keep your attention.The acting is excellent all the way from the two leads to the bit parts. The look and feel of the movie is outstanding. Gattaca's world is the future as dreamed in 1950s corporate America, where spacemen go to work in streamlined cars to their Frank Lloyd Wright offices, dressed in identical pin-stripe suits with their hair slicked back. Everything is washed in a pale golden light that first makes you think of utopia, but then you notice the clinically clean lines and surfaces, the movie is set in a cold emotionless place.Perhaps most noteable is the movie's restraint - the usual staples of sex and violence are largely avoided and the special effects sit unobtrusively in the background. And the movie is all the better for it.Try Gattaca one evening, sit down with a drink, watch it, drink slowly and enjoy. You'll be thinking slightly differently at the end.</fullReview>

The style and tone of the film is similar to Contact, but surpasses that film because of the originality and brilliant execution of the idea. The film takes a while to get into, but by the end you are hooked on this miraculous movie.There are a few elements that don't quite work, however, such as the murder investigation, but the events that this sub plot lead to make it worthwhile in the end. The ending is extremely moving and touching and the production design is amazing.

There are many common points between them: the confrontation of mind of body, the romance, the rigid society, the narrative line, the claustrophobic scenes, the series of quotes wisely dropped here and there as brush strokes...But not everything is good in Gattaca: the acting isn't as good as the other aspects of the film.

		<fullReview>"Gattaca" has to be one of the best films that I have seen of the year without a doubt. So people say it is boring and dull, I believe that "Gattaca" is passive, thought provoking and almost spooky in places. Despite Ethan Hawke and Uma Thruman taking the lead roles, Juse Law shines as the "valid" cripple in thsi film. The retro-30's style makes this a super smooth and slick film that leaves you thinking about it for a while after you finish watching it. Although probably better in book format, the movie does have the advantage of the flawless imagery and futuristic sets that give "Gattaca" a strange sense of familiarity, yet sets itself apart from anything else seen in the movies this year. Dreamy with a serious moral behind it, "Gattaca" gets across its subject with success. "there is no gene for the human spirit". I recommend this to anyone who likes a film that makes you think. Very good, very slick.Rich</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some Interesting Points about the FIlm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I noticed the other night while watching Nova Science that the DNA code alphabet is comprised of T N A and G. In the movie GATTACA with Ethan Hawk and Uma Thurman, altering the human DNA sequence is the main subject manner of the film. That, along with proving the significance of the human will or spirit. If you will notice, you can spell the word GATTACA with the afore mentioned letters designated to represent the sequenced molecules in DNA. No coincidence I'm sure.Additional elements within the movie GATTACA that call out these letters is the beginning and ending credits. In the beginning credits all letters in the alphabet are in a regular weight font while all occurrences of the letters T N A and G are in a bold face. The emphasis being placed on the letters occurring in DNA carries with the theme of the film. The futurist society presented to us in GATTACA is one in which milieus dictate one's DNA must be perfect in order to live a successful life. Hence the emphasis.By the end of the film Ethan Hawk's character has proved to us how significant the human will is by accomplishing his goals with his 'god given' DNA sequence while competing with humans with DNA refined by science. This affectively down plays DNA's significance as a factor in the ability to live a successful life. And this is cinematically reflected in the ending credits of the film by showing all letters in the alphabet, minus the ones occurring in DNA, being placed in a bold face. T N A and G are shown with a normal type emphasis.</fullReview>

But i dare say, that it was worth the late night.The movie has as much to do with the basic principles of life today as with the futuristic aspect. The human spirit/mind remains the same all through.Challenge the "rules", work hard, never give up and all the other so called "cliche's" find a place in this movie. But its not cloying and nauseating as other Hollywood productions.Ethan Hawke lends the character a lot of humanness and Jude Law, as usual is always good with his English accent (which kind of works, for his character in the movie) I thought this might be a lot of futuristic hogwash mambo-jumbo but it is a plausible premise. The plot is thin but nevertheless, the underlying motifs makes one think and believe in oneself.Watch it! (even the credits.. there's something in the end of it!)</fullReview>

I would also add that "Gattaca" is in many ways similar to the famous film "Matrix". Both trade about the coming future. I also like the actors who did a very good job. The main character is Vincent, a natural born janitor at the space program Gattaca. He has a heart failure which means that he has only 30 years to live and has no chance to go into space. He knows, that he has no chance, so he makes a deal with Jerome, who has perfect genes, but was paralyzed in an accident.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We watched Gattaca in our English lessons when we talked genetic engineering. We haven't watched the film before but now we think that it is in many ways the best film we have seen. It is really surprising when we see the development of genetic engineering. We couldn't imagine that someday something will happen like this: People who are not completely perfect( healthy) have not the same chances in life like those who were genetically manipulated before their birth. Also we think Ethan Hawk as Vincent does his job brilliantly, because he plays all the feelings and emotions of the character very well and the viewer can feel with him in his situation, because in our world nothing is completely perfect. As well the actor of Eugene, Jude Law, was brilliant in his role. After watching this film you really should think about it and you see what our world maybe can become. As a result we would say: If you watch this film, you won't regret it!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice Sci-Fi fairytale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gattaca is a good movie - not more and not less. Although it's covering an interesting topic, it still seems somewhat weird and boring in some scenes. Not like the plot itself would really seem boring at any time - just that kind of tension you feel in other movies never really gets you here.That's because Vicent's actions, although everything is well-acted, seem totally pointless to me. Despite being a Godchild, a person who wasn't genetically engineered, he never really loses, never does anything wrong and always surpasses all the problems seemingly easily. The movie focuses on Vincent's ability to still be able to win and reach his goals. That's alright at first and some scenes, like when Vincent tries to cross the street without his contact lenses, are quite exciting. But you always just get these all-or-nothing situations and so Vincent seems superhuman (or at least incredibly lucky). After some time, this is clearly boring the viewer because there is nothing in between. Some more dramatic moments would maybe have made this a masterpiece, but like this it only makes the movie seem like a nice fairytale.If you like Sci-Fi movies that seem somewhat fantastic (meaning "not realistic"), this movie is worth a shot - otherwise you might be disappointed of the way Vincent tries and wins in the movie without ever losing once.The point I liked most about this movie is the way the characters are played - you can really see and feel any of their strengths and flaws, no matter if they are genetically engineered or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting And Intelligent But Ultimately Pretentious Science-Fiction Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the near future there is a social caste system with a genetically pure ruling class who are biologically engineered at conception and an underclass of the naturally born called Invalids. An Invalid, desperate to be admitted to a space exploration program, pays a crippled but genetically thoroughbred man for permission to use his physical identity via blood, skin, hair and urine samples and must fight to maintain his facade and attain his dreams against a sterile and prejudicial society.This film is well made, well acted, refreshingly mature and very distinctive, but also rubbish. The reason I say that is because in a way it's as snooty about the genre it purports to represent as it is chastising in its depiction of intolerance. It looks like a handsome science-fiction film (it was co-produced by Danny DeVito), thanks largely to the excellent production design by Jan Roelfs, but it isn't really - it's a love story between two men dressed up as sf. Its weakest link is its script, which in the modern age of designer babies is a potent idea, but not a very original one. Most of John Wyndham's novels (especially The Chrysalids) explore the same ideas on a much more epic scale, and there are way too many holes in the plot. How can Hawke, who's a goddamn cleaner, afford to pay Law ? What has Thurman got to do with anything (she's that I'm-Here-To-Prove-The-Hero-Isn't-Gay stock character) ? Why is Law an embittered cripple one moment and a starry-eyed champion of other people's dreams the next ? The murder is the worst kind of meaningless McGuffin - we don't know or care who the victim was, it pads the story, it's only there to reunite the brothers and it completely wastes the great Arkin as a boring cop. The movie has some nice touches - Berkeley's character is terrific, with the revelation that he knew Hawke's secret all along for a very funny reason, Borgnine is a charming old man, and Michael Nyman's score is very polished. However, any sci-fi movie where the hero gets onto a spaceship wearing an Armani suit is not for me I'm afraid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film about potential that doesn't live up to its own...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gattaca is one of those sci fi films that tries to buffer the harshness and complexity of its subject matter by pandering to the audience and explaining away the well-conceived ideas.The voice-overs take the place of demanding writing and over-simplify the complex social norms that have risen in not-to-distant future. The illegal but accepted social structure that includes genetically manipulated superhumans and "god-children" or "de-GENE-erates" is referred to in passing attempts to add texture and depth to the film...But the names aren't used as if they were part of the every-day language of the characters, they are thrown in as cues to an audience that needs to have the social stratification and clever twists on language pounded into them.Nothing is subtle about this film, when it should have been. We get seemingly random and particularly coincidental events taking place to push the plot along and to force the audience to eat the theme of bigotry and potential. For example, the police happen to raid the club that Jerome (Hawke) and Irene (Thurman) are dancing at, the policeman happens to be Vincent's (Hawke) brother, and the policeman happens to be called off of the hunt before discovering the truth seconds before he rounds the corner (only to discover the truth in the next scene--how unnecessary!).The film reminds me of the studio-introduced changes to Ridley Scott's BLADE RUNNER in that they both were harmed by not trusting that the audience was keen enough to follow along. The original release of BLADE RUNNER included a useless voice-over as well and a happy ending which detracted from the message of the film.What a shame that a concept as good as the one of partnering with a genetic superman to hide your flawed identity is wasted by watering it down.This film which is about living up to your potential and not underestimating yourself has failed on both counts. It falls far short of its potential and it second guesses itself by oversimplifying and overexplaining itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the near future, humanity has mastered his own genetic code. So thorough is this knowledge, in fact, that the majority of modern conceptions are performed in a petri dish, on an embryo with the lowest number of negative hereditary traits. Against the backdrop of this fanatically eugenic-conscious future, discrimination has reached new levels, as jobs and relationships are won and lost with a simple blood sample and naturally conceived children are second-rate citizens. It seems like there's always a persistent, rebellious figure when confronted with such an oppressive system, and in Gattaca's case that role is filled by Ethan Hawke as the physically modest, daydreaming genius Vincent. The bevy of hoops Hawke jumps through to maintain the illusion that he's a top-tier genetic example make up most of the film's substance, with an ongoing murder investigation pressing the matter in a few hairy new directions. Somewhere along the way Vincent stumbles into a hollow, affection-free relationship with Uma Thurman that seems to spawn more from boredom than passion. Quite slow and methodical in nature, it's still a bright rumination on a future that already seems within grasp. Could have used a more flavorful tone, and the cast is almost universally glazed-over and dry.</fullReview>

Had this movie not taken itself so seriously, perhaps it might have been saved by some humor, but this movie was not funny either. I also did not get "involved" in the main character, Vincent's, struggles, and could care less if he got caught, or succeeded in his plan to go to space. Although, I do not blame Ethan Hawk's performance in the movie, and more the Writer than anyone. Watching a guy constantly, collecting his own personal DNA in CSI-like fashion, and not display any emotions about it, makes for a pretty boring movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>overview for Gautama- moral</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>gataca is a very interesting watch. some say it is a film about prejudice- it is not. nor is it "sci-fi". the so called vallids do not interact either professionally or sociably with the invalid population, either really doesn't give the other a second thought. if your curious of the way genetic research is heading currently this really is worth it. the film is carried along by a loose narration by our "victim", the poor child born of love-that is naturally and without gene modifying antenatal tech. so the naturally born kid finds that his hew brother is growing faster and harder and fitter than he. the natural born ( in-valid) dreamsof space academy but only the right ones (valids) can apply. hence our in-valid borrows the genetic sequence of a valid-- at a dollar price. now disregarding a love tangent and a murderdistraction the film progresses well. all the best morality tales must be both instructive and scary(a warning). this film triumphs magnificently for both. i think this film stands up , slaps the table and says- human genius that is human creativity, is a pure quiz of chance. spouse if you remove the chance genes you end up with a perfectly fine, healthily superior, super intelligent bunch of robots.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as Code 46</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Code 46 which in many ways could be compared to Gattaca. For one, the set design is well thought out. In Gattaca, there is a strong contrast between the technology and the fashion, like everyone owns a remake of a 1940s car and out-of fashion suit. This contrasts with modern interiors, Japanish minimalists-West Coast, and the high tech car in the intro sequence, and obviously the technology itself and knowledge of DNA.The film deals with discrimination on a genetic basis, highlighting even that racial discrimination has vanished - and seems to present a world free from political trouble and poverty. In that sense the eugenics paradise has been achieved, in much the same way as in Brave New World, the book by Aldous Huxley.In other aspects, Gattaca deals with the eternal topic of a man pursuing a dream, against all odds, and adds a little romance to spice it up.Nonetheless I felt these topics, the moralism, behind the script was too obvious a recipe, like "I guess you say that to all the girls". My review is rather negative in that respect, but I admit this film is considered a must-see by many others. It just did not live up to my expectations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a future world a child's DNA will dictate health, IQ and life expectancy. "Valid" humans having the best of job occupations, while the "In-valid" are considered more or less damaged goods. Vincent Freeman(Ethan Hawke)has always dreamed of working in the aero-space corporation Gattaca. Technology and a fraction of his future earnings allows him to assume the identity of a superior "valid" Jerome Morrow(Jude Law), who now is a crippled former Olympic swimmer. Vincent gets the job he wanted hands down and is excelling rapidly in the social caste system and even falling in love with a co-worker(Uma Thurman). A high ranking director at Gattaca is bludgeoned to death with his own computer keyboard. The murder investigation puts the assumed Jerome's destiny in danger. A few surprise elements add a twist to this clever Sci-Fi thriller. Rounding out the cast are: Gore Vidal, Alan Arkin, Ernest Borgnine and Xander Berkeley. Kudos to director Andrew Niccol.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Our opinion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film Gattaca is one of the best movies, which shows how people are classified into groups; here into a group of Valids, genetically perfect created persons, and Invalids, not genetically changed persons; only because of some physical or psychological harms. Furthermore we are touched by a wonderful acting of the main characters. It attains a very emotional feeling and conveys in a kind today's society. Very successful is the end, because we don't see a happy end in all situations, so the viewer leaves the film in a sad and pitiful condition. All in all you have to watch the movie yourself to get an own impression.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gattaca is quite a nice movie.It is not an extraordinary film,but it is quite interesting to think about the concerned topics. The main character Vincent(Ethan Hawke) has been born in the natural way without any genetic engineering.This seemingly prevents him from realizing his dream of becoming an astronaut.With his genetic failures he doesn't get a chance although he is extraordinarily motivated and has the gift.Later he gets this opportunity by becoming the double of one genetically engineered but disabled person. The film focuses on two ethical questions:On the one hand it's about genome ethics and how far this development could go,if it isn't regulated.On the other hand it is about a new kind of discrimination. The intention is -to me-interesting but the application leaves wishes open.Caused by the low budget of the movie there seems to be sometimes a lack of special effects and the difference between this film and reality is visible. by Nobson Ponte and Leo</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion "Gattaca" with Jude Law, Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke is a great film. It's so good and successful, because of the tension, which is always there, and because of a lot of secrets, like "Who is the murderer?", "What's with Irene?" and "Is it Anton who called 'Jerome'Vincent?" Often I don't like films like this with a lot of engineering, but "Gattaca" was very impressive, the best technical film i have seen and enjoyed it. Also it was nice that the end of the film is sad but at the same time like a happy End for Jerrome! Apart from that i like the film also because it shows that normal humans ( humans which are born by a normal way) are also good and that they can be in a higher position and not only the cloned humans because technique isn't the best! So, all together it was a pleasure to watch "Gattaca" and i could only recommend the film to other people!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gattaca represents rare genre of intellectual sci-fi movies that contains minimum amount of action and none of the usual big guns, huge monsters stuff. This genre is heavily dependant on the actors and settings. Settings for Gattaca are as follows: in the future children are not conceived naturally, but through genetic engineering. This has brought up new kind of racism: perfect versus flawed.Vincent (Ethan Hawke) is one of rare naturally born children, who is condemned to die in young age with 99% percent probability. Vincent wants nothing more than to be an astronaut, so he buys himself a different life as Jerome (Jude Law), who has been crippled in an accident. From here begins Vincent's deception game to reach the stars.Basically the plot deals with the issues of human spirit: what Vincent can achieve despite of his condition. Can he be better than the perfect people? Can he deceive everyone? Also there are lots of issues between the perfect and their humane flaws and how Vincent as flawed contrast with them.All in all interesting little sci-fi film whit solid actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent slice of sci-fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>===== Rating System: ***** Must see **** Very good *** I liked it, but you might hate it ** I hated it, but you might like it * Avoid =====In the near future, children will not be made in the traditional way, they will be created to the demands of the parents. Vincent (Ethan Hawke) wasn't created like that yet, and therefore he has to deal with the weaknesses of normal humans, like illnesses, imperfections and premature death. Vincent has always had the dream of becoming an astronaut, but his eye disorder and a weak heart render that impossible. But when Jerome (Jude Law), a potential astronaut gone cripple, offers him his services, his dream may come true.It's a potential masterpiece, but somehow the whole thing never works, and the reason lies in the characters. We follow Vincent who has a dream, but why he has this dream is never explained. Then he tries to realize this dream by cheating and lying, because he is basically incapable of doing his job. As an audience it is hard to sympathise with such a figure. Jerome helps Vincent but the reason why is never explained. Uma Thurman (Irene) must have one of the most thankless roles in history, because her only purpose is set dressing and run around with Hawke. Her character is non-existent. What we have here is three characters that don't make sense, in one of the most brilliant movie ideas of the 90's. The end product is still a decent movie with great colors, music and photography. It takes itself far too seriously, though, and the story contains too many improbabilities and coincidences so this remains flawed entertainment instead of a crackling masterpiece. ***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Which more-famous-than-it sci-fi thriller does Gattaca remind you of? Is it Minority Report? Maybe it's Total Recall? Really it's any number of these - and I'm sure it got recycled again by Michael Bay in The Island. Gattaca tries to set itself apart with it's production design and in-camera feel. It's a very stylish movie with very beautiful people (the subject matter of generic subjectivity demands that even if the studio hadn't). Ethan Hawke as Vincent is an above average lead, a little rougher at the edges and more desperate than Cruise/Willis/Schwarzenegger. Uma Thurman is his self-sacrificing partner and Jude Law was sufficiently perfect in this to bag a similar role in A.I. Oh, there you go, there's another one... 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why did the authors ever decide Jerome had to commit suicide? It was Vincent who was living a false life he did not own. I understand the wrong values behind genetic engineering, and admire Vincent's perseverance but still there was no reason for Jerome to commit suicide.Life consists not in holding good cards but in playing those you hold well -- Henry Wheeler Shaw (1856-1950)Jerome just used his brains and sought to make a living by selling his organic products. There is nothing wrong with that. He is made to appear like an incomplete person who is fully dependent on Vincent. He had his own life which is ignored by the film. He would have coped without Vincent anyhow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Execution Destroys The Whole Thing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plot: A man that was born naturally, tries to become an astronaut in a world where the elites are only the ones whose genes were artificially improved before birth.You'll love Gatacca if: You expect an easygoing crime\drama with a bit of Science Fiction thrown in. Gatacca doesn't really go too deep in the genetic racism thing it is based on? mainly it's a crime movie, but instead of guys in trench coaches searching clues with magnifying lenses we have guys in trench coaches searching for DNA traces. And that's where the good things end? if they were any in the first place.You'll hate Gatacca if: Like me, you expected something more "deep". The concept of the movie is great. Racism that has nothing to do with skin color, social status and so on but racism that has to do with genes and how "pure" they are. Logic literally takes a backseat in the movie and while we are in the future, everything, from clothes, to cars, to technology looks so 60's! Secondly the acting? the protagonist is in a situation where a single wrong step would destroy his plans and his life but he is acting as if he doesn't care. Also, why exactly people with better genes act like robots??? They are better genetically they are not cyborgs for Christ's sake!!! Finally the pacing. The plot is almost non-existent. Most of the time is the main guy trying to fake the urine-blood-heartbeat tests by using another man's urine-blood\heartbeats! Is that exciting? I think not. The movie tries to show us that someone can do things better even without perfect genes just by having a good fighting spirit, but the execution destroys the whole thing?FINAL VERDICT: Not Even Close (3/10)[+] Simple crime movie that is slightly futuristic[-] Fails getting through its main message. Forgettable characters. Very slow paced.Also Check: Aeon Flux (2005) - Blade Runner (1982) ? Children Of Men (2006) ? Metropolis (1927)P.S.: My purpose in all my IMDb Reviews is not to say "I like\don't like this movie" but to help you decide whether YOU will like it or not since everything is all about taste and expectations IMO...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler minefield ahead...I was sorely unimpressed with the simple, bargain-bin ideas in this film. Usually I can ignore stupid plots if other elements are engaging enough ('Legend', 'Bill &amp; Ted 2', '5th Element'), but even here the sets and styles are all boring. In an effort to avoid copying the lushness of 'Blade Runner', the filmmakers have given us a view of the future straight out of TV commercials and primetime junk. What's fun about humdrum?The plot, of course, is '1984', 'Blade Runner' with a shot of 'Double Indemnity' and 'Chariots of Fire'. Hawke, Thurman, and Law are all lost in their cookie cutter roles, but that's no tragedy. What's really depressing is Alan Arkin stuck in the Ed Robinson act. It's sad watching him try to fit in a role that is clearly too small for him.Spielberg would duplicate many of the elements here for 'Minority Report'. You know, even 'Back to the Future Part II' was more interesting than this.Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers This was a good premise turned into a bad movie. There is a very real and important point to be made here about the repercussions of genetic tampering, and the perseverance of the human spirit. And they don't tell you this, but Gattaca is a possible gene sequence of A, C, G, and T proteins found in DNA. Gattaca does a great job of describing the inequality of a world where your child's genes could be computer selected so that he or she is super smart, strong, fast, etc. But then it does a completely horrible job of describing the world wherein lies this inequality. Most of the story drags you through the drudgery of the continual checks to ensure that your genetic coding is up to snuff, something that would never happen if you actually work with that person every day. Then there are the space explorers wearing business suits to a new planet at the end. I guess they aren't so smart after all. On top of all this is the fact that there's a rocket leaving every day, but the launch window only comes once in 75 years. Huh? Will these people ever return from space? I'm assuming they will be there for at least 75 years, probably 150. This would have been much better as a 30 minute Twilight Zone episode with a budget of $5000. Hollywood, if you don't know anything at all about the laws of physics, astronomy, common sense, or the nature of technology, don't make a futuristic space movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yawn-City! Here we go again with, yet, another crummy (yes, crummy) look at the future. I don't know about you, but I think these (supposedly) "brilliant", set-in-the-future brainstorms that the film-industry keeps coming up with just get stupider and stupider by the minute. They do.Of course, a ton of money went into the making of this one and, naturally, that makes it look real bright and impressive on the surface. Yeah. All polished and shiny, just like a pretty new penny.But if you really sit back after it's all over and seriously think the story through you're eventually struck by how absolutely preposterous it is. It may actually take 2 (or more) viewings of Gattaca before you come to your senses and agree with this conclusion.And what makes Gattaca a real champion of the ridiculous is that the 2 actors who play switcheroo in the film don't even resemble each other one single bit. They don't! Even if I closed my eyes I could still tell these 2 men apart. I mean, who couldn't?And since these actors are playing characters who are living in a futuristic society where the frickin' elite are so painfully anal and fanatically meticulous about everything, including someone's looks, it would be impossible that this charade of identity-deception could ever be pulled off. It couldn't. Not even if the rest of this snobbish society were, literally, certified blind.What totally bugs me here is the fact that there seems to have been no attempt made to get 2 actors that, at least, resembled one another. Would that really have been so difficult?? Would it!!?? I don't think so. But to throw 2 quite different looking actors up there on the screen and expect everyone in the audience to accept that they could pass for one another (in such a rigid society as the one they were living in) is an absolute insult to the intelligence of any thinking person.This is a movie meant only for the brain-dead and the far-sighted. Like, didn't the 2 non-look-alike characters even agree themselves that they didn't look at all alike!? They sure did! The only thing that I found exceptional in Gattaca was the soundtrack. The title theme that weaved its' way through the entire picture was a powerful, moving piece of music that at times provoked strong, vibrant emotions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man, this is a bad movie, at times unbelievably bad, hence the palm shaped dents in my forehead. But it isn't interesting enough to fall into the so-bad-it's-good genre. This film is rife with plot holes and character inconsistencies and discontinuities. Uma Thurman is badly underutilized and misdirected. I know she can act, but in this movie she mostly seems like she's just pretending to be mysterious. Ethan Hawke's performance is passable, if bland. Apparently, the only one in the film who could act without direction was Jude Law. His performance provides the only real entertainment in this cliche ridden monstrosity that seems as though written and directed by a film school poseur.Like the movie itself, the score to Gattaca is annoying, overbearing, and cliche ridden, with six notes repeating, over and over again on top of a standard chord progression. Anyone who knows how to write music could have done this one in their sleep. Thankfully, there are portions of the movie with no music.The lighting in Gattaca is terrible affected, trying desperately to be moody and atmospheric, but looking more fussy and overproduced to my eye. Practically all the exterior shots are done through a yellow filter and most interior shots have a yellow cast to them - why? And what's up with the graduated neutral density filters in the scene with the solar reflectors? And what was so wonderful about those reflectors anyway, except for the way they reflected the Sun before it had even risen? Then there's the upside down love scene, complete with crashing waves in the background!Then we have the Gattaca corporation itself. Are we really supposed to believe that people dressed in immaculate grey suits, sitting at identical cubicles in an office space that's clean enough to build microcircuits are really going to be astronauts, and some stuffed shirt director played by Vidal Gore is going to be able to lead them in this endeavor? And they go into space in their business suits?! This could be acceptable in some kind of surreal Italian movie from the 60s, but Gattaca was too normal for this kind of abberation to seem appropriate.And about the 60s - they had three cars from the 60s, the Studebaker Avanti, a Citroen ID 19 Cabriolet, and the Rover 3500, to represent the cars of the future. These were supposedly electric powered, yet all the cars' engines sounded more like turbines. Electric motors hardly make any noise. But at least it was nice seeing Uma's very beautiful Citroen.In summary, a very light weight treatment of a heavy subject, rendered into an almost unwatchable film whose prior experience was mainly with TV commercials. 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gattaca</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had seen clips of this film provided by a Channel 4 countdown when it looked at the actress starring, and then I read the plot line and it sounded relatively interested, so I gave it a go, from writer Andrew Niccol (The Truman Show). Basically, in the not too distant future, all of society is run by DNA determining your place in the world, i.e. what you can and can't do, and how long you are likely to live, and this is especially important in the Gattaca Corporation, an aerospace firm. From childhood, being the last naturally born in a genetically-enhanced world, Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke) is determined not fit with a heart condition, a high likelihood of disease and not very long life expectancy, so he has no chance of a career against his genes, instead of gender, race or religion. Vincent gets a brief job as a janitor in the Gattaca Corp, but that only fuels his want to become a member of the firm and achieve his dream of travelling into space. He decides to get the ball rolling for his dream career by going underground and assuming the identity of Jerome Eugene Morrow (Jude Law), a perfect genetic specimen who used to be at Gattaca, but was crippled in a car accident, without anyone knowing. Vincent manages to get into the firm without detection with the help of Jerome's hair, skin, urine and most importantly blood samples to pass all daily gene tests, and he continues to work until he is assigned a mission. As time goes by he gets to know fellow Gattaca colleague Irene Cassini (Uma Thurman), but as his true self, Vincent is mistakenly made suspect to the murder of the mission Director Josef (Gore Vidal). Det. Hugo (Alan Arkin) is investigating the case, with the found eye-lash that Vincent unintentionally dropped as key evidence, and Anton (Loren Dean) is getting very close to him as well. Anton reveals eventually though that he is his brother who he has not seen since childhood, and always beat him a swimming race due to his better health, but he promises not to tell anyone. There is a point when Jerome is nearly caught out himself by Det. Hugo, but true identity analysis comes clean, and the eyelash is concluded as not belonging to the murderer. In the end, Vincent finally gets his chance to go into space, Dr. Lamar (Xander Berkeley) does reveal that he knows his true identity, but he lets him go anyway, and he is actually sad when he leaves Earth. Also starring Jayne Brook as Marie Freeman, Elias Koteas as Antonio Freeman, Ernest Borgnine as Caesar and Tony Shalhoub as German. The casting of Hawke, Thurman and Law are all equally good, there is no need to use special effects to tell a story involving a lot of scientific stuff, with thought-provoking moments it is a clever science-fiction thriller. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score for Michael Nyman. Uma Thurman was number 95, and Jude number 60 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Law was also number 10 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, and he was number 72 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I see this film has been voted a 7.6 by nigh on 31000 IMDb people. I find that hard to believe. I do like a bit a sci-fi, so when I read about Gattaca I was looking forward to seeing it. It proved to be very disappointing. The problems with the film stem from the script which is a shambles really. I found the main character and the female lead to be deeply uninteresting. Now how can that be when the story they are a part of has such dramatic and profound potential. Well it's not the actors fault in my opinion. It's the bloody awful script. One of the characters does something at the end of the film which is completely not what you would expect him/her to do given what has gone before. This was done for dramatic effect because otherwise you would have the all time least dramatic ending in film history. I felt and thought absolutely nothing at the end of Gattaca as I had lost interest long ago. In the film we're subjected to a future world poorly realised. How this can be considered by many (it seems) to be a thought provoking slow burner is beyond me. It could of been but it's just a dreadfully written and poorly executed bore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie is Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie took away a good idea from a movie which could have been much much better. In fact, I was very surprised to see how well-accepted this movie was when I read the user reviews. I don't mind a slow-moving movie but I can't stead a boring one. This movie was boring. The worst part was the astronaut thing. It was very dumb. What was the point of these space launches? Going to Titan in a business suit? What's he going to do once he gets there besides die because of the environment? The writer of this snooze fest obviously knows nothing of what Titan is actually like. The astronaut part of this movie was so stupid that it destroyed the credibility that it earned with the genetic part. I gave it 4/10 for some originality and a unique atmosphere. What can I say? I'm feeling nice today...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the best film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hello dear movie watchers, in our English lesson we watched the film "Gattaca" and my result is that it isn't really a great film. The idea of the film is good and structured well but it isn't very exciting because there aren't many climax' and you wait for some surprises but you know from the beginning what will happen. The characters are good chosen and acting well, through that it worths it to watch the film anyway. The end of the film is surprising and a little climax of the film, as well it is sad to awake the watchers. Finally I can say it isn't a great movie but if it will show in the free-TV I would take some crisps and watch it again ;-) Have fun Sarah.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is so ridiculous I don't know where to begin. The people I saw it with were laughing through most of it. The dialogue is so terrible and unnatural, it's so obviously scripted and will have you rolling your eyes every few lines if you're not rolling your eyes at the stone-cold seriousness of it all and overblown music at the most dull scenes possible. The concept is intriguing but this flop doesn't go anywhere. Don't see this movie, it's a waste of time. I had no expectations going in, but I couldn't believe the high reviews it's gotten! Even if it's intentionally corny, it's still bad. Avoid at all costs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is NOT sci-fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a DRAMA based on a fantastic premise that could only be possible in the future. It's somewhat like the book 1984 where the physical objects, machines, buildings, clothes, etc. are conspicuously lacking in detail; they are drab. What is important here is the picture of SOCIETY and how the characters interact within the social framework. Mostly we see movies where the lead characters rebel against the social framework, and it is so in Gattaca. Probably more interesting that way.I am a huge sci-fi fan. I am also a fan of the book 1984 and of movies like Brazil. Brazil was loaded with humor. Gattaca has zero humor. Gattaca was also boring. BOR-RING! I can gauge a movie by how I check my watch. If it seems like a long time since the movie started and I look and see that its only been running 30 minutes, bad movie. If it seems that the movie just started and I look and see that its been running over an hour, good movie. Gattaca bad. No payoff at the end, but you knew there wouldn't be, and you didn't care.Maybe it was the direction. The acting was good. The story taken on its own wasn't that bad. The love interest sub plot was so emotionless. In a way this story was like Les Miserables set in the 22nd century. One man fighting against flawed social values. Uma Thurman in both. See Les Miserables; skip Gattaca.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Many Ideas For It`s Own Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>GATTACA is a highly thoughtful SF movie , too thoughtful in fact since the ideas and themes overwhelm the story . Let`s take a look at some of them : Genetic engineering , sibling rivalry , discrimanation , inter-planetery travel and I haven`t even mentioned the murder mystery . No doubt with so many ideas floating around GATTACA would have made a highly absorbing SF novel with an identity of its own , but as a movie it comes across a bit too much like a Huxley clone . It should also be pointed out this movie is idea rather than plot driven which means it`s very talky and a bit too slow for a mainstream audience and this isn`t helped by Andrew Niccol`s cold and sterile direction which isn`t a million miles removed from Kubrick`s 2001 , a movie I dislike intensely . I have noticed a lot of IMDB reviewers liked GATTACA but I didn`t</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Underdog Who Shouldn't Prevail; But Does!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise of the movie is illogical. It parallels genetic disposition and potential with discrimination against minority groups in the past, and it fails. I'd like to think, now in the 21st century, as an individualistic society, we reward those who succeed no matter who they were, are and whence they come and we won't step back to discrimination in future despite knowing their potentials beforehand, simply because that is ridiculous. The story should be about the past; I assume that's why the detectives' attire resemble those of the 50s with trench coats and fedoras, and the why cars look like 50s cars.Two brothers don't recognize each other; the identification methods used are ridiculous; the movie's characters and atmosphere are bland, and if the most exiting scenes of it consist of a couple of pissing contests between two brothers in the form of swimming far from shore in the form of some chicken-taunting game, then you can be sure you have some few hundred feet of celluloid excrement in your hands.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow... how inspiring, how insightful, how... boring as hell!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, so there is an interesting premise and story at work here: A man who is not satisfied with his place in society changes his social status by taking on the identity of a guy who was genetically engineered to be "perfect". But you know what? The movie loses track of its own story as it gads about for the rest of itself like a damn murder mystery... which is boring as hell! The murder story is completely unnecessary and makes the movie tedious, pretentious and way overlong. Yes I know it's supposed to increase the tension because we don't know if mister not-satisfied-with-his-life will be found out by the police as an "in-valid" and a murder suspect. However it occurs to me and it should to you too that a damn murder mystery is not a damn science fiction movie!!!! It's freaking horrible! The guy who has taken on the identity of Jerome falls in love with Uma Thurman's character, who really is almost as boring as this movie. Oh, there's also the exciting SWIM competition between Jerome and his brother! Isn't that exciting!? And best yet, there are two swim competitions. The "tension" as I call it in the movie is really more suited for waiting outside a Wal-mart for a sale to begin and not for a science-fiction movie. I'm sure everyone will also love the scene where the not at all gay Doctor complements Jerome about the size of his wang, SEVERAL TIMES. Yes, wonderful science fiction! This movie sucks... stay away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Idea, Poorly Executed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whenever someone asks me the inevitable question of what is my favorite movie of all time more often than not Gattaca is the last film to come to mind.As I stated in my summary line, it was a good idea, poorly executed. Which bothers me more than a poor idea, excellently executed... at least I can give the poor idea an "A" for effort. Taking a good idea and mangling it with poor execution is the height of bad cinematography.So. I can hear all you fans of the movie are sitting there at your computers yelling, "HEY! What was wrong with it??!!" Accordingly, I'll tell you:A) This is supposed to be so far into the future that they have DNA sampling and testing in real time, interplanetary travel all the way to Jupiter, and a colony on one of its moons... yet they're still using the same old rockets to get there (which would take a *minimum* of 4,392 days or more than 12 years... each way). The auto body styles are circa 1950-1960. The clothing is old style as well. If you're going to do a futuristic movie, make it LOOK futuristic. If it looks old-school, that detracts from the futuristic setting. If they could do better with Star Wars in 1977, the CERTAINLY could do better with Gattaca TWENTY years later, in 1997.B) None of the characters were particularly likable, Dr. Lamar (played by Xander Berkeley), was the least unlikable of the lot. Jerome was an arrogant, bitter, self-absorbed &lt;expletive deleted&gt; who had little better to do than wallow in self pity; Irene could have been replaced by an inflatable date without anyone really noticing; and Vincent wasn't much more than an automaton, displaying no fear, stress, or passion in spite of his precarious situation.C) The writing and acting were cardboard, at best. We get no sense of the stress that Vincent is under on a 24/7 basis (that's the writer's fault), and the thespians involved run the gamut of emotions from A to B (the actor's fault, with an assist going to the director).D) What a boring, uninspired title. It should have been called "Borrowed Ladder."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gattaca... are you serious? This film sucks at all ... It's boring, a little later it's even more boring and if you wait until the end it's eh ... boring! This movie is a pseudo-forecasting film because this dystopian story will never happen. Moreover the story sucks really hard because even if you fall asleep and wake up again you would get back into the story because nothing really happened. The music is improper in combination with the pictures and scenes for example when those guys Vincent and Anton go swimming there's some kind of epic music although nothing really happens. And some scenes are totally stupid and senseless because no one is interested if a pianist has 6 fingers. Haha what a joke...-.-...*snore*... So for all those who planed to watch this movie: DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME!</fullReview>

Well, we gotta stop doing that, man, cuz it's like really, really unfair. Even the presence of Uma Thurman can not make up for crap like this.

All you gonna see is a man that wanna be an astronaut. You think that sound like sci-fi? I did too until I saw it. He just walks around and has flashbacks that is about when he was a kid and competed with his brother in everything, yey funny, NOT. The best part is the last seconds of the movie when he becomes an astronaut and flies away to Mars or something. Then I thought Yes we´re gonna see some space, but NO.

		<shortDescription>Gattaca! The very different Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gattaca is a very strange science-fiction movie from 1998. It should be a critical picture, but I think this is really a distopia. Consequently this film is very uninteresting since it's not really exiting. At first there is no finished story, with now clear start, where the viewer gets introduced. You get no feeling, no relationship to the world and the people, who live in this next-future society. We watched the movie in class in our English lessons with English subtitle for better understanding. The actors did a great job, Ethan Hawke, Jude Law and Uma Thurman. But this good actors(Oscar nominated)can't push this very strange movie to something special.P&amp;OGl hf</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't think so. Not even close. No hardware. And it had an austerity and surrealistic feel that didn't serve to further the plot. You would think that Gore Vidal would have chipped in a little dough for a more realistic spaceship at least. I mean, like ANY spaceship. I think we deserve that for sitting through the movie. Hey, that's the only reason why I sat through it. I was thinking to myself, man, there's GOTTA be a kick-ass ship at the end of this turkey. But there was nothing. To add insult to injury, the damn astronaut wore a leisure suit on the ship. (Oops! Sorry if I SPOILED anything for you.)OK, some scenes of suspense were done well, granted, but the plot was claustrophobic and unbelievable. And, speaking of Gore, I figured something weird was up when, in the first five minutes, not only were we introduced to the gay-famous Vidal as a main character, but a white-coated lab technician with a clipboard feels the need to comment at length on the "package" of astronaut Ethan Hawke. My suspicions were confirmed- the film maintained a vaguely homo-erotic tone throughout, and, guess who the hero turns out to be? A waste.</fullReview>
