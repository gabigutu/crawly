		<shortDescription>Cassavettes ? The Anti-Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A man goes into a big, strange house with his family and friends. He is armed with script and camera, and proceeds to create a milestone work of American cinema ? the key film of the 1970s. Above all else, `A Woman Under the Influence' is Anti-Hollywood, Anti-Establishment, Anti-Film. 1970's Hollywood may have defined itself with films like Godfather, Rocky, Annie Hall, and Deer Hunter ? but real, unpredictable, chaotic life was Cassavettes' territory. Fact is, Hollywood will never be ready for uninhibited Mabel and her much crazier husband Nick. Nutty as she is, Mabel/Cassavettes does nothing but tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but. Hollywood at best, tells persuasive lies. So?, to get Hollywood ready for the Gospel of Cassavettes, the first thing that must happen is to banish the entire FX community; ship ?em to Alcatraz where they can make blockbuster cartoons for each other. Second ? the writers, directors and producers of said cartoons can go Vegas and try to `leave.' Those who remain will be entrusted with putting complex human beings who inhabit interesting lives and situations on the screen ? not `role models' who traipse through neatly-plotted, highly-improbable, beautifully photographed, committee-designed plots. Get my point? By the way, Gena Rowlands in "Influence" gives one of the finest performances of the sound era. See this film. See it now. Right now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is just another confirmation that Cassavetes, along with Dreyer and Tarkovsky, is one of the very small number of geniuses in film, whose every film is an extension of their genius -- some more mature than others, but impossible to be "bad"; they are beyond terms like "good" or "bad" -- they are the great art works of the century.This film isn't about a "crazy" lady; it's not about putting a woman in an institution; and it's not about people talking about your crazy wife, though all of this happens in the film. Those are merely the events that take place over the course of the film; what it's really about is our misunderstanding, our experience as an audience. Just like the characters, we misunderstand Mable's childlike actions. What Cassavetes does is turn *us* into children -- it's as if we're experiencing things for the first time all over again, because it's a totally new experience, the same with watching a movie like "Andrei Rublev." That is an amazing thing to pass onto an audience. That's why I've never been bored watching a Cassavetes film -- something is always happening, things are always changing. The reality of what we're seeing is always undergoing augmentation, so we can never get fully situated.It's never unrelenting gloom the way many so-called realistic films are (and this film goes far beyond mere "realism"); it's devastating watching it, watching Mable ask people if they want spaghetti one by one. But it's loving when Nick jokes about someone hugging her too long. It's communal during a scene at a dinnertable where Mable takes a pride in feeding "her boys." But each scene goes through a transformation as it happens. When Mable goes home with another man, he makes it clear that he's not to be used, but also that she shouldn't punish herself. It's not a screamy moment with a woman hiding in the bathroom; his avuncular twang is disarming.There's a complete lack of self-consciousness in the film, and I mean that in terms of the characters (during Mable's key freak out scene, Rowlands does, I think, go too far) -- that's why the kids are s terrific in the film. When a boy says, "It's the best I can do, mom," it's an incredible moment because it's managed to be included without being offensive, mugging for the camera with cuteness. The film has such a strange relationship with kids -- they're like little people. And if that sounds odd, you'll understand when you see the film. The characters are constantly changing their minds; they're so aware of themselves that they're unaware -- Mable doesn't realize she's giving off a sexual aura (despite the fact that Rowlands can at times look like a blond beach babe). As with Julianne Moore in "Safe," we don't know what's wrong with her. She's a frenetic, guideless woman trying to do the guiding.The way Cassavetes sets up the film, with ominous piano music that comes in when Falk is trying to speak, blinded by frustration; or setting the film inside this house with gigantic rooms, makes everything feel larger and emptier at the same time. It's like the scariness of the echo of something you'd rather not hear. Someone said that they wouldn't want a single frame of "2001" to be cut, lest the experience be changed. I think that applies more aptly to Cassavetes' films, because he never treads over the same thing twice, even when he's doing exactly the same thing he's just done. It's always something new. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brava, Mabel!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone views movies differently. I for one didn't think we were meant to wonder who was crazier Mabel or her husband. Cassavetes makes a strong, bold (and rarely voiced) point...it is the husband! Mabel loved her children, loved to dance and sing and for that she was committed. Her "unidentified mental illness" seems to intensify when her husband mistreated her and was physically or verbally violent...in my opinion going a bit crazy after someone slaps you is probably healthier and saner than being polite, demure, and rational. Mabel loves life, shows her love without apology, and is severely punished for it. Everyone else in the movie struggles to calm everyone down and avoid showing too much emotion. While this may be more socially acceptable it isn't sane or even healthy. Humans are emotional beings...I for one say Brava! Mabel. I think the director tips his hand and proves his point when Mabel's character comes home from the institution. She hasn't seen her children, husband, and family for 6 months and people assault her, some she has never even met, before she even leaves the car. When she does get inside the safety of her own home the people who put her away and told to forget the past greet her with small talk and politeness! Then when she finally sees her children after being told to "wait a minute" she says to herself that she wants to remain calm and show "no emotions." It seems obvious that this is a perfectly acceptable time to be emotional but fresh from the institution she know being normal doesn't allow you to be emotional. Emotions are scary, messy, and inconvenient and I for one am thrilled that John Cassavetes didn't shy away from them. This movie is a true original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Influence of What?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Freewheeling Cassavetes study of a marriage.I think its a misreading to conclude that either one of the main characters is "crazy". Clearly Mabel has what you could call a borderline manic personality, but there's little evidence that she is unable to look after herself or her kids. The fact that she gets committed says less about her condition than about the position of women in the society Cassavetes is depicting. There is no sign that the visiting kids are in any danger - their father freaks out only because Mabel's behaviour falls outside his view of the conventional housewife. Nick on the other hand is not considered "crazy" despite physically attacking several people and getting his kids drunk, because men are allowed a lot more licence. In the end he is as trapped by the social pressures on him as Mabel is, except his frustration is turned outwards, hers inwards.When the family are alone there is no problem, Nick's difficulties arise when Mabel is unable to fit the social role assigned to her - notably it is his mother who drives him to have Mabel committed. The "influence" Mabel is under turns out not to be alcohol as we first expect but patriarchy expressed via Nick, and society's limited and limiting expectations of women and of people in general. Put Mabel in a San Francisco commune 6 years earlier and she would look normal.A word on the acting. Having known people with rather more serious cases of manic depression I can testify that Gena Rowlands' acting is actually rather understated. Falk meanwhile is a revelation to those who know him only from Colombo - his portrayal of the inarticulate, confused, occasionally violent but still very loving Nick is perfect - he just IS this guy.Incidentally, you can see where Scorsese took many of the ideas for his most personal films from (notably "Mean Streets" which apparently he made after Cassavetes criticised "Boxcar Bertha") although he tidied them up and made them commercial. He even copied Cassevetes' lead here by putting his own mother in "Goodfellas".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cassavetes's absorbing look at the nature of marriage; Falk and Rowlands are spellbinding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While John Cassavetes is (rightly) revered for this film and other under his belt, wife/key-star Gena Rowlands is the most fascinating and emotionally gripping part to this work, Woman Under the Influence. Her role as Mabel was perfect in a film that sometimes was not even as it just tried for suburban truth. I was constantly curious about where her character was headed, and even more so by how I did not feel any desire at all to pass judgment on her. The moment I would have thought to myself "well, she's too nuts to like" the film would be ruined for me. And that is one of the more intelligent points to the film that Cassavetes gets at. This is, after all, a character-based film, with story merely in the background. And with his two main characters we get a look at what has been a stereotype for centuries- men are often brutal and stupid, women are crazy. In this filmmakers world, it's just not that black and white, however, but with the grays as pronounced as the highs and lows in a melodrama; it's just the way he sees things, and it's a unique way as well, where the soul and choice are the precedents over comfy dramatic circumstance.I loved the use of the camera in many scenes, how it felt like they just shot and shot and went from one spot in the house to the next, uncertain but knowing how to observe and look. In fact, the whole film has the feel of a documentary, with the occasional dramatic touch such as a close-up. But what turns it into being something special is that Cassavetes understands that Falk, Rowlands and the others can take his script and make it their own, very personally so. And as it happens, Falk finds some of his most daring work here as Nick, a character who in his own way has become as nuts as Mabel with the everyday grind of living (which for both of them is filled with people, talk, pure humanity). For those who don't like the easy solutions in dramas, or want to know the basics of the post-modern independent film movement, this is for you. It might seem to drag in spots, but it seems to be even more enveloping if one gives it the time to contemplate over those 'drag' moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Courageous and Uncompromising Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a breakthrough - courageous and uncompromising view at the family and at the marriage where both spouses love each other deeply but they are both not well, they don't know how communicate when somebody else present, even their own children. They could be happy on the deserted island but not surrounded by friends and families. I was fascinated by both, Peter Falk's and Gena Rowlands' performances. She looked like a little girl, trapped in a woman's body - confused, insecure, listening to what is inside of her. When she said to her children, "I hope that you will never grow up", she meant it because she never felt comfortable as a grown up. I could not take my yes off Rowlands. Her performance is on par with the best study of nervous breakdown I've seen, and this is Liv Ullmann in Bergman's "Face to Face".Peter Falks was also a revelation - I love him as Lt. Columbo in the TV series but he is a completely different character here; in a way, he is as mentally unbalanced as his wife is. The fact that he loves her but never hesitates to abuse her makes him terrifying - you never know how he will act in the next moment, and he does not know himself. Directing and writing are absolutely first class, and I am very exited to see more films by John Cassavetes, the Godfather of American Independent film-making and a father of American "New Wave" 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remarkable realism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Woman Under the Influence is an emotionally packed film that is centered around a capricious yet troubled housewife named Mabel. Mother to three young children and wife to her loving but volatile husband Nick, Mabel's mind is consumed with gaining acceptance and being reassured by those who surround her. Her psychological ability to keep up with normal everyday situations eventually reaches full capacity and she struggles to maintain emotional and mental competency.Director Cassavetes intentionally chooses not to grant clemency to the viewer. Imagine walking in late to an opera that's in it's third act ? that almost seems like what Cassavetes does to the audience ? introducing his depiction of a distressed family while they're in mid flight. Gena Rowlands' portrayal of the likable but frail Mabel is nothing short of incredible, and Peter Falk gives an equally remarkable performance as Mabel's husband Nick. This film is not for the weak-hearted nor for those seeking traditional entertainment. It's distinctive approach to such an emotional journey will undoubtedly impede many viewer's enjoyment - but for those who appreciate unique cinema and realism, it doesn't get much better than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesomely powerful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably one of the most intense films ever made, but to label it "intense" is to almost do it injustice. After all, almost all of the greatest works of art are intense, aren't they?Although it is quite possible to find certain themes that run through this work, the movie almost seems to resist themes. Within its two-and-a-half hour running time, John Cassavetes touches on some of the most indescribable emotional states that human beings ever experience.Technically, the film is equally excellent, with a nice minimalist score by Bill Harwood, softly beautiful cinematography, and fascinating editing. But all of this is merely in service of the brilliant performances by Rowlands, Falk, and the rest of the cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vertigo at the bottom of the Human Soul ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film about need, about affection, about a desperate need of affection that consumes the heart of Mabel Longhetti, the "woman under the influence" ... Some might say she's a troubled woman suffering from a personality disorder, others would say she's just psychotic ... they couldn't be wronger : she couldn't have a personality disorder, since she doesn't have any personality at all. Her character is totally diluted into that desperate need to please, to make people comfortable. The painful paradox is that this desire creates even more awkward and uncomfortable situations. But Mabel isn't aware of that, she can't understand that because she has buried any desire to be someone under the profound will to make people she loves, happy. She's sweet and tender, but this sweetness is wrong because it's inspired by a double fear of rejection and confrontation.Mabel crystallizes all these feelings and translates them in a behavior made of unpredictable excitability, a forced cheerfulness, a childish behavior she almost uses as a shield not to be hurt. She's afraid, and so are we, when we watch this poor woman trying to gain anyone's sympathy, just to please Nick, her husband. Mabel is played by the beautiful Gena Rowlands in what I consider the greatest cinematic female performance ever. Peter Falk is underrated as Nick, the husband who tries to deal with Mabel's condition, with such severity sometimes, that even himself can't control his own reactions.This is the set-up of the film, it's a drama, that couldn't have been directed by anyone but the great John Cassavettes. It's not a thriller, not an action film, yet it provided some of the most heart-pounding moments I've ever experienced. Never had a lunch and a dinner scene been so uneasy to watch : as it's been mentioned before, Mabel doesn't want to hurt people's feeling yet she unconsciously does. Mabel is like a little flame that might, at any time, light a bag of powder. Mabel creates real tickling-bomb situations, where the explosion is a burst of emotions, so human watching the film feels indecent. That's Cassavetes genius, this is no voyeuristic movie because we don't enjoy watching such devastation in a family that has everything to be happy. It's no voyeurism, it's realism, its cinema-verity as its purest form. Every laugh makes us smile, every shout makes us vibrate. Every silence makes us feel uncomfortable. We watch, we wait, and we never have a feeling that nothing is happening. Every look on Gena's eyes, every way she deforms her face, every noise or weird hand gesture she makes is the expression of a poor little a soul trying to communicate a part of what remains in the bottom, what remains of Mabel's personality.Confronted to Mabel's emotional clumsiness, Nick looks totally helpless, yet he's not exempt from reproaches. He's not crazy but his own temper probably aggravated Mabel's condition. He warns his colleague, "Mabel is not crazy", but he insists so much, you wonder why would someone say that about a 'normal' woman. The answer is that he thinks she's crazy, but loves her so much he doesn't want people to think she is. Nick loves so much his wife he puts himself in situations making him act like a bag of contradictions. Nick himself looks sometimes desperate as he doesn't know what he's doing, lost between his responsibilities as a father, a son, a husband who loves his wife, and a man devoured by a frustrated violence. Seeing him trying to act like a father makes you put Mabel's insanity into perspective. If Mabel acts under Nick's influence, Nick's life and behavior are equally influenced by Mabel's problem, the effects on the couple, on the family and the relationships with the friends are disturbingly heart-breaking.Disturbing, Cassavetes' masterpiece is because it reflects our own fears with a gripping realism, it's a journey into the deepest bottom of the human soul, made of anger, fear, sadness, happiness, reason, craziness, men, women, children, human relationships. It's hard to watch, it's uncomfortable, we can't help but feel sorry for the poor Mabel, for these poor kids, and even for Nick. They're not pathetic because they're not quite passive. In fact, the movie is full of noise, of loud shouts, of movements, this is no swimming in an ocean of tears, this is not your typical tear-jerker drama, it's almost like an emotional thriller. In fact, this doesn't need any categorization, this film makes other films look like films. "A Woman under the Influence"'s direction turns it into a chaotic journey into human relationships, and a very exhausting experience in reality.Gena Rowlands gave the best performance I've ever seen, and the fact she won or not an Oscar doesn't even matter ... these considerations normalize the movie when it's more than something you would nominate for an award. Cassavettes's masterpiece is a tunnel ride into the depths of the human soul with its dark sides, and a probable light of hope at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bruising Portrait of Mental Illness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eeesh, what a tough movie to sit through.This two and a half hour movie left me sweaty, exhausted and hollowed out. In its own way it's an extremely well done film, but I don't know that it's an experience I want to repeat. Director John Cassavetes follows a few months in the life of a family whose mother and wife (Gena Rowlands) is suffering from mental illness, and the movie consists of one long scene after another of her cracking up, or trying not to crack up, and the various family members' reactions to her cracking up. Peter Falk plays the husband and father who thinks that mental illness is just some silly nonsense his wife should be able to stop if she just tried hard enough. Rowlands has the showier role, but Falk is the revelation here. His depiction of a husband who blusters and shouts to hide his overwhelming sense of helplessness and fear is superb.Cassavetes's camera is relentless. We watch Rowlands suffer again and again in long takes and intimate closeups. There are times when you simply want to look away from the screen to help this poor woman preserve a shred of dignity. The highlight of the film (or low point, depending on your point of view) comes when Rowlands's character returns home from a stay in an institution, and her family works overtime to convince themselves that everything's fine when the audience can see clearly that everything is not.Bruising is the best word I can think of to describe this film.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another IMDb reviewer, Dolly_Lo, wrote a review in September 2009, titled "Don't Accept It". See below:"Cassavetes was clearly an intelligent, sensitive man with bold new ideas about making films. He wanted to be an auteur, to break away from the confines of the system and bring a new realism to the American cinema. For that, I applaud him.Unfortunately, as a member of his audience, I cannot applaud A Woman Under the Influence. Cassavetes took what could have been a fascinating topic (an insane woman) and somehow managed to craft a dull film, filled with lengthy, ad-libbed ranting and drawn-out scenes. He seems to have had a gift for capturing the dullest moments of a person's life on film, and it often appears as though he simply turned the camera on his family and let the motor run and run. This tactic would be acceptable if Cassavetes had captured something devastatingly REAL -- or even a kernel of something so real it touched the heart in ways a conventional film could not. Yet I found the performances, particularly Rowlands', to be artificial. I never believed for a moment that she was really insane. I have met people who are truly mentally disturbed, yet I've never seen any of them act quite like Gena Rowlands in A Woman Under the Influence. She played it like a very obnoxious, uninhibited woman who drinks a lot, and even that was confusing because we only see her drink once (at the beginning), but she acts drunk for the remainder of the film. There are some moments in which she taps into something real, but those moments are few and far between; she fails to sustain a seamless mentally disturbed character. Again, I applaud her efforts, but effort alone is not enough to make the performance ring true.Novice audiences who happen upon this film and see its high IMDb rating will no doubt feel compelled to love it and rate it highly, just to prove that they 'get it.' But don't be brainwashed by the hype -- judge for yourself. You don't have to pretend to like it.Like Woody Allen, John Cassavetes could be accused of solipsism in his film-making, seeming to find his own psyche and his own life experiences so endlessly fascinating that he couldn't imagine that to others they appeared presumptive and tortuously self-indulgent. But Woody Allen at least has demonstrated a gift for keeping an audience entertained -- he knows that a compelling story structure and a good dose of humor are essential to any movie. If Cassavetes had employed some self-discipline (and a sharp pair of editing shears!), A Woman Under the Influence could have stood a chance. But what's the point of making a 'realistic' film if the only people who can stand to sit through it are the art-house devotees and film students who worship Cassavetes as some sort of anti-establishment deity? Without dumbing anything down, I believe Cassavetes could have made A Woman slightly more accessible by keeping the pace moving with an actual plot, instead of presenting a string of 30 minute-long scenes of ad-libbed arguments. If you just make films for yourself and a few of your fans, you're just reaching the already converted. Watch this movie with your own set of eyes and make your own decisions about it. If you are truly moved and fascinated by it, good for you." I don't think I can improve on this review as it exactly reflects my own independent impression of this film. Dolly_Lo, however, has already read my mind and written it herself so I'll just site her and leave it at that. I would only add this. Take a hatchet and chop this film up. Put it back together anyway you like and it won't make a bit of difference it the outcome unless you choose to discard about 75% of it before reassembling. That would be an improvement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertain Me With A Hair Ribbon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, "Woman Under The Influence" purports a very compelling illustration of mental illness. The movie depicts a blue collar family which is writhing in a very desultory state of affairs to begin with. This upheaval is compounded when it winds up culminating with the wife's debilitating cerebral condition! The aggregate domestic despondence that the Longhetti family is experiencing has thrown all of them into a tumultuous tailspin! Because Gena Rowland's mental anguish is unable to pinpoint, comprehension of the cause of such a disease became a proverbial needle in a haystack. Peter Falk plays the husband, he is rough around the edges to begin with, his patience has an agitated overtone attached to it!! The fact that his wife is stricken with a psychological handicap now manifested itself into an excruciating breaking point that he and his family were coerced into dealing with! While the wife (Gena Rowlands) seems presumably normal most of the time, she really is not, furthermore, being normal only 75% of the time will not suffice, sorry to be so fussy!! Her condition ruthlessly erodes at this family's emotional resolve, and presents itself as a heinous source of consternation for all parties involved! All of the major characters in this film were continuously elaborating on the rudimentary components of a very precarious and visceral survival. Gena Rowland's dubious plight was the virulent culprit to everyone else's anxiety, (including the children's) Her little skit, which she performed with a hair ribbon, sort of explained what type of person she was. Such a caricatured display gave you the indication that she was basically intelligent and imaginative, however, her illness had rendered her mentally irrational. As a result, the entire family became burdened with an apocalyptic living nightmare!! The director of this film, John Cassevetes, is absolutely phenomenal at portraying a number of pejorative aspects of human nature that are extremely difficult for many people to stomach. Reality has the potential to offend many movie viewers whether it intends to do so or not!! "A Woman Under The Influence" evokes such a scrutinizing display of haunting realism, that it has been the noteworthy recipient of the critically acclaimed accolade of "stunningly unique" in the cinema world. Gena Rowland's troubles did not delve into dirges of neon accented insanity, rather, they dealt with a series of illogical obsessions. These compulsions wound up pontificating an acute itemization of the type of disconcerting mental disease that she was afflicted with. Peter Falk did not want to commit his spouse to a mental institution, yet, living with her became an obstacle course from Hell!! His predicament became a choice between the devil or the deep blue sea!! This film is totally fabulous!! John Cassevetes is one of the greatest directors in the history of Hollywood!! Made right around the time of "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest" "A Woman Under The Influence" deals with the same dreadful similarities to unexplained mental handicaps, and their lethal complexities. The directing to this movie is outstanding! The acting is incredible! "A Woman Under The Influence" possesses an overall ideological fervor which entitles it to be amidst an onslaught of movies which are categorized as emphatically first rate!!! TEN STARS!! Definitely!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brava, Mabel!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS Everyone views movies differently. I for one didn't think we were meant to wonder who was crazier Mabel or her husband. Cassavetes makes a strong, bold (and rarely voiced) point...it is the husband! Mabel loved her children, loved to dance and sing and for that she was committed. Her "unidentified mental illness" seems to intensify when her husband mistreated her and was physically or verbally violent...in my opinion going a bit crazy after someone slaps you is probably healthier and saner than being polite, demure, and rational. Mabel loves life, shows her love without apology, and is severely punished for it. Everyone else in the movie struggles to calm everyone down and avoid showing too much emotion. While this may be more socially acceptable it isn't sane or even healthy. Humans are emotional beings...I for one say Brava! Mabel. I think the director tips his hand and proves his point when Mabel's character comes home from the institution. She hasn't seen her children, husband, and family for 6 months and people assault her, some she has never even met, before she even leaves the car. When she does get inside the safety of her own home the people who put her away and told to forget the past greet her with small talk and politeness! Then when she finally sees her children after being told to "wait a minute" she says to herself that she wants to remain calm and show "no emotions." It seems obvious that this is a perfectly acceptable time to be emotional but fresh from the institution she know being normal doesn't allow you to be emotional. Emotions are scary, messy, and inconvenient and I for one am thrilled that John Cassavetes didn't shy away from them. This movie is a true original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In A Woman Under the Influence Mabel goes crazy, but I can see why she does go crazy. If I lived the kind of life she lived with the family she has I would go crazy too. Everyone in her family is off their rocker and not completely with it. She is constantly surrounded by people yelling at her and telling her what is best for herself and people that aren't the sharpest knifes in the drawer.To start with the one person closest to her in her life, her husband, Nick, is a little off his rocker. He is always yelling at her when he is home telling her how to live her life and to stop acting like an imbecile. The rest of the time he is working long hours at his job and he isn't there to support her when she needs support. The one person in her life that should always be there for her is never there and if he is, he is just making her feel worse. She relies on him for support and always goes to him first when she feels she is acting wrong and he does nothing to support her. When she comes home from the hospital all he does is tell her how to act, instead of comforting her, he just yells at her and tells her what to do.The other major people in her life are her parents. Her parents do nothing in her life for her. Mabel basically runs their lives because they are afraid to stand up to her and stand up for her. In the end she even asks her father to stand up for her and he doesn't understand, and when he does get it he still does nothing. They do nothing to help Mabel recover or to keep her from going crazy because they do nothing for her period. The only person that tries to do something for her is Nick's mom. Nick's mom is adamant about having Mabel committed. She doesn't want to have Nick deal with it so she has the doctor commit her. It seems as though everyone is against Mabel and they feel that having her committed is a good idea because then they won't have to deal with it anymore. They all want to live their own lives and do nothing for Mabel except for yell at her and make her feel like she is doing something wrong when she really isn't. That is why she went crazy, and why she had to be committed, it was her family's entire fault.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>' This woman cooks, sews, makes the bed, washes the bathroom; what the hell is crazy about that?''</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A woman under the influence is a film about an eccentric family with Gena Rowlands starring as a housewife who has an emotional disorder, she is behaving oddly, can't handle her emotions, doesn't know what to do, insecure, unsettled , lacking confidence in her deeds. While her husband seems to play the classic father role model, with their three kids that added a spontaneous and sincere climate to the movie.The scene where Nick brought his friends with him and Mabel asked whether they want to have spaghetti for breakfast. a while after, Mabel was talking oddly to nick's friends but their feedbacks were like '' well she is weird , but she has a kind soul'', until she kept asking and insisting the black guy whom she found cute to dance with her(which the black guy appeared to take it a bit too seriously)nick overreacted by asking Mabel to SAT HER ASS DOWN , again Mabel failed to make a normal family-friendly discussion.Mabel frequently suffers from anxious attacks that unfolded to us in a scene when she started building-up her own fictive delusions in which she starts to believe as asking where the heck her children are? Which is a question she can perfectly answer!!?? One of the key scene in the movie is when Mabel will to her children by asking them their opinion about her, the children replied '' I think you are smart, funny, and Nervous!!'', that's another aspect of the movie, How do the children see their mother? Do they think that she is crazy as the rest of the family or not? Certainly not. the emotions shared between the children and Mabel were really the only truthful ones throughout the whole movie, that is to say children did easily interact with their mothers behavior, notwithstanding the emotion disorder that Mabel is suffering from.On the contrary, for her mother in law and her husband both of them think that she is out of her mind and started to get nutty and mad so they decided to take her to a psychiatric hospital where she will be treated.After Mabel came back from the hospital, the whole of her family gathered in order to welcome her so she will feel secure and safe again, but it was until her husband cracked up telling to go back to her old self, starting from that scene both the husband and wife showed simultaneously that the real problem is with both of them.This is my first John Cassavetes film, which as I noticed is someone who focus more on the emotional experience than the quality or the awe that can a beautiful picture make as impact on us, thus the active camera seemingly going everywhere, so if someone is interested in the film he or she has to really get into the heart of the movie otherwise it won't be that attractive, therefore it will be difficult to grasp the crux of the movie. moreover John cassavetes loved to work with the people he already knew we can take his wife Gena Rowlands and his friend Peter Falk as examples, it means that John wanted to have that emotional fluidity which enable the movie to be more realistic and influential.Still, I can't say exactly under which influence Mabel was, sure it's an influence and nothing more because Melba still is a better parent than her husband, but I would extremely disagree with the people that naively qualify Mabel as someone crazy, out of her mind because '' This woman cooks, sews, makes the bed, washes the bathroom; what the hell is crazy about that?''.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film has rough edges, but the movie is gripping and terribly real.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Living with Cassavetes must have been a bitch.In an audio interview of Cassavetes, his says that "under the influence" means that women, after a few years of marriage, come under the influence of their husbands. Cassavetes' comments on men and women are shocking today, and I looked at the years mentioned on the DVD. "A Woman Under the Influence" was released in 1974, and the interview was done in 1975, after the film's successful release by a distributor. In the mid-seventies, women's lib was just taking hold. Cassavetes became a working adult in the Fifties, the decade all those women's lib books were written about. And here Cassavetes is in 1975 saying married women were under the influence of their husbands, that Mabel is under the influence of Nick (played by Peter Falk), under his control, he's the man of the house, and he's the one who tells her what to do, how to act. "Just tell me how you want me to act," Mabel says several times. Nick not only tells her, he screams at her and slaps her down a few times. Then he says, "Just be yourself!" It's a brutal film about the relationship between Nick and Mabel. Because Cassavetes wrote the screenplay and directed "A Woman Under the Influence," I give some credence to his commentary about the movie; I'm sure he means what he says, but I don't necessarily believe it's true. Cassavetes' films are works of art, and in all works of art, the creator puts himself into the work; his subconscious is in there as well as his conscious. So I take it upon myself to presume there's more in "A Woman Under the Influence" than its creator knows and understands.I think Cassavetes' scripts are emotional outpourings and not necessarily accurate portrayals of the details of, say, insanity. So when Cassavetes wrote the script, I don't think he knew anything more about insanity than the rest of us. But he knew Mabel and he poured himself into her.So although Cassavetes may say that Mabel is socially inept and not crazy, I'm willing to think he may be wrong. I look at Mabel's behavior, and I wonder if she has a borderline personality disorder. I wonder _what_ her problem is, but I definitely think she's not under the bell- shaped curve of normality. What I saw in the movie is a woman who desperately needs help and can't get it. (The most heartbreaking scene for me was when Nick was verbally abusing her and Mabel asked her father to stand up for her. The schmuck stood up and said he didn't understand why he should stand up.) Because Cassavetes didn't have the expertise to deal realistically with mental illness, we don't get a good understanding of exactly what Mabel's issues are, but we know her relationship with Nick is abusive. I saw Nick as sicker than Mabel, unable to relate to her as a person. His job comes first (he's on call 24 hours a day it seems, and he always goes when he's called), his friends come first (after working a 24-hour shift, he brings a dozen guys over unannounced for breakfast at seven in the morning), his mother comes first (too much to mention).Because I assume Cassavetes was writing and creating the movie from within himself, I have to wonder what it was like for Gena Rowlands to be married to him. Cassavetes clearly believed that wives were under the influence of their husbands, that the man was in control of the marriage. There Nick is slapping Mabel several times to get her under his control, yelling at her, and generally abusing her emotionally and physically.In the interview, Cassavetes says that Nick was wrong to have Mabel committed. Mabel isn't crazy. Her behavior isn't exactly socially acceptable, but that's because she's socially inept. At the end of the movie, Mabel comes home from the insane asylum, there's a homecoming party that falls into a shambles of accusations and yelling, Nick and Mabel have a physical fight with their three children screaming and trying to drag them apart, and Cassavetes says the movie has a happy ending because as they're preparing to go to bed the phone rings and Nick doesn't answer it. It's either his job or his mother, and Nick lets it ring as Mabel and he get ready for bed. That's a happy ending for Cassavetes.Rowlands gives a towering performance as Mabel. Gena Rowlands is an actress I've seen in many films, and she's among a very few whom I rank as the best actresses of the 20th Century. Peter Falk is superb as Nick. He's another incredible actor probably better known now as the bumbling Columbo on that TV show. Cassavetes knew how to cast. Katherine Cassavetes was very good as Nick's mother; a cold bitch in control of her son and in hatred of her daughter-in-law. As Margaret Longhetti, Katherine manipulated Nick physically as well as emotionally, grabbing his suit and manhandling him as she screamed at him that Mabel was insane and not a fit mother for Nick's children. I've described the plot loosely, and many will find the film difficult to watch. Life for Nick and Mabel is harrowing, and it's worse for their three children. It's all about watching Nick and Mabel spiral out of control and then back together - but the spiral is downhill all the way, even as they get back together. Our only hope is that their relationship will become more personal as Nick lets go the outside world that's been keeping them separated. My hope is that Nick realized he screwed up and that he lets his love for her control him more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real life under the influence of Cassavetes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Textbook gender related observation: When Jack Nicholson's character acts eccentric in One Flew Over the Cuuko's Nest, nobody will believe he's crazy. When Gena Rowland's character is eccentric in this film, everyone assumes she is.But that is only one of many realisations one makes observing A Woman Under the Influence. It is an intricate film, as was John Cassavetes a filmmaker who always filled his films with as many things as possible. Whatever his films were about, it always had to do with the truth of human nature and human life in modern society. In one example of great main leads in his films, Cassavetes' real-wife Rowlands is playing Mabel, the woman of the title, the house-wife of a Peter Falk's construction foreman Nick. Everybody knows that Mabel is more or less "crazy". Why does everybody "know" this? She is eccentric, has got funny mannerisms, at time she talks and acts randomly about things that make no sense. She is a human being with a desire to achieve, but nobody has ever given her attention or respect as an individual. I think Mabel's crisis is first and foremost that of an identity crisis. She is empty inside, Nick says. That's because nobody has bothered to look inside. Upon the demanding adult roles society demands on her, in particular the task of motherhood, the result is breakdown. She is a house-wife who spends her days wandering around the house trance-like, she cooks and cleans and sews and all the time she acts as if that somehow would be an absurdity. She tries to be nice to the guests but it all results in awkward silence and embarrassment. What should she be doing, then? Who is she?I think any viewer judging that she is in fact "insane" is an enemy to the film's intent and soul. Rowlands portrait of this woman is a hauntingly perfect portrayal of mental illness, certainly, but her state is that of extreme confusion rather than being someone who's simply "lost it". This is a woman aimlessly struggling to get out of a sea of under-nourished self-esteem and identity loss. We don't know how or when it started, but the more into the film we get the more we understand. Her mind is like a tapestry that Cassavetes gradually unfolds. In the first scene she is running around trying to place her children in the car for a trip with their grandmother's. Cassavetes knows that the clever viewer will relate the title's "influence" to that of gender related, domestic pressure. But that's only the beginning, I think, of what this woman is suffering from. It's not until the end we realise that maybe her family wasn't all that supportive of her, her father seems genuinely uninterested in whatever any diagnosis could be and her mother is just Mabel's fourth child. And if Mabel is crazy, Falk's character of Nick is certainly just as crazy. We don't realise that until after a while either. But he acts just as random upon situations he's not familiar with, and he also has bursts of eccentric (mis)behaviour. You'll have to look more closely to discover this perhaps, he is after all a friendly looking male patriarch and your brain is less inclined to view him as crazy.Mabel, who is still dependent on him and her domestic safety (that's the crux, I think, of her entire problem), says "I'll be anything you want" and Nick tells her to be herself. But she hasn't got a personality of her own, her emotions conflict her roles and duties but neither become clear to her. What's worse, nobody is interested in her, or has the slightest notion she might have anything worthwhile. "Be yourself", Nick says, but in fact he's not interested in who she is, and he is (without giving too much thought to it) putting demands on her, expecting her to fulfill her duties which is one of the very reasons she's all messed up. He's just not that clever. It's not just that he is a blue collar guy, he seems totally unable to communicate personally with his wife and, certainly, with his children. Basically, he hasn't got much of a personality either, but being a man that reasoning is considered as abstract and not a psychological case. In any case, Nick and Mabel surely love each other, but none of them have the capacity to cope with one another, or even comprehend their surroundings. Towards the end of the film, all Nick can tell Mabel is "Stop what you're doing". There's a childish desperation in him that is channeled through his gender but just as "crazy" as Mabel's lack of self-confidence and self-realising even.I said that you observe this film, and I mean it. It is more than realistic, it is profoundly real. Everyone have met couples like Mabel and Nick, couples who's lack of harmony and functionality is so great, it can't stay behind the social curtain. I'm saying that as point of reference. We've all left the dinner table at some point. "Maybe it's time we'd go home". As much as any documentary, Cassavetes films moved in real time, here and now, portraying life as it is. He knew that realism doesn't mean tragedy or brutality. Life is rarely dramatic and offers no cathartic finales. Life just is what we are living, it's not easy to comprehend and it doesn't offer security. For the future, we feel great hope but we also feel great fear. This film has got horrible moments, but it's horrible moments of truth. It's also got humorous moments of truth. These judgments are in a sense arbitrary. It's real life. It's the rarely seen beauty of truth that Cassavetes conjured up in his films. Rowlands is there to capture the essence of it, the notion that we are all human beings who need and deserve to be loved, no matter if we have table manners or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ground me down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie asks the questions: "What is insanity?", "When is someone so mentally unstable that they should be institutionalized?", "Who has the authority to commit someone against their will?" These questions could be the basis for a great movie, but I found the histrionics on display here annoying and, after over two and a half hours, exhausting.The woman whose mental status is in question is Mabel (Gina Rowlands) with Nick (Peter Falk) her working-class husband. I give Rowlands credit for exhibiting behavior that made me very uncomfortable to watch. I would find it awkward to be around her socially, but she was functioning as a wife and the mother of three children and, on reflection, I did not think her behavior was so extreme as to have her institutionalized. If she was edging toward insanity, then it was Nick who was driving her there. Nick would do things like invite a dozen of his fellow construction workers to his home for breakfast on the spur of the moment, after having worked all night, without even telling Mabel when to expect him. Instead of telling Nick to go jump in a lake, Mabel tried to accommodate him and his friends. Her behavior during the breakfast was unusual and off-putting, but not what I would call crazy. That scene seemed to go on forever.One thing I found unbelievable was how normal the three young kids were. I think any kid under the age of ten living with such screwed up parents would be having serious problems of their own.This film did not seriously address the questions it raised. For example, there was no discussion as to exactly why Mabel should have been committed and on whose authority that decision was made.For me this film was overly long, unpleasant, and tedious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With starring roles in "The Dirty Dozen" and "Rosemary's Baby", John Cassavetes was one of Hollywood's brightest lights during the late 1960s. Today, however, he is perhaps better remembered for his innovations behind the camera - the author of 'Shadows', 'Faces', 'A Woman Under the Influence', and 'The Killing of a Chinese Bookie', films shot in a gritty, Cinema Verite-style that featured strong performances from a repertoire of actors including Seymour Cassel, Ben Gazzara, Peter Falk, and Gena Rowlands."A Woman Under the Influence" is the apex of Cassavetes' artistry and perhaps his greatest film. It recounts the story of Mabel Longhetti (Gena Rowlands), a housewife/mother with failing mental health. The film tells of the incidences that lead her to suffer a nervous breakdown, the toll Mabel's struggles have on her husband Nick (Peter Falk) and three children, and her shaky readjustment to normal life after a 6-month stay in a mental hospital.Gena Rowlands' performance as a troubled house-wife is powerful and electrifying. Cassavetes' style is frequently imitated but rarely bettered, and the extent of his talent is on full display here. The documentary filming helps draw us into the inner world of the family, and we as an audience are subject to the Longhetti's eccentricity and dysfunction but also the love and togetherness that offers a sort of transcendence. There have been many indie movies and docudramas centered on familial dysfunction since, but in terms of poetry and emotional resonance, "A Woman Under the Influence" is peerless.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Woman Under the Influence is a remarkable family piece. An under rated masterpiece that has an excellent portrait of family life under the spell of mental illness. Rowlands is outstanding in the main role and so is Falk as her tough as nails husband. The family dynamic is seldom so harshly and sweetly portrayed. It clocks in at nearly 2 1/2 hours, but it is well worth the time. This is a pretty intense film and Cassavetes' documentary, home movie style approach will not appeal to everyone, but there's no denying how well-made and very well-acted this picture is. Always interesting and pretty much down right provocative down to the closing credits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Acting, Horrible Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From actor and independent writer/director John Cassavetes, A Woman Under the Influence gives the viewer a look at a working class family with a problem of mental instability. The husband, Nick (played by Peter Falk) is a blue collar worker who has trouble showing his wife, Mabel (played by Gena Rowlands) the amount of attention that she deserves. From the onset of the film, it is obvious that Mabel is very quirky and strange, but only a few minutes later it is clear that she is much more than that. Crazy. Bonkers. Out of her damn mind. Nick tries his hardest to hide this from his co-workers, and after she has a particularly strange incident at dinner, he asks her if she'll be okay, as if he's trying to deny Mabel's illness. Her problem only spirals from there.I did find some particular problems with this film. I guess these problems were mostly present in the story, and the way some of the character acted toward the end. Mabel has been committed, because, frankly, she's nuts. Then, six months later, she's ready to come out of the hospital, and her husband throws a party to welcome her back. He never acts stupid in the beginning of the movie. Why would he invite all these people, some of them strangers to Mabel, over to his house when his wife is in such a fragile state? It's simply idiotic. Later, after Mabel comes in the house, Mabel's father has a huge outburst at Nick, screaming at the top of his lungs about not wanting to eat spaghetti. His daughter has just gotten back from six months of rehabilitation, and the thing you want to do is keep her calm, and he goes nuts over spaghetti? A few minutes later in the film, Nick brings Mabel into the stairwell and forces her to do the things she did when she was mentally unstable; make her weird noises and gestures. Didn't he send her there to make her better and not do those things? There were various other parts that occurred after this, but it would just be redundant to look at them in more detail. I guess I just had a serious problem with the decision by Cassavetes to have his characters act in this way. It simply didn't make sense.However, although I had problems with the ending of the film, there was one aspect that really redeemed it; the acting. Gena Rowlands played an amazing crazy woman. There were times when I forgot she was acting, where I got so caught up in her wild gesticulations and crazy talk that I was actually scared of her. She was amazingly convincing and intense. However, I was also impressed by the rest of Mabel's family. Peter Falk played a very strange character, and I almost thought he was crazy himself, because of the awkward way he handled his children, his job, and especially the situation with his wife. I also usually don't appreciate child actors. But the young people who played Nick and Mabel's children in this film were phenomenal. It really felt like they were Mabel's children, because they seemed so attached to her and were so interesting in helping her with her problem. I think their performances are one of the things that kept this film together, and without them it would have made the film less realistic and less intense.In general I wasn't impressed by this film. The story was jumbled and unclear, and the characters acted in ways that made me wonder who wasn't insane in the movie. The only saving grace were brilliant lead acting roles of the Longhetti family. Their realistic dialogue and powerful acting kept the film together, and are probably the only reason the film has ever amounted to anything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Character suffers from mental illness - the viewer suffers from boredom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Around half it's time, this movie is as pleasant and entertaining as watching an unedited tape from a psychiatric ward. Gena Rowlands does deliver a very good performance and Peter Falk also does a good job. But the rest?Yelling, yelling, yelling. And some more yelling plus slapping in the face. Little to no action. For 15 minutes we are forced to watch actors eating a meal. That's right, that is what that scene near the beginning is all about: the actors are just eating, cameras rolling, script not existing. It's just improvisation and little editing afterward, with totally boring end effect. And something similar is repeated at the end: they're just cleaning the table for four minutes. How fascinating and mind openingThere is almost no music score; which is always a risky move, because it makes the movie more realistic but at the cost of being less appealing to the audience. So on the one hand with have a "realism of no music". But on the other we have a scene with a rope at the dig site: one of the characters (while being angry) manipulates (probably without bad intentions) the rope, while other character uses it at the same time to go down a slippery hill; and falls down. At there are two problem with this event. The first one: there would be no way to manipulate the rope with such ease (especially with one hand), because of the weight of that (fallen) character. The second one: the issue of perpetrating the accident is newer addressed by authorities or even the rest of the work crew later on. So that is quite unrealistic roll of events. And so, a mixture like that just makes you think of the whole movie as a chaotic endeavor; a movie with an MO of "My name is John Famous-Actor-Slash-Independent-Director Cassavetes and I am taking a serious subject of mental illness, but do not care about the rest, because I have already used up seriousness on being an self funded independent director". And on the technical side of this picture there are problems with bad lighting and bigger problems with even worst soundThis movie is so boring and hard to digest, that unless you are a film (or medicine) student, you shouldn't approach it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who is the craziest one in the movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gena Rowlands is cast as the woman under the influence of some undefined mental disorder. Her acting is superb; when the camera is in a close-up of her face, her chops are just better than anything I have seen. Her facial gestures, the eyes, furrowing of the brows, nose twitching, everything - is the best I have seen in an actor portraying emotions and thoughts without having to say too much. Wow.In my opinion, it was her husband, Nick (Peter Falk) who was the one who needed to be put away. He portrayed a man who was angry, and he was angry and violent throughout the movie, for the most part. Poor Mabel (Rowlands), she was at the mercy of his anger and emotionally did what she had to do to cope.But this was a different era; it was shown, through Cassavetes' writing and direction, that it was acceptable then, in some American blue-collar homes, to slap women around, threaten people, give children alcohol, as long as it was the man of the house doing it.How times have changed, and it was through movies like this, where bizarre social behavior that was on the borderline of acceptable in that era, may have been a catalyst for the audience to examine their own emotions and mores.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Woman Under the Influence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A Woman Under the Influence" is an unrelentingly harsh film, much like "Requiem for a Dream" or "Leaving Las Vegas", but unlike those, this one is shot like a documentary, and while both of those are a little exaggerated to give a stronger impact, this one is a depressingly realistic portrait of mental illness. Since the film is shot so bluntly, it mostly relies on the performances of the actors for its power, and, man, do they deliver. Gena Rowlands and Peter Falk give 2 of the best performances that I have ever seen as a mentally ill, and possibly alcoholic and morphine addict (although this is only implied), woman and her angry husband who desperately wants her to be normal, to the point of trying to force this upon her.The film starts with Mabel sending her children to her mother in law's house, expecting her husband to come home since he promised her a "love night". He ends up not making it home for the night and Mabel gets black out drunk and takes home a man, seemingly unconsciously. It is implied that she is raped and when she wakes up in the morning she thinks the man is her husband, Nick. It is implied that she has been like this for a while during the next scene at a dinner table. Nick loves her, yet he is very reluctant to get help for her and he doesn't want to believe she needs it ("she cooks, she cleans, what's crazy about that?"). One moment she will be crazy and the other she will be calm. This attachment to her and desperation from her husband has caused her to go unhelped for a long time. Finally when she does get help, Nick becomes incredibly stressed and everyone at his job tries to confront him about it. This only makes him more agitated until eventually he pushes his coworker down a large hill of dirt, on accident (they're construction workers). He breaks many of his bones and Nick leaves to bring his kids to the beach to "have fun", but he is very on edge and is just as forceful to his kids. He eventually gives his kids beer on the ride back because they will "sleep like a rock", and it's this desperation that only makes his wife worse and his kids more attached to his wife. Once his wife comes back, we are very aware of how fragile the whole situation is for both Nick and to a greater extent Mabel. Our greatest fears come true however when we learn that Mabel is still crazy and Nick is still just as angry. The film subverts our expectations and hits us hard with the reality of the situation, and even though Mabel goes back to normal after her breakdown at the very end, we know that she could go right back to being crazy in the next few moments. The fact that Nick can't tell her that he loves her makes this even worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Woman Under the Influence: Indie at Its Finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The self-proclaimed hipsters and 'indie' film watchers of our generation have probably never heard of the 1974 film directed by John Cassavetes, A Woman Under the Influence (and if they have, props to them). I hadn't heard of it until I did some research on the best Independent films of all time and it came up on top in several lists. I was intrigued, watched it, and came to the conclusion that this movie is a perfect example of what an Independent film should be. For those that have never heard of the term 'indie film', or simply do not know what they entail, they are simply movies that are not produced from a major film studio, and with significantly lower budgets than other feature films.A Woman Under the Influence was a low budget movie, costing only $500,000 to make. This is a drastically lower budget than, say, The Godfather: Part II - which came out the same year - with a budget of $13,000,000.Budgets are something that matter when it comes to these types of films. The budget calls for things to be simpler, such as costumes and sets, props and makeup, music and lighting, and so on. For example, the house in the movie was an actual house that they borrowed for the movie. They didn't go out and build a new house because it simply wasn't in the budget.The movie almost seems like a more realistic reality to me because the budget was so low. There are no special effects, no fancy lighting, no fancy set; everything is raw and natural, which makes the aesthetic of the movie so unique.Films in this genre tend to have the same feel to them; the aesthetics are always similar in some way or another. They are like a work of art that capture something real, and address things that large budget, big-hit blockbusters do not address. In this particular movie, the main character, Mabel Longhetti (played by Gena Rowlands - wife to the director), is mentally ill. She's crazy, and unusual, which you can see from the start. And her husband, Nick (played by Peter Falk - our generation may know him as the grandfather in The Princess Bride), sends her away to a mental institution for six months. Movies from that time never really addressed mental illness in that way, or any way for that matter, which is one reason that this movie makes such a good film.Independent films often times appear in film festivals before they become known to the public . A Woman Under the Influence appeared in both the San Sebastian Film Festival (where Gena Rowlands won Best Actress and John Cassavetes won Best Director) and the New York Film Festival. Winning awards catches the audience - and critics'- attention, which gives the movie the attention it deserves, but I believe this movie deserves more attention than it currently has.I absolutely recommend this movie. Though, I'll admit it's not for everyone, it sure is a film that lovers of independent films should watch. It's sad, it's dark, and it's a roller-coaster of emotion, leaving you with no resolution in the end. The film is a work of art, just as an Independent movie should be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nick Longhetti (Peter Falk) is an angry hard working blue collar worker. His wife Mabel (Gena Rowlands) has some mental issues. She's stressed out and manic. She gets into drunken one night stands. He flies into rages over her craziness. He loves her and never physically harms her. She's sent to a mental institution for 6 months. He throws a large party for her return but his mother berates him for inviting so many people. Even with only the family, she is overwhelmed by the experience.This is a showcase for Gena Rowlands' acting abilities. She is worthy of her accolades. Her performance is completely immersive. Peter Falk yells a lot and matches her intensity. This is a movie for the acting classes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Triumph for Actress and Director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The late John Cassavetes and his wife, Gena Rowlands were able to carve an impressive niche into cinema history while Cassavetes was still alive, but the zenith of their work together had to be the 1974 film A Woman Under the Influence an explosive and blistering look at mental illness from a perspective that has been rarely explored on screen.Most films dealing with characters with mental issues take place after the diagnosis has been made and the character is either in therapy or has been committed. This film takes a different tack as we meet Mabel, a suburban housewife and mother of 3 played by Rowlands, whose mental issues initially appear to be something as simple as bipolar personality, something that can be dealt with via medication, but it is clear as we see Mabel interact in various social situations, that there are serious mental issues going on here, but for some reason, no one really wants to talk about it. Her husband Nick (Peter Falk) knows there is something wrong, but is still harboring a great deal of denial about it, despite the fact that he absolutely blows up at anyone else even hinting at the fact that there is something wrong with Mabel. There are moments where we see Nick punishing Mabel for behavior she doesn't know how to control for the sake of his own denial and it is heartbreaking to watch. It is also heartbreaking that Mabel is unsure of what's going on but gauges everything through her children....as long as her children love her, she doesn't care what anyone else says. This film is such a troubling watch because we want Mabel to get help and we see the people in her orbit walking on eggshells around her instead of telling her what she needs to hear. It is almost 2/3 of the way into the film before Mabel is actually committed and even sadder is the fact that when she's released, she really doesn't seem any better.Gena Rowlands delivers the most powerful performance of her career as Mabel, a master class in acting that won her a Golden Globe and an Oscar nomination. Rowlands is gutsy and unhinged and absolutely riveting in a role that would be any actress' dream. Mabel is warm and sad and frightening. The scenes where she tries to fight Nick's decision to commit her and her eyes literally roll in the back of her head and the scene where she's in the street screaming at strangers in an effort to find out what time it is because she has to meet her kids' school bus are absolutely devastating. The school bus scene is especially powerful because Mabel appears so mentally shredded you're convinced that she isn't even in the right place to meet the bus and you're surprised when the bus actually shows up. Rowlands so completely commands the screen with this performance that during the 30-45 minutes when her character is not screen (when Mabel has been committed), the film comes to a screeching halt.Peter Falk is explosive in an almost Brando-esque turn as Nick, a husband who is at a loss how to help the woman he loves more than life. Falk has rarely been so powerful on screen and mention should also be made of the director's mother, Katherine Cassavetes, who plays Nick's mother.A once in a lifetime cinematic experience thanks to evocative, in-your- face direction, a pair of devastating lead performances, and a story that leaves you with hope and wonder about what happens after the credits roll.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rowlands at her Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mabel Longhetti (Gena Rowlands), a wife and mother, is loved by her husband Nick (Peter Falk) but her madness proves to be a problem in the marriage. The film transpires to a positive role of madness in the family, challenging conventional representations of madness in cinema. The film's creation and reception has an interesting story, perhaps almost as interesting as the film itself. Despite strong critical acclaim for his past work, Cassavetes had a hard time getting this one into theaters and may not have succeeded without the help of his fan Martin Scorsese...Why such trouble? The film went on to be one of the most critically-acclaimed films of all time. "Woman Under the Influence" was one of the first films selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".Nora Sayre, "Miss Rowlands unleashes an extraordinary characterization ... The actresses' style of performing sometimes shows a kinship with that of the early Kim Stanley or the recent Joanne Woodward, but the notes of desperation are emphatically her own." And Roger Ebert noted that this was "perhaps the greatest of Cassavetes' films."Indeed, the film is more satisfying than Cassavetes' earlier work. While perhaps not as influential as "Faces", this is the film that allowed Rowlands to really shine, and managed to be both mainstream and subversive at the same time. For those unacquainted with Cassavetes, this would be a good place to start.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In some utterly weird, totally ass-backwards way, kind of like Cassavetes' "Inland Empire," in that it seems like his entire aesthetic in pure distillate form. The editor's hand is simultaneously predominant and completely absent; the eye [ sry] of the camera follows Rowlands' beautiful, over-the-top performance unblinkingly, so in one sense it's entirely understandable that some find its putative 'realism' convincing-- the reality, of course, though, is that we -are- experiencing an edited, beautifully contrived, entirely -cinematic- reality. The cinematic medium wielded with all the acute precision and unabashed passion of Vertov's kino-pravda; form elevated to heights that transcend content-- like a later American genius [ viz. Korine], art creates its own reality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Mabel is not crazy, she's unusual"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching this, I can say I am literally fascinated by John Cassavete's films. Although this is only my second experience with his directing, I can say I love the sense of reality and humanity he transmits through his characters. The first film I watched was "Shadows", where the movements of the camera give us the sensation of witnessing a real life story, and although the summary said it was about interracial relations, I thought it was really a film about people, simply.A Woman Under the Influence is not very different, for that matter. It's a film about something that happens every day, and it might even have happened to one of us, to someone we know. It's a film about incomprehension, in this case there is a "reason" for it (though it shouldn't be), Mabel has a psychotic personality structure - using the right Freudian term ? but that kind of failure of communication might as well have happened to someone who is not psychotic, who is just a normal housewife, and I'm sure it has happened. Gena Rowland's performance is absolutely spectacular in what is certainly one of the best female roles in the history of cinema.I think we should begin from the common point, which is acknowledging that, having a psychotic personality organization does not necessarily mean you are mentally ill and cannot have a family and live a normal life. The neurotic organization was always socially accepted, and I guess it wouldn't be crazy to say it's a part of pop culture, having become popularized through countless characters, such as Woody Allen's. The problem with the psychotic is that, the only cases we hear of are those in which the person is involved in some sort of breakdown, and yes, it is likely that it will happen at some point, but it doesn't mean they have to be institutionalized. Mabel was an example of a well-adapted psychotic personality, I don't remember if it's shown whether she takes some sort of medication or not, but she supposedly had a family to back her over and was fine at home.What happens is that this family fails to understand her needs and simply refuses to listen to her. I'm not saying she was 100% happy as a housewife or that some kind of external and medical help isn't needed in some cases, but the episode that made Mabel's husband decide to commit her was far too ordinary to be taken so seriously. It shows total incomprehension from the husband and everyone else involved. Most of the time I thought Mabel was the sanest person in the movie, no kidding. Of course, these events take place in the 70's, when it was much more common for families to simply have their loved ones committed and be excused from all responsibility, placing the sickness only in the person who was supposed to be taken care of and loved in a moment of crisis.I didn't really understand the ending, though. Throughout the entire movie, we see Mabel struggling to have her voice heard and not being considered by her family, something that is shown especially in the dinner scene. Later on, Mabel and her husband have a final discussion where things seem to be just like they were before she went to the asylum, or even worse, and then the ending shows them reconciling. I thought it was too unreal for them to end fine after a physical fight and a suicide attempt. I wonder if John Cassavetes didn't want to go all the way or if he really took the previous events for granted and decided to have a lukewarm ending. One way or the other, I thought it was a great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A polarizing character study on the disparity between genders in tackling mental illness. Mabel is a young mother of three and wife to blue-collar worker Nick, who is desperately trying to keep up appearances while his relationship with his wife is falling apart. Despite Mabel's seemingly odd behaviour, she is a loving mother and her children adore her but one night Nick doesn't come home at night, and Mabel begins to fall apart at the seams. As her behaviour becomes increasingly bizarre, her relationships begins to crumble and Nick's frustration mounts as he struggles to get a handle on his family. Shot documentary-style, 'A Woman Under the Influence' is one of the most honest portrayals of 'group-think' culture and the intimate effects of gender inequality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Woman Under the Influence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Oscar and Golden Globe nominated director John Cassavetes (Shadows, Faces, The Killing of a Chinese Bookie), I found this film in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, I was certainly interested in watching it for this placement, and the leading stars sounded appealing. Basically in Los Angeles, housewife and mother Mabel Longhetti (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Gena Rowlands) is slowly developing strange mannerisms and her behaviour is becoming increasingly odd, she wants to please her construction worker husband Nick (Peter Falk) who she loves dearly, but he is concerned about the way she is being in the company of other people. He believes she is becoming a threat to other and herself, so he reluctantly has her committed to an institution to undergo six months of mental treatment, but left alone with their three children he seems no better or wiser than his wife, he cannot fulfil the role society expects him to play, and he is changing in the way he relates to and reacts to his offspring. Six months pass and Mabel returns home, but is clear she is still mentally and emotionally strained in doing so, and her husband seems ill prepared for her return also, he at first planned a welcome home party with guests, but at the last minute cancels and send the guests home, knowing that this is foolish. Mostly only close family, including Mabel's parents, Nick's parents, and their three children, go to greet Mabel for her return, but even this is overwhelming for her and for Nick, and the evening becomes another night or torment and anguish as the couple emotionally and psychological argue. During this very bad fight Mabel cuts herself, and following these events the rest of the family leave, she and Nick are left alone to put the children to bed, but they cannot sleep knowing that the distress may mean her leaving again, they profess their love for their mother, she eventually gets them to bed, and the film ends with no real resolution as Mabel and Nick get ready for bed themselves. Also starring Matthew Cassel as Tony Longhetti, Matthew Labyorteaux as Angelo Longhetti, Christina Grisanti as Maria Longhetti, Katherine Cassavetes (John's mother) as Margaret Longhetti, Lady Rowlands (Gena's mother) as Martha Mortensen and Fred Draper as George Mortensen. I can see why Rowlands was nominated the awards, she is pretty convincing as the mentally unstable wife who struggles to keep the family she loves, and Falk is equally good as the husband struggling to cope with his wife's erratic behaviour, it is a simple premise, a wife having a mental breakdown, being sent away for treatment, and returning with no real change, I agree that if the film was judged just by acting it would is fantastic, but being just over two hours it does feel a little too stretched, otherwise it is a most watchable drama. It was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay for John Cassavetes. Very good!</fullReview>

The film shows how children are affected by the occurrences and how well- intentioned family and friends can also lend to the chaos we observe.Rowlands is just terrific by the contortions she makes sometimes acting as if she is Lucille Ball-like and other times just driven to madness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cassavetes' tour de force</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This John Cassavetes' film is a sincere and in-depth examination of mental illness on family life. Featuring powerful performances from both the leads, it is a compelling drama with strong emotions.Most of the events in the films are focused on the two lead characters. Mabel is a middle aged, married woman who has completely dominated her life to her family. Her eccentric behavior seems inappropriate at some stages but the character is treated with utmost care. One could never go as far to call her mad. I believe, it is her excessive love towards her family and fear from seeing them harmed causes her mental depression and she looses the control. She is the woman who is concerned about everyone else, who just couldn't leave anyone unsatisfied. Her past is not known to us but her sensitive emotional states are nicely presented throughout. I think Mabel is a woman who just couldn't let be herself because of all of these, that's why under the influence. Gena Rowlands gave one really really great performance.But it is not just Mabel and her mental illness which the film is all concerned about. As I said earlier, it demonstrates how it the family life. Peter Falk gave equally good performance. It is his character whom I equally sympathized. Some viewers see him as the one who is really ill and states some of the scenes showing his questionable behavior. But I do not share such school of thought at all. I believe, he was a true family man. A hard-working man, devoted father and a husband who fights almost everything to protect his wife. He never believed in his wife's illness though admitting of not understanding it. He stands by Mabel but couldn't stand it when her actions started involving his children. His character and children towards the ending shows how much it takes to love someone.Movie has camera-work quite similar to documentary films, matching with film's plot that helps it up building realistic atmosphere. All in, it is a compelling triumph with masterful film-making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of realism to stand up for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A Woman Under the Influence" - like other Cassavetes films - is a difficult one to put into any specific drawer. Which is a good thing as it is able to push different buttons for different people and keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat and actively involved throughout. Not in the Hollywood kind of way, mind you, full with overblown drama, enhanced with musical cues and a heart-warming love story at the core, but rather in a way that makes you care, feel that it matters, that gets under your skin as a person, not just as a movie consumer. The main reasons why the film is so engaging and absorbing lies in the fact that it draws from convincingly portrayed lives rooted in a Seventies reality, the lives of a blue collar husband and a housewife with two kids. It's a familiar constellation with the ordinary domestic mayhem between troubles, challenges and duties, the need to show emotions and to suppress them at the same time, and there's always the urge to escape. It all comes down to a life on the edge, where people as partners in marriage are trapped in the confines of their everyday existence.On the surface "A Woman Under the Influence" is about a woman going mad and people in her environment having to deal with it. But thanks to the characterisations of Gena Rowlands (Cassavete's wife in the part of Mabel Longhetti) and Peter Falk (as her husband Nick) a rather simple story like this gets complex and multi-layered. Cassavetes delivers cinma vrit the way it is meant to be. The film shamelessly shows us our fears, the emotional abysses between people, confronts us with the resulting traumas, all based on the influences we have on each other. It makes us suffer with both protagonists and their efforts, their eventual helplessness to deal with the situation, to find the common ground of the relationship. And in a struggle things go overboard. "Will you please stand up for me?" Mabel asks in one crucial scene, and if we don't judge first but listen, we might also hear what she's trying to say.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I concentrate on Gena Rowlands or Peter Falk, I am mesmerized by the story. This movie has intentional awkward scenes and takes time to dwell on the characters behavior when you just don't know what to say. The movie does move, it does have a purpose and a story to tell, and it stays with the story. It does not deviate. Sometimes the slow timing adds to the tension and other times it's boring. When it's boring, I start to notice that some of these other characters are uneasy as if they have not had a lot of experience as actors. Gena Rowlands does not have that problem. I was completely taken in by her performance of a mentally ill person.

		<shortDescription>A Tale of Woe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fresh to Cassavetes' canon, A WOMAN UNDER THE INFLUENCE is tiresome and exhausting for my first-time viewing, throughout the entire running time (155 minutes), we watch a series of intense clashes between Mabel (Gena Rowlands) and Nick (Peter Falk), sometimes catalyzed by their family members or close friends, and the repercussions includes Mabel exacerbates her mental disability and the collateral damage to their 3 young children. Using intimate and irregular camera-work to demonstrate a fly-on-the-wall authenticity opens a maximum door for thespians to show off their superlative working-class liberation of feelings and emotion, Gena Rowlands, immerses into her character with optimum dexterity, from her quirks of sputtering and word-mouthing, the fervid and persistent advocacy of opera aria to the time-bomb of her squeamish frailty, we never know when will she explode, whilst time is ticking and the wait is taxing both for the players and the spectators. She also shines in her warmer facet during the heartwarming episodes with her kids. Mabel is a dream role any actress would be ever craving for, Rowlands is the performer nonpareil for her concentrated and committed dedication of embodiment without falling into the pitfall of borderline OTT. Falk, a flawless pick for an ordinary blue-collar, bedeviled by his wife's unhinged nature and stumped by the futile and consuming communication, improperly catches the worst moment to throw a surprise party for Mabel, his quandary could be easier to be related by the audiences, besides, his trademark out-of-focus eyes betray his frustration and it is certainly the situation is at his wits' end. This tiny budgeted film is a family workshop, kinfolks and friends constitutes the cast, e.g. both Cassavete's mother Katherine and Rowlands' mother Lady plays the in-laws in the film. Overall the film is a challenging project which unflinchingly debunks the underbelly of the marital bond, "till death us do apart" is so harrowing to listen under this circumstance. During the conjugal tug-of-war, Cassavetes pluckily interposes their children into the game, at the eleventh hour, it is the kids' relentless endeavor thaws the edginess induced by the heavy volley of laborious squabbles. Finally I must bellyache about the befuddling time-line, when Mabel brings a stranger to her house at night, it is the next morning Nick and his workmates come back from working, they have an unpleasant midday dinner, then it is the morning after Mabel's mother brings the children to home before school, right? Then how come later Nick's mother accusing Mabel for adultery at "last night"? Help me out here, it does bugs me, otherwise it is an indeed unique film of its own kind, although it doesn't gratify my satisfaction thanks to the frivolous and dreary altercations, I am always coveting for a bit more from the story plainly extracted from the lifelike experience, other than accentuates the tedious and irksome sensory overkill, it would be nicer if a sensible approach could lead us to a palliative nostrum to set our cerebral phase back to a normal state.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cassavetes: Meditations on the original face I</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With this, Cassavetes joins my list of cinematic masters who evoke a transcendent humanity, next to maybe six more. This is rare praise from me. The man cuts deep, and in progressively deeper ways which I'm going to note here, extending a discussion that began in previous comments.The easy thing to say is that it's an emotionally shattering movie, as visceral as any of the films on madness, better in fact. There had been many good films in this niche prior of course. If you want detailed visual metaphor for the woman's situation, you'll find a great set in Red Desert. A more angsty one in Through Glass Darkly, together with harrowing emotion and Protestant guilt. Repulsion has the more eye- grabbing hallucination.Then of course is what many reviewers mention when talking about Cassavetes. Usually dubbed as realism, it is the lasting impact of lived experience, the intense focus on the moment-at-hand. You live through a Cassavetes film and all that. Work for some, transcendent for others. But you can read about that elsewhere, here I want to leverage a somewhat different set of notions which I think reveal a deeper genius at play.The Cassavetes effect is something I have not encountered anywhere else.See, it is not just the tethering to moment or the undefined horizon. Ozu had done this, Antonioni and others. Altman was trying at this time. Marienbad was fully an evocation of trying to define horizons. A small advance in what Cassavetes does is an extreme fixation to moment. Remarkable in itself, but in the long stretch it would achieve nothing but nihilism. Buddhists, whose main area of expertise is exactly an awareness of emptiness, what is usually transferred in the West as 'being in the moment', caution against single-minded fixation on fixation. It's one of the most tiresome things I know in my own meditation, trying to be in the moment.Cassavetes is similarly exhaustive up until a point.Confining our gaze may prove so suffocating some viewers will want out, that's the gamble: the reward can only be apparent in retrospect. During my first watch of Husbands, I was exasperated and ready to write him off, that is until a certain point. But it matters that we work to stay tethered to that moment-at-hand, mirroring the husband's commitment to his loved one, the commitment to departing friends in Husbands, to forging a relationship in Minnie and so on. It matters that we stay in that space, investing of ourselves.Within that space is the lovely Rowlands, as much an auteur in that space as Cassavetes is of the overall film. Her performance here tops any of Brando's in improvised creation of the situations. Without a horizon herself, Cassavetes would famously refuse directions during the shoot, she throws herself in aching, innocent, calligraphic madness. It is the shyness of wanting to please and be a part of others but not knowing which parts of you to bare in what time, the most touching ordeal. An actress unsure of the extent of her performance. Implicitly, she seems to know the scenes with music (starting with the black coworker who breaks into tenor song over dinner) are partly hallucinated by her character, and knows they are not necessarily not happening. Hence, the confusion and hesitated reaction.And then she goes away.This is where the movie starts, very slowly. So far it has all been preparation, fixing the mind for meditation. As in previous films, this narrative shift creates desire, lack, expectation, human horizon. In Husbands it was the trip to London, in Minnie the proposal. It's a masterful effect at work, so risky because he leaves it completely up to the viewer to stay tethered. Masterful because it asks of us to discover the character as her close ones have known her since before everything, before the anger, confusion and labels?not mad, wife or mother, just the sweet face you've tied your life to.Now we want to see her back, see how she is, like her husband and children do. And because we haven't had any distractions leading up to the shift, no subplots, music, montage or visual flow to break the concentration, it registers in a tremendous way. Lesser films would discuss memory, here we're made to have memories?but if and only if we have been patient in the knowing. I haven't seen anything like this until the recent crop of Asian films like 2046 and Syndromes and a Century, and there without one tenth of the livingness achieved here.Is that how it ends though?No, and here is the deeper genius for me. This may be the most heartwarming film I've seen for just the last scene, a wholly new glimpse as the couple tidy up their place, alone at last, safe, calm in each other's presence. And then it ends. Another shift and horizon, this time to who these people are away from all the public crap of life. And how poignant? Love as quietly taking care of the same house together.As in previous films, we have presence in the moment, presence over time, the shift to horizon, and second shift in the end. Fixing the mind to one place then releasing so you hover over the world, awareness rippling outwards. This may be the closest to meditation any filmmaker has come, and I'm usually a stickler about this. Oh, it remains work, but the cumulative world built over the course of several films has never been equaled in cinema for my taste.Something to meditate upon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mental illness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fascinating study of mental illness. The question is, who is the one who is insane, the husband or the wife? Also, how do you decide when someone is mentally ill and needs to be put away? These are just some of the questions raised by this wonderful and thought provoking movie.Gena Rowlands delivers what is arguably one of the greatest performances of all time. Peter Falk is equally brilliant in his role. Mix that with the genius film-making of John Cassavetes and you have the greatest drama of all time. This is film-making of the highest degree.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know Nick Longhetti. Growing up with Nick makes it hard to watch this movie. Falk's closed-minded , ignorant, angry, paranoid, misogynistic...performance makes unsettles me. Rowlands' performance is equally unsettling. Is Mabel sane, is she insane? Is she weak, is she strong? Is she a victim...Together they are spectacular. Oh, cannot forget Cassavetes. He delivered a small movie that kept breaking out of itself. Each tight scene was filled with so much tension, drama, emotion, suspense, fright...it existed outside of the screen. I felt more than the scene possibly allowed, and for that Cassavetes' defined his legacy. This movie deserve a viewing from anyone who wants to watch a portrayal of reality that is often either choked or overwrought in other films. Mixing these two characters is brilliant. In other realities Nick would be married to an equally strong partner who tempered him. Mabel would be married to a caring, patient partner who allowed her security. In this reality they are sad people who are too insecure to walk away from each other. I strongly recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutal, honest and exhausting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film stunned and then I watched it again. It contains two of the greatest performances in movies that are out there. Rowlands is incendiary and almost touched by greatness and Falk is astonishing. I have read a couple of reviews that say she overdoes it and thus it is hard to sympathise with her. Make up your own mind and see it. For me they were a perfect match. The way the story unfolds and the way Cassavetes directs has such a looseness that is like breathing in fresh air when you have been fed dull monotonous fayre via the Hollywood meat grinder. This really is a film to cherish. I had seen 'Faces' years ago and it stuck in my head but I never managed to track any others down so I am now going through all his movies. He really is unique and the way he sets the scene and allows the actors room to manoeuvre, the way they inhabit the frame, the fluid camera-work, it's all beautiful to watch. Two scenes really stand out for me. The scene where Nick comes home with his workmates and they all sit in the kitchen and Mabel embraces them with such vigour that it sends Nick over the edge, is cinema at its most brilliant. It is a captivating scene and contains such spontaneity (even though it is all scripted) you would swear they are just making it up. Mabel is such a great character that you feel for her as she is such a sensitive soul. I didn't imagine that she was crazy but that everyone around her was uptight or too stiff to relax and see the beauty around them. These people don't stop to smell the roses but Mabel does. The scene where Nick goes crazy when the kids have no clothes on is a good example. I mean the kids have no clothes on, big deal, they are just kids playing. The way Nick misreads delicate situations and goes overboard with things is such a clever demonstration of the complexity of relationships. Yet the tenderness they share deep down is enviable. The moment she returns home and sees her children is heartbreaking. It is all shot in extreme close-up. I found the scene intensely moving and almost inescapably emotional. Cassavetes had me gripped. Please, please see this film. It is a masterpiece of film-making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are sick and tired of Hollywood phony clichs, corporate fairy tales and artificially constructed overblown drama pretending to address serious issues, such as Crash 2004 be sure to see this film. It is a real film about real life and most of all it saves you the fakeness of the Hollywood editing system and pompous camera movement. The function of this film is to make you think and ask questions not to entertain you so do not expect that it is an easy to watch flick. Most importantly it is true art made without serving the rules and regulations of commercialism. It is art for its sake and that is what makes it true and real.</fullReview>

I submit that she is still the same old Mabel, and that Nick's slap is an attempt to get some semblance of "normalcy." In other words, this normalcy is what Nick can live with, but make no mistake, nothing has really changed. And that, to me, is the beauty of the end of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dying swan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Woman Under the Influence is one of those films that moves the audience so much that we forget we're watching a film. Gena Rowlands' performance as Mabel in this film is heart wrenching in the most sincere sense of the term. Cassevetes does a wonderful job reducing all of the fancy film techniques that have become so popular in film today and focusing solely on the experiences of the characters. Peter Falk also delivers a stellar performance as Mabel's husband, Nick, making the audience wonder which of the two of them is the craziest. While Cassevetes never comes straight out with a reason for Mabel's insanity or for the way Nick treats her, the reasons are heavily implied by the actions of both of them, their parents and especially by the things Mabel says when she is having one of her episodes.Rowlands' performance is electrifying. From the very beginning, the eye is drawn towards Mabel, running around trying to get her kids ready for a weekend with their grandmother. The first hint that something is off (besides her jittery and nervous behavior), is when she goes to get her son's bike from the other end of the driveway and ends up riding it (somewhat) to the car. Something's odd about her, but at the same time, magnetic. We can't take our eyes off of her, wanting desperately to get inside her head and see what she's feeling. What follows is a seriously depressing view of motherhood, life as the wife of a working class man, and womanhood in general. Mabel tries incredibly hard to be the perfect mother, the perfect housewife, the perfect daughter, the perfect woman. But in her mind, she is always falling short and no one seems to hesitate in pointing it out to her. She's endlessly disappointed with her life and seems to be obsessed with fun. The night she sends the kids off with her mother to spend a romantic evening with Nick, she gets stood up. Nick is a hardworking guy, but he's not happy about it. He seems to understand at least a little bit that Mabel requires extra attention in order to stay sane, and when he can't give that to her she goes over the edge. So when Nick is called into work on the night of their romantic get together, Mabel turns to a stranger in a bar for the attention that she is in need of.The excursion Mabel takes on that night is the first real evidence the audience gets that suggests she's a bit more than just neurotic. She gets confused, calls the man Nick, invites him back to her house, freaks out when she realizes the kids aren't in the house even though she was the one who had sent them off the previous evening. There's something seriously wrong with Mabel and by the time Nick and his co-workers arrive at the house the audience is feeling confused about the situation, but also sympathy for Mabel herself. Nick seems to understand that there's something wrong with Mabel, but he doesn't want to admit it. He invites all his co-workers over for dinner with the two of them (far from the romantic dinner they had planned for the night before), and Mabel has an episode. The men are afraid of her it seems, or at least incredibly uncomfortable by the questions she asks them and the situations she puts people in. She means well, but she crosses the line between fun and inappropriate several times and Nick finally scolds her for it. Once Nick scolds her, we see the other side of the crazy Mabel character. She starts babbling, making incoherent statements and odd noises and hand gestures. She's trying to express her frustration with the control Nick has over her, with how he wants her to act. She's struggling between the version of herself that she loves, and the one that Nick wants her to be. If it was up to her, her and Nick would have lived a happy life together having fun singing and dancing every day of the week. She has some episodes where that is all she will talk about?fun, dancing, singing, and the love she has for Nick. But once someone yells at her or says something negative to her, she's brought back to reality and the frustrations of life become too much for her to handle.A major theme that was represented in the film was the effect of music on the characters. There are numerous times when the characters were walking around singing to themselves, mostly opera. The opera seems to be a release for these characters (Mabel and some of the working class men that Nick works with). It's an escape from the realities of their world, which is what Mabel is most interested in. Also, the theme of the dying swan comes up several times in the film. Mabel plays the music from Swan Lake for the children and her to dance to, but focuses on the part where the swan is dying. When she returns from the mental hospital, before she cuts her hand with a disposable razor, Mabel jumps on top of the couch, humming the tune of Swan Lake and dancing, talking rather incoherently about the dying swan. It becomes very obvious that Cassevetes wants the audience to recognize Mabel herself as the dying swan. She is the beautiful being that is dying, who is trying to revel in her last sane moments on earth, but is losing them fast. All she ever wanted was to be seen as that swan to others, only beautifully alive rather than gracefully withering away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Love, marriage and madness--cinema verite style. Harrowing, free-flowing melodrama about a mentally-ill housewife in the modern-day and the effects of her behavior on her husband and children. Filmmaker John Cassavetes was criticized at the time for creating what some saw as a preconceived tour-de-force for actress-spouse Gena Rowlands, yet she seems to fully inhabit the neuroses of this unstable woman, giving the role enough batty flourish to cover several performances. It's a stunning personal achievement for both writer-director and his star, but as an entertainment per se the picture is rough-going. Personal taste will have to decide its ultimate success, but certainly Rowlands proves herself to be an actress of virtuoso means, and underrated Peter Falk is also excellent as her exhausted husband. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mixed bag.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wanted to love this. I think that John Cassavetes uses a powerful aesthetic technique that gives the film a very authentic atmosphere throughout. A lot of the time it felt more like we were just living with these people then like we were watching actors reading written dialogue. Almost improvised in a lot of ways, or I'd even go as far to say like a home movie. Peter Falk delivers a tremendous performance as the husband of Gena Rowlands' mentally unstable Mabel. Cassavetes constructs the whole thing as a study on the role of madness in the American family, how it buries in and makes an impact on the entire household.Rather than strictly making it a study of the psychotic Mabel, he makes an intimate point in exploring Falk's Nick, the loving and eternally trying husband. In Falk you can feel that peculiar blend of resentment and adoration towards Mabel, constantly lashing out at her mistakes but eventually coming back down out of the everlasting love he feels towards her. This is where the work by Cassavetes shines the most, in exploring that strange balance that occurs with this kind of love, with this kind of person being in a marriage. The film is deeply uncomfortable at times, which I mean as a huge compliment, when we see strangers and even friends gathered around witnessing Mabel's madness and being completely unsure of how to react. I think a lot of scenes go on too long and there's no reason for this to be over two hours, but the eerie sensation Cassavetes is able to bring out of these extended interactions was very interesting to me.Where the film doesn't work for me and what dragged it down a lot, unfortunately, was in Rowlands' performance. I wanted so badly to adore her, but she was so inconsistent. Her more reserved moments are brilliant, an unsettling picture of a happy woman with a madness lurking within her, but it's her more manic displays where she totally lost me. In all of her ticks and eccentric behavior, Rowlands felt so calculated, none of it coming off naturally or with any sense of believability. It was honestly hard to watch at times, not in the good way, seeing a film with such an approach of authenticity be dragged down by a performance that was absolutely anything but. It all leveled out somewhere around the middle for me, able to greatly admire the work of Falk and Cassavetes but deeply disappointed by Rowlands.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie many years ago and remember how I was taken away by it. Then I saw it again the other day and was prepared to be a little disappointed cause my experience is, that movies rarely are unaffected by time. In the 70's it was common to understand mental illness as arising out of a dysfunctional communication pattern in the family. The one who got sick was viewed as a symptom-bearer for the whole family which was why treatment to a larger degree consisted of family-therapy. And I think that this movie is a product of that way of understand mental illness. Actually this movie reminded me of this way of understanding mental illness and I am grateful for that.I am glad to say that the acting especially from Rowlands and Falk is something quite unique to watch. Their performance is simply outstanding. From my work I couldn't recognize Rowlands behavior but I don't think that a movie in that respect have to portray reality. She found her way of showing us how a woman under the family's influence behave. I really think that Falk showed us that he has a great potential for acting. It was the sudden shifts in mood between displaying aggression and then showing us how vulnerable and confused that he could feel that impressed me. So authentic.The drama is almost unbearable to watch so despite the good acting I don't think I will be watching this movie again in the near future (read on IMDb that Rowlands persuaded Cassavetes not to set this up as a play as it would not have been possible to play Mabel Longhetti on a regular basis).Still. If you like psychological drama and other movies like "streetcar named desire" and "who is afraid of Virginia Wolf" you really should see this one too. /Simon</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe I need to see a couple more Cassavettes flicks to get to the bottom of the self-indulgent charge. I find the leisurely pace here enticing, with lots to look at most of the time and all kinds of stuff going on left and right as Gena Rowlands melts down amid the more contained neuroses of her extended family. I DO get the charge that the depiction of mental illness here winds up as another variation on the performative, sentimentalized, rain-man-cute Hollywood syndrome. But - I don't really want to complain when the whole point of the picture is to show the continuity of dysfunction among the entire cast, with the clear message that Rowlands' sin is that she's the wrong KIND of crazy. As the movie went on I found myself concentrating on Peter Falk as the husband; here is a guy who does not know how to play the hand he's been dealt, and fails all over the place, but you can see him trying to do what he's been told is right. Just as the ending seems to be heading for total meltdown, things suddenly normalize, and all the drama turns out to be one component of a sustained domestic routine, which goes on. Which I guess makes this King-of-Hearts-meets-Ivan-Denisovitch, an unlikely but attractive coupling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Woman under the Influence is one of the most beautifully acted films that I have seen in recent years. The Performances by Peter Faulk and Gena Rowlands are spectacular. While Rowlands plays the stand out role of a mother/wife, who has slowly and methodically grown distant and quite mad over the years of their marriage, I believe that Faulk's performance is just as impressive and equally mad. In dealing with a wife who is as immature as his own children, Faulk is reduced to dealing with her in extreme and embarrassing ways.The tension begins when Nick, played by Faulk brings his co-workers back to his house in the morning after a long night shift, which probably was not the smartest idea because he had broken a long standing date with his wife the previous night. I suppose he brought them back for his own protection, thinking that maybe the presence of other might help to suppress an incident with his wife. Her bazaar awkward interactions build until Nick has to yell at Mabel (Rowlands). From there it only gets worse. Mabel's fickle and fragile mental state makes for a strange situation for her children. After practically kicking them out of the house in the morning, a few minutes later, she is begging for their presence once again. She waits in frantic anticipation for the bus to arrive and collects her children at the foot of the bus like a mother has not seen her kids for years. The way in which she acts towards the father of her children's play date is that of a twelve year old. The father does not seem comfortable at with leaving his children with a woman who he thought to be drunk, but later finds out just to be mad. After he tells her so, her demeanor immediately changes once again and she has a look of shame, like a child who has just been scorned by a disappointed parent. Faulk arrives in a fit of rage that seems a bit over the top. He strikes her and it is in this scene that one realizes the exhausting effects that his wife's strange behavior has on him. It drives him to lash out and act in equally irrational ways. His patience is constantly being tested.This is a common theme throughout the movie. It seems that every family member seems to have the right idea of how to fix this family and is not afraid to voice their opinion. Nick's mother is one such character. One of the final scenes is when the family is gathered around the dinner table after Mabel's return from the hospital. Nick's mother and other family members refuse to accept Mabel's request to be alone with her immediate family thinking that the best thing for her is to have people around. This ends badly and Mabel is almost forced into a type of relapse. Nick is constantly trying to keep a dictatorial control over his family no matter what the cost - understandably so, as he has been pushed to this point psychologically and physically as he strikes Mabel into sanity once again.The movie is a strange demonstration of family life. I think it's extremes are meant to display that all families have their problems and deal with them under their own circumstances. Is it right for others to intervene? Who makes that decision? The voyeuristic quality in which the film was shot also incites a feeling of guilt in the audience for witnessing such atrocities and also instills a feeling that they are a present member of the family and a first hand witness to the troubles that they are experiencing. The movie was enrapturing from beginning to end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cassavetes draws us into a world of domestic chaos and madness in a way we were never before</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Cassavettes is one of the American filmmakers that changes the way Hollywood would look at cinema in the years to come after the 60s and 70s. This is perhaps his strongest film from a dramatic point of view. He certainly is one that would look for a different kind of film-making based mostly on the performances of the actors themselves, never letting fancy camera work get in the way. While this may have been annoying in some scenes of Faces, in a work like A Woman Under the Influence it makes us become more involved in the chaos of the Longhetti family.He certainly is helped by all the cators he chooses in the film. He really always casts his parts well. Peter Falk's personality finds its home in a character like his Nick. he is wonderful. Equally as wonderful is Gena Rowlands, as the cuckoo woman under the influence. It's hard to believe that both these actors were never really in the A-list, they act like they are two of the best actors that ever lived. And a big chunk of that is because Cassavettes' way of directing always suits the characters, the story and the situation that his films portray. The chaos and mental instability of the character of Rowlands is shown very well by the blose and gritty movements of the camera and the grittiness of the picture itself. We become so aware of the situation that we are in it. There are no black screens ending the scenes, the fights are long and unbearable, the uncomfortable situations that Rowland's state of mind leads to are never ended abruptly, we often stay for the whole events, stay for the beginning, the middle and the end of every single little tragedy that happens everyday.The husband shouting, the wife making strange sounds, the kids crying. These are powerful images that set important tones, and it's unbelievable when they are juxtaposed in succession by displaying the happy moments when they all laugh, as they all sit on the bed like a happy family. The husband trying too hard to make things happy and forgetting what happy things are like, the wife being unaware of the real world, and being unaware of being unaware. This film is deep, and even though it's over two hours, you will want more, because you hardly ever get the chance to be so drawn into a film the way cassavettes draws us into A Woman Under the Influence.WATCH FOR THE MOMENT - The whole final sequence. The chaotic atmosphere and the fear that something terminally terrible is going to happen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Mabel's not crazy, she's unusual." Nick puts on a brave face over his wife, Mabel. He wants his workmates to accept her. Nick is an L.A. construction supervisor. He is played by Peter Falk, better known to TV audiences as Columbo, the taciturn detective. Here, Falk has room to develop a complex character ? a man devoted to his wife but struggling to cope with her eccentricities.Mabel is, in fact, slightly mad. Gena Rowlands was Oscar nominated for her performance. The craziness is not overly engaging at first. She picks up a man at a bar. She is frustrated and annoyed when her husband cannot get promised time off. When she serves Nick's workmates dinner, she is vague and then flirty. This famous 'spaghetti' is almost embarrassing in its realism and almost seems to outstay its welcome. But when madness becomes seriously disturbing we see such trivia in stark contrast. Mabel had been weird, but happily so. She didn't hurt herself or her children. But incarceration and electric shock treatment will take away all trace of levity. Never a threat to others, we sense that it is Mabel who feels understandably threatened. And how much of her 'madness' is from misunderstanding, male chauvinism, and intolerance? John Cassavates, reviled at the time (he had to hawk his film in an attempt to get it shown), is today remembered as an auteur of almost legendary daring. A keen proponent of method acting, his script was tightly written and only the actors' attitudes to the dialogue are improvised. Yet the film has a free-wheeling quality often emulated many years later (Half Nelson might be a good example). The low-budget style threatens to look amateurish if it doesn't ultimately succeed. Fortunately, A Woman under the Influence succeeds in a way that rips your guts out. The image of a woman teetering on insanity is forceful and disturbing. The film goes beyond mere bravura performance ? subtle family dynamics are recognisable enough to make us question dismissive stereotypes such as the Neurotic Woman or the Alpha Male Husband. How much are they influenced by circumstance? Characters are all dealt with sympathetically and it is unsettlingly easy to identify with the strong traits - determination to hold a family together in adversity ? which makes us vulnerably open to the more distressing themes.A Woman under the Influence is a treat for serious film lovers. But some viewers may find the style too serious or demanding of hard work. It refuses to be entertainment - even in the grand melodrama style of comparable movies such as Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf. It also switches jarringly between theatricality and outdoor action scenes (necessary to show Nick's work persona, his inability to cope with the children when Mabel is away, or Mabel's sorrowfully unbalanced outer shell when she frightens people just by asking them the trime. Flawed and uneven, A Woman under the Influence is still a jewel to be treasured.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cracking Under an Invisible Pressure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A seminal movie that showcases a character-driven study of a family coming apart at the seams due to the incompatibilities of the two most closely involved: the husband and the wife. It's never clearly explained what it is that is eroding away at Nick and Mabel Longhetti. She seems an open, if a little clumsy, housewife who does the best she can to please people even when she may, at times, overstep her boundaries. He's your typical Joe Schmoe -- a hard construction blue-collar worker who has little time for Mabel's "look-at-me" antics. It's hard to imagine what it is that drew them together, but whatever it was, it's gone like memories in a scrapbook -- one that Mabel holds on to as if her life and her sanity depends on it.Mundane episodes end in an escalating sequence of confrontations between Mabel and Nick. It seems that any attempt of Mabel "being herself" (a phrase Nick repeats throughout the movie, especially at the end) is immediately followed by an act of sudden violence on his behalf and ensuing mayhem in the household that usually includes the ever-present children and the intruding mother-in-law, Katherine (Katherine Cassavetes, necessarily shrill). It's as if Mabel had something within her that he lacked, and any display of it would be enough to send him into a fury of lacerating words and threats to kill her and his entire family while following this with "comforting words" which state that it's not her fault, but someone else's.One of these confrontations ends in Nick's decision to commit Mabel to an institution -- an act of sheer cruelty, because she as of yet hasn't had any diagnose of being mentally unstable. Gena Rowlands, in realizing that she's to be sent to a mental facility, has one of the most intense nervous breakdowns ever seen on film, an acting tour de force that surpasses Bette Davis' own breakdown scene in both JUAREZ and OF HUMAN BONDAGE for the length of its duration and the documentary feel throughout. It's no wonder that Rowlands had told Cassavetes she wouldn't be able to perform this night after night in a theatre else she'd wind up, like Mabel, in a hospital. It's a grueling experience to even watch this happen to her.The irony of A WOMAN UNDER THE INFLUENCE is that there is no solution to this nucleus of dysfunction. Nick is so much a control-freak that he forces her to act according to his will even when she returns home, visibly herself, shy at first but more open later on -- and here it all comes out and rears its ugly head. She's not the problem. He is. He's what Mabel is under, and unless the story would allow her to divorce him, she would always be suppressed, a woman whose voice has been cut short by the insecure masculinity of a man who can't stand seeing his partner under her own light.It takes guts to show a marriage at this stage of decomposition, especially when there are children involved. The theme had been explored before, but with this movie John Cassavetes pocketed his first real glimpse into the abyss of the cycle of spousal abuse that seems to go on forever, without any redemption for either character. Shocking, at times brutal and horrifying, A WOMAN UNDER THE INFLUENCE is the kind of film anyone interested in independent cinema should watch, not just for its cinema-verite feel, but for the sheer power of Gena Rowlands and Peter Falk's acting as they literally become their roles. It may take a little patience -- the movie is a little long -- but that comes with a reward of seeing an experience of a different kind being shown, naked, to us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Am I under the influence?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Post viewing the film A Woman Under the Influence (1974), by director John Cassavetes, I couldn't help but feel like I was the one losing my mind and falling out of reality. The high tension confrontations and odd mix of attempts to hold onto ones own self quickly captured my attention and drew me into the life of Mabel Longhetti (Gena Rowlands). As a blue collar, suburban housewife, Mabel slowly loses her grip on reality and just as sadly, her life as well.If the last name didn't give it away, the family is Italian, which holds a connotation of being very family oriented. Incorporating this idea, it is no wonder why she tried so hard to connect with her husband and children, although most attempts had disastrous endings. A perfect example of these embarrassing and shocking moments was the spaghetti dinner Mabel hosted for her husband, Nick (Peter Fawk), and a couple of his fellow construction workers. Her effort to try and seem normal, by asking Nick's peers to sing a song and dance, illustrates just how out of touch she is from the "norm".In observing Nick and Mabel's relationship, I couldn't help but feel like they were a perfectly odd couple, complete opposites. The ways in which they interacted and quarreled only brought me to the conclusion that opposites must attract, because the two are on totally separate sides of the spectrum. Nick's poor excuse for acceptance of his wife, I believe, even added to her illness. Her eventual nervous breakdown and commitment to six months at a psychiatric hospital drew her even further away from her family. It was at this point that I transposed her illness as a force acting upon her, rather than being a part of her. A force just trying to keep her down and pull her away from anything she feels a part of, or slightly a part of.The film was intense to follow, the plot being as sporadic as Mabel. The extreme scenes of high drama stretched every relationship Mabel had. Her madness exploited any closeness Mabel had with her family. The viewer is brought into an enormously emotional story, and can't help but become attached to Mabel. This may be the reason why I felt like I was going insane with her. The film had its attractive moments, along with repulsive, encompassing the feeling of being on an emotional roller-coaster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Woman Under the Influence Cassavetes captures the everyday life of a household run by a man. Nick Longhetti, played by Peter Falk, is Mabel Longhetti's, played by Gina Rowlands, husband. In his attempts to keep her from going over the edge into being neurotic, we are left questioning which character is truly the crazy one. The movie feels like you are watching real people doing their thing. Although it is not particularly entertaining to watch a wife staring at a wall and drinking, Cassavetes expertly produces a strong sense of her character by doing so. He thinks about the situation from a normal point of view, rather than going for the Hollywood affect. For example, the noise when Mabel enters the bar after her husband stands her up, is equal to their talking level. It becomes hard to hear them, but in reality, bars are noisy places and it is hard to hear the other person. Cassaveti is also not afraid of silence within the film. He artistically films the awkward silences that follow Mabel's jerking of her head as she mumbles to herself.Gina Rowlands does a fantastic job with portraying a woman who does not know what is happening with her life. Mabel tends to forget reality within the film. After sending her kids away for the weekend with her mother, Mabel screams for her mother and kids the next morning, and she has no recollection of saying goodbye to them. Similarly, she asks Nick, "Aren't you gonna ask where the kids are?" Whenever something goes wrong in her life or she becomes confused she starts to make faces, jerks her thumb while making a sound, and ignores her surroundings. As a result of this, it is evident that she desperately tries to control what is going on around her. She will copy people's voices and actions to be in the spotlight and get a laugh. For example, when she answers the phone call where Nick's work wants him to come in, she repeats word for word, "What do you think he's superman?" Her sanity seems to depend on laughter which is evident from the scene where she comes home from the hospital and tries to tell a joke to her family, but Nick shuts her down and refuses her the opportunity to laugh. She needs the laughter as a release in her life, and since Nick suppresses it, she holds it all in and her body and mind release it by jerky and subdued movements of her hand and head. While Mabel needs to free herself from Nick in order to be happy and sane, Nick depends on Mabel for his sanity.Nick has to be in control of his household as the man of the house. His children and his wife are expected to obey his rules and orders. If they fail to do so, he takes what he sees as the necessary actions of abuse and force. When Mabel goes to the hospital, it means that he did not live up to his own expectations. This failure results in his going crazy. He starts drinking like she did, and even allows his young kids to get drunk. This parallels the scene where Mabel throws a party for the kids and leaves them in charge of having fun. Both of them were irresponsible with the children, but thought that they were doing what was best for them.The final scene where the family is sitting down at the table with her is very perplexing. She says that she "wants to be calm" when things start to fall apart for her once again. It is evident that the shock therapy that she mentions has trained her to show little emotion when what she needs most, is to show all of her emotions. She tries once again to make a joke, and is shut down by Nick saying, "Be yourself." What he does not understand is that she is being herself, but he has controlled her for so long that he does not know who her true self is. Her sanity is hanging by a thread that Nick ultimately tears at.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has Cassavetes ever watched a Cassavetes film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mabel is suffering a mental breakdown. This movie follows her disturbance, her family dealing with it, and her subsequent return in order to show an unconventional and more true-to-life account of mental image. A lot of it is claustrophobic and irritating, but it's one of those movies of which one can't deny its powers.Now I appreciate Cassavetes' approach to cinema, but I just can't like it, since a large part of it seems directly produced to be completely unlikeable. This movie clocks in to about two and a half hours, a long feature even for a typical film, but as it's mostly long scenes of uncomfortable reactions, it gets a little hard to take at points. And near the end, when the husband guy is shouting, "God I could kill you, I'm going to kill you!" I believe others could stand with me when I say that every bone in my body wished he would kill someone or someone would die just so that some form of change, closure, or denouement could occur. No such luck, but that's the point, isn't it? I like Faces a lot better, but this one I think is a lot more remarkably structured. It seems almost as if it doesn't have a particular reason to end, just ending whenever, but the fact that it's split into very long, distinctive scenes (something like five or six of them) helps to realize that this film works a lot in real-time, showing domestic issues that tragically go on just about as long as we spend watching them... longer, actually, but please, let's not encourage him! Let's face it. There is NO entertainment value in it, there is little compelling about it, and it's about as nice to watch as sticking pins in your eyes... and yet, it's still a good movie. I just can't help but wonder if Cassavetes has ever watched one of his own films.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possible spoilers and a comment on the title</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching "A Woman Under the Influence," I am highly doubtful of the accuracy of its title. If, as viewers, we believe that the influence affecting Mabel (the Gena Rowlands character) is alcohol or drugs than we must have watched only the first thirty minutes of the film. The excessively domineering Peter Falk character (Mabel's husband Nick) would drive any person to acting unusually; indeed, Mabel's mental illness seems more of a result of her loving him rather than any internal mental problem.The childlike innocence of Gena Rowlands' insanity is touching if even a little overdone. As a whole the acting is good even if the direction does not focus on the actors' best moments. The direction, however, seems to shift from one moment to the next without any self-consciousness. This mirrors Nick's behavior--totally unaccountable when presented with a less than ordinary situation. Both the director and the main male character exercise power in restrictive ways that damage the film and the lead female character, respectively.Essentially, the focus of this film seems off. A possible (and convincing) viewing of the film would suggest that the disagreeable Nick receives no punishment for behaving poorly; it is only because of Mabel's undying love for him and need to protect her children that she cannot leave him nor control her own erratic behavior (which is formed as an act of resistance against his patriarchal megalomania). Mabel is under the influence of her love for Nick and a society that limits her expression.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What society can't deal with</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Be authentic and genuine in how you relate to people, be a wonderous child in an adult's body and society will tear you apart. You can't expect understanding from any "normal" adults, even in your immediate family. Children will be the only ones who will be able to see you for who you really are, and accept you that way. Everyone else will try their hardest to hammer you in to the narrow, cold, petty role they expect you to play.It's not surprising that so many people react negatively to this movie. They don't like to see the ugly, cold side of society or themselves. They don't like to have a mirror held up to them. If you want entertainment, untinged with uncomfortable truth, this movie is not for you.That's not to say "A Woman Under the Influence" is not flawed in how it goes about showing society's fear of non-conformity. It requires some suspension of disbelief. Particularly, that Mabel could have raised three kids in a family, while in such a state without medication. There are also some unsatisfying "intermission" scenes. Finally, there's the very unbelievable ending where Mabel is slapped back in to lucidity by Nick.However, the vast majority of the film is intense and quite believable, especially in it's depiction of the lack of understanding the average, unconscious, "normal" adult society shows Mabel.Highly recommended. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"A Woman Under the Influence" is typical of Cassavetes amateurish films with over-the-top performances which indulge improvisation, often to the point of embarrassingly silly moments. Rowlands much lauded performance is quite poor, depicting a nervous condition with all the fervor of a hysterical teenager performing in a high-school play. But I think this is what Cassavetes valued and it's a detriment to his films which often explore interesting issues. "A Woman Under the Influence" isn't a terrible film, but it's certainly not a good one either.</fullReview>

In my opinion, this film is one of the finest moment in 70's worldwide cinema.There some moments in the film that we are "almost" on the set in interaction with the characters, because of there unique, powerful and unexpected performances, with a help of a masterful direction of John Cassavettes.Trust me, if you like ultra realistic movies, full with a marvelous and subtle poetic vein, this is the ultimate experience in cinema. A must see! Im sure that it will surprise you, like it did too me. If you like this movie, i recommend: "Husbands" (John Cassavettes) ; "La graine et le mulet" (2007)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cassavettes' Magnum Opus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think Gena Rowlands was one of America's true screen greats and her performance in "A Woman Under the Influence" is arguably her best. It is remarkable, primarily because it is so multifaceted, so complex in its interactions with other characters, and so realistic in its complete unpredictability. "A Woman Under the Influence" is an unflinchingly honest, emotionally gut wrenching, and saddeningly ugly portrayal of a person locked in a downward spiral. Anyone who has faced mental illness and/or addiction will relate to this film greatly, because it is so personal and realistic. Similar to Cassavettes other films, "A Woman Under the Influence" is challenging, peppered with odd scenes and interactions, and slowly paced. However, it is also, in my opinion, one of the best American films of the 1970's. If you've ever been curious about John Cassavettes, one of America's first truly independent directors, "A Woman Under the Influence" is a terrific introduction. This is a memorable, honest, and brilliantly directed film. For Gena Rowlands, I'd argue the role of a lifetime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gena Rowlands' remarkable performance must be seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are gaps in my Cassavetes moving going experience. I saw "Faces" (1968) when it was first released and was blown away by how real and honest the dialog was. Cassavetes sometimes would give his actors the bare essentials of what needed to be gotten across and allow them to improvise dialog and action until they got what they wanted. He didn't always work this way, and when he did it didn't always work, but when it did the sense of realism was nothing short of phenomenal. "Husbands," a later Cassavetes, was an instance where I felt the improv didn't live up to expectations. As a result and the fact that the angst of some of his characters are so intense they are hard to watch, I stopped going to see Cassavetes films. About a year ago I decided to give Cassavetes another try because of comments I read about Gena Rowlands and so I watched "Gloria" (1980), the story of a mobster's moll who doesn't like kids but finds herself in the strange position of defending a scrappy young Puerto Rican boy against her old mob friends. This was Cassavetes' most studio based production, properly financed and in some regards, more conventional than his other films. On the other hand, some of his independently made films suffer from excess, so "Gloria" was a happy medium. And what I read about Rowlands was correct. She is an actress I've always liked, but have just never got around to seeing her best work. "Gloria" was by far and away the best thing I'd seen her in until then. Rowlands was spectacular, exceeding all my expectations. She effortlessly displayed the typical Cassavetes angst, but with surprising power and cunning. Very subtly she allows a fragile side to occasionally peek through her callous outer shell. I would rate Rowlands' Gloria among the top five performances of the 80s.Rowlands made such an impact I was determined to see more with her. Let me just say this about Rowlands in "Woman": Wow! There's absolutely not one iota of similarity between her Gloria character and Mabel in "Woman." It was like a completely different actress at work. In "Woman," Mabel is married to Peter Falk's Nick, a city works engineer. The problem with Mabel is she's very strange. Even a bit crazy. Or is she? This is the big question in the film. I assumed this was another one of the director's improv films, but it was apparently tightly scripted. Apparently all those years of improvising with Rowlands and Falk paid off, for when they finally got a script to adhere to, it still comes off like they were improvising. Like Cassavete's earlier independent films, "Woman" has an element of excess, but you come away from the experience with these characters under your skin in ways a film with less excess wouldn't allow. It's true this film is probably the height of angst. There are scenes of family arguments that are indeed difficult to watch. At the same time, you are amazed by what you are seeing. The entire cast goes beyond whatever was asked of them, mostly Rowlands, whose character is so completely out there in terms of human behavior the performance could easily have become caricature. Instead Rowlands builds a believable emotional picture of a mind in distress, on the verge of collapse. She's funny, hateful, scary, sad... you name the emotion, but her character isn't a hodge podge. It's a unique personality, like someone you can picture meeting in real life, then later wonder to yourself: What the hell was that? Early on, as we get to know Mabel, I found myself laughing at how peculiar she was. There are some genuinely hilarious sequences. Yet, the experience of getting to know this woman showed me that my initial reaction to how she was behaving was honestly my own defense against holding back the tears for a woman who had much more going on upstairs (literally in the case of one scene), than I had ever guessed. She's a constant surprise. So the final question is... what 'influence' was Mabel actually under? And see it for yourself to answer. If Rowlands' portrayal of Gloria was one of the top 5 of the 80s, I'd say her' Mabel may be among the top 5 of the 70s. On the strength of these two performances alone I would say she is one of America's finest actresses.In the DVD extras I found it was financed by Cassavetes, Rowlands and Falk. When completed they couldn't find a distributor, so they collected all the major newspapers, sat down and looked for theaters that played films they wanted to see. Cassavetes then called each theater and asked if they would show his film. Most did. That's how the film first saw distribution. Then, after the New York Film Critics praised it, it was picked up by a distributor . It received Oscar nominations for best actress, best director. Rowlands won for the Golden Globes. It one of the finest films ever made about a woman coping 'under the influence'. A remarkable film with a fabulous performance by Gena Rowlands. Really worth seeing.</fullReview>

There has certainly been more recent filmmakers who wish to bring us the same gritty and uncompromising depiction of reality, but rarely are they as effective. All segments of film-making are addressed here, providing the moviegoer with the ability to appreciate each. Honestly, in viewing the movie you can definitely tell the actors themselves appreciate the beauty of the film in which they are working.From a plot perspective, the film is somewhat difficult, but the viewer still feels immersed in the situation, rather than just a passerby who can leave the actors to do their performance on their own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uneven, but still worth it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Cassavetes was one of those rare artists of whom it could be said that his flaws were his strengths, and his strengths were his flaws. On a purely technical level, his 1974 film, A Woman Under The Influence, is not a very good film. It is often poorly lit, edited, and at times poorly acted, almost as badly as Cassavetes' own Minnie And Moscowitz. Yet, there are moments when its dramatic power rivals that of his first great triumph, Faces, or any other work of drama or fiction. Consequently, the film has to rank somewhere between the two in the Cassavetes canon, and I'd opt for putting it closer to Faces, for, despite its manifest flaws, which I will touch upon, it has moments of sheer brilliance, illumination, and that often misunderstood quality of 'artistic honesty', that help it overcome its flaws. To say it is voyeuristic is to be too obvious?. The film follows the doomed marriage of Nick and Mabel Longhetti (Peter Falk and Gena Rowlands), who have three children, Maria (Christina Grisanti), Tony (Matthew Cassel), and Angelo (Matthew Laborteaux), who are not the cute wiseass film kids viewers loathe. He's a foul-mouthed, ignorant, and often physically and emotionally abusive husband and person, while she's a flaming nut case. Many criticisms of the film have tried to leaven such assessments of the two lead characters, but this is because of obvious political or philosophical strains. Anyone who's ever known a family of not quite there folks has known people like the Longhettis, and their bratty children. It is a dysfunctional household, in the modern sense, even though that term had not yet become prevalent when the film was made.There really is not much of a plot to the film, as in most of Cassavetes' films?.Does Cassavetes dig and probe the human psyche in the overt way an Ingmar Bergman does? No. He crafts scenes, sometimes raggedly, and lets us get mere impressions, at times. Cassavetes might be though of as an emotional Impressionist, rather than a visual one. Most of the time, the emotions are spot on, yet every so often an emotional clunker hits?.However, Rowlands and Falk give terrific performances, in this acting dominated film. Falk is superb as a clueless bigot, and Rowlands gives a real unhinged performance as the crazy Mabel?.Some Feminist critics have tried to claim the film as a document for their wacky theses, stating that Mabel is not crazy, no more so than Nick, and, to a certain extent, they have a point. Nick is a lout, a moron, who lets his kids get drunk on beer with him, and rages against decent people at the drop of the hat?.Given that the film clocks in at two and a half hours, he does make great use of silences, as he did in Faces. There is a scene, late in the film, when Nick has been worn down by Mabel and the kids, where he just passes through a doorway, holds it, then inhales deeply. It is a very effective scene. Cassavetes is, in a way, the Walt Whitman of film, in that his excesses, while technically being excesses, also are indelibly part of what sets him apart from other filmmakers. He lets scenes play on in real time, and often loses control of the scene, but when he is on, he nails things no other filmmaker does- few films have ever portrayed the working class as well as this film does. This film also makes better use of framing and other technical aspects than his earlier films did. Yes, often he makes bizarre edits- such as the earlier scene, where Mabel goes nuts, and is institutionalized. It just ends, mid-sentence, and then we see Nick dealing with his co-workers' knowing of it. But, overall, the film works, more often than not feeling realer than reality often does, and that's the scary part to its success, far more frightening than any Hannibal Lecter film, and like flaws, fear can be a strength. Just as Nick Longhetti.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cassavetes has good objectives, but often a poor way of telling.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Cassavetes' films surely justify the adjective "idiosyncratic". This film borders on "theatre of the absurd" in fact. What Cassavetes shows us must be what he intended us to know about the thrust of his story, since he both wrote and directed. I harbour the notion that he was intending to tell a story of both physical and mental abuse practised by a pig of an ignorant lout of a husband on a wife far above him in intelligence. Alas, her zest for life and general liveliness infuriates the guy. His abuse leads the wife into behaviour that could be interpreted as mental illness, so on the solicitation of the husband and his mother-from-hell, poor "Mabel" is committed to six months in an asylum. Now, I submit that if anyone in this story is "insane", it is "Nick". Hardly any of his notions about his wife have any basis in reality. You could say he really isn't living in the real world, but in an "absurdist" world created by his limited intelligence and lack of logical perceptions. Isn't that what we usually mean by "insanity"? So far, so good, but Cassavetes doesn't really present a picture as coherent and logical as I have capsuled above. The editing is so chaotic that once in a while I harboured the notion we are seeing a "rough-cut" of the film, not a finished product. It could be,of course, that such editing is just part of the "absurdist" philosophy of the presentation. The world isn't logical, so why should its literature be? Is that it? None of the ancillary characters in the drama behave much better than "Nick", even those sympathetic to "Mabel". We really are looking at a dysfunctional world, not just a dysfunctional marriage. Reviewing the action mentally, it looks to me like the three kids and "Mabel" are the only really "sane" people around that "world". How long they will survive the return of "Mabel" from the asylum is problematical, in spite of the up-beat final scene.What is the origin and meaning of the title? Surely not that "Mabel" is an alcoholic, though she is shown as drinking a couple of times. "Under the influence" of the brutal treatment by her pig of a husband seems the more likely meaning. Whatever, Gena and Peter, aided by a cast including most of the family and friends of Gena and John (they are married) certainly give bravura performances above the ordinary. You ought to see this film for that reason and for the story of wife abuse, even if, like me, you don't care for the cinematic style.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More of a documentary, really</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A Woman Under the Influence" (John Cassavetes, 1974) could easily be re-titled "An Audience Under the Influence." Through the use of confining technical tricks, Cassavetes manages to have a serious affect on those who view this film, drawing them into the lives of Mabel and Nick Longhetti (Gena Rowlands, Peter Falk). The desired result is to produce a film that is more like a documentary than a scripted drama, a controlled "cinema verit" piece.Cassavetes shot the film in a real house, which from a technical standpoint means that it is going to be very cramped. Most of the film occurs in the house and with all of the equipment that is required to shoot a film plus the actors and staff, there really wasn't much of a choice of how to shoot the film. Hand-held cameras are used throughout most of the shooting in the house, and the shots aren't usually very clean or wide. Cassavetes had them stay close to the actors, whoever was speaking usually, and as the movie progresses, the shots tighten in more on faces. They get so close, that not even the whole face is visible in some shots. This style of jerky, close up filming adds to the feeling that the movie is merely documenting a family rather than portraying a screenplay. In some instances this style of filming disrupts the suspension of belief that the audience is expected to have, but in this instance, with the high quality and intensity of Cassavetes script, it actually heightens the experience. After watching Mabel and Nick argue and run around the house with the cameras close on them for a while, the audience is pulled into the story and is affected by it.The brilliance of Gena Rowlands' performance in the film is perhaps a major reason that the film is so powerful. Unlike Karen Black's performance of a simple and expressive woman in "Five Easy Pieces," Rowlands manages to convince the viewer that she is "different" and often prone to fits. Black took her similar role a little too far and just made he character seem dumb, instead of na?ve as the role might be better played. Rowland stuck with what Cassavetes intended and added her own likability to the character. Her simple, though entirely "real" gestures and facial expressions throughout the film added to its validity.But Rowlands' performance overshadows the one given by Peter Falk. The frustration and confusion that is portrayed by Falk as Nick Longhetti is no less convincing than his "wife's" whimsical and confusing mannerisms. He didn't so much bring the character alive, as one usually says of a good actor playing a role well, so much as he played the character truthfully. His wonderful performance certainly helps to solidify this film as a quasi-verit piece.One final note on the length of film: Although it is longer than most of the New American Cinema canonic films, it makes the film more real. Cassavetes has a good amount of patience with letting a scene play out instead of editing it down to a few concise shots. The dining room scene where they're all eating spaghetti# happens almost in real time. The audience is invited to sit at the table with them and listen to these "real" conversations as they unfold.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie A Woman Under the Influence was made in 1974 and was directed and written by John Cassavetes. In this movie we see one of the main characters as a woman which didn't seem to happen much in any of the other particular movies we are watching for this type of genre. Gena Rowlands plays the crazed wife Mabel Longhetti and famous actor Peter Faulk played her husband also known as Nick Longhetti. This movie is about a mother/wife who is somewhat odd or even could be considered a little crazy and thus makes the marriage very strenuous.We get a feel for how Mabel's life works, we see her in the very beginning rushing around the house with her kids trying to get them ready to go to her mothers house for the night. We see her running around telling the kids they need shoes on. During the scene I really felt like the characters were real and not acting. I can remember my mother doing the saying and doing the same things when my brother and I were younger and she was trying to get us to practice or school. Throughout the whole movie I believe that they portrayed realism through each of the characters.Finally she gets the children off with her mother and now she is getting ready for what is to be a special romantic night with her husband Nick. Nick works for the city and has to go down to the middle of town and fix a water pipe that had burst. He knew that she wouldn't understand and doesn't call her till much later and tells her his dilemma. From then on we get a real glimpse into Mabel as we see her calmly tell him it's OK over the phone. Then throughout the rest of the movie we see her do weird awkward movements with her face and hands whenever she got mad or upset. It was a different type of movie than I am used to but it made you think that it could happen to someone you know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Film, worth a serious look</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I expected an artistic film, probably a slow moving film, leading into my viewing. What I ended up seeing was a disturbing melodrama, which actually was quite fascinating. The film is the story of an Italian middle-class couple, Nick and Mabel Longetti (played by Peter Falk &amp; Gina Rowlands), living around Los Angeles. They are a couple of passionate parents, and they have three children. Nick is a construction worker and seemingly finds bonding with his fellow workers easier than he does with his family, therefore distancing himself from his family. When he is around his family he acts short-mindedly and without much thought. Mabel, on the other hand, seems to be neurotic and lacking of self confidence, probably as a result of having a character like Nick in her life for so long. What's interesting is that Mabel never stops caring for her children and takes care to make sure things look normal. She seems to ignore any problems with her husband makes the point to get the children to school on time no matter what. Then, there's an odd scene where Nick comes home with a bunch of guys from his job and she makes them a spaghetti breakfast, which concludes with her creating an embarrassing scene by forcing one of the uncomfortable men into dancing with her. Her odd behavior continues with her neighbor Mr. Jensen, the father of some of her children's friends, whom she awkwardly forces to play with all the children. She also has shouting matches in the house with her mother-in-law. Not surprisingly, Mabel becomes so delusional that Nick can't take it anymore. She soon has a nervous breakdown and is sent to a psychiatric hospital for six months. When she returns home, things only get more hopeless as the children dislike their father's controlling parenting. They seem to desire their loving mother, no matter how deranged she may be. What happens next, I'm not quite certain. The film seems to hint that Mabel is not sick at all, and that she was hospitalized more out of convenience to Nick than any real affliction. In the end, Mabel is presented as a victim. This film is definitely a character study. Doing some searching online, I'm reading that it is filmed is something called the cinema verite style. This entails an active camera seemingly going everywhere, and the viewer is basically a fly on the wall. The result is a narrative which is filled with explosiveness and unforgettable scenes. This is aided even further by the dynamic characters which are the subject of the film. The amazing thing is that this is all the result of John Cassevantes, as he was both the writer and the director. I need to mention how good Gina Rowlands is as an alcoholic who seems to go through a nervous breakdown. Peter Falk, as I expected, was also great. His character is shown at times to be crazier than his wife, but he doesn't have to suffer the same indignities she does. It's an interesting study of gender, for this movie was made during the rise of the Woman's Rights movement, and this is a film in which two crazy people are presented, and it's the woman who is hospitalized. I get the feeling that Cassavantes may be an old fashioned type with this regard, maybe he's speaking out in some way against the changing social tide. Lastly, I want to mention that although this film runs 155 minutes, it's often so intense and filled with energy that I hardly noticed how long it was. Basically, it's a good storytelling, and in that case time is sort of irrelevant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Commentary on the contemporary family after the 1960's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scott Greenan New American Cinema April 7, 2006 A Woman under the InfluenceA Woman under the Influence is one of the more emotional films that we have watched all semester. Shot with a voyeuristic point of view, the film quality and angles are almost reminiscent of an old home movie (gone crazy). Mabel in this film is a wife and mother in a small working class family. Her growing insanity proves to become an issue when dealing with her kids and her marriage. There are a few themes in the film that stood out to me to be very important in understanding her mental state. One of the first themes in the movie is the idea of music. Music is everywhere in the film, especially when Mabel is acting the craziest. At first, one might believe it is background music, heard only by the audience. When Mabel begins to interact with the music through humming and dancing, we figure it must be on in their world through a radio. Finally, we can notice that no one else interacts with the music. The music we hear is the music that plays in her head, the trigger that drives her mad. This music is normally classical, orchestral tunes. This is why she relates to her children so well; she has this sense about her that the children see as imagination, when in reality, it is a disease. The theme of music continues when one of the men at their table begins to sing in a surprisingly lovely voice. He somehow represents a beauty that comes from such an unexpected place (a blue-collar worker). His style of Italian Opera fascinates Mabel. This fascination appears later when we see Mabel and Nick with the children, conducting a symphony of whistling. Another theme was one of misogyny. Mabel has been taken advantage of by many of the men with whom she comes in contact. It begins with the man at the bar, who takes her home and (presumably) rapes her while she is greatly under the influence of alcohol. It continues when she is approached by one of her husband's coworkers in the kitchen. He picks her up and slaps her butt, knowing that she is crazy. The doctor is also to blame, coming into their house and makes kissing faces at her. What this all proves is that because she is overly friendly to these 'gentlemen' in her psychotic stage, they all take advantage of her. However, she is not to be left blameless. Part of her psychotic episodes includes getting uncomfortably close to other men, kissing and hugging them. She seems to revert back to a more childish idea of niceties, always offering food and asking names. Both Nick and Mabel steal the show in this movie. Their appearances are highly believable as normal, everyday human beings (not overly pretty, average). Their characters are completely in love with one another, despite Nick's abuse of her. Domestic abuse was much more common in those days. Holding it up to modern criticism is unfair. Nick's attempts at pulling the family back together are noble and, inadvertently drive him mad as well. Like every father, however, he is portrayed as the enemy to his children. They, in turn, defend their mother, knowing something is wrong and holding on to the basic principles of peace in a time of domestic conflict. The odd thing is: can we really blame Nick for his actions against her? We can pass it off as tough love, trying to take control of a woman who has completely lost it. Hitting her seems almost like an attempt to help her (please note that I am not standing up for domestic abuse!). One could also see it as a light form of punishment in comparison to electro-convulsive therapy (Etc) that she experienced in the hospital. Scenes from One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest come to mind when thinking of Etc. Jack Nicholson's character is physically administered electric shocks to simulate a seizure, leaving him in a vegetative state. After she came home, one could see a physical change in her appearance. Her clothing was much more conservative (like an attempt to imitate Joan Clever) as opposed to her hippie garb from before. Even her psychotic episodes have changed. She became suicidal, a symptom not seen or suggested before. Her craziness mixed with the traditional style of a catalogue-like mother provided an image of a bloodied Joan Clever, dancing on tables to imaginary music. Changing and altering behavior through mechanistic means seems to be a growing theme of the time. This is reminiscent of other films of the day that program individuals through brainwashing such as A Clockwork Orange and The Parallax View. This may also be an odd commentary on the culture of the day, growing out of youth and into the suburbs, taking on roles such as 'mother' ("I don't like to be called ma!") and 'father.' More importantly, the film focuses on this couple who is affected by this mental disease and yet they live with it by closing the movie while getting ready for bed after a dinner party. This film is a criticism of the contemporary family, an old home movie or memory of a bad time in a family's history because, according to Nick, all families go through bad times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Power of Cassavetes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got done reading ten pages of Carney's book on Cassavetes. It took me another ten minutes for the pain in my head to leave. Call Cassavetes what you want, its sad to say that more than half my generation don't know who the hell Cassavetes was, let alone what films he has left behind. To define Cassavetes is to define the dining table scene in the first half of Woman Under the Influence. Pure honesty. A taste of real life and the simple moments in life. How many times can one use the word "real" in one of his films. It is also fun to see many of Cassavetes family members in this movie. From his children, his wife, and good friends. The man is now and will forever be the Godfather of Independent Cinema. Orson had his chapters in film history, Cassavetes has his. In this film, we see amazing acting from the "Faces" crew as well as a close look into the abnormal story line that the studios wouldn't and couldn't produce. It took Cassavetes to produce a classic such as A Woman Under the Influence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a Hollywood classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shot in 1974 for about a millions dollars on Taft Ave in Hollywood, 'A Woman' was independently produced, written and directed by John Casavetes. I'd heard about the film and its use of improvisation but didn't know what it was about. Turns out its about a middle aged women going crazy and her husbands fight to save her mind. There isn't much fancy camera work or editing, just raw drama, and some of the most serious acting I've ever seen. Gena Rowlands and Peter Falk are totally intense and committed to their parts. Its like Casavetes' set up the scenes and just lets them go. The focus goes soft a few times and the camera moves around a lot trying to capture the performances during the more intense sequences. You can imagine the crew trying to make adjustments behind the lens as the actors play out the scene, lost in their characters. Rowlands and Falk say on the DVD extras that they didn't know when the camera was rolling or not. They would just start when they felt it. The role of improve isn't as prevalent as some say in the film, it is heavily scripted. In some of his other films, it is. He lets the actors drops or add lines if it serves the character. Gena Rowlands performance is mind blowing. You can't get this film from Netflix, so you might have to poke around for it. I rented it from Cinefile in West LA. I recommend that store for any movie you can't find elsewhere. A must see, 'A Woman' is a Hollywood classic</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A short comment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To see A Woman Under the Influence is to see how poorly every other movie about mental illness deals with its subject. Take 1975's Best Picture winner, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. It's filled with quirky and amusing characters at whom we can giggle. If you extracted Gena Rowland's performance from A Woman, it actually might have easily fit in next to those crazies. Any other film would probably treat Rowland's illness as a joke, and we would have laughed at it. But this film shows us that there is nothing to laugh at. I could only cringe in horror and whimper at the events as they unfolded. There is nothing easy about this film. It's emotionally draining and it forces us to live through these pains. It provides no one to blame, and there is no kind of pat ending, neither happy nor tragic. Cassavetes' realist direction is as perfect as it gets. Both Rowlands and Peter Falk give masterful performances. A powerful, powerful movie. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Candid Portrayal of the Devastating Effects of Mental Illness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first I thought this movie was a comedy, but it certainly is not. Then I thought it was some kind of touchy-feely movie with an offbeat esoteric message, and likewise it is not. Then what is this movie? It is a candid portrayal of the devastating effects of mental illness on a woman and her husband who is trying his best to cope with his wife's erratic behavior. In this movie, Gena Rowlands, in what is probably her greatest performance, is a woman who is so repressed that she actually loses her ability to communicate, which leads to numerous problems. Although her husband, wonderfully played by Peter Falk, wants to help and is supportive, he is clueless as to what to do. There are some comical scenes in the movie, but this movie is pure drama about a serious topic, mental illness, and how it can destroy an entire family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Portrait of the Artist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most interesting aspects of this film is the self-portrait of the artist that it includes. Mabel is John Cassavetes, not in a superficial biographical sense, but as an embodiment of his vision of life's collaborative expressive possibilities. Mabel gives us a view of how Cassavetes actually performed on the set as he made all of his movies. Like her, he used every trick in the book to elicit a performance from an actor, adapting his methods to the individual actor's needs: begging, pleading, and explaining sometimes--rallying, badgering, provoking, or chiding at others. Playing mind games when it was necessary to help an actor go deeper into himself (just as Mabel nags Mr. Jensen when everything else fails to stimulate him and tells jokes to Mama Longhetti to get her to lighten up). Like Mabel, Cassavetes was his actors' own best audience, laughing, smiling, jumping out of his seat with delight when interesting and unexpected things happened (just as she does with the construction workers). Like hers, his vision of directing was the opposite of dictation. Direction was interaction. Mabel shows us what it really means to say that Cassavetes' view of direction was not a relation of superior and inferior, of boss and worker, but of equals working together in a surprisingly intimate yet public "family." Mabel is her creator's reflection on his own life of directing. This is one of the insights I got from Ray Carney's amazing new Cassavetes on Cassavetes book, which goes into incredible detail about how all of the films were made. (He has more than 100 pages on this film alone.) I highly recommend it--along with his web site devoted to Cassavetes' life and work, which has more informationWhen you watch Mabel's ecstatic, doomed, inventive, tragic, comic performance, think of Cassavetes. Think of someone giving his or her soul to a world that doesn't want it. Think of the tragedy of an artist who wants to make the world laugh and love, but only elicits criticism and embarrassment the harder he tries. Mabel is John.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reaches us viscerally on a gut level</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nick Longhetti is abrupt, emotional, quick to anger, but also has moments of tenderness. His wife Mabel is socially inept and emotionally insecure. Her behavior is strange and inappropriate, but is she crazy, a danger to her children? John Cassavetes 1974 film A Woman Under the Influence tries to supply an answer but the answer is unclear and the film can be viewed from different viewpoints. What is clear, however, is that Peter Falk and Gina Rowlands who play the troubled couple love each other deeply but cannot express their love in socially acceptable ways. They are no movie family with manufactured emotions, however. but two flesh and blood human beings who feel and suffer and love right before your eyes. After spending two and one half emotionally exhausting hours with them, you will feel everything that they feel and know that they have become part of your own family.Set in the suburbs of Los Angeles, neither husband nor wife are people of means and Nick is a blue-collar construction worker for the city. They have three children, Maria (Christina Grisanti), Tony (Matthew Cassel), and Angelo (Matthew Laborteaux) who are not cute movie kids but real people who happen to be small. They love their parents but are bewildered by how they act. Mabel expends much of her energy trying to be the perfect wife and mother but has no strong sense of self. As Cassavetes says, "Her problem was that she was doing everything to please someone other than herself. When Nick wanted her to go to bed with him, she'd go to bed. When he wanted her to be embarrassed, she'd be embarrassed. If he wanter her to apologize, she'd apologize. Mabel's not behaving herself, but you can't behave yourself when you've been pushed so far from your own way of being". Nick, on the other hand, tries to avert being exposed as a fool, but in the effort to avoid embarrassment, makes an even bigger fool of himself.When Nick calls one evening and tells her he has to work on a burst water main, she loses control, goes to a bar, and brings a man home to spend the night with but the next morning resumes her household duties as if nothing had happened. When Nick brings a bunch of fellow workers home for Spaghetti breakfast the next morning, Mabel dutifully acts the part of hostess but doesn't know when to back off after she invites an obvious uncomfortable man to dance with her. At that point Nick explodes and everyone sits in awkward silence. After that incident, Mabel's behavior becomes a growing problem and a concern of Nick's mother Margaret (Katherine Cassavetes). When Mabel inappropriately attempts to engage a neighbor to play with her and the children, Nick walks in, draws the wrong conclusions, and has Mabel committed to a psychiatric hospital for six months.When she returns home from the hospital, Nick and Mabel try to pick up the pieces of their relationship but Nick miscalculates her vulnerability and invites forty house guests to welcome her home and a tug of war with the children leaves nerves even more frayed than before. Nick and Mabel have problems and many are deep seated but the film is not despairing, nor is it a clinical study of the so-called mentally ill. Whatever their problems are, they are not that different from those of many married couples, only much more pronounced. They may not be ours but they are human problems nonetheless and we relate to the Longhetti's as human beings that we care about. In A Woman Under the Influence, Cassavetes supplies us with a mirror to see ourselves and many may not like the view, yet the film touches us in ways that cannot be expressed with words. It reaches us viscerally on a gut level and remains forever a part of our lives.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know that among film snobs that the films of John Cassavetes are considered amazing works of art. And, of all of Cassavetes films, this is his most famous because it was nominated for two Academy Awards. Yet, despite this and some very positive reviews, I felt that watching this film was like SLOWLY chewing on broken glass! It was thoroughly unpleasant and seemed to be in need of massive editing. As a play, this might have worked....as a film, I see it as something that the average film viewer couldn't possibly enjoy.The film consists of what appear to almost be home movies that last a very, very long time. The camera work is better than home movies but the graininess of the print and the complete lack of even minor editing made it seem like a movie not yet ready for the movies. There isn't a lot of story. Instead it's full of scenes were Gene Rowlands screams and yells--acting at times like she's mentally ill but at others like she's just a very nasty and occasionally self-destructive person (more like a person diagnosed with a Borderline Personality Disorder than anything else). And, as for her husband (played by Peter Falk), mostly he's impassive...until he blows up and screams at her. If you like this sort of thing as well as knowing that it is an art house favorite, you'll probably enjoy the film. As for me, it was a major chore to finish it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could Be The Most Challenging Cassavetes Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Woman Under the Influence might be the most difficult film made by John Cassavetes. Cassavetes's films can be intimidating in the way that a painting can be intimidating. Many people see a painting and their first inclination is a mental scramble to figure out what it means, what it's saying, when one is rarely such an acute piece of work. It's because there is some intangible sandwich board on something like a painting or a Cassavetes film, not that they are anything alike, that reads, "art." But whether it is or it isn't art, art isn't necessarily a work that culminates to a statement. However, there is always something that is being expressed or observed.In A Woman Under the Influence, the beautiful Gena Rowlands, a beautifully endearing performance, plays someone whose behavior is very unorthodox, very nervous, possibly not coming naturally out of her impulses, but who is to say that she's crazy? I don't believe the film is about a woman going mad. I believe it's about a woman whose friends and family think she's going mad. Peter Falk's genuinely delivered bossy, obstinate husband reacts to and handles Rowlands's behavior in very unorthodox and nervous ways himself. He doesn't understand his wife. The film is a reflection of human misunderstanding in society. Do we take the time to understand people? Do we even care to differentiate between two different personalities? Many of us do not.Cassavetes's film personifies its themes by having the same effect on us that's endured by its characters. There are some scenes where we don't really understand why anybody's doing anything they're doing. Everything sometimes seems like people are firing off impulses and creating chaos. So we try to understand, only to feel as dumbfounded as its characters. The film doesn't mean to boggle us, but to indent our perspective and adjust to its own looking glass. What I admire about this film is that it has taken me months to figure out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong Family Unit and Relationships despite Insanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In director John Cassavete's brilliant film, "A Woman under the Influence", Gena Rowlands plays Mabel Longhetti a housewife who boarders on insanity. But despite her psychiatric problems her husband Nick, played by Peter Fawks is still madly in love with his wife. Though the relationship is not normal, or even sane for that matter the two make not only the marriage, but their family work.The most important aspect of the film would have to be the relationship between Nick and Mabel. I think that the relationship between the two is definitely not healthy but it's obvious that they are so in love they want to make their marriage work. Nick says to Mabel that, "I don't mind you being a lunatic". This attitude really proves to be correct; it is only when Mabel sanity begins to embarrass Nick that he becomes impatient with his wife. Even then though he doesn't consider the idea of committing her, but only seems to know how to deal with the situation by yelling. The best example of this would be when he has the workers home for lunch. As Mabel nervously sits around the table trying to make conversation with the men and then asks them to dance, this is when Nick cannot tolerate his wife's insanity and tells her to sit down. It is doesn't seem to be that he is upset with the way that she is but he is more upset with the idea that her behavior makes others uncomfortable and then embarrasses Nick. But, prior to that he stares lovingly into Mabel's eyes, and the two seem to be more interested in themselves them the company that they have. They are always making eye contact and understand each other in more than just words.It is not until Mabel's sanity begins to harm the children that Nick feels he has to institutionalize his wife. I think that one of the most important qualities to remember about Mabel is the fact that though she is insane she is neither a bad wife nor a bad mother. The film makes it very clear that both Mabel and Nick are good parents. The best example of their parenting skills being that the children are given the bedroom upstairs while the dining room is converted to a bedroom for Nick and Mabel. They want more than anything for their children to be happy. Mabel proves her parenting skills in a number of ways. The first scene of Mabel in the film is of her trying to get the children into her mother's car, quickly locking them in and telling them to watch their hands as she shuts the door. This is average behavior for any mother and it indicates the chaos and love of the family. In this first scene she looks less like a crazy woman and more like a frazzled housewife as she speedily puts the children into her mother's car not wanting to forget to kiss them goodbye and reminding her mother that if anything happens she wants to hear about it. Later in the film while she is at the bus stop she is under dressed and confrontational but still excited to see her children. The love that Mabel has for them despite her own psychiatric problems shows that the Longhetti family is a secure unit even if they don't conform to the standards of what the average mother should really act like.Nick too strives to be a good parent. His temper seems to get the better of him, and it almost makes the audience question his character's sanity but he loves his children. The scene in the film where he takes his children to the beach is pivotal in showing his love for the three children. As he and the kids sit in the back of the truck and they asks for his beer he doesn't seem to know what to do other than to give them what they want. The scene is heart wrenching as the kids all sip on beer and Nick doesn't know what to do other than just apologize for sending their mother away. He questions his decision, but just wanted to do what was right for his children.When Mabel has returned home after spending six months institutionalized Nick realizes the effects that putting his wife away has had. Mabel doesn't want to get too excited and doesn't want to show any emotions for fear that she'll behave in a way that will make her seem crazy. Nick and Mabel were a unit before she left and though Nick wants his wife to be sane he also wants her to be the woman that he fell in love with. He takes her upstairs and begs her to be herself to make the quirky noises she once made and the outlandish conversation she has with people. It's almost as though he doesn't know what to do with the new Mabel and blames himself her losing the woman who he fell in love with. I think that the most important message that the audience receives from the film is the fact that maybe normal isn't necessarily what's good. Nick and the children loved Mabel even when she was crazy. Likewise, Mabel still loved them even though she was crazy. As a member of the audience I am torn as to whether the decision to send Mabel away was a good one for Nick to have made. I saw the destruction that Mabel's insanity had. She brought strange men home from bars thinking they were Nick. But I also saw the love between Nick and Mabel because Mabel was the way that she was. The director leave the film open to decide whether or not Mabel is going to be alright, but the audience is given the general feeling that even if she is still insane the family will survive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Woman Under the Influence (1974)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I was forced to perform the excruciatingly difficult task of making a top 10 list, A Woman Under the Influence would definitely be a contender for one of those spots. Though from a technical standpoint it's unremarkable (Cassavetes never paid much mind to the photographic aspects of filmmaking), it's a tour de force of perfect writing as performed by brilliant actors under a powerful director. It's not easy to watch -- the tension and awkwardness is packed so densely it could drive the viewer as mad as the characters -- but it's impossible not to be held in its sway. The film is about insanity of a nuanced and thoroughly un-Hollywood kind. Mabel's madness is nervous and desperate and held in by only the barest of threads. But there's also Nick's madness, his violent need for a happiness he can't define, a happiness that one feels he wouldn't know what to do with if he ever found it. And yet despite their madness, I feel that I understand and sympathize with these characters so deeply. I wince at their mistakes but I know exactly why they make them.And it's not just about madness, there's so much more, too much for me to talk about. An incredibly rich, though constantly painful and emotionally draining, experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gena Rowland's gives the performance of a lifetime...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an Oscar-nominated performance, Gena Rowlands plays Mabel Longhetti, a mentally unstable housewife married to blue-collar worker, Nick. At first, Nick and his co-workers, who frequent the Longhetti household, regard Mabel's increasingly erratic behavior as quirky, even entertaining. When the welfare of the Longhetti children comes to public light, however, Nick must face the fact that Mabel is very ill. Mabel is hospitalized and Nick must take control of the household. Clueless as to how to manage his children, Nick makes astounding misjudgments on their behalf. As the film progresses, the viewer questions who is the more unstable individual, Mabel or Nick. Gena Rowlands gives much depth to Mabel; equally well displayed are her highs and lows as are her vital roles of wife and mother. Gena Rowlands is unforgettable in this film; she is a cinematic American treasure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who is crazy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A woman under the influence" is,along with "a child is waiting" and maybe "husbands" John Cassavetes's most accessible work.Accessible,but not necessary palatable for everyone.Improvisation has a large part,the spaghetti scene was probably filmed like that,that's why Cassavetes has his own actors troup:here we find Gena Rowlands(dazzling),Peter Falk(a thousand miles away from Colombo) and Cassavetes's own mother.One of the child is played by Matthew Laborteaux,who will be very popular as Albert in the "little house" series. Rowlands plays a very normal woman,living in a rather Italian macho world,where woman has got to content herself with cooking ,gardening,and child care.But after a problem at her husband's work,everything seems to go wrong:Mabel's games with the children seem odd to her family circle,and,one night,she sleeps with the first to come.She's gone nuts,as her family thinks. After a psychiatric hospital stay,Mabel comes back ,a new Mabel,all smiling.She seems to have changed,but her behavior is too contrived,too polite,without the spontaneity she had before,in a nutshell,her psyche is shot.After a suicide attempt,her husband understands that the true Mabel was the one before.Will they be able to pick up the pieces?This is a very long movie (2 hours and a half)with very long scenes that might bore some.Cassavetes is closer to European mood,that's why he 's so revered here.You will be highly rewarded if you follow Mabel's rocky road in this man's man's man's world though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Masterpiece, With 2 Great performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>like i said it is a masterpiece from John Cassavetes, with two amazing performances and wonderful photography.....................................it has very good photography, and possibly the best performance from an actress, Gena Rowlands as Mabel Longhetti (definitely her best performance), and another great performance from Peter Falk as Nick Longhetti(one of his best performances), the rest of the acting is flawed, but still pretty good, and overall it has very few flaws........its about a family...the rock hard husband is married to a woman who has problems and has been acting very strange, then the rest of the film shows the madness getting larger and larger, and very challenging, definitely one of the best film of all time, about that kind of madness.........................................................i strongly recommend this!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love is sex and sex is love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Life's all about love. Or at least that's what Cassavettes believed. The anti-thesis to this movie has got be Eyes Wide Shut, where life just comes down to sex, regardless of relationships. Mabels love is for everyone too, not just her husband. It's like she has a disease : a pure heart. The problem is this goes against society which is all masks and manipulation, and no one in the movie can figure Mabel out. She gets branded as crazy for being free of bulls**t. In Eyes Wide shut everyone has their mask and keeps it firmly on, even when Kidman &amp; Cruise recognize their masks for what they are, they still have to keep on going, and the solution is sex. Maybe what's missing in Eyes Wide Shut and present in A Woman Under The Influence is the presence of God. Perhaps the question about Mabel is wether she really is pure or is she just another person dealing with the complications of life and human genetic programming. We all manipulate to get what we want, maybe Mabel is just doing the same on a grand scale. Mabel finds it quite easy to bring a man back to her place for sex, maybe because she's not getting her emotional-love fix from her husband, but still, it seems to boil down to just sex again. Cassavettes seemed to believe in his Love philosophy, but i wonder...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WARNING: Extremely Overrated!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is possibly the worst film I've ever seen that deals with mental illness, and I've seen most of them, believe me. If you think Gena Rowlands' performance is brilliant then you must think stage musicals have realistic acting. How did she get an Oscar nomination for this? Over-the-top, sensationalist acting like this only belongs on Broadway, not in film. Overall, this film is embarrassing, awkward, and sometimes confusing. If you want to see Cassavetes' brilliant side, go rent Faces. Avoid this garbage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why live?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I lived as Peter Falk and Gena Rowlands, I wouldn't live. I am sure critics find this movie fascinating, I found it so depressing that I held a grudge against my then wife, now ex-wife, for making me take her to see it and then not wanting to leave. Women may find this enjoyable, most men will not. Most people have to be in high spirits to see this, if you aren't you feel like you want to commit suicide after seeing this movie. Just my opinion since I usually go to movies to be entertained. This is not to say I don't enjoy some dark movies. I just don't enjoy dark, mental, woman movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Is Falk's Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Peter Falk's film. Period.I was 10 years old when this film came out; I was already a film maven at the time. Of course neither my parents nor I saw this film when it came out, but I was in love with the typeface of its ads &amp; the aura that this was An Important Film. Okay, 34 years later I've finally seen the film--having never seen any Cassavetes-directed film previously. He's a hack, overall. Zero sense of timing, editing. Gena's performance reminds me too much of Dustin Hoffman's stint in "Rain Man": technically on par but entirely one-note. As Tom Cruise stole "Rain Man," Falk takes the cake for this film.I was annoyed with Gena's performance, really throughout--it seemed better suited for "Awakenings" (blecch!). It's not all her fault: she's a basket case from first scene to last. We never find out why?? But Falk's character seems real &amp; is performed WONDERFULLY by Falk as a seriously flawed man.Shave off at least an hour (an editor needed!), and this would have been an arresting portrait not of a woman under the influence but of a simple, Cro-Magnon, man coming to grips with a wife who doesn't work &amp; yet cannot deal with her three kids &amp; her husband's long hours of work.I'd rather remember Cassavetes for "The Dirty Dozen" or "Rosemary's Baby." He would have been a better director had he snipped his own tendency for excess--as he amply demonstrates with this film.Bob</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i frankly do not understand why cassavetes is so revered. this is just a terrible film. i found it to be ridiculously fake, superficial and unbelievable. it feels like play acting with little or no consistency. i found myself constantly asking "why am i to care about this? what is supposed to make me care about or connectwith this person?" "it feels real?" - it feels like i'm in the room with a bunch of amateur-ish actors working from a very bad script (if any) who have no common idea of any particular thread that is supposed to hold this together.i think that cassavetes value must be that at the time this was very different technically, and relative to big budget film in the 60's/70's this was exciting, but it has not stood the test of time. it has been imitated many times in independent cinema and refined to the point that his films looks like a total joke where no one involved with the film was actually putting forth any effort. what is with all the unnecessary laughing at things that are not funny? over-intensifying things that are not intense and then asking the viewer to perceive that as "unbelievably real and believable"???? he is not a good director. again, it is obviously improvised - badly - and it is so inconsistent that it does not make a good believable movie. sorry i just don't' get this. i saw faces and thought it was awful and tried to give this a chance, but i just don't see how this is one bit believable.</fullReview>
