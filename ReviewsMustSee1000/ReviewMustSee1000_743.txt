		<shortDescription>Divine decadence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Bob Fosse hasn't achieved an immense degree of recognition, but his movies have a distinctive flavour. He seems to have an obsession with the world of music-hall, which is felt in other movies like "Sweet Charity" and "All that Jazz". In his other movies though, musical performances tend to steal the show almost entirely. "Cabaret" is an exception because it has an interesting background and storyline, and the music-hall performances are cleverly used here to illustrate and emphasize the plot. They play about the same role as the Chorus in ancient Greek play.Of course, the depiction of Cabaret's "Kit Kat Club" deserves attention all by itself. It is not surprising that a cabaret buff such as Bob Fosse took interest in the Weimar Republic period in Germany, when "divine decadence " was the name of the game. Only Bob Fosse could recreate with such consumed application the grotesque sleaze of Berlin's lowlife during the rise of Nazism, a context which served as inspiration for expressionist painters, and for Brecht's "Threepenny Opera". During the credits, check out a woman in the public with short hair and glasses smoking a cigarette (something quite dodgy in 1931!). It is the exact reproduction of a famous painting by Otto Dix.An outrageously grinning clown (Joel Grey) introduces every cabaret number. The girls appear in all possible contorted postures keeping deadpan faces. The Kit Kat club reminds of a roman arena, where the public is out for anything insane (even women fights in the mud...). To give an idea of what sort of den the club is, Michael York finds himself at one point standing next to a transvestite in a men's urinal...The cabaret performances get all the more provocative as the plot gets tense. The club is an essentially immoral place where anything is for sale, and it adapts shamelessly to the radical political changes coming up.Liza Minelli's character is totally at home in such surroundings. Her persona is perfectly sketched in her song "Bye Bye Mein Herr". She is the incarnation of the vamp, both heartless and ingenuous, the sort of lethal woman who drives men crazy and then gives them up like toys. Indeed, a very typical stereotype of the interwar period, think of Marlene Dietrich in "the Blue Angel"...Minelli's performance onstage with garter belts and a bowler hat still looks elegantly naughty today.Though, the real nature of her character is well studied as soon as she gets offstage. While Minelli can't help being extravagant all the time, she turns out to be a fragile woman neglected by her father, and in demand of constant and renewed attention. As predicted in her song, she proves basically unable to engage in any serious relationship, despite her involvement with Michael York ( "And though I used to care, I need the open air, you'd every cause to doubt me Mein Herr").The script was based a story by British writer Christopher Isherwood, called "A Goodbye to Berlin", based on his own personal memories. He is allegedly the character played by Michael York. A serious upper class young man, he meets Liza Minelli out of blind chance, while looking for an apartment to share. She introduces him to all sorts of people, from riff-raff to aristocracy, including a gigolo, a Jewish heiress, and an ambiguous baron who dismisses them both after having "played" with the two of them. Michael York's sober performance looks a bit pale as opposed to histrionic Liza Minelli, but of course, that was necessary in order to stress the essential difference between those two strangers. The movie ends as they part on a railway platform, but one can guess their experience together will have changed them both, as as far as he is concerned, was a definite coming of age.One of the scenes, in the middle of the movie, is quite disturbing. At a countryside inn, a young S.A man sings a song called "Tomorrow belongs to me", which starts out nostalgic but gradually turns into an infectious Nazi march as the whole crowd joins him. This unexpected number seems to have embarrassed many viewers. If Nazism had presented itself as pure evil, would it have met any success? This daring scene makes evident that it was for many Germans of the time the symbol of positive values : beauty, tradition, order, pride, future. If you didn't know how things turned out, would you not have been tempted to sing along this powerful hymn to the fatherland as you watch this? Good question to ask oneself even, or especially, nowadays...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect On All Levels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On a historical level, a personal-story level, and as pure entertainment "Cabaret" works perfectly. The scene is Berlin, Germany, only two years before Hitler would come to total power. It is the Berlin that Christopher Isherwood lived in and wrote about: poverty, drug and alcohol escapism, criminals, sleazebags, fighting in the streets, venereal disease, the prostitution of both sexes, the desperation to escape through the film industry, the temporary escape from the harshness of life in "naughty" nightclubs like The Kit Kat Club, which encapsulates it all. It's a bad scene, and a good example of, perhaps, why so many Germans felt in need of a Hitler. There's not a single verbal reference to Hitler, and yet the presence of the growing Nazi movement all around these decadent misfits is ever present in this film. But you can't blame any of these apolitical people for that. Liza Minelli and Michael York's characters are so needy, so desperate just to find some personal happiness in life. They can't be bothered with what's going on in the bigger picture. Except for the Master Of Ceremonies at the Club: Joel Grey's character is a semi-supernatural all-seeing character, mocking, seeming to somehow know EXACTLY the further destruction Germany's headed for. His scary all-knowing grinning face pops in regularly to remind us. The musical number "Tomorrow Belongs To Me" is so effective an illustration of the appeal this new Nazi hope held for impoverished suffering Germans, and yet we have The Master Of Ceremonies' evil nodding grin to remind us, in retrospect, what it really led to.Just as every musical number (aside from being so beautifully choreographed and presented) reminds us of the desperation in Sally Bowles' life and in most of Germany. "Money Makes The World Go Around" is a perfect musical number, and so illustrative of the horrendous financial state of Germany at the time. Joel Grey's raunchy "Two Ladies" on the Kit Kat stage to the hysterical delight of the decadent crowd reminds us that all sexual propriety has broken down (including in the lives of the main characters, now involved in a threeway with one of the few Germans who still has some wealth intact). Everyone who wants an example of the artistic heights that film can reach should see "Cabaret".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely in the Top 10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a very hard time picking a favorite, favorite film, but if forced to create a Top 10 List, this film would be there. Yes, Liza Minnelli CAN act , and brilliantly. The songs are wonderful and funny, the narrative is brilliant and dark. Those who typically don't like musicals might enjoy this, as there are none of those cheesy "I feel a song coming on" moments - - all of the music is confined to the stage of the Kit Kat Klub. Michael York's role is often overshadowed by Minnelli's brassy Sally Bowles, but his work is equally strong. A+.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In here life is beautiful!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wanted to see this movie after I bought the soundtrack for the Broadway revival version of the Cabaret musical this summer. So I bought the DVD and at first I was a little disappointed.Not by the movie really,but by the fact that not all the songs from the Broadway show were in the film.I really love that soundtrack so it mattered to me a lot.Well by now I have really gotten over it.It doesn't matter anymore because the film works so well without the other songs,I feel it has everything essential from the stage version,which I have never even seen btw,yet anyway.This is not your typical musical.It is made in a very realistic way,so there is no sudden singing like normally in musicals.Almost all the songs are performed in the Kit Kat club and they add to the seedy atmosphere there.Thinking about it now this was a good choice.It allows you to really focus on the characters and their development...as a realistic drama Cabaret is wonderful.The actors are very good.I never cared much for Liza Minelli before but in this film she gives the perfect performance.Being very believable as Sally,who goes through so many things but still,in the end,decides to continue like before. "Life is a Cabaret old chum..."Michael Yorke and Joel Grey are also very good.I have a thing for Alan Cumming from the Broadway version as the MC,he seemed so sleazy it was amazing,but I have to admit that Joel Grey was excellent in the movie.He was all together funny and creepy and I don't wonder why he got the Oscar from this role.Cabaret deals a lot with the Nazis coming into power in Germany in the early 1930's,even though it looks like a secondary theme in the movie.The closing shot is off a room full of Nazis shown through a mirror.It leaves no questions about the future of Germany.I haven't seen that many films dealing with pre nazi Germany before and I thought this one did it quite well.So Cabaret is basically not "just" a musical.It has some darker themes about society,as well as showing us what the night life,and life in general,in poor Germany after the first World War just before Hitler came to power was like.And yes it also has wonderful musical scenes,good acting and is definitely worth the time to check out if these things interest you!!9 out of 10."So, life is disappointing? Forget it! In here, life is beautiful. The girls are beautiful. Even the orchestra is beautiful."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Center Jewel in Bob Fosse's Triple Crown</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1973 was a very good year for legendary director/choreographer Bob Fosse. He won an Emmy for directing and choreographing the television special LIZA WITH A Z, he won a Tony for directing the Broadway musical PIPPIN, and blindsided Francis Ford Copolla by winning an Oscar for Best Director for CABARET, the dazzling 1972 film version, which is Fosse's re-thinking of the 1966 Broadway musical. The stage and screen versions are quite different and as independent works, they stand on their own as outstanding achievements and it is not necessary to have seen the play to appreciate the movie. The main focal point of Fosse's re-thinking of the musical is that he wanted it to be a more "realistic" musical and therefore made sure that all of the musical numbers (with the exception of "Tomorrow Belongs to Me")all took place within the walls of the Kit Kat Club. He cut several numbers from the original score, but if you listen, some of them can be heard as background music in several scenes. He also shifted the focus of the way the story is told...the play tells the story from the leading man's point of view, but Fosse switches the focus to the character of Sally Bowles, the brassy, sassy party girl who believes in "divine decadence' and wears bright green fingernail polish. Fosse also takes two secondary characters from the play, who are older, and makes them young and attractive in order to make their story more youth-friendly, I imagine. Liza Minnelli turns in a dazzling Oscar-winning performance as Sally, a gutsy, self-absorbed party girl who shows signs of vulnerability and a desperate need to be loved. Minnelli makes the most of her musical and non-musical moments in the film...her climactic confrontation with Brian (Michael York)is brilliantly performed. York is charming and sexy as Brian and Joel Grey's Oscar winning turn as the Master of Ceremonies is a delight. The musical numbers are all brilliantly staged and performed, from the opening number "Willkomenn" to the new "Money" song performed by Minnelli and Grey, to "Maybe this Time", the ballad belted out by Minnelli onstage in the empty club. Fosse cleverly counterparts the musical numbers with the realities of what is going on in Nazi Occupied 1931 Berlin with sometimes startling effect. "Tomorrow Belongs to Me" still gives me goosebumps every time I watch the film. This film ruled at the '73 Oscars, winning eight awards in all (it lost Best Picture to THE GODFATHER)and deserved every accolade it received. A sparkling, eye-popping, thought-provoking, haunting film experience that should be savored over and over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That's what I call a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a strongest film I know. Every time I watch it, it bewilders me so I can't turn my eyes away from the screen, even though I remember all what happens by heart. It fills me with a strange mixed feeling of interest-sympathy-admiration-disgust-and-horror. One of the reviewers here called this film depressing, and I inclined to agree. Any picture of Berlin in 1931 must be depressing and frightening. But, on the other hand, there is an atmosphere of desperate reckless joy in the movie. When the entire world goes mad and speeds to a catastrophe, life is a cabaret! Do what you can, come hear the music play, don't permit some prophet of doom wipe every smile away, and end as the happiest corpse! It's one idea. There is also another, more humanistic: live and let live. Brian fails to understand Sally, so they fall apart. Fritz for the sake of his love faces the danger of admitting that he is Jew in Germany. There is no hope for him and Natalia in this country in this time. But he couldn't do otherwise. There are plenty of other ideas too: about money, politics, corruption, perverseness, decadence, stupidity of middle classes, talent, success, etc. The story is very simple and incredibly complicated in the same time. No use retelling it. It must be seen. It's life as it was in 1931 and in many ways as it is nowadays. I suppose that Cabaret would be a great film even without any musical numbers, but with them it is a masterpiece. They say that history repeats itself, for the first time as a tragedy, for the second time as a farce. Well, I would say that in Cabaret every event repeats itself for the first time as a human drama in life and for the second time as a farce on the stage, but it would not be exactly true. Life and farce are shown synchronically or farce even go in advance. But every staged number in divinely decadency Kit Kat Klub ruthlessly shows the naked truth of life. (Only Mein Herr and Maybe This Time have more to do with the character of Sally Bowles.) And of course, Tomorrow Belongs To Me must be mentioned separately. The way of German people towards fascism is presented in one startling scene. And in finale too. That distorted reflection of the audience full of Nazi, accompanied by a tense silence after Master's of Ceremonies ?Aufwiedershen' is horrible. The movie due half of its unforgettable effect to the masterful camera shots. Actors' works are absolutely fantastical. Surely, Master Of Ceremonies is Joel Grey star role. He is amazing as that demonic shameless figure that seems to know everything, understand everything and deride everything. Liza Minnelli shines in every scene, acting, speaking, singing and dancing. I know few performances equally true, strong, brilliant and stylish as hers as Sally Bowles. Michael York is excellent as well, though he is often underestimated. It's only his character who is reserved, intelligent and avoids show-off. And he is perfectly British. I really admire York's acting in the movie. There are also beautiful Marisa Berenson as noble Natalia, Fritz Wepper very believable as tormented Fritz, repulsively attractive Helmut Griem as the rich scoundrel Maximilian and picturesque supporting cast. John's Kander's music is wonderful and haunting. Shortly, Cabaret is a work of a genius, or it would be better to say of geniuses: Bob Fosse and the crew and the cast. And it's flawless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest musical film of the Seventies, winner of 8 Academy Awards...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Cabaret' is a dazzling combination of music, drama, and social commentary...'Cabaret' is more than a musical... It is tough, satirical, acrid, and provoking... None of the sweetness of Rodgers and Hammerstein, none of the joyous celebration of life of 'The Sound of Music.''Cabaret' is an exciting place for music...'Cabaret' is the first musical to exploit the notion that life is fascinating because it is ambiguous... 'Cabaret' uses music in an exciting new way... His characters do not disintegrate into song to express their emotions... Rather, a sleazy night club becomes a place where satirical comment on the lives and problems of these characters is made in striking, entertaining, and often in ferocious dances and songs...'Cabaret' is only one of three major elements that remains separate in the film and then gradually and inexorably become melted into one... These elements are the music of the cabaret, the lives of the principal characters, and the world outside of their narrow domain... Director Bob Fosse captures the atmosphere and turmoil of the time and place, just before Hitler's rise to power, presenting a multifaceted portrait of a hedonistic, increasingly dangerous society, in which every brushstroke is significant and influential...The cast, headed by Liza Minnelli as an American cabaret star and Michael York as the shy Englishman suffering with the fact that he "doesn't like girls," perfectly embodied the characters caught up in the currents of the tale...The film begins with an amorphous view of Berlin's Kit Kat Club in 1930s Germany, and as the view becomes clearer, we meet the nightclub's depraved customers and its host, the charming painted emcee, who sings 'Willkommen' as the cabaret's girls play their musical instruments... At this moment, the Kit Kat Club shows a world unconcerned with events... Sally is a citizen of this world, deliberately shocking, cheerfully promiscuous, a lost child masquerading as a seductive woman...Away from the nightclub, Sally plays the leading role in a fantasy of her own imagination... Speaking almost entirely in emotional hyperbole, she regards herself as 'a strange and extraordinary person'... She takes Brian under her wing and one day introduces him to Helmut Griem, a rich, suave, divinely sexy baron with whom they both have affairs... Everyone becomes part of her free world: an unseen father who is indifferent to her; and Marisa Berenson, a young serious Jewish department-store heiress who is feverishly courted by an opportunistic, a fortune hunter, called Fritz Wendel (Fritz Wepper)..At first Sally's insulated life bears little relation to the events propelling Germany toward its bleak destiny... Gradually, however, the cabaret becomes more threatening; the Master of Ceremonies provides the historical and social themes throughout his songs.. (he and Sally sing 'Money makes the world go 'round').. Later he sings a stimulating 'Two Ladies' about the joys of a ménage ? trois.. He even dances with a girl in a gorilla costume, singing 'If You Could See Her' adding in a confidential whisper, 'If you could see her through my eyes, she wouldn't look Jewish at all!"Only once does the film leave the nightclub for a musical number in an outdoor café, and then it is for one of the film's most haunting scenes, where a young boy begins to sing 'Tomorrow Belongs To Me'.. While Fosse's camera pans down to reveal his sinister insignia... started to sing along with patriotic passion... It is a sequence of frightening beauty, made even more memorable by several quick shots of an elderly man, silently sitting on a table.. disapproving the song...When the pathetic Master of Ceremonies tells us once again that 'life is beautiful' and the Kit Kat Girls break into a reprise of 'Willkommen,' the irony is devastating... The final shot of the growing of Nazis in the audience reinforces the menace of the political horrors, and turns the cabaret into a daring place of diverting escapism...As Sally, Liza Minnelli is entirely a creature of cabaret... She sings the title song in a number of stunning effectiveness... The song sums up the film's sardonic view... Minnelli is required to go from a girl of easy virtue proclaiming that 'certain cigarettes make her go wildly sensual' to a helpless person sobbing 'Maybe I am.. just nothing!' --- but she manages to control the connections of mood with style and sensitivity... In one song, 'Maybe This Time', she is too close to her mother Judy Garland.. as the two possess a similar intensity, warm vibrato, the blend of pathos and humor, and an over-eagerness to communicate with their audiences... 'Cabaret' is not unforgettable... It is great entertainment, a daring piece of diverting escapism that hopefully will revitalize a tired form...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than just an excellent movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is perfect. You will enjoy the bright play of brightest actors as well as tunes that have become classical. In any moment you can pause a movie and get a picture that you'd want to hang up on the wall in your house - so beautiful the movie is. If you can play any musical instrument, you will definitely try playing tunes from Cabaret. But the film has more than that : it also shows how Germany was slowly but inevitably turning to fascism. You feel scary when you listen to a song "Tomorrow belongs to me" and see that the boy singing the song wears the Nazi emblem on his shoulder. It gives you this sort of "I-know-what-will-be-in-the-end" feeling you have when you see newspapers and videos made years ago - yet it reveals some sides you didn't know about.Cabaret is a very deep movie. There are lots of details in the movie - brightly exposed to us by an excellent cameraman - which create a second, historical storyline which you start to understand only after you watch the movie for a while. Cabaret is the kind of movie you'd want to see several times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best musical &amp; one of the best films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This landmark masterpiece defies strict classification. It is one of a few movies which defines cinema. It's undefinable as a genre because it works as a musical, as drama, as a comedy, as a war movie, as a social satire, as a historical epic, as a masterpiece of cinematic choreography, AND THE LIST GOES ON. Interestingly, it is over powering not only as a film, but as an original Broadway musical, a novel, a play, and most recently as a revamped musical which incorporates the new songs and choreography created especially for the film into the original show. And the Tony and other awards from other media keep pouring in. The new DVD version is a must. This is the movie that in a very tight Oscar race year (like 1939 with Gone with the Wind, etc.), won NINE Academy Awards. And that against the Godfather! (Part I, just for starters.) The late Bob Fosse did score a major coup by winning the Best Director Award over the favored legendary Director of the Godfather. Fosse's delegacy lives on...on film, and on stage right now in London, Berlin, and New York where the CABARET revival, did I mention CHICAGO?, and FOSSE, the musical- based on his life- including a piece from the movie of Cabaret continue to dazzle new generations. The DVD is a knock out too. Truly one of the best, a cliche often said. THIS CLAIM, however, IS A FACT.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hugely successful tale set on Nazi Germany with classic musical sequences and unforgettable songs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young English man named Brian(Michael York, in a character based on Christopher Isherwood's experiences) develops a relationship with a reckless young American girl named Sally(Liza Minnelli at a wonderful performance to the edge of tragedy) in Berlin during the 30s in which Hitler is rising to power and racism, anti-Semitism and determinedly amoral behavior are growing. They're both then seduced by a German rich aristocrat named Max(Helmut Griem). Meanwhile Brian works as English teacher for an elegant young Jewish(Marisa Berenson) and his friend Fritz Wendel(Fritz Wippel), both of whom falling in love. All the roles are linked by the Kit-Kat club where perform Sally and an androgynous master of ceremonies(Joel Grey , he deservedly won Oscar to best support cast).It's a magnificent musical-drama well set on Germany where are increasing horrors of Nazism taking place on its grim moments. Atmospheric nostalgia piece from the stories of Christopher Isherwood and successfully creating a portrait of a nation falling into moral decay. It's one of the most perfect examples of accurate timing over a sustained period ever put on cinema. This dynamic film packs excellent musical numbers full of aggression, fire and turn out to be unmissable experience. Liza Minnelli, Michael York and Joel Grey give the acting of their lives. Glamorous and evocative cinematography by Geoffrey Unsworth . Based on the John Kander's hit Broadway musical and soundtrack by Ralph Burns full of classic songs. This story was formerly brought to life by Henry Cornelius (1959) with Laurence Harvey(Brian role) and Julie Harris(Sally role) in a good drama no musicalized.¨Cabaret¨ is an impressive picture splendidly directed by Bob Fosse(1927-1987) and winning three Oscars. Fosse was a director, actor, choreographer and dancer. He choreographed : ¨My sister Eileen, The Pijama game, Damn Yankees¨ and directed another films with awesome musical sequences such as ¨Sweet charity and All that jazz¨.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An eerie, glowing tinderbox full of grinning souls and desperate laughter...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pre-Nazi Germany is a hotbed of escalating tensions, but decadent nightclub performer Sally Bowles is oblivious to the encroaching horrors. If you know a little about Liza Minnelli and you're curious, "Cabaret" should make you a fan; if you're not interested or just don't like her, "Cabaret" probably isn't the movie for you. Liza is the heart, soul, and centerpiece of the picture; when she's on-screen, everybody else is irrelevant. Movie-fans still discuss whether Liza was actually acting the role of Sally Bowles or just being herself (her Oscar-win still draws debates--Diana Ross in "Lady Sings The Blues" is oft-times described as 'robbed' for the Best Actress statue). Indeed, time has proved that Minnelli had a whole lot in common with Sally, the parallels are even echoed in much of the dialogue, but this part utilizes her entire range (sarcastic sass, vulnerable imp, high-powered musical presence) and she's fabulous. She doesn't do anything small, even her quiet moments are extraordinary. Her final speech to Michael York ("How soon would it be before we started hating each other?") is a knockout, as good as any of her musical numbers, and when he lashes out in anger, she sighs, "If you wanna hit me, why don't'cha just hit me?" She can be fragile and wounded, but it's in her spirit to get right back up and perform. The film is a burlesque nightmare, amazingly directed by Oscar winner Bob Fosse, who also choreographed the musical numbers, and photographed by Geoffrey Unsworth, another Oscar recipient. ***1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Divine Decadence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished re-watching Cabaret and it is even better than I remembered it. It is a dazzling ball at the Satan, the Feast during the time of plague. It is an unforgettable film, made by the master, the screen version of his own stage masterwork. It is dark, prophetic capture of "divine decadence" that paved the road to the most horrifying hell of unspeakable catastrophe that the world had not seen before. Bob Fosse proved in his only second directed film how talented he was in everything he was doing. Shot entirely on the location in Berlin with the Kit Kat Club cabaret of the title as a real centerpiece of the movie, "Cabaret" is a marvel of directing, editing, color settings, that in combination with brilliantly clever and catchy songs, creates the doomed ambiguous atmosphere of uncertainty, hanging onto the present moment, and not daring to imagine to whom tomorrow belongs and what tomorrow will bring. It is impossible to talk about Cabaret and not to mention the international cast of the young talented actors who played the characters of their own nationality. Two definite stars of the film are without doubt Liza Minnelli as Sally Bowles and Joel Grey as creepy devilish MC. For me, the film belongs to Liza Minnelli who gave performance of such energy, charisma, and exuberance, that it has become Liza's calling card and, her claim to cinematic immortality. Under her rather intimidating makeup - her eyes that took up the good half of her face, the eyelashes so long that they can reach the opposite wall of the room, the impossible garish colors of her eyelids that probably glow in darkness unmistakably announcing her presence and colored in dark green finger nails that can be considered the dangerous weapon, Sally is vulgar but vulnerable, corrupted but lovable, oblivious but lonely, talented but stuck in the cabaret Kit Kat Club where the music never stops and life is always beautiful ...In 1973, Cabaret competed for the Best Picture of the Year award with number one of 250 Best Movies as per IMDb users, Francis Coppola's Godfather. Not only it was the equal contender, it won 8 of ten Oscars it was nominated for, including Best Director for Bob Fosse, Best Actress for Liza Minnelli, Best Supporting Actor for Joel Grey (who was against three heavy weights from Godfather - Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall), and Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Cinematography. With all my love for Godfather, I believe Cabaret deserved all its awards, and as time goes it proves to be one of the best screen musicals ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Perfect Film About One of History's Darkest Hours</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bob Fosse's most accomplished film is one of the most accomplished films ever made, period.Fosse understood that the days of the old-fashioned Hollywood musical were over, at least as of 1972, so he gave audiences a musical that doesn't feel like a musical. Based on Christopher Isherwood's fine collection of novellas, "Goodbye Berlin," and the subsequent stage musical based on them, "Cabaret" takes elements of both sources to create something completely unique. It tells the story of Brian Roberts (Michael York), a British professor who travels to 1931 Berlin to give English lessons to a wealthy heiress of a German Jewish family. He meets the irrepressible Sally Bowles (Liza Minelli, in a dynamite performance), an American and fellow lodger in his boarding house, and the two begin a madcap friendship and sort-of romance, eventually falling in with a wealthy German baron until they all fall out with one another. Meanwhile, revellers come to the Kit Kat Klub, the cabaret where Sally performs, to join the sinister Master of Ceremonies (Joel Grey, recreating his Broadway performance) in laughing away the dark cloud of Nazism building on the German horizon.Fosse sharpened his directorial teeth on "Sweet Charity" three years earlier, and while I greatly admire that film, I can admit how uneven it is as a movie. "Cabaret" proves Fosse to be a master behind the camera, with a directorial style as unique and instantly recognizable as his choreography. The Kit Kat Klub and its devilish M.C. provide stylized commentary on the world rotting away outside the cabaret's decadent interior; the musical numbers don't advance the plot as much as comment on it. Fosse's way of filming musical numbers is fascinating, using quick edits to capture movement from multiple angles almost simultaneously. But what gives "Cabaret" its shattering power is the way it depicts the Nazi movement's insidious rise to power even as people were dismissing it as a joke. For all of the film's stylized panache, it provides one of the most realistic documents I've ever seen of just how the Nazis positioned themselves to dominate Germany. It's no coincidence that the film's most disturbing moment comes not in the nightmare, feverish world of the cabaret's stage, but rather in the realistically depicted world of a German beer garden, where the angelic voice of a Nazi youth raised in song becomes a rallying cry and call to arms for the German people. The acting is phenomenal. Liza Minelli gives easily the best performance of her career and one of the best performances in the history of cinema. Joel Grey creates a character who manages to be no one and everyone at the same time. One can't imagine this vampirish imp of a man existing outside of the dark, lurid walls of the cabaret. And Michael York does terrific work as well, even if his role isn't as showy.I think "Cabaret" has been underrated because people have labeled it as a musical, and musicals never get taken as seriously as other genres. But I would caution anyone against dismissing this film on those grounds. Yes, there is music in it, but what "Cabaret" is more than anything else is a haunting warning about the dangers in any time and place of ignoring the unpleasantness of the present and near future for the hedonistic pleasures of the moment.Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life is a cabaret old chum! Come to the Cabaret.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Willkommen, bienvenue, welcome! Fremde, etranger, stranger. This movie is phenomenal, one of the best of all time musicals ever. Directed by Bob Fosse, what a marvelous performances by Joel Grey and Liza Minnelli in this picture. Cabaret is a lot of fun to watch. The film is loosely based off the 1939's book written by Christopher Isherwood call 'Berlin Stories: Goodbye to Berlin" and John Van Druten's 1951's play, 'I am a Camera'. Cabaret was made into a Broadway musical in 1966 with music by John Kander, and lyrics by Fred Ebb. When it became a hit, a movie was produce in 1972, to capitalize on this fame. The film is set in Berlin during the Weimar Republic in 1931, under the ominous presence of the growing Nazi Party where a small night club call Kit Kat Klub is struggling to survive during the coming months of the harsh new regime. Since the musical kept on rewriting the script, as years passed by. A lot of the source material has change over time. In this version, young American Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli) performs at the Kit Kat Klub, while running a boarding house. A new English teacher arrival in the city, Brian Roberts (Michael York), and moves in with her. At first, they kept each other at reservations, trying not to fall in love with each other. As time go on, the two find themselves madly in love with each other, while the world is finding new ways to keep them apart. The acting is pretty good. I really can't picture anybody else in the role of Sally Bowles. Indeed, Liza singing is way too talent than her character is supposed to be, but it didn't really hurt the film. Sally Bowles was based on Jean Ross, an aspiring actress, singer and writer, who lived a colorful life. Jean Ross was offended by the character portrayal by Liza, call it apolitical. After all, Jean Ross is kinda right. Sally Bowles might not be the most likable character as she does a lot of pretty awful stuff, but the way, Liza Minnelli sink you in, with her charm. You can't help, feeling for her. She always had that frantic, nervous, almost desperate disposition in everything Liza's in. It really does explain why she didn't had much of a film career after this. Normally I find this off-putting, but here, it works perfectly in this role. Sally always looks and sounds like she's in deep, desperate denial about her life and the state of Berlin, and constantly seems on the edge of a nervous breakdown. I really fell pity for Michael York's character to having to deal with her. I never understood why, they change the character name from Cliff Bradshaw to Brian Roberts. It seem a bit odd. I found York acting alright, but he never stood out, much. I did find his big reveal to Sally about what happen to Maximilian von Heune (Helmut Griem), midway through the movie to be a great twist. That wasn't in the stage versions. The movie also dealt with sub-plots, dealing with other characters like Fritz Wendel (Fritz Wepper), a German Jew passing as a Christian who fall in love with Natalia Landauer (Marisa Berenson), a wealthy German Jewish heiress. This part of the film, always felt like a different movie. It never mixed, well. The sub-plot from the novel, involves the doomed romance between German boarding house owner Fräulein Schneider and her elderly suitor, Herr Schultz, a Jewish fruit vendor never got anywhere, as it was cut from the film. I also glad, they cut the dead dog scene. That was pretty awful. In the traditional manner of musical theater, every significant character in the stage version of Cabaret sings to express emotion and advance the plot, foreshadowing every song with Master of Ceremonies (Joel Grey). Fosse cut a lot of songs like 'Don't tell momma', 'So What?", "Telephone Song", "Perfectly Marvelous", "Why Should I Wake Up?", "The Money Song", "It Couldn't Please Me More", "Meeskite" and "What Would You Do?" He replace them with new songs like 'Mein Herr' and 'Money, Money". There were a lot better than those other songs. The song 'Willkommen' and 'Cabaret' were after all the best pieces in the musical. The club serves as a metaphor for the threatening state of late Weimar Germany that is clear. While this might be long stretch, the film could also be a metaphor of American Ku Klux Klan movement that was gaining ground in the 1960s. After all, the club had the same initials of the Klan. Indeed, the KKK didn't embrace Nazism, because they believes in an entirely different form of government and freedoms. But like the film, the culture of the KKK embracing Nazism into their lives. It might be something to think about. Honestly, the only song that wasn't play at the club was 'Tomorrow belongs to me' in the beer garden by the German youth was powerful. What a really great haunting song by two great Jewish songwriters. Great use of the elderly man in the background of that scene. Director Bob Fosse knew how to film this movie, and that's one of his greatest shots in the film. For a movie rated PG. It's has strong adult themes. The ending to the film is hard to swallow. Unlike other musicals at the time, this one doesn't end with a positive note. Still, the movie was indeed a success, and won many Academy Awards with 8. It would had won Best Picture in that year if the Godfather film wasn't so damn awesome. The movie is easy to find, despite not being available in high-def or digital presentation, due to a really bad scratch on the original film. Overall: it's was a great commentary on the "mask of normalcy" people are wearing during the rise of Fascism in Germany. A must watch for any musical lover.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the Greatest of All Broadway Musical Adaptations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First released with the tagline "A Divinely Decadent Experience" - Bob Fosse's film retains its power to shock forty years after its original release. Beautifully filmed, with a brilliant use of intercuts between the musical songs and scenes of sickening violence in the Berlin of the early 1930s, the film provides an object-lesson in how a musical in film should work, with the songs commenting on as well as advancing the plot. Liza Minnelli is quite simply the definitive Sally Bowles, combining boundless self-confidence with an innate vulnerability. She shows a mastery of tone and shade in her rendition of some of the tunes - in the title song, for instance, she recalls her mother at her best, whereas in the song "Maybe This Time," she reveals the character's inner yearning for a better life. Likewise Joel Grey is definitive as the Emcee - a vicious parodist who knows precisely what the songs mean in terms of satirizing Germany at the beginning of Nazi rule. Michael York's "Brian Roberts" (actually Christopher Isherwood) is both bemused yet appalled at what happens around him; he can never become actively involved either in the anti-Nazi movement or the decadent world of the Kit-Kat Club due to his respectable upbringing. He can escape from Nazi Germany; sadly neither Sally nor the Emcee have that privilege. This is the film's principal tragedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cabaret</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A timeless classic! The musical numbers alone are superlative, even the 30-years-younger CHICAGO (2002, 8/10) pales in comparison. My very first Bob Fosse's film, certainly the film gained its classic fame as the biggest winner of the Oscar in 1973, with 8 wins (including BEST DIRECTOR, LEADING ACTRESS and SUPPORTING ACTOR) and nearly usurped the BEST PICTURE trophy from THE GODFATHER (1972, 9/10), if it had been so, it would be inflicted with much notorious backfire in the film history, but the film itself is an unerring gem among the undying musical genre, my first viewing is a thoroughly exultant experience, and cut and dried, it's on my guilty-pleasure list. It is my first Liza Minnelli's film as well, the cabaret's "international sensation" Sally Bowles, an innocuous vamp, Liza grants her role a disarming vitality and quaintly resembles a bobbed Anne Hathaway doppelgänger, not only radiates her grandeur in rendering her doughty-yet-alluring show tunes (she is born to do it), her portrayal of Sally personal life is equally (if not more) affecting, her doe-eyed naivety and unrestrained zest for life, for love, for fame elevate her character as the master of her own fate, her sacrifice may not gain concurrence from motley views of life, but a full obeisance to her independence and pluck is duly earned. Michael York, behind his gawky effeminacy, plunges himself into a more contentious venture, Brian Roberts, his character's bookish bi-sexual temperament is a provocative taboo on big screen (like since ever) and the implicit ménage ? trois temptation (with Sally and the suave Helmut Griem, whose gentrified debonair is utterly irresistible) has been simmering to the perfect temperature, under-girds a manifestation of initiating a sex-liberation wave (germane to the 70s era while against the Nazi-rising milieu in the film). There is a subplot dealing with a bromide of a down-and-out German guy's infatuation with a rich but prude Jewish girl, there is an ironic twist near the end, however never quite manages to steal the limelight from Sally and Bri, but Marisa Berenson's placid performance is still worthy of backslapping (the dichotomy of women's images is a trifle stale though). Joel Grey, as the so called "Master of Ceremonies" and won an Oscar (against three fellows from THE GODFATHER), serves only as the performer in the film, no clear attachment with the plot, his musical set pieces are burlesque, risqué but entertaining to the bone, with a strenuous mimicry of German accent, it is a hard-earned honor, although I don't understand how Al Pacino could lose at any rate. The film drops its curtain right before the prevalence of Nazi's atrocity, the ending with the vague reflections of Third Reich audience occupying the place has sublimated the materialistic razzle-dazzle onto an eerily ominous scope which the film has no interest to tamper but the audiences will intuit what will happen next. A great windup, neat and potent!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An effective, dark film that is a talent show for Liza Minelli</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is there a real difference between Europe and the U.S. in the Great Depression era (the era of this film) and now? In the 1930s, Europe, the U.S., and the rest of the world were in a horrible economic melt-down. The stage was set for a man like Hitler to use his charisma to take power by giving people - especially young people - an ideal to fight for.I think one of the most effective scenes in this superb, dark film is the way they do the song "Tomorrow Belongs To Me". A great song, but to me the way it is done is very effective. It opens with a tight close-up of a young man who starts singing. All you can see is his face. He begins to sing and the camera slowly backs out to reveal that he is a Nazi. Very well done. The young people in the audience are shown in close-ups, rising and singing this song, but, like the lead vocalist, not joyously. To me, it was almost like they're "programmed" to rise and sign along with it. The faces are of hate and determination, not joy about a more beautiful tomorrow. It's as if the movie wants to show that they have been brainwashed. They are willing to fight and die if needed for their ideals and one is either for or against them.Also effective is the comment by Michael York at the end of the scene, where he asks "Do you still think you can control them?" and then, in a haunting way, we see Joel Gray as the M.C. in his pancake makeup with an eerie "See, I told you so. There is much more to come" smile. Powerful stuff. To me, that scene sums up the whole movie.A powerful, tour-De-force show for Liza Minelli and a fascinating commentary on the Germany of the Great Depression. It is an effective although depressing film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A welcome surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my time on this planet, I have passed this film by at least a hundred times, curious, but not enough to warrant seeing it. Well, this weekend curiosity got the better of me and I finally broke down and saw it. I was pleased to find a very tightly constructed piece of musical drama, in which the drama and the musical elements are separate yet interconnected.A story ostensibly about the end of decadence in Germany and the simultaneous rise of the Nazi party, "Cabaret" winds up being much more. Unlike "Titanic"(1997), which also intermingled historical events with a love story, "Cabaret" uses the cabaret as a device to comment on the goings-on in the story surrounding it, yet doesn't feel tacked on or phony like the former film. Part of this is because of the wonderful performances all around, and part is the sheer craftsmanship involved in putting the film together. Liza Minnelli and Michael York make us actually care about their characters, and Joel Grey brings a creepy verisimilitude to the Master of Ceremonies. Marisa Berenson, Fritz Wepper, and Helmut Griem put in fine supporting performances, lending dimension to what could have easily been cardboard characters.The craftsmanship of Geoffrey Unsworth and Bob Fosse is no less impressive. I was familiar with Unsworth's work from "Superman: The Movie" and was amazed with his ability to make Liza look so breathtaking here. Fosse's direction and staging of the dance numbers is classic Fosse, even if the film had to be tightened up by the studio prior to release. This is great entertainment, with food for thought, and the Kander &amp; Ebb songs stay with you long after the film ends.Come to think of it, so does the film itself. Well worth seeing, and the ending is very thought-provoking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The All Time Great Film Musicals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When director and choreographer Bob Fosse decided to adapt the critically acclaimed Broadway musical CABARET to the screen he took on a daunting challenge. The 1966 hit, a song-filled version of John Van Druten's 1952 play I AM A CAMERA, itself an adaptation of British novelist Christopher Isherwood's BERLIN STORIES, CABARET incorporated both the traditional conventions of the American Musical Theater (boy meets girl , love songs sung by the main protagonists) coupled with the more daring plot device of a ghoulishly painted Master of Ceremonies who comments on the main story's proceedings through song and dance. The musical eerily evoked the decadent, devil-may-care atmosphere of Berlin in the early 30's and the apathy of the citizenry to the encroaching Nazi takeover. As with classic Rodgers and Hammerstein shows of the past, CABARET included a romantic subplot (this time involving an older couple, A German landlady and her Jewish tenant) that strongly tied in with the book's stance against prejudice. But composer John Kander and lyricist Fred Ebb went much further than Rodgers and Hammerstein in conveying man's inhumanity to man : the nature of Evil permeated the entire atmosphere of CABARET. Albeit entertaining,even exhilarating, the new musical never lost sight of the forces that would lead pre-World War 2 Germany to the brink of social and political disaster. In the process of transferring CABARET from stage to screen, Fosse and screenwriter Jay Presson Allen scrapped much of Joe Masteroff's Broadway script and went back to the original source, Isherwood's stories, creating a more intricate storyline and eliminating certain subplots while adding new ones. The German landlady became a mere walk-on role, the older Jewish suitor was gone. The young British writer Cliff, straight in the Broadway production, became sexually ambiguous Brian in the film . British Sally Bowles, the singer in the notorious Kit Kat Club Cabaret, was now an American played by Liza Minnelli. Into this mix was included a wealthy Jewish heiress involved in a doomed romance ; and a menage a taros involving Brian, Sally and a seductive German Baron. This indeed was going to be the most adult rendition of The Berlin Stories depicted in any medium. As the Master of Ceremonies, the androgynous one-man Greek Chorus who introduces the acts at The Kit Kat Club, the producers retained the protean talents of Joel Grey, repeating his Tony Award winning stage performance. Under the meticulous direction of Bob Fosse and abetted by master technicians Goeffrey Unsworth (cinematographer), David Bretherton (film editor), CABARET emerged as a daring , stupendous piece of work. The opening scene introduces Joel Grey, the sycophantic emcee, introducing the audience to the denizens of the seedy cabaret. Throughout the film these musical sequences at the Club are artfully interspersed with domestic scenes between Brian and Sally at Fraulein Schneider's rooming house and other Berlin locations. Simply put, the movie walks a brilliant tightrope act , juxtaposing the cabaret numbers with everyday life outside its parameters. In a brilliant masterstroke, songwriters Kander and Ebb confine the music only to the cabaret numbers, dropping all of the song score sung by the principals (the eliminated songs do make an appearance however, as background music on Sally's phonograph and in public settings!) What impresses one most now about CABARET in the thirty -odd years since its release, aside from its technical triumphs, is the great ensemble acting of its cast. Liza Minnelli's star wattage never shone more brightly than it did in this film. Although turning Sally into an American slightly skews the story, Minnelli is so strong in the part that it hardly matters. Not a subtle actress, her animated delivery is shown to great advantage here , hiding a more exposed creature underneath. In scenes where Minnelli shows her vulnerability, she is deeply affecting. There's a repeat of her memorable Pookie from THE STERILE CUCKOO here, coupled with her dynamic, no-holds-barred stage performances at the cabaret . One of the inherent weaknesses of the film is Sally's desperate longing to be a star, a major film actress. She desperately desires fame but is portrayed in the rooming house scenes as a young woman with only mediocre talent who needs constant reassurance. That idea is totally obliterated when Minnelli takes the stage. She holds both the cabaret and movie audience hostage with her incredible talent, culminating in two unforgettable numbers, the gorgeous torch song "Maybe This Time" and of course "Cabaret". At the peak of both her physical and vocal powers, Liza Minnelli gave a performance that rightfully earned her the Best Actress Oscar that year. In recreating his stage role for the screen, Joel Grey again demonstrated his brilliant gift of tying all the elements of the story together. With his decadent air, slicked back ebony hair, painted face and rouged lips, he comes across like a living, rotting corpse. It is a chilling sight. Equally impressive is Michael York as Isherwood's alter ego, the young novelist who fatefully becomes involved with poor unstable Sally. Marisa Berenson , Helmut Griem and Fritz Wepper round out a superb cast. CABARET has lost none of its glow over the years ; in fact it looks better than ever. It also has the distinction of stealing some of the thunder from one of the greatest American films ever made. At the March 23rd, 1973 Academy Award ceremony, THE GODFATHER won three Oscars, including the much coveted Best Picture Prize.. But CABARET ran off with eight Oscars, including Best Director for Fosse and Supporting Actor for Grey. It also won nearly every technical award in sight. That this landmark musical film shared highest honors with Francis Coppola's masterpiece only adds to the movie's luster. CABARET is a classic for all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joel Grey's MC bespeaks uncomfortable truths through risqué entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joel Grey's MC, the iconic centerpiece of "Cabaret," is a fool in the Shakespearean sense: his outrageous makeup and clownish demeanor give him license to speak the most embarrassing truths and to broach the strictest taboos. We never see him out of his MC persona, but we do see two layers to his performances. As the host of an interwar Berlin burlesque, he is on one level?and perhaps for him it is the only level?an entertainer for Nazi fatcats and wealthy Yanks and Brits on continental vacations. But art imitates life, and we can also see, perhaps all too plainly, how the songs that the MC presents mirror events in the world outside the club. The Nazi party's growing boldness is displayed through rapid cuts between mob violence in the streets and the MC's cartoonish goosestepping on stage. The unusual love triangle between Liza Minelli's hopeful actress and her British and German paramours has its telling parallel in the song "Two Girls." Most shockingly and ambiguously, the MC lampoons anti-Jewish miscegenation laws by romancing a person in a gorilla suit and asking why society should stand in the way of their love. Would the Nazi party view this routine as an endorsement of their policies, since the idea of a human and a gorilla in love is patently foolish, or would they understand that the MC's question had truly moved the audience in spite of the veneer of absurdist comedy? The music of "Cabaret" underlines the plot points in very bold strokes, but it works because everything is so unabashedly theatrical. Matching Joel Grey's achievement and far outshining a weak turn from Michael York, Liza Minnelli gives an all-time great performance, particularly in the songs "Mein Herr" and the title tune.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1931, in Berlin, the English professor from Cambridge Brian Roberts (Michael York) comes to the boarding house where the promiscuous American performer and singer of the Cabaret Kit-Kat Club Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli) lives. They befriend each other and soon Sally discovers that Brian is not attracted by women, but they have a love affair. When Sally meets the wealthy Baron Maximilian von Heune (Helmut Griem), both Sally and Brian are seduced by the baron. Meanwhile there is the ascension of the Nazi Party. "Cabaret" is a movie too long with a shallow story, but nice musical show. Joel Grey steals the movie in the role of the Master of Ceremonies.

		<fullReview>It's a sad fact that a period movie will almost always reflect the year it was made more than year(s) it takes place. Take, for instance, Julie Christie's hair in "Dr. Zhivago," or Kate Beckinsale's...well, entire appearance in "Van Helsing" (although, was that even an issue in that steaming pile of bad FX?).One of the best aspects of "Cabaret," then, is that it truly does feel like you're watching a movie from 1931. Well, sort of. If it were made in 1931, it would almost certainly be in Black &amp; White, have primitive sound quality (sound pictures still being relatively new at that time), and maybe be a little less frank about its homosexual content (although being that 1931 was a year pre-code, who knows...). Perhaps a better way of putting it is: "Cabaret" looks like you're watching actual events from 1931, not 1931-by-way-of-1972. The costumes, makeup (the overly arched brows and pancake makeup of the KitKat girls is just as creepy as it is sexy, if not more so), sets, and even attitudes are practically a living postcard of Weimar Germany (as far as this 23 year old American can tell). There are no glaring anachronisms here. It's astonishing.Another is the character of Sally. Fledgling writers are always encouraged to make their protagonists as sympathetic as possible, otherwise what will care about their journey? Sally is flighty, shallow, self-centered, and proves that she can be bought. Why do we love her so? Why do our hearts break when her father stands her up after she spent the first half an hour lying about how much he cares for her? More important than sympathy (or empathy) in a character, IMO, is dimension. With good, there is bad. With pattern, there is contradiction. Sally, above all the aforementioned characteristics, is career driven. And no one's gone to the top without a little white lie or two (or three, or four...). Of course, dimension or no dimension, the wrong actress (or even poor acting by a great actress) could make this character fall flat. It's because of that, that one cannot speak of this role without mentioning the sparkling Liza. Those who dislike the movie often site Liza's "over the top" acting as a chief flaw. I don't see that here. Perhaps if she were the Sally from the stage production brought over to film, this would be the case, as sometimes stage actors forget how intimate a medium film is (the severely under-rated RENT does suffer from this occasionally, for example). Her singing, while jaw-dropping to say the least, is just one part of her role. Watch this girl ACT. Look at the giddy expression on her face when Max volunteers to "corrupt" her and Brian. Watch her desperately (and eye rolling-ly) try to impress the upper crust at a dinner party. Watch her try and play down the immense physical pain she must be in after a back-alley abortion. Yes, she has an amazing voice, but this is performance that would scream "Oscar!" even if there were no singing at all.But, "Cabaret" IS a musical. Another sad fact is that when showtunes become standards, they lose almost all of the potency they have IN CONTEXT. Sure the title track IS a fun song and all - "Come to the Cabaret, old chum! Life is a Cabaret!" - on its own. But watch it where it belongs - it's quite depressing. She's lost a good man, friends (I doubt she'll be seeing much of Fritz after the wedding), and in the end her career is in the same spot it was when the movie began. The Nazis, once dismissed as a thuggish cult, are growing in number. How much longer does she have to be safe? Better enjoy what she has left. See what I mean? This is a dark musical, folks. No "happy ending, fade to black" here. The songs, all performed in the night club, avoids the suspension of disbelief required for other musicals when characters randomly burst into song on the sidewalk. And though they don't further the plot along in the strictest sense, they do parallel. "Two Ladies" is sung while Max, Sally, and Brian drive to his mansion. "Mein Herr" is sung when sexual tension begins to arise between Sally and her new roommate? Foreboding? I think so.And what can one even say about Joel Grey that hasn't already been said? Pure. Genius. No one else can make you simultaneously laugh and feel uncomfortable like that."Cabaret" is a brilliant watch: dark, clever, complex, but un-deniably catchy and not dated by a long shot. You'll get chills and frown at the end....but then you'll rewind to the beginning and watch it all over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliantly successful combination of musical with dark drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The scene is Berlin just before the completion of Adolf Hitler's rise to power. Two apolitical people go about their lives while impending doom surrounds them. Cabaret is a ground-breaking combination of social drama and musical entertainment. It's one of the best examples of films from the New Hollywood. This was a short time in American cinema where the studios were producing challenging and director-led personal films.What Cabaret does which is so unique is to reinvent what the musical could be. It's a film that is essentially a drama that uses musical numbers to comment on its story. The songs all fit into a realistic narrative. Most of them are sung within the confines of the Kit Kat Klub, the cabaret of the title. In taking this approach the movie is more able to incorporate a disturbing subject such as the Germany's progression to Nazism into this most fantastical and joyous of film genres. All of the songs comment on the social situation in Germany at the time and because they are all performed in the cabaret they can be explained in a real context, cleverly allowing those who do not even like musicals to enjoy them as they do not break the illusion of reality. The one song that is performed outside the club is perhaps the most memorable however. 'Tomorrow Belongs to Me' is sung by a young fresh-faced boy with an angelic voice. It starts out quite beautifully but as it progresses the camera pans down and we see the emblem of the swastika on a band around his arm and realise he is a Hitler Youth. The words suddenly take on an altogether more sinister meaning. It's a moment that really encapsulates the way that fascism seemed like a progressive way ahead for the majority of people at the time. With the benefit of hindsight we, of course, see the horror of what it represents but for many Germans at the time, the ideals of Hitlerism had an attraction, and 'Tomorrow Belongs to Me' brilliantly illustrates both these points.Another way in which the film differentiates itself from most others that deal with this time and place is that there is barely a mention of the Nazis at all. All the Nazis characters exist in the periphery of the story, they barely interact with the characters in any way. Their significance is in no need of emphasis; their presence is ominously felt throughout. Cabaret reflects the changes in Germany from the point of view of people living in their own little world but the true horror is never far from the surface. The strange insular world of the Kit Kat Klub encapsulates this perfectly. Hosted by the enigmatic, almost supernatural, Master of Ceremonies, it's a decadent place that exists apart from the realities of Hitlerism, a place that we all know must be ultimately doomed when the Nazis fully rise to power.Performances are universally great with Michael York and Liza Minnelli both putting in very fine work. Minnelli especially has to be credited for combining both dramatic acting and musical performances of both the highest calibre. The songs themselves are memorable and work in the clever double way of providing entertainment while commenting on dark issues below the surface. In a sense, that is the genius of Cabaret overall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A musical for those who do not like musicals.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't usually like musicals. The sight of people bursting into song while engaged in some ordinary activity strikes me as silly. But, as a musical, this movie appealed to me since the musical numbers are integrated into the fabric of the movie by being part of the cabaret where the main female character, Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli) performs. The story has Brian (Michael York), a Cambridge student, coming to Berlin in the early 1930s as a private English language instructor. Brian becomes involved with Sally and their alliance is extended to a threesome when Max (Helmut Griem), a German aristocrat, joins the action. The subtle give-and-take among the three makes for engaging drama. There is one exchange between Sally and Brian that I think most people will remember long after having seen the movie.I found the musical numbers well choreographed and visually striking. The numbers are so good, and the production values of the cabaret so super, that I had to feel that either this cabaret was the best in Berlin, or there was some polishing done to make these become knockout numbers for the movie. As opposed to musical set pieces that are non sequiturs in many musicals, the ones here establish context, creating a bawdy decadence played against a menacing backdrop of the rise of Nazism. The only song performed outside of the cabaret was the one, "Tomorrow belongs to me" sung by a Hitler youth in a beer garden. This is one of the most powerful scenes I have seen in a movie. It gave me an insight into the beginnings of Nazism that I had not had, showing how a nationalistic song can possess an audience. In its own way this scene had a more chilling effect on me than the tirades of Hitler. After the song, Brian turns to Max and asks, "Still think you can control them."The acting is all first-rate. I was particularly impressed with Joel Gray as the master of ceremonies of the cabaret--he has an unctuous cynicism that is simultaneously disgusting and transfixing. The cut to Gray's malevolent little smile after the singing of "Tomorrow belongs to me" provides a perfect punctuation for the song. Gray well deserved his Oscar for best supporting actor. Liza Minnelli gives a standout Oscar-winning performance. York and Griem are well cast and hold their own in roles that are less demanding than those of Gray and Minnelli.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Originally a 1966 Broadway musical, this groundbreaking Bob Fosse musical was in turn based on Christopher Isherwood's Goodbye to Berlin, previously dramatized for stage and screen as I Am a Camera with Julie Harris as Sally Bowles. Fosse uses the decadent and vulgar cabaret as a mirror image of German society sliding toward the Nazis, and this intertwining of entertainment with social history marked a new step forward for the movie musical.Cabaret is a musical film starring Liza Minnelli, Michael York and Joel Grey.Michael York plays a British writer who comes to Berlin in the early 1930s in hopes of becoming a teacher. He makes the acquaintance of flamboyant American entertainer Sally Bowles, played by Liza Minnelli. Sally works at the Kit Kat Klub, a George Grosz-like Berlin cabaret where each night the smirking, androgynous Master of Ceremonies (Joel Grey) introduces a jazz-driven "girlie show" to his debauched audience. Virtually all the film's musical numbers are staged within the confines of the Kit Kat Klub, and each song comments on the plot and on Germany's "progression" from hedonism to Hitlerism. Most of the Broadway score by John Kander and Fred Ebb was retained, with the welcome addition of "The Money Song."This is one unforgettable film musical.Although it lost Best Picture to The Godfather, Cabaret won eight Oscars, including awards to Minnelli, Grey, and Fosse.Everybody in Cabaret is very fine, and meticulously chosen for type, down to the last weary transvestite and to the least of the bland, blond open-faced Nazis in the background.It's entertaining and stylish despite the fact though it maybe not quite as serious as it wants to be.But nevertheless,it is a great musical film just for Liza Minnelli alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceptionally well made film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cabaret is an exceptionally well made film - the music, choreography, acting, screenplay and direction are all of very high caliber. Even after 36 years, it hasn't aged, and is as shocking and entertaining as ever. It deservedly won 8 Oscars in spite of competition from one of the most beloved movies of all times The Godfather. Although the academy is notorious for decisions based on emotions rather than merit, in this instance, I consider the splitting of best direction and best picture Oscars between the 2 films as a just outcome. It's therefore very surprising, it's not on any of the all-time-great lists - a great injustice, or could it be a conspiracy? It'll certainly be on my list of 100 all-time-great movies.</fullReview>

No-one breaks into song and dance for no apparent reason in this film. Liza Minelli plays a singer working at a cabaret club, and the music is set within this context, with her performances juxtaposed against and enhancing plot developments.

How odd that he portrays a British writer rather than Nazi when he could easily pull off the latter. But he does well regardless.Liza Minnelli is incredible, and really deserves more credit as an actress. Clearly she was honored at the time, receiving an Oscar for this role, but she is best known as a singer. That may be fair, but do not discount her acting. From this to "Arrested Development" and everything in between, she can be a powerful force.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"What good is sitting alone in your room, come and hear the music play. Life is a cabaret my chum, come to the cabaret" which of course is the heart of the glitter covered, sequin wearing, toe tapping wonder emporium that is the Kit Kat Klub, packed up to the rafters with high notes, transvestites and raucous laughter. Between the choices of all that and my room, I know I would rather be on a Saturday night, because 1932 Germany is the place to be! But I warn you to get there fast, because what is waiting on the horizon will defiantly ruin the party. Oh forgot my manners, allow me to introduce to you Miss Salley Bowles (Liza Minnelli), husband richest man in the world and of course a future acting superstar, a creature of true divine decadence as she would better put it. At a glance her eyes may be full of youthful exuberance and naivety, but when you look deeper, you realize it's all just a ploy, a false bravado to keep her fragile spirits from being damaged. But the only person who knows this is also a person you would describe as the exact opposite, Brain (Michael York) who is a uptight, straight laced, bisexual Englishman, the absolute antithesis of everything that is Sally. Yet the signs of a beautiful romance begins to blossom between them. But life is never that easy, because the malicious Nazi party waits around the corner and a love triangle with Maximilain threatens to thrust the romance into inescapable turmoil. The 1972 Academy Awards was the battlefield of two almighty giants that waged war against each other for the rights of their place on the cinematic throne for that year. The battle was of course won by Godfather when it took home Best Picture, but with a mammoth total of 8 Oscar nodes, including a Best director for Bob Fosse and best actress for Minnelli, I doubt Cabaret will be feeling to down after the event. You realize why Cabaret did so well with each repeat viewing gives you something completely different; may it be songs for yours next karaoke night, a celebration of weird quirks or must importantly a chance to awe at Minnelli's delightful performance as Salley all over again. I would be the first to admit I was nether much of a fan of musicals, I found them to be plot less, lacking in any character depth and just generally derivative. So film like Chicago, Moulin Rouge and high school music's never really appealed to me, I just shudder at the thought of being in a world where people would randomly start breaking out in song and dance for no real apparent reason. But then I saw Cabaret, I wouldn't even say it's entirely a music, it more a film with musical numbers in it and certainly not derivative on contrary it's multilayered and brimming with subversive themes that are as relevant to 1932 Germany, right into 1972 America and forward to worldwide today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Powerhouse,, even today and a unique musical in the genre, kudos to Oscar winner Minnelli</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the early thirties, American Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli) is doing what she loves most, singing in front of an audience. Nevermind that its in the somewhat seedy world of cabarets and the pay is not overwhelming. She keeps a small flat in a large boarding house and, one day, gets a new neighbor. He is naive Brian (Michael York) who is a Brit with a yen to teach English to Germans. Shy and reserved, Brian is struck by the outspoken, daring singer and doesn't quite know what to make of her. Or, for that matter, the cabaret itself, where songs are scandalous and politically charged. Also at the musical watering hole is the Master of Ceremonies (Joel Grey) who is talented performer with a cynical, risk-taking demeanor. Naturally, at this time, Germany has been in the throws of a deep monetary depression, having been severely punished by the victors of the first World War. Citizens flock to the cabarets to forget their troubles. But, more disaster is ahead of them, as the Nazi party is slowly taking over and the Jewish population is being humiliated, treated as scapegoats for all of the country's ills. Against this backdrop, Sally and Brian "hook up" with each other, a match which may not be made in heaven. Also, since they have become friends with one of Brian's students, a beautiful Jewish heiress (Marisa Berenson), will the political situation test the loyalty of friendship? This is a powerhouse of a film, being a political musical which doesn't "sing anyone's troubles away". Yes, the songs are catchy and buoyant, up to a point, but there is always an undercurrent of tension and despair. The cast is truly superlative. Minnelli won a much deserved Oscar for her matchless work, while York, Berenson, Grey, and all of the others are great, too. Sets, costumes, script, photography, artistic assets and direction are all worthy of high praise as well. Therefore, if you were born long after this film was released or if you just want to finally see a film you've heard so much about, seek out Cabaret.</fullReview>

The only person I understood more in the film was Liza Minnelli because i find that she spoke more clearer then the rest of them. It wouldn't make any difference if she was Amercian or not, she was more on the ball. Although I found the storyline really boring, the music really stood me out. I honestly loved 'Maybe This Time' since it is a very well known song and of course it was covered many times by different artists including the TV show 'Glee'.

		<shortDescription>An ominously dark musical classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Berlin in 1931 was a liberal, some would say decadent city; the first world war had been over for some time and the dark years of Nazi rule had yet to begin... in this setting we find our protagonist; American cabaret singer Sally Bowles. One day she meets Englishman Brian Roberts; he rents are room in her apartment and gives English lessons to get by. The two of the become friends and later on lovers; this is complicated when she meets Maximilian, a wealthy baron, who showers her with gifts and gets close to her... and Brian! In a side story Brian's student Fritz falls in love with Natalia Landauer, another student who is also a wealthy Jew but is unsure how to go about letting her know. As the film progresses the Nazis rise from being a relatively minor group to being the dominant force in Berlin Society; a force that will change things forever. Interspersed with the story we see a variety of songs being sung in the Kit Kat club with either Sally or the unnamed Master of Ceremonies performing.The primary story isn't exactly deep but that doesn't matter as it is well told; Liza Minnelli and Michael York go great jobs as Sally and Brian; the former showing that she can sing as well as act. Joel Grey's performance as the club's sexually ambiguous MC is another highlight despite him having little to do with the main plot. The film's greatest strength is that it doesn't concentrate on the rise of the Nazis; it happens in the background; gradually; in the way that such politics gradually corrupts a nation... the moment we see a young boy singing 'Tomorrow Belongs To Me' turns from pleasant to ominous when the camera moves back to reveal his Hitler Youth uniform. The film contains several great musical numbers; all of which take place on the stage of the Kit Kat Club... so if you are the sort of person who doesn't like musicals were people break out in song as they do ordinary things you can still enjoy this! The inclusion of a bisexual love triangle, transvestites and abortion may have been shocking when the film was released; now it is unlikely to shock most people but nor does it distract from the film as it is something that feels natural in the setting rather than something forced in just to shock. If you like musicals this is probably a must see but even if you don't it is well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>" You're about as Fatale as an after-dinner mint "</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie called " Cabaret " was originally created as a musical Novel by Joe Masteroff. Taken to the silver screen, it was then expertly directed by master choreographer Bob Fosse who worked himself into a heart attack, directing it. The story tells of Brian Roberts (Michael York) who travels from Cambridge England to Berlin, Germany in 1931, during the rise of the Nazis. There he meets American, Sally Bowles (Liza Minneli) a fun-seeking, well-meaning, but ditsy Cabaret singer. Together they touch lives amid the growing depression enveloping the world. Roberts takes adjoining lodgings in an inexpensive apartment with Bowles and meets a variety of friends like Maximilian Von Heune (Helmut Griem) At her place of employment, the Kit-Kat club, Sally joins the Master of Ceremonies (Joel Grey, superior performance) on the small stage. The film is rich with dancing routines and wonderful Musical numbers, like 'Money' 'Two For One' and 'If you could see her through my eyes.' The happiness of the movie is punctuated with background scenes of the growing and menacing brutality of the Nazis. Yet, the movie garnered a flurry of Awards and testimonials and despite it's years on the shelf, has remained a Classic. Recommended! ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mercilessly Bleak</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh how bleak! Most musicals are upbeat. This one isn't. The plot contains lots of laughter and there's plenty of music. But the laughter reeks of derision, mockery, and scorn. And the music is mostly doleful. Set in 1931, the Cabaret is Berlin's smoky, hazy Kit Kat Club, wherein a cocky, sneering, grotesquely made-up M.C. (Joel Grey) lords over a mishmash of performers, one of whom is Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli), singer/dancer and actress wannabe.But like vultures, uniformed Nazis hover in the plot's background, an ominous harbinger of encroaching evil. Effervescent Sally tries to block them out of her mind as she performs on-stage, and welcomes a potential romance with Brian (Michael York), a youthful, handsome guy just in from England. There's a "live for the moment" attitude among all the characters. The Sally/Brian relationship is marginally interesting. But the heart and soul of the film is the Cabaret with its terrific lighting and art direction. Most of the film's songs are sung here, either by Sally or the M.C. or both. A couple of songs are just awful. But most are at least melodic, the two best: "Maybe This Time" and the title song at the end.At one point Brian and his friend Max are at an outdoor beer garden. Suddenly, some teenage guy, healthy-looking, normal, and bright, starts singing "Tomorrow Belongs To Me." And he sings with gusto. Then the camera slowly pans down, to reveal on his sleeve a Nazi emblem. Soon, others join him. In this film, the curse of Nazism is never far away."Cabaret" is a hard film to judge. You have to admire the cinematography, set design, art direction, era costumes, and bizarre makeup. Acting is acceptable, though Liza tends to overact in some scenes. And film editing is absolutely terrific. But the visual and musical tone is relentlessly downbeat and dreary, yet appropriate given the political climate. Desperation seems to be the underlying message. "Cabaret" is a film about ordinary people clinging to their feel-good moments amid impending cultural collapse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film with a single character: The Master of Ceremonies. An ambiguous spell and walls of illusion. Subtle exploration of chimera and fall of an era. A special inebriation and columns of words, songs, dreams, love, lies, freedom and hypocrisy like shield against terrible future. Nothing real, nothing splendid or ugly. Only the believe in miracle and in art to build another tomorrow. Joel Grey- in a magnificent role- is the almighty puppeteer. Master of show, maker of sins, lenient, sarcastic, cruel, brutal, ambiguous, a vulnerable androgynous god, he is the incarnation of Old Greek anenke. So, the film, cobweb of lights, smiles, dances and promises, good intentions and fear, is not pledge for classical "Life is theater play" or "Life is dream" but for the painful "Life is only refined lie". Natalia Landauer and his husband,the charming Sally Bowles,the wistful innocent Brian Roberts, are victims of same illusion who can be skin of reality.Beautiful film. Gorgeous music.

		<shortDescription>intriguing adult musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Liza Minnelli's only great film role immortalised her for all time as the good-time girl in Berlin, Sally Bowles, and very good she is too in the role. This film adaptation of Kander and Ebb's stage musical junks most of the story in favour of exploring the darker side of Berlin just before the Nazis rise to power. As a musical, it is curious, with the story dealing with a lot of adult themes (particularly the love triangle between Sally, the English intellectual she lives with, and the young dissolute Baron they find who showers them with gifts). The power of the stage version's Nazi and anti-Nazi themes is buried in a more personal story, but this in itself is interesting.Some of the songs, too, were ditched ('Don't Tell Mama' was one I particularly missed) in favour of a couple of new ones - 'Mein Herr', and 'Money Money'. As well as Minnelli, the musical and showy strength of the film comes from Joel Grey, transported from the stage version in his bizarre make-up to continue as reflector and commentator on troubled times. In non-musical support, Michael York does well as the troubled bisexual PhD student finding his life is in limbo; while other, smaller roles playing out their own mini-dramas are memorable. The best song, however, is the rousing 'Tomorrow Belongs To Me', which allows the Nazi supporters to join in chorus to proclaim their idea of a new world. Within the fabric of 'Cabaret', this is chilling indeed.</fullReview>

In the Kit Kat Klub, singer Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli) shares her English lover (Michael York) with a homosexual German baron, and her Jewish friend Natalia has troubles of her own.This version of Christopher Isherwood's Berlin stories regrettably follows the plot line of the play I Am A Camera rather than the Broadway musical on which it is allegedly based, and it lacks the incisive remarks of the MC, but the very smart direction by Bob Fosse creates a near-masterpiece of its own, and most of the terrific songs are intact.

And you never knew where his creepy face would pop up and smile at you. However, the fact that his make up was piled on top of his face like nothing I've ever seen, somehow stands for something. It stands for how he sees everything, while max, sally, and Brian are on the boat, his face pops up and says "money". I guess that means that max has so much money he can do whatever he wants, he can just buy off his two new friends.

		<shortDescription>Berlin sings and dances as Nazi Regime waits in the wings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Berlin 1930. The city is a haven for society's outcasts, foreigners, transvestites, prostitutes. The focus is on "Sally" (brilliantly portrayed by Liza Minnelli), a life- (and men-) loving American night club singer with secret dreams of settling down and living a more respectable life. She befriends a young unemployed translator and "shacks up" with him. Together they (and others) witness the changing winds brought on by the emerging power of the Nazis.The musical numbers are fantastic, most memorable the "Money" song and Liza Minnelli's solos. "If You Could See Her Through My Eyes" is a thinly veiled commentary on the Nazi's hatred towards Jews. The vulgarity of the night club milleu adds to the realism of a tragic chapter in German (and World) History. This film is a masterpiece deservedly honored with 8 Oscars! -- If you ever get a chance to see a stage production of "Cabaret", by all means SEE IT. Some of the effects are even more stunning when seen live on stage. This is one of Broadway's finest musicals ever. Without a doubt, this brilliant transfer to film is Bob Fosse's masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>social commentary set to song</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shakespeare's words "all the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players" ('As You Like It') are amplified in this brilliant movie. Life is a Cabaret to Sally, Brian and company. Knowing we're all players, the protagonists that populate this movie dashingly treat life as a cabaret. What the hell, if we're on stage, let's have some fun, eh? Sally worries she is not shocking enough. Brian worries he is too shocking. The energetic, epicene, outre', omniscient Master of Ceremonies serves up appropriate commentary for every situation in the lives of the players, dishing out obiter dictum via the Kit Kat Club stage. A great number of societal references can be inferred from the Kit Kat Club's numbers, not only the obvious one portrayed, the Weimar Republic's failure to stand up to the looming evil of fascism, but you can feel shades of reference to the American civil rights struggles of the 60s, the human choice of escapism in the face of adversity, and also the classic search for self-acceptance that each faces. All this in a Cabaret, you ask? You bet. As the players rocket through the comedy of life and all its tragicomic turns, their better angels do prevail in the parting. One lesson they learned being, sometimes you just have to be yourself, and let others be themselves, and that painful recognition is the greatest act of acceptance (and love?) that one can make (Sally and Brian's taking leave of each other). The film comes across as well or better than the stage version. Fosse, Allen, and Wheeler sagely selected the right subplots from the Isherwood stories, and Fosse earned a direction Oscar (over Coppola!) for his focus. Cabaret won eight Oscars, a bizarre record in that it's the most Oscars won by a film that didn't win Best Picture (it lost to 'The Godfather'). Forget your troubles (remember- that's a conscious choice for each of us- cross-reference 'Life Is Beautiful'). Come to the cabaret. Wilkommen en cabaret--- enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i had always thought this movie was just another musical and with liza minelli it didn't seem like it had much to offer. i was so wrong. this movie is amazing. it is dark, grotesque and unapologetic. definately not just another musical. it uses the grimy, grotesque and mostly comical cabaret shows to parallel the twisted political events unfolding in germany before world war II. this movie is a social comentary above all else. it doesn't hide itself and never apologizes for the ugliness it shows us. one of the most effective scenes to illustrate this is when natalia finds her dog murdered on her doorstep. it's one quick shot, not long enough for the shock to sink in, and then we're back to the cabaret where joel grey is dancing with a monkey, asking the audience to forgive him for loving a jew, all with a cruel, malicious smile. his character amazes me because it embodies all the movie is: he is sick and disturbing and yet very entertaining. this is probably the darkest musical i've ever seen. it ends with a song but in no way are things settled. the final shot is that of a blurred cabaret audience, the only fairly clear symbol being a swastika on a nazi armband. the movie is over but the horror in germany has just begun. the killings in the movie are random and gruesome. blood is well distributed but none of there is little emotional attatchment to any one of these victims shown, except the dog. in one scene, the car carrying sally, bryan, and george passes a dead body lying in a pool of blood in the street, obviously a nazi victim. george comments that the best thing to do is let the nazis kill all the communists and then the germans can control the nazis. we see the spectators around the dead body and all are frozen. it is very inhuman, no emotion, no shock. it has just begun. the same inhuman statues are found in the beginning and end of movie at the cabarate shows. another incredibly effective scene is that of a german family picnic where one young perfect aryan boy begins to sing, very loud and clear in german. the camera pans down and we see he is in a nazi uniform. soon, the singing spreads to the other young people, eventually ending in the entire gathering united in a warlike, patriotic song. the effect is horrifying. as bryan comments wryly to george "and you say we can control them?" the love story between sally and bryan, while entertaining, seemed to me like only a small supporting plot. my attention was focused on the sleazy world of the cabaret: an amoral, very sexual and grotesque world that suits that period of germany perfectly. the intercutting of scenes of the cabaret and german society was very effective. i think many people underrate the importance of this movie. too many people go in looking for light entertainment. this is a very good movie and the songs are entertaining but it is anything but light entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK. Aside from Liza Minnelli's somewhat abrasive singing and her hideous eye make-up, as well - (Along with the story containing some totally unwelcome Nazi-glorification in its "Tomorrow Belongs To Me" sequence) - I certainly thought that, for the most part, 1972's "Cabaret" was one of the better Musical/Drama/Comedy pictures that I've seen in some time.Set in Berlin (circa 1931) - Cabaret's best moments were, of course, its well-staged musical numbers (choreographed by director, Bob Fosse). It was especially showstoppers like "Maybe This Time" and "Mein Herr" that were the real standouts.A winner of 8 Academy Awards - Cabaret was a fairly stylish and socially conscious production. And, believe it, or not - Included in Cabaret's story of ruthless gold-digging and dreams of "being a somebody" - It also featured one of the first-ever mixed-gender love triangles to be seen in a mainstream, Hollywood picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Liza Minnelli had done very few films prior to this one, but lots of television. She was definitely ready for prime time and more in this one as she is amazing in this one all the way through. Between this one and New York, New York which came later this one is no doubt Liza at the top of her game. Her Sally Bowles character is the most recreated on live stage of any role. The major surprise in this one is Joel Grey. He made his role as the Master of Ceremonies his own and he is at the top of his career here. He also had much television work before this movie and a couple of minor film roles. He is so big here that at times he dominates this film.Of the 4 writers involved only Joe Masteroff is still alive. One of the writers, John Van Druten, never saw this result of his writing a he died in 1957. All the writers should be proud of their results here on film. Director Bob Fosse's fine work with this one is very evident and he would go on to do the hit musical Chicago many years later. This is a classic now and destined to grow a more classic for the years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bob Fosse's Masterpiece an Unforgettable Display of the Social and Political</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No matter what Your Opinion of this Musical-Drama Gem, it Stands Alone amidst a Genre with its Ultra-Stylish Expressive Entry that is Like No Other. Bob Fosse made Few Movies (his heart was definitely in the Theatre) but Almost All of them are Excellent.This One may be the Most Excellent. It's fine Cast are Alluring and Fosse's Camera says in no uncertain terms "I am Camera" and will not be Denied. The Editing is Distinctive as it Links the "Real Life" Political and Social Concerns of the Day with the Rise of the Nazis in 1930 Germany. The on Stage Numbers seem to profoundly Defy the "Brown Shirts".That Defiance is Intercut as the Film Peppers back and forth between the Stage and the Street Brutality frequently and is Powerful the way it Hammers the Surreal with the Real. Almost All of the Musical Numbers are Displayed Distinctively as Reflections of the Undeniable that something Devastating is Happening to the Country and its People.Its People are in a Decadent Mood and the Cabaret is where They go to Display and Play. Liza Minnelli is the Fulcrum the Film finds its Message and its Story. She is Simply "Divine" as the Playfully and Aloof Sally Bowles as She Parties like there is No Tomorrow. Speaking of Tomorrow...If the Song "Tomorrow Belongs to Me" doesn't send Chills to Your Sensibilities and Receptors, You're not paying Attention and are Heartless. In Fact, many of the Songs are Sublime Recreations of the Human Condition and are Classic Pop Culture Contaminants that Entertain and Posses. The Film is Possessed and Joel Grey as the Devil Incarnate Winks at the Audience as He Unveils Their Sins and Relishes that the Nazis are even more Corrupt than the Patrons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weimar's cautionary tale -- the pursuit of happiness as a distraction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The pursuit of happiness, enshrined as a right in the US Constitution, is one of the greatest motivating factors in all of human history. It can also be one of the biggest distractions. CABARET, from the musical by Kander and Ebb and directed by Bob Fosse, is sort of an examination of this through the historical lens of late Weimar Germany as it succumbed to Nazism. Liza Minnelli is Sally Bowles, a dancer/singer at the Kit Kat Club who has dreams of becoming a famous actress; and Michael York is Brian Jordan, an English philosophy student who is in Germany for cultural enrichment and to make some money. Both of these tragic figures are the conduit for the audience, with Sally being the fantasy side of things and Brian being the reality. As with CHICAGO, although a little less so here, the musical numbers don't just move the story along (all while being organic) but also comment upon it as well. This, for me, is what sets Kander/Ebb musicals apart from the rest. Nazism begins as a mere nuisance but, as the film progresses, becomes more of a presence (and present threat). This is mirrored in the pacing of musical sequences which are initially spaced out a little sparsely but become more frequent as the film goes on. From an interpretive standpoint (and this is just my opinion), this implies (through the nature of what a cabaret is and entails) that our willingness to be entertained and distracted, even if only temporarily, is what allows political extremism/tragedy/etc. to insidiously take hold. No scene in CABARET is more chilling than when the young Nazi starts singing (what I think is) a folk song, and his audience gradually joins in with him. In fact, this entire musical is filled with pathos of varying types, which is why I think it's so effective. The cabaret is a metaphor for the ways we try to mask our pain, to find happiness, but it often comes at the expense of our dignity. From a technical perspective, all of the performances were solid with special marks being given to the leads. However, Joel Grey as the Master of Ceremonies was just as entertaining, perhaps the most so as his role provided dramatic and musical unity to the film. He was also simply hilarious to watch. There was also dynamite editing, choreography, lighting, etc., making it a sort-of ancestor to the music video. If there's one complaint I can levy, it's that the film takes a little too much time to get going, although once it gets into gear it doesn't let up. All things considered, CABARET is a stunning accomplishment that still holds relevance in this day and age of disillusionment with the political establishment. I'm a little hesitant to draw parallels between the America of today and the Germany of then, but it's a little disconcerting to feel like the only thing keeping us from making the same mistakes is that we've never suffered the abject humiliation that Germany suffered at the end of WWI. On a more positive note, CABARET exists as a testament to the power of entertainment, and definitely deserves its status as one of the best musicals ever put to film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A landmark in film history!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Cabaret" was the most influential musical film since "42nd Street". Widled considered one of the greatest films ever made, it follows the young, wild and sensitive American Sally Bowles, who lives in Berlin and work in cabaret "Kit Kat Club". She met Brian Roberts, a young British, shy and reserved who needs work as a English teacher. They immediately feel attracted for each other but some problems come with her obsession with money and his attraction for other men. Meanwhile, a destructive power grows in Berlin...In the early '70s, when the films that explore violence and sex began to take care of movie theaters, musicals seemed to be too outdated to suit young moviegoers expectations with the "New Hollywood". Until Bob Fosse (doubtless, the most underrated director) adapted a Broadway musical that defined the posterior types of it's genre. "Cabaret" is not full of sparkles, it does not have a happy ending and is waaaaaaay sexual for kids used to having the Gene Kelly movies. Still, it is the adult themes (that even some adults are not mature well enough to understand them) which include corruption, sexual ambiguity, false dreams and hedonism that include it as one of the most important of the 70's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Entertaining. Set in Germany in the 1930s, an entertainer, Sally Bowles (played by Liza Minnelli), is in relationships with two men. Meanwhile, the Nazi party is starting its rise to power...The musical and theatrical numbers are great, the initial plot is intriguing and the movie seems propelled by a bouncy vibe. However, ultimately the plot is so-so: it doesn't really go anywhere or make any profound statements. The Nazi Germany setting gives a vast amount of room for biting statements, but the movie only scratches the surface.Liza Manelli is superb in the lead role. Her bubbliness and warmth keep the movie going and give it a beautiful light feeling. Good support from Michael York and a host of German performers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Opening scene comparison to the Sound of Music with reference to COLOUR.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening scene of Cabaret is quite a contrast to a movie like The Sound of Music. The colours are dark, and it seems there is an unveiling. There is Jazz music and the sound of laughter, so it is not peaceful and serene as the Hills and Julie Andrews singing. When we meet the first actor, it is evident that is it a more comical movie, whereas Julie Andrews is more serious and solitary in the opening scene of The Sound of Music. Cabaret is more sexual, playful and colourful. The colours are rich and dark compared to the soothing blues and greens in The Sound of Music, indicating that this movie is darker in nature, appealing to more sexual and naughty pleasures. There are costumes and make up, revealing a sort of covering which does not occur in the free, real scenes at the beginning of The Sound of Music. Cabaret indicates a sense of absence of morality, as opposed to modesty and innocence.</fullReview>

In a thousand years from now, some theater major in some college on some yet to be discovered planet will watch the dancing in Cabaret and be as stunned by it as we all were the first time we saw it.Maybe only one or two other movies reach this level of perfection, and no other movie can top it.This movie is as good as it gets.Tony</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A triumphant success</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Cabaret" is an American movie that came out over 40 years ago, the very same year that a certain "The Godfather" was released as well. These two films dominated the year in terms of awards success with finally "The Godfather" winning Best Picture at the Academy Award, but still scoring less overall wins and with Coppola losing the Best Direction Oscar to Bob Fosse. Liza Minnelli and Joel Grey won the acting categories. You can see "Cabaret" from several different perspectives: The first would be as a romantic drama. It is okay as that. I would not say that it's among the best in that genre that I have ever seen, but the romance plots work for the most time and there is actually two of them. The main plot is obviously between Sally and Brian. We see how they meet, how they argue, how they meet other people and it all amounts into Sally's pregnancy. However, I must say that I found the relationship between Wepper's and Berenson's character at least as interesting. The second approach could be in terms of a political movie and it is a huge success as that one. It has references and depth from that perspective that most political thrillers can only dream of. I may be a bit biased here as I always found the second quarter of the 20th century the most interesting era in terms of politics, but still. Then again, it's fairly different to set this apart from seeing "Cabaret" as a musical movie as almost all the songs have a bit of a political background, some more subtle, some less subtle. The highlight of this was probably "Tomorrow Belongs to Me" as it is finally depicted how unstoppable the Nazi movement had become at that point and how everybody joins in the song as well as the rise of the NSDAP. Or almost everybody as the very old man's ideals obviously differ from the modern image the party was trying to portray at that point.And finally, I would like to give a special mention to Joel Grey. He beat 3 actors from "The Godfather" and without being somehow depreciative to their performances I want to say that it's absolutely amazing that his great performance here was awarded accordingly. It may be true that we do know almost nothing about his character in terms of who he is as we only see him in his role all the time, but he created one of the most enigmatic characters in film history and his musical performances are nothing short of outstanding. The songs fit him perfectly and he is the heart and soul of the film and the time when he is on screen is the most memorable from the whole film to me. No offense to Minnelli. Every one of Grey's songs is a winner. Just like the entire movie. Thumbs up and I urge everybody with an interest in 20th century politics to not miss out on that one. Here in Berlin, it's occasionally still shown on the big screen, probably because it's set in the German capital as well. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Liza Minnelli and Joel Grey terrific</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's pre-war Berlin. The country is in a depression struggling between Communists and Nazis. Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli) is a flamboyant bohemian American singer performing at the Kit Kat Klub with MC (Joel Grey). British academic Brian Roberts (Michael York) from Cambridge moves in to finish his doctorate. She falls for him despite him being adverse to women. He teaches English to earn money and one of his students is a rich Jewish heiress Natalia Landauer. She is uncertain about the advances of Fritz Wendel. Sally and Brian are befriended by rich playboy Maximilian von Heune who seems to be interested in both.Liza Minnelli is brilliant. Joel Grey is magnificent. Michael York is put in a tougher spot as a bi-sexual. I buy him more as a homosexual and I like his friendship with Sally more than his romance with her. The biggest deficiency is Helmut Griem as Max. The role needs to be a matinée idol and played by a superstar. It's minor but very important to see both Sally and Brian tripping over themselves for the guy. He needs to be magnetic. The Bob Fosse songs are incredible. The inter-cut scene between the stage and the beating by the Nazi thugs is truly compelling. The pacing does go flat at times and it probably could be trimmed a little. Overall this is a great musical and social drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My first encounter of the film when I was around 17, it was shown on the television which was around the 30th anniversary and round the time Liza Minnelli was married to David Gest. As soon as I watched the film I bought it on video for myself and it was a film I watched more than once. The cast were great including Joel Grey, Marisa Berenson and Michael York. Liza Minnelli was great as the Cabaret singer Sally Bowles, there are some scenes where she sounded like her mother Judy Garland for example the part where she tells Brian (Michael York) why she had an abortion. The soundtrack is brilliant my favourite songs are Two Ladies and Money Makes The World Go Round. There were scenes which were disturbing like the dog being killed because it's owner Natalia (Marisa Berenson) was Jewish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life is a Cabaret Old Chum</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is an unwritten rule in musicals and specifically movie musicals. They have to be decadent. Especially in modern times everything from the themes to the set pieces have to be elaborate, abundant, clean, shiny and new; and why the heck not? No one really breaks out into song with a mood forming Greek chorus bellowing behind them. It only makes sense that if you're going to be creating your own reality in song; you might as well go for broke.Cabaret starts in the Berlin Kit Kat Club during the waning years of the Weimar Republic. Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli) works and performs there clinging to a dream of discovery and eventual stardom. The Emcee (Joel Grey) invites us, the audience into her world where the attitudes towards booze and prurient pleasures are as loose as the women. In comes Brian (Michael York) an uptight British writer who is working towards his doctorate in Germany. He pays for his schooling and boardinghouse boudoir by teaching eager German heirs and heiresses English. The two meet as Brian is moving in and start a friendship that might just become a little something more.Cabaret is the granddaddy of modern movie musicals for very good reason. In addition to being topical and intricate, it's also does decadence with originality and spontaneity. How odd then that the film isn't strictly speaking a musical. The music is diegetic furthering the story largely through Joel Grey's character. The songs inject the film's themes with a macabre sense of humor yet no character sings who isn't already doing it for a living. What results is a world very much its own entity yet functioning within an increasingly hostile reality.There is also a subplot about two of Brian's pupils falling in love and marrying in an unabashed Jewish ceremony yet the principle story revolves around Sally and Brian's unconventional romance. Themes like poverty, the rise of Nazism, homosexuality, poly-amorous love and freedom of artistic expression all run amok creating a sense of frenzied fatalism. Yet that fatalism is choreographed with panache and seduction that is impossible to resist.If there are any noted faults in Cabaret they stem from director Bob Fosse. He may have won the Academy Award for Best Direction, beating out Francis Ford Coppola and The Godfather (1972) but I couldn't help but feeling slighted by his hawkeyed style. Fosse he makes the mistake of keeping the camera at mid-range one too many times. It parades by the sidelines of the Kit Kat Club stage but never meanders on stage for too long. Fosse should have taken some cues from famed director and choreographer Busby Berkeley, making the camera a participant in the choreography. You compare the famed "Life is a Cabaret" to "By a Waterfall" from Footlight Parade (1933) and you'll see what I mean.Still you got to give Cabaret credit for ushering in a new generation of American musicals; a generation more jaded and cynical yet still looking for a good time. Without Cabaret there would have been no Sweeney Todd (2007), Hairspray (2007) or Chicago (2002), which incidentally Fosse directed for the stage. Provocative, sensual and surprisingly relevant, Cabaret deserves it's stature as a gold standard for musicals.http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grotesque Morale or Delightful Decadence?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in the day, Bob Fosse's second feature was drown with praises and awards -- eight Oscars and three Golden Globes. It was a big hit and is still today considered as one of the finest musicals ever made. It has succeed to record images to our consciousness regarding what life was like in the Weimar Republic, right before the rise of NSDAP. Even though I am not a big fan of American musicals, Cabaret must be acknowledged among the finest, alongside with The Sound of Music (1965), of its era. Cabaret is a film with its flaws but, what is most interesting in it, is its historical period picture.The film begins with a mirror view of a cabaret; and the viewer is instantly invited to the world of joy and oblivion -- "Leave your troubles outside, life is disappointing, forget it!" In fact, Cabaret is a mirror reflection; a reflection of a world at transition; Europe on the eve of the rise of Nazism. Soon the story is introduced to us: an American club dancer (Liza Minelli) entertains crowds in Berlin at the beginning of the 30's and starts a love affair with two men. The story is rather thin and intelligently simplistic but, to my mind, the most intriguing thing is how this story line reflects the gloomy morale of the Nazis.First of all, the central milieu is a cabaret and the songs sung there are perfectly tied to the film: "money makes the world go around," "life is a cabaret," "two ladies and one man," "if you could only see her with my eyes." The latter, which portrays a man and a monkey in love, is, in all its tackiness, funny and naively simplistic. In fact, here lies the biggest flaw of the movie. In its structure and how, at times, it is extremely self-evident, even banal in its metaphorical nature, if I may say so.However, the grotesqueness of the film is both delightful and horrible (the montage of a show and a violent act performed by the Nazis, for instance). In the light of this, we see how Cabaret deals with friendship and love, happiness and freedom but also, paradoxically; portrays a decadent world where all of these have turned upside down: into malignancy and violence, oppression and anxiety, which have taken over.An essential observation is that the grotesque eroticism of the cabaret, in fact, equals the decadent morale of the Nazis. Due to this, I am mainly fascinated by the film's historical context and how it is also a picture of the 70's; how it has drawn the relation between the past and the presence: the burlesque -- the disco, gay culture, civil rights and the feminist liberalization.In the end, we return to the beginning; to the reality -- "Didn't you forget all about your troubles? -- and we see the mirror view once again, through a tracking shot. The camera stops by an elusive reflection, an illusion from which we cannot distinguish anything but the faceless Nazi officers. This awakes a strong thought of Cabaret as a "metamusical" for it truly achieves to describe how transient happiness is, in the middle of chaos, suffering and destruction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will Make You Dance and Sing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Cabaret" sets the tone as one of the best musicals ever adapted to the screen back in the 1970's and is still one of the most exciting heart-pulsing films of all time. To put it blunt, it has everything to please those who are fans of musicals. It provides plenty of wit and charm which is what most would expect in a musical of this calibre. The music is very exciting and enthralling much like the reboot of "Chicago". The acting is pitch perfect and also quite phenomenal (Liza Minnelli just totally makes Sally Bowles a character her own). But what makes "Cabaret" so extraordinary is that in spite of the light-hearted music and the scintillating singing and dance numbers is that the story itself sparks a lot of deep, dark and at times disturbing undertones to it as well. Such brooding topics lay in the facets of racism, alienation, abortion and other assorted taboos. But the dark tones are brilliantly concealed through the delicate dancing and wonderful singing you wouldn't think that this was a dark story.The musical is adapted from "The Berlin Stories" by Christopher Isherwood and centres around a young British tutor named Brian Roberts (Michael York) who has made residence in Berlin in 1930. He lives across the hall from the perky, but eccentric lounge singer and fellow Englander Sally Bowles (Minnelli). She's a singer at the Kit Kat Klub a local Cabaret centre. Once Brian falls in love with her, Sally becomes aggressive and desiring. But their relationship is constantly put to the test as a Baron steps into the fray who also has his eyes on both Sally and even may have lust for Brian as well. As the Nazi party starts to come into full effect, trouble obviously comes with the package not only to the two lovebirds, but for those who are close to them as well.The free-spirited attitude lingers throughout the course of the film and is wisely used as a decoy to symbolize the feelings the film is trying to get across. The humour of the movie stems from making fun Nazism as they demonstrate the modus operandi of what the Nazi party truly represented, whether is was through domination, greed and the bizarre love triangle Sally and Brian are up against.Progressively, the events outside the Klub materialize splendidly equal to the events within the vicinity.What can be said about the acting except that it was absolutely beautiful. Liza Minnelli was an absolute delight. She played her rather complex characters with absolute perfection. Joel Grey was equally electrifying as the Emcee. The exchange in words were spot-on and it also looks and feels very natural to the point that they didn't sound like they were acting. The audience must've felt silent when they were singing songs together like "Money" as they played off their every move and even apart they were sublime. In stage number like "Two Ladies", Grey uses lots of comedic energy that pays homage to the silent film era performers like Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin. Minnelli is just special and musically enhanced when she rips out the final song you just wish the song never had an ending. Michael York pulls off a great performance as Brian Roberts, but he sadly very upstaged by the domineering performance of Minnelli, she's just has that integrity that she carries with her.Overall, it is safe to say that "Cabaret" is an delightful movie that comes across being the musical of all musicals.. Bob Fosse created a brilliant masterpiece, but it was released in bad timing because when it came out, another heavy came into full effect, "The Godfather." If you never seen it yet, you don'y know what you're missing. For those who love high energy films like "Moulin Rouge" or "Chicago", then this type of movie might be your cup of tea. It will surely leave you awestruck for a very long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Divine decadence"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The late 60s and early 70s were a turning point for the screen musical. Long established as an innocent, chaste genre, it suddenly acquired a raunchy, burlesque quality that brought it back to its "pre-code" roots in the early 30s. And this is itself the very era that Cabaret transports us back too ? a bygone age of glamour and sexual liberty that became as much a key for the new generation of musicals as the 1900s had been for those of the previous generation.Like many of the greatest musicals, at the centre of Cabaret is one mesmerising, momentous performance. Liza Minnelli is playful, passionate and ultimately deeply emotive in a turn that would be impressive enough were it purely a dramatic role. But what is more she puts every inch the Sally Bowles character into the way she sings and dances. Constantly beguiling, she seems to build up some mysterious rapport with the audience, beckoning us to come join her in this cabaret of a life. Emerging gradually from the chorus line in the first number, she quickly becomes absolutely riveting.And then we have some top class direction from Bob Fosse. Fosse was originally a choreographer, and more than any other director of musicals he treats cinematic technique as a form of choreography, with whip-pans, focus-shifts and angle-changes all a part of the dance. He was a little heavy-handed in his first feature, Sweet Charity, but here it is all done with such poise and precision that we barely realise how much the image is being manipulated. Fosse also shows himself to be a master of making us see exactly what he wants, for example making sure during one of the numbers that it is only when he reveals himself that we realise one of the dancing girls is actually a dragged-up Joel Grey.But really it is very hard to talk about the individual talents that have gone into Cabaret because this seems so very much a movie in which everyone is working together for the same stylistic aims. I can explain this with the example of just one of the musical numbers ? "Maybe This Time". It is, first off, a wonderful Kander and Ebb tune (this is really the only great score they produced). The song of course occurs outside the main line of narrative, but it is nevertheless supposed to be a commentary on the relationship between Liza and Michael York, and Ms Minnelli uses these feelings from the screen romance to inform her performance. The marvellous cinematography of Geoffrey Unsworth shows her at first as a face amid the darkness, eventually throwing a light on her from behind that sends arcs out from her arms and legs as the song swells to a climax. Fosse has his camera slowly wheel about her, giving the impression that she might be singing alone. And when he eventually does show the rest of the club, it's a series of inserts that show this is a rather low-key point in the night, the audience no more than a handful of bored-looking patrons, and suddenly the whole thing has an extra layer of sadness.But there is another strand that winds its way through the movie ? the rising shadow of Nazism. At first it's little more than a bit of historical background detail, seen but not directly commented upon, but eventually Hitler's thugs creep into the story and the songs, taking them over absolutely. One cannot help but speculate, since we know what subsequently happened in Germany, on the eventual fate of Fritz and Natalia, or the various possibly gay characters at the Kit Kat Club. Cabaret finally becomes a dreadfully sinister reminder that this vibrant and liberated society could become horrifically barbaric. At times it is as delightful and joyous as the finest Rodgers and Hammerstein shows, few musicals are quite so effectively chilling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have a habit of beginning my reviews of musicals with the caveat that I don't generally go out of my way to watch them, but once I do I generally find them entertaining. This one however had some disturbing elements that I wasn't expecting, even though the film has a forty year history and a host of Oscars to it's credit. I'm referring to the juxtaposition of the rise of Naziism that parallels events at the Kit Kat Club against the private lives of Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli) and Brian Roberts (Michael York). The film sets us up for the eventual downfall of all concerned, most in ways that are depressing if one dwells on them for too long. The concept of 'divine decadence' is given ample opportunity to permeate our viewing senses, and gains a gradual progression as director Fosse takes us through the musical numbers hosted by the trans-gendered Master of Ceremonies portrayed by Joel Grey. The fact that he scored an ace at the Oscars against three formidable "Godfather" challengers is a testament to the outlandishly garish performance he gives here, alternately playful and lighthearted, at other times sinister and even racist ('If Only They Could See Her Through My Eyes'), while performing with a Monkey Girl representing the Jewish people. It's all very unsettling against a backdrop of the club owner beaten up by Nazis, and Brian receiving the same treatment when he challenges their 'crap' on a street corner. However the most unsettling sequence, given historical twenty-twenty hindsight, is the overtly patriotic appeal to the Fatherland led by the Hitler Youth singer ('Tomorrow Belongs to Me'). Elder Germans, undeniably uncomfortable but powerless to express dissatisfaction, are helpless but to accept this inevitably rising threat to their homeland.So much for thinking that "Cabaret" was simply an all out musical. Liza Minnelli's performance here was absolutely breakout, given her prior career essentially appearing on variety TV shows in the decade leading up to this film. Her contenders for the Best Actress in 1973 were certainly formidable enough, and I'll have to reserve judgment until I see some of those other pictures. But overall, this one's a unique viewing experience and an eye opener if you like your musicals straight up. This one is anything but.P.S. Listen attentively to Minnelli's character when she counsels Natalia (Marisa Berenson) on her relationship with Fritz. When she says "I'm no good at all if anybody cries", her voice rises a notch and at that moment sounds exactly like her mother Judy Garland. Think Dorothy in "The Wizard of Oz".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Liza' s Oscar Winning Performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once upon a time there was a marvelous small studio Allied Artists which has a tiny lot in Hollywood so small the studio itself could not be used for wide angle photography. AA produced Friendly Persuasuion, Love In the Afternoon, El Cid, 55 Days at Peking, and somehow managed to stay in business though it had no lot to garner rentals, no TV unit to offset the film division. Its movies such as Soldier in the Rain were shot at nearby Paramount. AA did have creative people like Billy Wilder, Gary Cooper, William Wyler, Audrey Hepburn, John Huston, David Niven, Sophia Loren, Steve McQueen, Ava Gardner and even Elvis Presley in its movies. Somehow it was able to stay afloat and entered into one of the first co production deals this one with ABC (before it was acquired by Disney). Cabaret is a brilliant film with kudos to all involved especially Director Bob Fosse and star Liza Minnelli who hit a grand slam home run and won the Oscar in the role of Sally. Liza's performance is almost like a 3D movie, it jumps from the screen! Brilliant!Cabaret was up against The Godfather which won all the major awards save for Liza had it not been, Cabaret would have surely won Best Picture. As for AA, it went on to produce Papillion a major hit with Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman and The Man Who Would Be King, (Co produced with Columbia) with Sean Connery directed by John Huston. One of its final films was Billy Wilder's little seen masterpiece Fedora with William Holden, Henry Fonda. But that time the studio was failing and it could not distribute Fedora as it should have.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't generally give extreme notes to films since there's no "perfect" film. Yet I gave a 10 to two of Fosse's films.Cabaret is at once a drama, a comedy, some kind of echo from the sidelines of history, where, knowing what you do, you watch the terror bloom, and of course a beautiful musical (only through the acts of the Cabaret). Bob Fosse actually is a very good filmmaker. I often wonder what would have happened if he had picked that line of work. Here he picked an excellent cast to portray the end of an era, a group which decided to hold on until the end, bent on ignoring the world around them and party on. As we all do in our own way. Of course this will end badly, for life usually does.Back when I was stuck in officer's school, this was one of the only watchable films shown in the city where I was stationed. For some reason it played for 5 or 6 months and I must have seen it about 10 times in the same theatre. Thanks Bob !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have one symbolic comment about this excellent film.It fools people!Unless more careful information corrects them , many people are under the impression that a trip backwards in time would lead them to hearing the Hitler Youth singing something called "Tomorrow belongs to me" There is even a book with that title, as if the boys in brown sang in the language of their enemies-but it's as interestingly convincing as that.War films are very hard to pull off...a musical about the Third Reich now has the added crazy spin of Mel Brooks and his Producers.Cabaret in my opinion falls into none of the holes...with all the noble intentions in the world, the troops of "Schindler's List" walk sometimes from the pages of Commando magazine ...you can't just multiply briefcases, huge cars, steel rimmed spectacles and fountain pens to the nth degree around the correctly clad sadists.Cabaret was about the embryonic stages of the Holocaust, but Himmel!did it work.It worked possibly as living tableau of the time like an accomplished detailed sketch,but it stays within the prerequisites of the musical which is very very difficult given the period and other treatments.Sound of Music ? Well let me say the old one about if they'd followed what the nun said , they'd never have made it out from the nasty men in the big cars...There used to be a pile of right wing students in England who began saluting in secret police raincoats and hats, when the Germans appeared...I bet the same lot ran Cabaret till their projectors exploded !The day must come when perhaps some other aspect of the Second World War will hit a German angle as effectively as Cabaret in the cinema-I would personally like to have seen Jodie Foster play Leni Riefenstahl,but I don't believe it will happen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is the total opposite of "Singin In The Rain" yet is just as brilliant. The look and atmosphere (based on a true story) fills you with Berlin prior to the second world war.A musical with singing Nazis has been done before but this is not the sugar coated version we usually see its hard and menacing.In a wonderful piece of bravuro editing the german folk dancing inside the kit kat club is sliced between a non nazi supporter being beaten up outside. References to famous paintings of the period are plenty without being elitest. The film is pared down to the storyline of Sally and Cliff unlike the Stage version which is a totally different experience.The star of this film really has to be Bob Fosse. Dont get me wrong Liza is great, Joel creepily wonderful but without Fosse sticking his neck on the line and going for broke with the atmosphere and style of this piece they would not be in one of the best musical films ever, yes I know Seven Brides has great routines, South Pacific decent songs etc etc but put them side by side with this one and your looking at a winner on all levels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best musicals there´s ever been, and certainly one of the best pictures ever.Let´s analize the movie on it´s whole. Everything is wonderful, there´s nothing bad you can find...The Music. Very good. Not as brilliant as "The Sound of Music"´s, but comes pretty close. The lyrics are very imaginative and funny, and sad when they have to be. One magnificent thing about some songs is that you can feel different about them (sad, happy...) each time you see the movie. That IS something.The acting couldn´t be better. Of course, Judy´s daughter steals the show with the breathtaking performance of the funny, crazy and childish Sally Bowes. She was born to play Sally, but she didn´t perform, she BECAME Sally. Joel Grey was also amazing. The rest of the cast is not as brilliant, but it´s quite good, specially Faye Dunaway.The script. Well, it´s probably the best thing of the picture. It takes you through the life of an ordinary girl living an ordinary life singing at the Kit Kat Club, a Cabaret in the Berlin of 1931. Sally´s character is so familiar and simple that you could expect to find her walking in the street tomorrow. It´s just great. The movie is about everything that might seem love without getting to be love. Sexual affairs (heterosexual and homosexual), sensuality, etc... That´s great about the movie.Well, what else? The cinematography is very good, it´s dark, and siniester for such a creepy and dangerous world Sally lives in without realizing. GREAT. GREAT.Directing. Bob Fosse does a great job, even though it was only the second film he directed. Nothing was wrong, there were no mistakes. A masterpiece.After saying this, the movie would deserve a rate of 9/10. Supposing that this glorious film has touched your heart as it has touched mine, the movie would deserve a 10/10.RATE: 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a masterpiece! This is one of the all-time greatest film musicals ever made. The film, on its own, is simply brilliant. Fosse's direction is better than ever and Liza Minelli - WOW. What a performance. However, I do prefer the stage version of "Cabaret," due to the many subplots (i.e. the Fraulein Schneider/Herr Schultz relationship) that do not appear in the film. People who are unfamiliar with the musical or the story should see the film first, and then the play (I've seen the current revival 16 times to date); the experience is much more harrowing when you are actually there witnessing everything. But like I said before, the movie is brilliant, and even more brilliant when not compared to the stage version. I know I already mentioned Liza, but you cannot say enough about her here. She is magnificent, as are Joel Gray (as the Master of Ceremonies) and Michael York (as Brian). The choreography is another stand-out. "Mein Herr," is Fosse at his best. Everything in the film is so real, it almost feels like a documentary. My only complaint is that the film can feel heavy at times. This heaviness is nowhere to be found in the stage version (which was directed by "American Beauty" genius Sam Mendes). Fans of the movie should definitely see the play - Broadway's Susan Egan singing the title song is the most intense theatrical experience I've ever witnessed, not to take anything away from Liza. Just see both. It's the story that's the most important thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The worldwide effects of Nazism were so devastating that the way Germany was between the end of WWI and the rise of Adolph Hitler in 1932, feels like an insignificant detail.Weimar Republic, hyperinflation, these abstract words have no weight when you compare them to the Night of the Long Knives, the Nuremberg Laws, they're nothing in the great scale of History ? yet during this 10-year parenthesis, Berlin happened to be the hippest of all European capitals, and maybe Paris' most important rival in Arts and entertainment: Otto Dix, Berthold Brecht, Fritz Lang, Von Sternberg, the expressionist revolution, to name a few. Berlin was an artistic melting-pot with such an international radiance that no one could see the Nazis coming. Bob Fosse's "Cabaret" is a tribute to this forgotten era, this sensational picture embodies in tone, flash, music and plots the exuberance, flamboyance and 'divine decadence' of the early 30's, while we're all, as viewers, one step ahead of the protagonists. We know that the worst is still to come, and it's impossible not to feel the inner tragedy of the story. With all its 'hotness', "Cabaret" is like the heat wave preceding the storm. The whole irony of the film is that we only have glimpses of the Nazism, yet the film says much more about their rising than Luchino Visconti's "The Damned" in two and half hours of an indigestible plot. This is a credit to Bob Fosse's talent as a storyteller, and performer, the exhilarating editing provides a nice parallel between the stage: the cabaret and the real-life events, and the result creates a powerful contrast between two sides of German society so in contradiction that only one can triumph, and the course of events doesn't leave much for optimism. But life is so short that even at the dawn of a nightmarish time, anyone is allowed to dream, to have fun.And Liza Minelli's performance is essential to the film, with her genuinely childish smile and sparkle that constantly illuminates her eyes, she's the embodiment of all the positivity that the 'Cabaret' inculcates to the audience. She's not a cabaret artist, she is the cabaret, which is not surprising if you take the cabaret much more than an entertainment but as a state of mind: an eternal desire of escapism, of having fun, of partying and eliminating all the boundaries. Bisexuality, homosexuality, transvestitism, the cabaret trivializes the deviations in the name of freedom and liberty, joy and insouciance ? and these values are incarnated by the second significant performance: Joel Grey as the Master of Ceremonies.If I have no objections against Liza Minelli winning the Oscar for her unforgettable portrayal of Sally Bowles, well, I can't review "Cabaret" without mentioning Joel Grey. As an eternal "Godfather" fan, I couldn't believe that none of James Caan, Robert Duvall or Al Pacino won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. I guess if Pacino had been rightfully nominated as a Lead, things would have turned different, but well, if any performance could beat the legendary film, I'm glad it's this one. I hold no grudges against Grey; he was terrific in a performance that went beyond the musical and linguistic abilities it required. Grey was funny, over-the-top, irritating, feminine, masculine, weird, international, he was the stagy incarnation of the Cabaret while Sally Bowles completed the picture in real-life. But the Cabaret's state of mind is all the more relevant when seen through the eyes of outsiders. The film opens with the arrival of Brian, an English writer (Michael York) to Sally's pension, he's here to teach some English and meanwhile discovers the Cabaret's sideshow and tries to embrace its 'dolce vita', influenced by Bowles' gutsy approach to life. Two of his students are Jewish, Natalia is a rich aristocratic daughter (Marisa Berensom) and Fritz (Fritz Wepper) is an unscrupulous go-getter, who could get jobs because he lied on his religion. While Sally seems rather careless about Nazism, blinded by her Hollywood dreams, the other protagonists are our link to the reality. When Brian violently hits a Nazi flag, the next shot is explicit about the response he received and when Fritz comes to Natalia's house, the first thing he says is that he's a Jew. Next shot, they're getting married, indeed, only a true love could inspire someone to jeopardize his life, but it's also the first awareness that Nazism is not just a 'bit of adversity' but something that shall be fought.That's "Cabaret", a battle of spirits, of ideals that affected Berlin, then Germany, then the whole world. "Cabaret" is like the desperate cry of a period before it would finally let the winner precipitate the world into War. And all we can do is enjoying the frenzy, the happiness before it's too late. "Life is a cabaret, old chum" shouts Liza Minelli at the end, Indeed, all the previous acts showed a parallel between the story and the songs, whether they're about love, money, marriage, sexual plurality ? the trademark will be used by Bob Fosse in his next successful film "Lenny", when Lenny's sketches are illustrated by his own experiences. Bob Fosse, an eternal performer, incarnated the truth that art only transcends life experience to universal levels. And what better alibi that the Nazis even fought Art and used them to display their own values which, needless to say, were in total oppositions with what the Cabaret stood for."Cabaret" won 8 Oscars, yet lost the Best Picture against "The Godfather", but it is to musicals what "The Godfather" is to gangster films, the exaltation of values rather than style, something that speak to the heart before striking the eyes. And the film closes with one of the most haunting shots of cinema's history, with the mirror ball feeling like a Damocles sword pending above the audience. And we know that maybe for once, the show will not go on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen a staged version about two/three years ago here in San Francisco. It was a small stage with an audience maybe of about 100. That closeness created an intimacy with Nazi Germany that I did not welcome. A huge Nazi flag unfolds. The characters sing that song on stage: "Tomorrow Belongs to me." The separation between performance and audience is lost in that small venue. And that may be the most important part of the play. What side would the audience member be on? Perhaps, more than likely, the wrong side--we would be on the side of the Nazis.In the stage performance, Sally sings "Cabaret" in a minor mode--that is to say a mode of mourning. Liza Minelli belts out the tune in defiance of the moral position she finds herself in, or--more likely--oblivious to the moral position she finds herself in.What happens in the Kit Kat club is a reflection of Germany's fall into moral nihilism. The characters in the performance will descend--if they had not already descended--into moral decay. The ultimate moral decay is the abortion Sally Bowles will undergo, an abortion of a child who might be Brian's, Max's, or the emcee's--or anyone else's. But one could easily assert without too much of a stress that that abortion is no different than what the Nazi's did to the Jews. To me--as a person raised in Catholic orphanages--that has always been a powerful message to the film."Tomorrow belongs to me" must be one of the most moving, sumptuously beautiful songs in the entire Broadway musical repertoire. If we re-read Goethe's FAUST, one of the points of that play is the attractiveness of evil--attractive in that evil attracts. Perhaps like a spider web attracts a fly or a moth and the insect cannot extract itself from the web. Attractive in the sense that one just might enjoy such evil--as in the ease of orgasm with homosexuality. Or the ease of self-flagellation with the moral conundrum--thou shalt not...--of abortion.The emcee--and here Joel Grey will forever be enshrined--provides an important anchor to the film's moral tone. "She doesn't look Jewish at all" might be funny in Weimar Berlin, 1933; after 1945 such anti-Semitic remarks are offensive; the song is intended to be offensive. The morally ambiguous relationship between Sally and the emcee reflect that ambiguous moral relationship of Weimar Germany. Hitler did not have to come to power; every one knew what National Socialism meant. He was appointed chancellor because--well, in my view, a senile von Hindenburg was morally weak. But like a train wreck, there was most likely no real alternative to Hitler and to what was going to happen in Nazi Germany.At the end of the movie, there is an executioner's drum roll--the kind of drum roll given when a person is to be executed. The camera pans over the audience of Nazi soldiers--where Nazis were not allowed in the club at the start of the film, they are the audience at the end of the film. The audience knows what happened in Germany after Hitler's rise to power, January 30, 1933. Six million Jews would be killed; that drum roll is for those Jews. And a drum roll for so much more. It's not surprising that a short 15 years later Bishop Robinson would write "The Death of God." And that Kierkergaard--that dark Danish theologian --would enjoy a resurgence. In the Holocaust, did God die? Not an unreal question even if no real answer.The movie / play asks a great deal of the audience. That it manages to convey so much in such a short space of time is a tribute to its principals and to its musical numbers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Less of an adaptation and more of a total reinvention of the successful stage play, the film version of Cabaret is one of the few movie musicals that is almost universally considered to be superior to the Broadway play that inspired it. Most unusual for the time, director/choreographer Bob Fosse made the ingenious decision to isolate the songs from the dramatic scenes, and keep all of the musical numbers on the stage where they belong. This proves to be a dynamic film-making device, as the terrific songs by John Kander and Fred Ebb create a harrowing juxtaposition to the haunting backdrop of the Nazi party's brutal rise to power in 1930's Berlin. From anti-Semitism and fascism to bisexuality and open promiscuity, there is no subject considered "off-limits" in this taboo-bucking motion picture.In an Oscar-winning performance, Liza Minnelli literally radiates with an exuberance that she was never able to recapture elsewhere, and also takes time to belt out bravura renditions of exceptional numbers like "Mein Herr," "Maybe This Time," and, of course, the sublime title song. Englishman Michael York is slender and sexy as Minnelli's occasional love interest, and Joey Grey picked up an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his amusing and creepy performance as the Kit-Kat club's grand emcee. The German-bred actors Helmut Griem and Fritz Wepper both turn in seductive performances, and Jewish socialite Marisa Berenson is quite affecting as the film's sole ingénue. Berenson's Berlin accent is so convincing that I mistakenly assumed the New York-born actress was really German for years.Winner of eight Academy Awards in all, including Best Director (the film lost the Best Picture Oscar to THE GODFATHER), CABARET is a remarkable film that successfully combines sexual titillation and wicked humor with grim social commentary and nightmarish realism (sometimes simultaneously and with music). The film is entertaining and enjoyable, but also contains a haunting aura that lingers long after the picture has ended. I have seen this film more than 30 times over the past 25, and I get chills during the "Tomorrow Belongs to Me" sequence every single time. That type of lasting effect is not common in art work of any medium.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When celebrating the cycle-of-life "Cabaret" sits on the spice shelf.A town which is occupied by a sausage-factory which comes to life when the meat-plant workers come in for rest and relaxation and perform the lessons and morality-tales which are learned from safe and unsafe handling of food and objects around different life-forms.That sex, love, and family must sometimes be sacrificed to perform and follow the foot-lights of the stage.War is sometimes a bi-product of military-personal racing to their favourite performance venue(s) where "other" children and wives lived and worked in Europe and especially in Germany.The cycle-of-life is the call for many to chase the memory and contact with those people and places which made them excel at something, namely war.That in the end the only way to keep some of the universe's life-forms from racing to a celebration of war as depicted in other films such as "Wood Stock" and "Schindler's List" was to electronically engage and control the minds and movements of those who chase a special moment based on the destruction of others.The difference in the end was the sausage and the workers.Which are you?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most critics slam this film. I saw it again in the past week for about the 3rd or fourth time and still marvel at its complexity. What I took from Liza's performance is her vulnerability and the air of bravado she exudes to hide it. A really great performance by her. The story's transfer to the screen cannot have been easy but Fosse succeeds. He intercuts scenes of Nazi brutality with the stage shows and the decadence of the Kit Kat club is captured. One of the most chilling scenes still mesmerizes me. A fresh young healthy teenage boy sings the first verse of a German folk song so sweetly, then gradually the song takes on a menace and by the end of the number the audience (including some young girls)are all standing and singing in unison and victory and the boy is revealed for what he has become - a Hitler fanatic. One of those moments on film that cannot be forgotten. Michael York is sweet as the uncertain homosexual. Joel Grey is unforgettable as the MC of the club, manic and all knowing. But it is Liza's movie, eyelashes and all. Her brief shining starlit moment in the sun. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

Not one camera movement/picture is in vain, and that's rare. The music is perfect, the acting brilliant and the whole story cuts, it's so sharp.

		<shortDescription>a triumph of musical direction - reality, as far as melodrama can go, isn't meddled with</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bob Fosse displays flair as a director, but he also is a very intelligent storyteller as far as controlling how to pull plot and musical sequences together. It's maybe easy in the case of Cabaret, easier than say All That Jazz. But then again, Cabaret was already written and a big hit on Broadway, and Fosse's task was to make it feel real and vibrant in a cinematic setting (unlike All That Jazz, which had the super-ambition of being an original 8 1/2 type of project). After finally seeing the film, it's perhaps not surprising that he won the Oscar that year; this is the kind of craftsmanship that Hollywood was used to, even if it wasn't quite as iconic as the Godfather, which ultimately got picture anyway. It's a musical that *moves* incredibly when it needs to, but also stays close to the chest(s) of its characters, their little dramas played out against the slowly building scale of the Third Reich.It's a story we all know, sort of: American girl finds British boy in late 30s Germany, boy grows attached to girl over some friendly time, boy and girl grow friendly also with German boy hiding fact he's Jewish even from his beloved Jewish girl, American girl may be pregnant with a child that she doesn't know, so on and so forth. Actually, a lot of this is just the stuff of apple-ripe melodrama, full of the little twists and motivations and outbursts and, thankfully in this case, subtleties that make it all so palpable and fresh for audiences. The dialog is also perfectly witty for a movie musical (not quite Singin' in the Rain, but close enough), and ingrained in the setting of a cabaret there's some raunch to be had... within the realm of PG for 1972 of course.But back to the direction for a moment, since there's enough that's already been written about how wonderful Liza Minelli is and how awesomely flamboyant Joel Grey is or how restrained Michael York can be- all terrific in their juicy parts. Two scenes and a shot should be looked at for interest points: when Minelli's Sally and York are under the train tracks, we see Sally scream out, and begs York to scream out too in sync with the train going by above. Just as he's about to scream, which would be the typical thing to see (i.e. Garden State), Fosse suddenly cuts to a man being beaten, this inter-cut with a warped musical number with Master of Ceremonies and his gaggle of girls. It's a sharp cut but it's smart and concise and one is not only not confused but it's refreshing. Another scene is when Minelli is in the woods relaxing with York, him miles away in thought and she trying to sound optimistic as an expecting mother - she then flashes to some moments, visions of the future, of coming home to a kid on the stairs, still with her fur coat, still performing from the past, so on. Then it cuts to her without the coat. This, too, is jarring, but the narrative freedom that Fosse takes advantage of is uncommon in musicals, not just from the period.And one last shot to mention: the final one, as Grey finishes with his "Goodbye" bit, and the camera goes by in a slow, deliberate pan actors a scrambled mirror, looking out at the placid faces of the Nazis in the audience. This is, simply, just good artistry of a variety that in other hands might lead to pretension, but for Fosse is meant for any audience member to conceive of and understand. Overall Cabaret works for those expecting the pleasures of a movie musical and film buffs looking for something more: turbulent love and relationships done to some imaginative direction that keeps things surprisingly grounded in reality. If not true reality, then a hyper-reality that doesn't seem too far off - it was in fact the 30s of Germany, depression leading to the rise of Hitler and the "gang of thugs". Cabaret!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Timeless masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was made in the early 70s and I've probably viewed it almost ten times, but it still feels fresh and sharp in it's analysis of different people in a highly frustrated and controversial society.The viewer is taken to the eventful atmosphere of Berlin in 1931. The focus of the film is on an interesting relationship between two opposites. Brian is a young newly arrived English teacher and Sally a cabaret performance artist. Brian seems touchingly innocent and uncorrupted, while Sally is the lively opportunist, who's not unwilling to sleep with producers in hope of a film career. Sally is a bit naive in a very lovable way.We also get to follow the story of Fritz and Natalia, the gold-digger looking for a rich marriage and the daughter of a rich Jewish merchantman, and their difficult relationship. The Master of Ceremonies and Maximilian, a wealthy aristocrat, both illustrate a nonchalant and immoral life-style. I can't help to be charmed by the elegant self-confidence and "divine decadence" of these two characters. I guess decadence is seen as a stylish virtue in Western jet-set culture. Any film with such ingredients and cast could be great, but Cabaret is however also a musical. The songs and performances support the storyline perfectly. Unlike in other musicals the songs seem like a very natural part of the story. The most memorable scene is when a youngster stands up and sings a patriotic song. Soon the viewer gets to see the swastika on his left arm and the audience stands up one after one and sings with him. The scene gives you cold shivers, because the emotional impact is quite scary. The scene makes you wonder what your own reaction would have been and helps to understand how vulnerable people are. Most other songs are great too. "If you could see her" (through my eyes) is both heartbreaking and hilarious. Is it a crime to fall in love? Few films I've seen involve as much depth and many different levels as Cabaret. The film is very entertaining, but also realistic, analytical and critical. My all-time favorite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When Life Intrudes on Cinema and Produces Great Art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cabaret is not just a great film, but great Art. Immediately upon its release in 1972 it transcended the already lofty position that film held in the public realm, and ascended to the heights of "International Phenomenon." It swept the world pop culture before anyone had yet heard the term "Blockbuster," fully deserving of every iota of praise and admiration that was lavished upon it. Never aware of it as a contrived, artificial Hollywood product, I was completely absorbed, totally immersed in a remarkably profound experience. I'm no fan of Pollyanna musicals or Broadway schmaltz, and thankfully, neither is Bob Fosse. The intensely heady atmosphere of the Kit Kat Club is palpable, as is the increasingly ominous threat of the rising Nazi party. All the elements - music, lyrics, dialog, character, costume, decor, setting, pace - are entirely supportive of its somber theme. Inside the club, Life is beautiful, and the music, singing and dancing are brash, bawdy and brilliant. The contrast of life inside and outside the club is not just an effective device to make logical and believable the normally quaint and awkward Musical Movie form, but is also a powerful metaphor for our ability and willingness to distract and delude ourselves. So much of the world, at the time the story takes place, refused to see just exactly how black was the storm gathering on the horizon, and Fosse is keen to comment on this tragic aspect of human nature. As outrageous and raucous and delightful as Cabaret works to be, it's always grounded in stark, stern reality. This exceptional balancing of such paradoxical, contradictory impulses is such a rare quality in popular films, and is almost as scarce in the population that consumes them. This film was unusual, too, in its unfashionably frank depiction of "alternative" lifestyles. In 1972 many were deeply shocked, but so many more were thoroughly charmed; the irresistible allure of it's character's genuine wide-eyed wonder and optimism amidst such gritty truth is so powerfully persuasive.Liza Minnelli brings so much natural spunk and pathos to her captivating portrayal of the the desperately naive Sally Bowles. Her innate ability at maneuvering Sally's roller coaster emotional path demands our attention. Most every other character is superbly rendered as a near comical silhouette, and Bob masterfully provides key moments for them to magically blossom into fully three dimensional personalities; the wonderful effect wholly dependent on superior acting talent. Some people who are aficionados of the original Broadway production may balk at the curtailed musical score, or some of the artistic liberties that Bob took with Christopher Isherwood's 'Berlin Stories,' but these edits are all in the service of a sublimely powerful cinematic experience. If you need to see the Broadway version, go find the Broadway version. And, if you can turn this one off before the end credits then you urgently need a checkup from the neck up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Divine decadence, darling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Divine decadence, darling," is what is served up abundantly in *Cabaret*. I was in junior high school when Liza won Best Actress for her tour de force as Sally Bowles ? I was furious because I felt that Diana Ross got robbed. I knew, with my consummate adolescent insight, that Liza was merely playing herself in *Cabaret*, but that Diana was acting her little heart out in *Lady Sings The Blues*. Time has told a different tale, however, with *Lady Sings The Blues* being resigned to ignominy and *Cabaret* remaining as a sparkling achievement in movie-making. Winning 8 Academy Awards in a very tight race against such blockbusters as *The Godfather*, *Deliverance*, and *Sounder*, it is Liza Minelli's tour de force, a role of a lifetime. Even her mother, Judy Garland, never had a role like this, so exquisitely tailored to her talents, that even Liza herself had a tough time topping this performance. In fact, she never did, starring in some truly dismal choices such as *Lucky Lady* and *New York, New York*. In *Cabaret*, Minelli plays Sally Bowles, a plucky little trollop who sings at the Kit Kat club in Berlin, during the time of the Weimar Republic. Sally tries very hard to be "an international woman of mystery," but lives in a dream world in which her non-existent worldly and dashing father will soon swoop down and rescue her. She falls in love with Brian (York), a charming and bi-sexual scholar earning his living as a translator. They are both romanced by a wealthy and handsome suitor (Griem), who after stirring their dreams and passions, leaves them flat. The subplots of Brian's students, their fellow boarders at the rooming house, and Sally's various schemes provide an opportunity for wonderful music and staging. Most of the numbers happen onstage at the Kit Kat club. We have addressed the issue of performances within performances before ? and the usual question is "Who would pay money to see this?" But in *Cabaret*, the staged musical numbers are spectacular and you would definitely pay good money to see a nightclub performances like those. "Money" and "Mien Herr" are incredible, and Bob Fosse's outre choreography is stunning. The costuming and makeup add to the heightened surrealism, and the Nazi threat adds an element of danger and desperation to a movie that would be hard to classify as a musical, drama, comedy, satire or war movie. The Nazi violence, with a few exceptions, is shown by implication and suggestion. The "Tomorrow Belongs To Me" number is roundly described as stunning and chilling, and after almost 30 years, remains so. The concept of the story itself is enduring, engendering 90s Broadway revival directed by *American Beauty*'s Sam Mendez</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is haunting, like the sound of the S-bahn that Sally tries to outscream. The non-singers all fit their roles perfectly: Michael York has just that innocence his character needs and Marisa Berenson has the fragility of the china doll she plays. Was there ever a madder tea party than the one with Fritz, Brian, Sally and Berenson's princess, with the uproarious conclusion when Sally blurts out the only German word she knows,the one for fornication?Grey is a tornado. Your eyes follow him just to make sure he is not coming your way. The leer he gives Sally, followed by his sticking out his tongue, is chilling.As I recall, the original Broadway show of the 60s had "Tomorrow" take place in the club, or restaurant. Opening up to ordinary Germans brings more of the country into the crime. And, like so many great 70s films, life just goes on [the resolving of the Max-Sally-Brian triangle is very similar to that in Sunday, Bloody Sunday]. Brian goes home, Max skips town and Sally's life goes on. Back to the club, but this time refined through a thick lens.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fosse's musical masterpiece of divine decadence.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Certainly legendary choreographer Bob Fosse was the ideal choice to stage the dance scenes in this jazzy 1972 feature film version of "Cabaret", based on the same-titled 1966 Broadway musical smash, based on the John Van Druten novel, "I Am a Camera" (also filmed in 1955), based on a single chapter of Christopher Isherwood's "Berlin Stories" memoirs. The musical practically begs for Fosse's dark, interpretive genius. So it should come as no surprise that he tops even that great feat sitting in the director's chair. Armed with a formidable, intuitive style, a bold script, dazzling camera work technique, and an explicit eye for detail, Fosse brings fascinating life to the seamy ambiance and tainted attitudes of a pre-Nazi Germany. In doing so, Fosse performed a major tune-up, reshaping the Broadway show for film...and improved on it nearly 100%. Every alteration, small or big, every little tweek added infinite power, vitality and nuance to the dark, foreboding atmosphere. It's an intelligent metamorphosis. In bringing Lisa Minnelli aboard, who was born to play this role, certain character adjustments had to be made from the musical which starred Jill Haworth and Bert Convy. Sally Bowles was originally a free-spirited Englander, but here (obviously) she's a capricious American who revels in the pretentious glitz and perversion of early 30s Berlin. The naive American writer/teacher (Brian in the film, Cliff in the Broadway show, Chris in the Van Druten play, and Isherwood in real life) is now a naive Britisher (played by a very appealing, understated Michael York), who is finally "outed" in this presentation, adding dimension and sparking more interest in this flawed spectator (or "camera"). In addition, the musical's secondary pairing of Fraulein Schneider and Herr Schultz is eliminated entirely here - which is fine, because although the elderly pair gave the musical a nostalgic, sympathetic tone, they also bogged down the proceedings. Schneider is only glimpsed here as the German landlady and Schultz as her elderly Jewish paramour is out altogether. Instead, a younger, more red-blooded couple, Natalia and Fritz, are brought in for the same discordant purpose and the luminous Marisa Berenson and Fritz Wepper are wonderful in their discovery of each other, while dapper Helmut Griem as "Max" serves a different purpose in the film. Instead of a Nazi smuggler, he plays a well-to-do playboy, bringing new meaning to the word "idle rich" as a highly versatile love conquest.Some things, however, should never be tampered with. And they aren't. Joel Grey reprises his Broadway creation as the seedy, repulsive, yet transfixing Master of Ceremonies, the embodiment of decadence and defiance whose "shows within a show" brilliantly transcend the script and encompassing drama. John Kander and Fred Ebb tailored new songs ("Maybe This Time", "Mein Herr", "The Money Song") especially for the talents of Minnelli and Grey, both Oscar winners here, and its to the credit of both writers and performers that these new songs have been incorporated into stage revivals ever since.While Bob Fosse's film direction of "Sweet Charity" left a bitter aftertaste in my mouth, his Oscar-winning work in "Cabaret" left me hungry for more. A brilliant turnaround for this icon who had a real affinity for exploring the dark side. He went on to impress film audiences with his lacerating biographical study of foul-mouthed comedian and drug addict Lenny Bruce.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must state my bias to begin with... I am a huge fan of cabaret - real cabaret, having studied it as part of my drama degree. Which means that I am highly critical of depictions of cabaret in film. (For the record "Moulin Rouge" had nothing to do with cabaret. The Moulin Rouge was more of a titillating fun-parlour than a political hot spot for performers and writers who had something to say.)This film captures the political world of cabaret through the songs performed at the exquisite kit-kat club. Hovering ever so precariously over the sinister and uncertain world of 1930s Germany and the rise of Nazism, the film cuts back and forth from the cosy world of the cabaret to the world outside.I loved the choreography, the story, the attention to detail, the costumes, the performances, the depiction of pre-war Germany, the script and the direction. All this - and it's a musical!I can't believe how much they managed to jam-pack into this film.CHECK OUT: - Bob Fosse's choreography - especially look at the dancers' fingers. - The songs and how they nicely reflect the action of the film without being obvious about it. - The framing of each shot (at the Kit-Kat club).This film doesn't date.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest All Time Musical Films!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cabaret was far different that the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical films like The Sound of Music or Mary Poppins or Oklahoma. This film was decadent for the time of Berlin before Hitler's rise to power. As the Nazi movement was gaining power, Berlin residents like Sally Bowles played by the one and only Liza Minnelli had relationships with men and lived on her singing at nightclubs until she meets Michael York (When will he be knighted?) anyway he plays the writer. Joel Grey won an Oscar as the Maestro. I loved the movie and won't bother to see the musical whether it's Judi Dench or anybody else playing Sally Bowles. THere was only one person who played Sally Bowles to me and that was the divine Liza with a Z. She totally becomes the character. When you see this film version, any musical whether the West End in London or Broadway in New York City will always be second rate to this cast. Of course, the fact that Bob Fosse directed this gem and changed the musical films forever from light and happy to dark and sad like in Cabaret. It's eerie to think that the people in the Cabaret have no idea of the horror that lies ahead with World War II and that's terrifying in general. I won't give away much but that this is Liza at her finest and best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not that I dislike musicals. Maybe it's that I don't quite "get" this film. But Cabaret only very rarely worked for me. In a nutshell (I'll flesh all of this out more below), I'm not sure I got the point of setting the film in Berlin during the transition from Weimar to Nazi Germany. I didn't really like the music or the cabaret performances. Very little of the soap opera stuff had any impact on me. I strongly disliked Liza Minnelli and only occasionally liked Michael York. And the direction, cinematography, and most of the technical elements did very little for me. There were a couple things I did enjoy (one not so minor), but you'll have to read on to discover what they were (I need to create _some_ suspense here).Cabaret is the story of Sally Bowles (Minnelli) and Brian Roberts (York). Bowles is living in Berlin in 1931, singing and dancing in a cabaret called the Kit Kat Klub. During the opening, we see Roberts just arriving in town. He ends up at the boarding house where Bowles is living, hoping to acquire a room. He's taking a working vacation from graduate school in England. He plans on earning his room and board by teaching English to Germans.Roberts and Bowles' relationship evolves over the course of the film--that's the gist of the plot. Roberts also makes two friends among his students, Fritz Wendel (Fritz Wepper) and the very rich Natalia Landauer (Marisa Berenson), and Bowles meets the even richer Maximilian von Heune (Helmut Griem) at the dry cleaners. All of this is interspersed with occasional cabaret performances (only very seldomly featuring Minnelli) and even less occasional references to the rise of the Nazi party. The bulk of the film is soap-operatic relationships among the characters.Cabaret had a somewhat circuitous trip to the silver screen, starting with the semi-autobiographical fiction of Christopher Isherwood, who lived in Berlin between 1929 and 1933. After Isherwood, the material was transformed into a play and then a film both entitled I Am a Camera (1955). Finally, it became the Broadway show, and after that, this film version, for which director and famed choreographer Bob Fosse wanted to look back to Isherwood's writing. I haven't read Isherwood's work yet, but from what I understand, it has more of an essay-like tonality, and attempts to capture life in the relatively "decadent" Berlin of the 1930s in detail.Unfortunately, the end result is that this film version of Cabaret plays like a directionless pastiche of mostly mundane events. The goal seems to be an in-depth portrait of a troubled woman in a troubled-environment, and conjointly maybe a commentary on contributing factors that led to the imbalanced state of both. But what Fosse achieved instead was a random-feeling, poorly acted hodgepodge of soap-operatic nonsense.Minnelli's performance is so loaded with annoying affectations, and she so frequently overacts--not to mention that she's very disturbing to look at--that it kills what little dramatic impact the pithier developments should have. York vacillates between confusion, woodenness and overacting, occasionally finding a balanced middle ground that's enjoyable, but it's like waiting for a slow-moving pendulum to reach its nadir.The Nazi material, including the two all-too-brief instances of society embracing some of the attitudes or ideas, could have been very strong and poignant--especially in contrast to the freewheeling life depicted elsewhere. But Fosse makes no kind of commitment to it, so it ends up feeling like it was added on as an afterthought, like scotch-taping a paper lapel to an otherwise complete cashmere coat.Fritz and Natalia, the two characters that I did enjoy and who had a compelling story that was intimately bound up with rising Nazism, were largely ignored. Fosse spends maybe 10 minutes on them.The music and choreography for the cabaret performances lies somewhere between banal and unpleasantly corny. It has a kind of vaudeville "shake your derriere to the cowbell" hamminess, while the choreography involves a lot of mugging--again those annoying affectations--that saps all of the potential effectiveness out of the art direction. Maybe that music was popular in these kinds of German clubs in the 1930s, but would some melodic, harmonic and rhythmic inventiveness--not to mention some finer artistry in the lyrics--have killed Fosse and his composers? It can't be that John Kander and Fred Ebb were unfamiliar with Kurt Weill, for instance.Besides, for the other element I really liked--the art direction and production design--Fosse went out of his way to give us something intriguingly surreal. The look of the film, especially the cabaret scenes, including the garishly painted faces and bizarre costumes and overall appearance of the performers, is based on the visual art of George Grosz and Otto Dix--even going so far as recreating characters from Dix paintings down to small details. I'm a huge Dix fan, so I enjoyed this aspect of the film. But I wanted this aesthetic to be followed in other areas, too, rather than the very pedestrian and unsurprising route that was taken.(By the way, I know that my score of 6 may seem high given my review, but remember that a 6 is equivalent to a "D" in my way of looking at ratings. There were at least two elements I liked--with the art direction/production design being very important to the film, and I rate on all artistic and technical elements. The film has passable cinematography, lighting, sound, etc., even if they weren't anything special to me.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Unstoppable Liza &amp; Incomparable Joel Grey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Life is a cabaret, old chum. Come to the cabaret!" croons a divine Sally Bowles, the American expatriate living in pre-World War Two decadent Berlin, sleeping around and dancing on stage at the Kit-Kat club, played with great vulnerability and aplomb by Liza Minnelli. Partnered with Joel Grey's astonishing turn as the Master of Ceremonies, the two shine in Bob Fosse's remarkable musical Cabaret, a film that foregrounds the messy, tumultuous relationships among Sally, her next door neighbor and lover, the very British Brian Roberts (Michael York), a charismatic German businessman Baron Maximilian (Helmut Griem) with his laissez faire political and sexual interests, and another couple, one Jewish, one not. Ultimately, the film foretells the growing crucible of Berlin with its boots and swastikas, its fear and violence, by focusing on the lives of these men and women in a time of growing crisis. Liza Minnelli carries the film with a performance of great humanity and grace. Her expressive eyes do so much work in the many close-up shots that Fosse employs; her singing and choreography are both stunningly original and remarkably human. She lives, breathes, performs like a performer, and despite the role's manic-pixie-dream-girl template, Minnelli plumbs the depths of Sally's misery and anxiousness: her anger at her absent father, her ardent desire for fame, her unflappable determination to be the life of the party. A favorite scene involves Sally Bowles trying to contain herself while in the presence of another beautiful woman, and the gestures and frustration boil over in ways that are interesting and true. Minelli's Sally Bowles is a sad character, one of intelligence and passion, and one that I fear for in the ramp-up to the Third Reich. Perhaps, Sally's character lacks some of the naiveté or hollowness that Fosse intends by casting her with the dynamic Liza Minnelli (In fact, I had a difficult time figuring out how anyone would not be captivated by Sally, not take her to Hollywood, not make her a star!). Simply put, the film would not work without Minnelli's tour de force performance of singing, dancing, and embodying the weakness and the strength of Sally Bowles, the American who has lost her way in a darkening city. In addition to riveting dance numbers and filming everything with medium shots or close-ups which give great focus on the eyes, make-up, and lips of characters, director Bob Fosse stages tableau shots which give us snapshots of the time: the beaten Kit-Kat club owner, bloodied by Nazi boots; a Russian corpse, presumably communist, strewn across a busy street with people looking in horror; an older German man who remains sitting while everyone around him stands in a nationalistic fever singing the song "Tomorrow Belongs To Me," in a moment of ominous foreshadowing. Fosse inserts German radio in the background of multiple scenes at Sally and Brian's flat, with the chatter underlining the rise of Nazism and Hitler, along with an elderly German woman stating at one point, "I wish we could go back to the days of the Kaiser!" And the emcee, Master of Ceremonies, and Greek chorus of Cabaret is the marvelous Joel Grey, an elfin performer with a haunting and childlike whimsy of a performance with wigs, make-up, various costume changes which go from milkmaid to goose stepping soldier, and a charismatic sense of play. The emcee's role, it seems, is to welcome and usher us into the darkness and twisted mirrors of the Kit-Kat club, to entertain us with his commentary and routines, to comment on the chapters of the film itself through song and dance and comedy, as well as to provoke us into considering the role of art in a fascist state, the role of the artist who performs for those he or she may personally abhor. Can you take a Nazi Party member's money as an artist? Should you? In a world where famous musical artists are taken to task for exorbitant birthday party performances such as Beyonce or Mariah Carey's recent events for the late dictator Moammar Gadhafi, the role of the artist when confronted with cruel power is still present with us today. Grey's emcee playfully sings a dazzling array of songs with amazing choreography, and the film lights up every time he appears. Fosse shows restraint and lets dance sequences play out in real-time or at least in long, unbroken takes compared to the frenetic editing of today's films, allowing us to drink in everything that is going on at once on stage, as well as giving the cramped, confined quarters of the Kit-Kat club stage with its mirrors, curtains, and band an intimate feel; the barrier between performer and audience is nearly nonexistent as Grey dips into the audience from time to time for jokes and laughter. Fosse uses shots of the Master's face as jump cuts at other important moments in the film, signifying the performer's role as always commenting on those men and women and their travails, always seeing everything around him in the city as it spirals and spirals. It is an astonishing performance. The Master of Ceremonies adds an elegiac air to the dwindling days of bustling, cosmopolitan Berlin. By all accounts, it was one of the most wonderful cities in the world during this time. The audience slowly changes over the course of the film until the devastating final shot. His songs and dancing then take on the air of a survivalist, a clownish desperate attempt to curry favor and possible reprieve from what is to come. Is there hope? When the SS Storm Troopers come to the Kit-Kat club, and come they will, the Master of Ceremonies and his troupe will have no place in the Third Reich. We know where the Nazis will place them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnificent Minnelli and Grey in a great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a long-time fan of musicals, I was aware of the existence of Cabaret, but didn't get down to watching it until only recently. While not my favourite of the musical genre, it is a hugely enjoyable film. Bob Fosse does have a very distinctive style, and this style works. The photography is very good and never sloppy, and the costumes and sets are extravagant. The songs are equally wonderful, as iconic as the title song is, the one song I was familiar with prior to my viewing of the film, the best song for me is the brilliant Mein Herr, and the choreography exudes charisma and energy. The story is the least exceptional asset of the film in my opinion, not bad mind you in fact it's very interesting but everything else was so wonderful, while the writing sparkles. Liza Minnelli and Joel Grey are both magnificent in this movie and are a joy to watch in any of their scenes. All in all, a great film helped by the wonderful music and lead performances. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That's all I can call it cause that is what it is. Bob Fosse intricately weaves his own style into what I think is a pure masterpiece. The acting is great, the sets are unbelievable, and everything was so real I actually felt like I was in 1930's Berlin.Liza Minnelli is absolutely amazing as the vivacious Sally Bowles. She certainly did deserve her Oscar. Joel Grey gave a equally stunning performance as the impish Master of Ceremonies and he so owned his Oscar, and yes,he did beat Al Pacino that year, but he still deserved it.Almost everything about this film is perfect, and anyone who doesn't think the same has been living under a rock for a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ribald.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I learned the word years ago studying English literature, but we don't see it in use very much anymore. Ribald. That is the best one-word description for this movie, "Cabaret." It garnered a number of awards in 1972, including Best Actress for Minnelli and Best Supporting Actor for Grey (who incidentally is the dad of Jennifer Grey, who was "Baby" in dirty dancing.)Liza Minnelli is Sally Bowles, American showgirl and performer in 1931 Germany, about the time that the Nazis were beginning to assert themselves. Included is the early suppression of the Jews. Sally is very flaky, thinks she can become a movie star, but we see that it just isn't going to happen. Michael York is a recent Cambridge graduate Brian Roberts just coming to Germany to work on his doctorate. He ends up renting a room across from Sally's in a big boarding house, but it soon seems like Sally and Brian share both rooms together. Brian is shy and proper, Sally is brassy and bold, he has no choice but to go along with her.Helmut Griem as Maximilian von Heune shows up. He is a wealthy baron who ends up showing Brian and Sally both a good time. They become a love triangle in a most unconventional manner.Joel Grey is Master of Ceremonies at the club, where patrons are told to leave their troubles at the door and only have a good time inside. We never see Grey out of costume, his only contact with the rest of the cast is on-stage or back stage. It is fitting that Sally does the movie's closing number and the last verse says "Life is a Cabaret, old chums..." and that is the metaphor in the movie. What we see in small glimpses onstage mirrors what is happening in the lives of those outside in everyday life.I used to sing "I love a parade, the whole world is a parade" for a similar reason.Ribald: ?adjective 1. vulgar or indecent in speech, language, etc.; coarsely mocking, abusive, or irreverent; scurrilous. ?noun 2. a ribald person.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fosse captures this difficult period in history with an off-beat, artistic flare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The man beat out Francis Ford Coppolla. Yes, Bob Fosse, most known for his work on Broadway in regards to dance, beat out Coppolla and "The Godfather" for the Oscar for best director in 1973. That has to mean something and upon watching this film, it definitely does. Fosse has captured the off-beat underground of the Cabaret and paralleled it beautifully to Germany at the time of the rise of the Nazi regime."Cabaret" tells the story of Sally (Liza Minnelli) an American trying to make it beg in Berlin by working at the Kit Kat Club and sleeping with all the right people (at least she believes) so that she might one day be a film star. She meets Brian, who is trying to make a living teaching English in Germany and the two hit it off in a very awkward way and their lives are spun into a crazy sexual chaos because what is practical and what is instinctive don't line up. This effects all characters in the film in some way. Of course, sprinkled throughout are scenes and numbers from the Kit Kat Club, where the master of ceremonies (Joel Grey) is sure to put on a lively and raunchy show each night.The brilliance is that the viewer, much like the audience is being entertained so that they can lighten up and forget about the difficult times. For the viewer, that is the drama of the film and for the audience that is the rise of the Nazis. Joel Grey's role is therefore ever so pivotal to keep you amused and he is simply commanding in his Oscar-winning role. Minnelli is also strong in that she embodies both sides of life: the amusing and the difficult.Fosse contributes to this with various effects, one being the distorted mirrors image that he uses both in the beginning and the end and the other more apparently so in the way he stages and shows the musical numbers at the cabaret. Grey and the dancers are raunchy and strange, yet captivating, and despite the fact that these women are not attractive and alluring, you're still very entertained by the whole show. It's the very reason this film is successful, otherwise it would be boring. It already feels too long for a musical at 2 hours where the drama is most exclusively between Brian, Sally and their friend Maximillion.The impact of the Nazis is not really felt in this film because most of the conflict is superficial in nature between Brian and Sally (their problems can't compete with the problems of Germany and the Nazis at the time) and this was probably the only thing keeping "Cabaret" from topping "The Godfather" for best picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a charming film. A true feel-good movie. Since I saw this movie, Liza Minelli has become one of my favorites. She's so sweet and I think she really deserved her Oscar. It's a shame Michael York didn't get nominated. He was almost as good as Liza. But the real character actor in this magnificent film has got to be Joel Gray. His dancing, singing and his funny faces was the best. He really deserved the credit (and the Oscar) for his role. Even though it's a wonderful film, it's still a bit strange but that's just fascinating. You never get to see any weird films lately. All of the new films has no magic. I truly recommend this beautiful film to everyone. It's got singing, dancing and the special Liza Minelli and the charming Michael York. What else do you need in a musical?? Thanks</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The forerunner to Chicago I would say Cabaret is one of the best musicals I have ever seen. It has several levels to the film, which make it appeal to so many different age groups, from teenagers to OAP's. On the one side you have this swinging bar set just before the second world war, you meet the people, and you listen to the music from this place. As a first impression the film looks to be a shiny bright and happy film people are smiling and enjoying themselves. The two main characters are Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli) an American living in the heart of Germany and an Intelligent Englishman Brian Roberts (Michael York) they both fall in love and all seems to be going well. However the whole film is filled with undertones of the second world war, living in the heart of Germany they are starting to feel the wrath of Hitler and his youth movement along with his hatred for Jews. This carefully woven into the tapestry of life in the Cabaret, gives the viewer an impression of life at the start through rose coloured glass and then evolving into something a bit more macabre than first thought.The Cast act superbly throughout and a special mention has to be said for "Emcee" the master of ceremonies played by Joel Grey he is easily my favourite character and really keeps the story going.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a twisted, wicked tale of life in the German 1930's.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I despise most musicals, but Cabaret defies all typical definitions. I truly love this movie. Bob Fosse has an ingenious approach to directing, using the emcee to segue between the theatre and what's happening offstage. I have never seen a movie or Broadway play like it in that respect. The story is far ahead of it's time, dealing with liberated women, transgender issues, and Semitism, just to name a few. One particularly disturbing scene is during the picnic in rural Germany: a Nazi leader sings a patriotic song and people just watch him at first, then the citizens join in and Nazi's start appearing all over the lawn. Definitely not something we are used to, the open bearing of the Swastika or Third Reich uniforms in a non-combat situation. One great thing about this "musical" is that nobody just all of the sudden bursts into song during an inappropriate time. I am from Oklahoma, and some people feel fortunate that our state song is written by Rogers and Hammerstein, but I just think it's annoying. Cabaret is anything but annoying. I have seen it compared with Chicago, and I would be inclined to agree- Chicago definitely borrowed scenes and costumes from Cabaret, but the format is completely different. I recommend to everyone with an open mind, assuredly see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of all the amazing things about this movie, including the music, the acting and singing of the principals, the direction of Fosse, one thing stands out in many of the comments I have read. That is the powerful song "Tomorrow Belongs to Us" and yet not once has the young singer been mentioned by name by anyone, including the makers of the film. There is no question that the situation in the country, Germany, at the time portrayed in this film, shows how the Nazis were growing not only in power but also in their attempt at stifling any expression by the people. The happenings are emphasized by attacks committed by the Nazis on the owner of the Kit Kat Klub, which are quite obvious to any viewer, but it that song by the young man that shows that ideology weas beiing supported by the majority of the German people of those times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Cabaret" is an excellent film. I have very rarely watched a musical that did not bore me. Well, this one actually excited me. This one is excellent. It presents a particular social entourage considered as decadent, yet honest to itself, that reflects as a mirror the social and political decay of the era. The Nazis will fight them to their extinction, because the perverted one does not like to watch a blatant self in the mirror.Within these bounds, these people search for some sort of love or rather consolation to their loneliness to some other lap, any lap. Apart from that, Liza Minelli is amazing and the music and songs need not be praised since they are already considered classical.Do see it. It will teach you some things.

		<fullReview>The fine songs of John Kander and Fred Ebb are the highlights of Bob Fosse's adaptation of the Broadway musical (which in fact was adapted from a play which in turn had been adapted from stories by Christopher Isherwood) about the last days of German decadence in advance of Nazism. Liza Minelli plays cabaret singer Sally Bowles, a free spirit who invites uptight Brit Michael York into her world of sordid sexuality and greedy excess but who, deep down, is an immature waif starved for daddy's attention. Bob Fosse uses his dancer's experience to good effect in the cabaret sequences and Kander and Ebb's musical commentary is tart and enjoyable. Jay Presson Allen's script is a bit too foreshadowing (the choice to have a young Nazi lead a beer garden full of Germans in "Tomorrow Belongs To Me" is unfortunate because it's sung in English) and the film kind of peters out at the end. But it's a good topic for Hollywood to tackle and the sleaze quotient makes it go down easy.</fullReview>

One notable thing about this movie, as a musical, is that all of the singing and dancing takes place on the stage of the Kit Kat Club (the cabaret). There is no singing mixed with the dialogue. Liza Minnelli's perfomance as Sally Bowles is charming. I really liked it when she performed "Mein Herr"; that's my favorite scene in the movie. Plus, the cinematography and editing are outstanding. Best of all, there's actually a story in this movie--it's not just a musical for the sake of being one. Fantastic direction by Bob Fosse, who also did the choreography in the movie.

		<fullReview>Everybody has one: the movie that, the first time you laid eyes on it, kinda changed your life, or at least your perceptions of it. "Cabaret" is mine. It absolutely knocked me out in 1972 when I was a 12 year old boy in Tennessee. I had never seen anything like it. Ran out to buy the soundtrack, saw it again multiple times, raved about it to anyone who would listen, etc. etc. I became an instant Liza Minnelli fanatic, and I had NEVER had any interest in her. Had to see all her old stuff. Barely knew she was Judy's daughter. Frankly, I was a fan of Liza before I was a fan of Judy's. Saw "Cabaret" many times over the years, and just recently, it was revived here in NYC at a benefit screening, attended by Liza, Kander and Ebb, Marisa Berenson, and other people associated with the film. I will tell you that you could hear a pin drop in the audience as the lights went down. It was like being in church. "Cabaret" has lost NONE of it power since 1972; it is better than ever. The standing ovation at the end was sustained and LOUD. It is a crime that "Cabaret" is not on the AFI Top 100 list, and a result of that, that list has absolutely no relevance to me. (BTW, where is it on the IMDB top 250? It used to be there.) Anyway, if you haven't seen it, you're in for a revelatory experience. It is one of a kind. Thank you Bob, Thank you Liza, Thank you Joel, Thanks for a great flick!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everybody talks about Liza Minnelli. Yes. She acted greatly. But I think there are more in this film.Unlike the other 'Nazi films', it's implicit. You will see NO Nazi violence in this film (except the killing of Natalie's dog). The director even doesn't show how Michael York was beaten up by the two Nazis. And we don't know what would happen to the Jew couple. (But we can imagine, can't we?)No violence, but it's even more forceful, right? The singing young Nazi boy is even more unforgettable than the concentration camps or war scenes. It tells how horrible Nazi was, better than the Nazi war-crime-film cliche does.Needless to say, the very last shot, Nazis' faces reflected on a metal surface, in absolute silence, is breath-taking.Michael is the 'hero' in this film. Michael knew what Nazi was very well and he criticised. But he's not so 'heroic', he has his weakness. It makes me remember Tomas in the unbearable lightness of being.The film shows no serious Nazi crimes directly, instead, it shows how decadent, happy ppl lived before Hitler. But just becoz it's implicit, it's even more forceful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! Great sound. Great extras! And, yes, great movie! Liza Minelli and Michael York are excellent in this much-praised musical. It has that "70's feel"---sharp editing, strange camera angles---but maintains a timeless aura. The songs are by now simply a part of the history of our culture. The depiction of sexuality certainly was tastefully done. This was one of ten films from the 20th century selected to be archived in the Smithsonian Institute. 'Nuff said.</fullReview>

It's partly the setting, partly the romance, partly the other actors but mostly Liza Minelli as Sally Bowles; she's divinely decadent, and she can sing too. No matter how many times I watch this film, I always feel a chill go up my spine at the singing of 'Tomorrow Belongs to Me'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost great (but still wonderful)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Such a difficult film to review. In some ways, it deserves and 8 or even a 9 but there are elements that aren't quite right, at least from the perspective of 2012. It's original, moving, entertaining and beautifully cast, production designed and shot. It's recommended viewing for anyone with a brain and is an object lesson in how to make a great film without spending hundreds of millions of dollars. So what's wrong? Most of what's been written about Minelli's performance is true and the Oscar was fully deserved but there are a few moments that seem badly disconnected. And the story seems rushed at times, even with a two hour running time. There's at least one song too many. Or maybe there's at least one substandard song. I'm not sure which. It's still a wonderful film but you can't help thinking that a tweak here and a tweak there could have made it better. There is however one thing which is perfect. Minelli's performance of the title number. If you've seen it, you'll know what I mean (unless you're the person that described it as joyous!). If you haven't, then you're in for a shock. It's that good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somehow misses greatness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this is a good film but not quite as great as some reviewers think. Mostly the problem is with the cast. The characterizations other than Liza as Sally are uniformly flat. Michael York is incredibly boring and the same could be said for the rest of the supporting cast. The two German actors and the beautiful though dull Marisa Berenson. Therein lies my problem with the movie. It's worth a look, the musical numbers are great but the plot somehow meanders, and is only of real interest because of the looming Nazi undertones. As for Liza, well, you either find her annoying or cute or perhaps annoyingly cute. The one truly magnificent element in the movie other than the musical numbers is the classic performance of Joel Grey as the emcee. For that the movie is worth seeing but unfortunately the rest of the cast Liza exempted (sort of) are not up to par.</fullReview>

The rather bleak ending and the sense of dread that hangs over all the proceedings make this more than just a musical,as the dark days of the Nazi atrocities move ever closer towards these characters.Beautiful,energetic and visually stunning,a night at the Kit Kat Club's Cabaret is something you won't forget in a hurry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vivid Showpiece of a Mythic Era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bob Fosse's "Cabaret" is a superb slice-of-life display of an era often romanticized in the imaginations of those who remembered the horrors that followed it: Weimar Berlin. Michael York and Liza Minnelli are wonderful as two lovers who take in the free-wheeling lifestyle that popular literature often ascribes to 1920s Berlin. I do not agree that this film was worthy of the Oscars it garnered in 1972, nor that Fosse's direction was superior to Francis Ford Coppolla's with "The Godfather"; but it is nonetheless a worthy movie for those who enjoy period pieces or musicals. "Cabaret" is decent as a musical, featuring songs equal to those in such notable screen classics as "The Music Man" and "My Fair Lady." Minnelli is delectable as Sally Bowles, and her acting is equal to her singing; eerily enough, her voice is almost identical to her mother's. The emcee is my favorite character in the film; his song numbers serve the same role as a Greek chorus with regards to the main plot.I recommend this film mostly to those who have a fondness for musicals. It's not as excellent as "The Godfather," but Minnelli, York, and the actor who play the emcee are marvelous enough to keep a viewer entertained for a couple of hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most brilliant film musical ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If anyone outside of Broadway wasn't aware that Bob Fosse was a genius, Cabaret certainly let them know. Fosse took a beautiful "little" musical and saw immediately how to translate it into a film. Lots of us missed the romance of the landlady and the grocer, along with the lovely song, "Marriage", but the issue a hand was that Fosse and Kander and Ebb agreed the subject of the insidious rise of the Nazi movement needed to be handled in a much bigger way.Bob Fosse's vision and instincts were perfect. Kander and Ebb wrote some new music. Joel Grey came from Broadway as the centerpiece of the film -- and he won a much deserved Oscar for his role as the ever so creepy emcee. The romance of the seniors was replaced by a romance between two younger Jews, one of whom is concealing that fact in an effort to avoid Nazi harassment. A very rich and very, very decedent character is introduced to underline the moral decrepitude of Sally Bowles and to facilitate displaying the downward spiral of Germany into the Nazi influence.I've never thought Liza Minelli was a great actress and I still don't. She's a very talented performer, though not nearly so as her mother. Bob Fosse directed her performance in "the role of her life". He got everything she had and rolled it into Sally Bowles. Michael York could have been stronger, but that would not have fit his role. He was just a smart and very naive man who was an instrument of whichever character wanted to manipulate him. In fact, all but the Emcee and Sally Bowles are characters totally subjugated by the story.The film takes us on a brilliant downward spiral ride with extraordinary music and the amoral emcee making sure we take notice of the fact we're on the road to hell. The rich German character is a sort of "assistant emcee" who does his job away from the cabaret. He makes sure we see that Sally Bowles cares nothing for anyone but herself, a self that is all veneer and no real substance.Of all the scenes in the film, I recall one with a palpable shudder. It takes place on a beautiful day. The Sally Bowles menage-a-trois is off on a drive in the country and stops at an open air biergarten. A beautiful young Aryan boy in the Nazi youth organization rises to sing a song. His voice is even more beautiful than his appearance. The song, "Tomorrow Belongs To Me" is a heart-stopping scary indicator of how far Germany has fallen under the Nazi influence. This scene is as scary and creepy a scene as I've ever watched in all my years of movie-going.Bob Fosse was up against The Godfather when his Cabaret came out. There's no doubt The Godfather was a great film, but even with a projected tsunami of awards going its' way, all the key aspects of Cabaret beat it out. Liza Minelli won an Oscar for her morally bankrupt Sally Bowles. Joel Grey won an Oscar for his brilliant portrayal of the true heart of the musical, The Emcee. The cinematography, always perfect, often totally off the charts brilliant won an Oscar. And, of course, Bob Fosse won his Oscar for best director.What a shame Bob Fosse always burned his candle at both ends -- and with the force of a flamethrower. If he had managed to stay with us longer his body of work might have shone at least as bright, if not the brightest, of all film directors. Did anyone out there see his biography-pic of Lenny Bruce? Not everything he did was a film musical. On Broadway his light as a dancer/choreographer/director shines so bright that even today you need to wear dark glasses to look at it. His first film set a new standard for film musicals, and set the bar so high I wonder if anyone will even approach it. Such was his brilliance, such is the brilliance of his Cabaret.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tomorrow Belongs to Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is strange how an established cinematic genre can suddenly disappear within a few years of reaching a pinnacle of excellence. The late fifties and early sixties saw three of the greatest epics ever made, "Ben-Hur", "Spartacus" and "El Cid". Within about five years of this last, however, the genre was to all intents and purposes dead.Something similar happened to the musical which, along with the war film and the Western, was a casualty of the cinema revolution of the seventies and virtually disappeared by the end of the decade. Yet the opening years of that same decade had seen two very fine examples of the genre, "Fiddler on the Roof" and "Cabaret"."Cabaret" is set in the Berlin of 1931, the dying days of the Weimar Republic. Brian Roberts, a young Cambridge academic living in Germany, falls in love with Sally Bowles, an American-born cabaret singer from the city's Kit Kat Club. The two begin an affair, but this does not prevent Sally from sharing her sexual favours more widely. To complicate matters further, Brian is bisexual, and he and Sally share a lover, the aristocrat Max von Heune. There is also a sub-plot about Sally's friend Natalia, a wealthy Jewish heiress, and her lover Fritz. Fritz is also Jewish, but in the growing climate of anti-Semitism has concealed this fact, passing himself off as a Gentile.The traditional Broadway or Hollywood musical, such as "Fiddler on the Roof" or "The Sound of Music", observed a convention whereby the main characters would periodically burst into song, regardless of whether or not they were in a situation where people would normally sing in real life. The purpose of these songs, of course, was to convey the characters' feelings in musical form. "Cabaret" departs from this convention. Four of the main characters, Brian, Max, Natalia and Fritz, do not sing at all, and all the songs, with one exception, are heard during performances at the Kit Kat Club.Most of the songs are performed either by Sally or by the sinister, camp, leering figure of the Emcee, the club's Master of Ceremonies. Although the title song "Come to the Cabaret" is a cheerful one with a "live and be happy" message, the others, like "Mein Lieber Herr" and "Money, Money, Money", sound cynical and jaded. The jazz-based score is much less lyrical than that of most Hollywood musicals. Some German cabarets from this period specialised in political satire, often with a left-wing slant, but the atmosphere in the Kit Kat Club, with its scantily-dressed female performers and transvestite male ones, is not one of ideological commitment but rather sleazy decadence and world-weary cynicism. Contrary to the words of the song, staying alone in your room might not always seem such a bad option by comparison.Earlier musicals such as "Showboat" and "West Side Story" had shown that the genre could deal with serious subjects such as racial discrimination and juvenile delinquency. "Cabaret" deals with an even more serious theme- the rise to power of the Nazis. Nazism is an ever-present theme throughout the film, although in the early scenes the Brownshirts seem like no more than thuggish gangsters. As the film progresses, however, we see how their influence is growing. The management of the Kit Kat Club cynically pander to the national mood by including anti-Semitic sketches in the show; a man who has fallen in love with a gorilla sings "If you could see her through my eyes- she wouldn't look Jewish at all!". In the final shot of the film we see, in a mirror, that most of the audience are now wearing Nazi uniforms.A key scene comes when Max and Brian drive out to a country inn. The sunny German countryside comes as a pleasant contrast to the Berlin scenes, most of which are sombre and gloomy in tone. This is where we hear the only song sung outside the club, the Nazi anthem "Tomorrow Belongs to Me", musically by far the most lyrical song in the whole film. (The devil here, quite literally, has the best tune). At first the song is sung by a single young man, but soon nearly all the beer garden customers, especially the young, join in. (Only one old man shows his disdain). To modern eyes this scene is a horrible, sinister one, but it serves as a salutary reminder that in 1931 there were many young men and women who believed that tomorrow belonged to them, who saw Fascism as an idealistic alternative to poverty, unemployment and the decadence of the Weimar elite.In most years "Cabaret" would have been a strong contended for the "Best Film" Oscar, but in 1972 no film was going to beat "The Godfather" to that award. The Academy did, however, try to even up the honours by awarding it eight other Oscars, including "Best Director" for Bob Fosse (ahead of strong competition from both Francis Coppola and John Boorman for "Deliverance"). I have never agreed with Joel Gray's "Best Supporting Actor" for his role as the Emcee- showy and a technical tour de force, but lacking the emotional depth of Al Pacino's performance in "Godfather". Liza Minnelli's "Best Actress", however, was well deserved. This was something of a career-defining performance- she has made relatively few other films, none of them as well-known as this one. Here, however, she succeeds in showing us the human, vulnerable side of the outwardly hard and brassy Sally. Even when Sally aborts her unborn child on a whim, breaking Brian's heart, Minnelli shows us that there were reasons for her action.Musically speaking, I can think of plenty of film musicals that are better than "Cabaret". When, however, it comes to the strength of the acting, the emotional power of its story and the significance of its themes, there are few that can match it. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My mom and sister are absolutely in love with Cabaret, it's like their favorite musical. They have been trying for years to get me to watch the movie, so finally after 21 long years I finally sat down and watched it. I have to say that my mom and sister are very interesting people to love this musical, but I can see how it is so popular, frankly it is "fabulous". The characters are adorable, somewhat odd, but it was all in good fun and it looked like they had a terrific time doing this film.Sally is a performer who has big time dreams of becoming a famous actress one day. Her life changes dramatically though when a handsome young British man, Brian Roberts, comes into her life and just sweeps her off her feet. Together they find a passion that they have needed in their lives for a long time. But another man enters their lives, Maxamilian, who also seduces Sally and Brian into a life of passion, life, and music while the whole world in is in great depression over the Nazi party taking over.Cabaret is a timeless musical that will never die, I'm sure it will be on Broadway for a very very long time. The music was fun and the actors must have an absolute blast with this musical. I would recommend the movie if you are into musicals, this is a semi-strange film, but I think that you'll get a good kick out of it. After all, in there life is beautiful.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than Coppola's "Godfather"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... a question many viewers seem to raise. (A decision which, of course, ultimately is a matter of taste.) In my humble opinion, "Cabaret" is just a touch ahead of "The Godfather". Certainly, 1972 must have been a lucky year with two top-shelf movies competing for the best picture award, both being considered as masterpieces even 30 years later. And "The Godfather" certainly is part of cinema history, beyond any doubt: together with its follow-ups it is a landmark of epic story-telling, it has brilliant actors, it has Gordon Willis's excellent cinematography, very strong editing, too, and it has made an enormous impact on a whole film genre.However, "Cabaret" strikes me as something completely different, and something which is far harder to achieve than "The Godfather". It is a musical, yet it isn't, it most skilfully (!) conveys feelings and a message that go far beyond the pure storyline (even though it is also a very entertaining film even for the low-brow viewer). It has excellent performances, too (especially by its supporting cast), and it has aged very well (something that cannot be said of most of the films of the early 70s).Personally, I think the difference between "The Godfather" and "Cabaret" is somewhat like the difference between perfect craftsmanship - and very good craftsmanship with a touch of genius, on the other hand.Now you decide what is more impressive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Under Bob Fosse's direction the cabaret numbers are all exciting. Joel grey as the Master of Ceremonies is outstanding. Liza Minelli as the brassy Sally Boules outshines everyone in her splendid "Come to the Cabaret" presentation.It is amazing how much action can take place on the confines of the tiny cabaret stage and how soon one is completely absorbed in the solo acts. The cabaret audience and its reaction are left out of the picture most of the time, the camera concentrating on the singing and dancing. The choreography and costumes are top class and the acts soon become the most interesting part of the production.Against a background of Nazi propaganda there are the continual rumblings of anti-Jewish sentiments in 1931 Berlin and a nervous anticipation of events likely to follow. But the MC invites his audience to leave all their problems, their worries, their cares outside and enjoy the cabaret where everything, just everything, is "beautiful".Intertwined with the stage presentations at the cabaret are the off-stage relationships between Sally and her lovers. Understandably these scenes do not quite sparkle like the rest of the film. I do however enjoy the scene where Brian Roberts (Michael York) and Sally get a little tipsy, clink glasses and make a toast "Here's to you and the baby".Liza Minelli has beautiful eyes which she uses to great advantage. She can give us a wonderful display of mixed emotions....laughing and crying at the same time with a tear-stained cheek. Great to watch and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cabaret is spellbinding, possessing the elements of film that make the craft art. The film bounces between innocence and evil during the first stages of the Nazi influence in Germany. Carefree individuals caught up in a political agenda to seek perfect order and structure. What is most harrowing, is that as a viewer, we know what is to come. Liza Minelli justly earned an Oscar for her wild nympho siren performance. She is the Star and carries the film's weight with much talent. The Cabaret is on the opposite pole of the Nazi Agenda. Loose, perverted, drug addicted, pagan, and everything else in the house of sin. Joel Grey takes the other side of the scale and balances out the melody. He makes an excellent Emcee and Devil. Bob Fosse's eye for direction is original and beautiful. The lighting and staging of the actors and sets are top quality. The film is sexy and erotic filled with bits of humor and foreplay, touching area's most people shy away from. The film is dark and frightening when the true evil and sin appear in the fresh faces of Aryan boys manipulated in believing they are the new order.The music is fresh and impressionable. You'll be singing the tunes for days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the Best Movie Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This incredible movie tells the story of Germany's slide towards Nazi rule in the late 1920s or early 30s. The world of pre-WWII Berlin is seen through the distorted mirror of the Kit Kat Night Club. While technically a musical, the movie does not use the contrivance of having people stop in the middle of a scene and burst out in song and dance. Rather, the songs and danges are integrated into the plot either by being performed on the Cabaret stage or in some other natural manner--including the bone-chilling Tomorrow Belongs to Me. Unlike most movies of the time (including the vastly overrated Godfather), director Bob Fosse does not keep the action entirely linear; rather event A will happen in scene 1, you then have scene 2 dealing with an unrelated issue, then the consequence of event A will be played out in scene 3. This lets the viewer draw his own connections, rather than having everything spoon-fed by the moviemaker. While the Godfather un-deservedly got Best Picture for 1973, it got a total of only 3 Oscars, while Cabaret got 8 (including Best Director)--making it the movie to have gotten the most Oscars without also getting Best Picture. It surely should have--in 1973 or just about any other year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Bad, But Vastly Over-Rated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Cabaret" is a somewhat curious film that won eight Oscars in 1972 and almost blindsided "The Godfather" for the best picture of the year. The film is about a young American dancer (Oscar-winner Liza Minnelli) working in an adult nightclub in 1931 Berlin. She is very sexually active and has had many loveless relationships with many men. Two new men in her life catch her eye (Michael York and Helmut Griem). What follows is one of the strangest love stories during the history of the cinema. Minnelli is an expert in sex, York is a bi-sexual, and Griem has characteristics of both Minnelli and York. There are suggestions of three-ways and homosexual undertones throughout the course of the film. Unfortunately none of this adds to the film. The fact that the Nazis are slowly coming to power in Berlin is an important side-story that is never explored as much as it should be. Bob Fosse's (Oscar-winning) direction is pretty good, but the musical numbers at the Kit Kat Klub never do add to the film the way they should. The under-achieving screenplay does nothing to help out this problem either. Joel Grey (Oscar-winning) tries to provide musical insight as the master of ceremonies at the club, but instead of adding to the film he quickly becomes a huge minus. "Cabaret" is very well-made, but there are some problems that keep the film from being as good as it should have been. The musical scenes are disappointing as they make the film overly wrong and never do create the impact that they were meant to have. Liza Minnelli is the film's greatest asset. She turns a character that could have been very flat into a person who is very complicated and difficult to figure out. Michael York is also impressive as a deep character who, like Minnelli, is in limbo in a place that is slowly spinning out of control. Helmut Griem is not very good though. He struggles through the middle of the film and he never does keep up the intensity created by Minnelli and York. Joel Grey won a curious Oscar as he did not have one speaking line that was not in song. His character is poorly developed and never does have the impact that he was meant to have. "Cabaret" wanted to be trail-blazing, but basically does the same thing that earlier films from the 1960s did. "The Sound of Music" is a better musical dealing with the fear generated from the Nazis and "Midnight Cowboy" is a better film that deals with the taboo subjects of bi- and homosexuality. "Cabaret" is a good film, but it is no "Godfather" and the fact that it won eight Oscars is one of those mysteries generated by the Academy. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

The ominous coming of Naziism and its seizure of the Geman populace is remarkably portrayed through a number of capivating and convincing scenes. One that stands out depicts a handsome blond lad of about sixteen singing with such sincerity a nationalist song with his arm raised in the Nazi salute.

		<shortDescription>"Come Hear The Music Play"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two of the most successful movie musicals adapted from Broadway shows are The Sound Of Music and Cabaret. Of course what could Maria Von Trapp and Sally Bowles possibly have in common, other than the times they live in and how they dealt with them.Cabaret takes place at the tail end of the Weimar Republic era as Sally and her crowd party on while Germany is surrendering its freedom to an authoritarian minded party and its leader. Liza Minnelli is Sally Bowles in what is her career screen role. With the fading away of the musical genre, we don't get to see Liza Minnelli too often as a singer so be grateful that Cabaret is recorded and popularly available. Her role also calls for a great actress as well, so small wonder she won an Oscar in 1972 as Best Actress. Her award was one of eight that Cabaret received. Cabaret ran for 1165 performances from 1966 to 1969 on Broadway and it was reversed there in terms of casting. On stage it was an English woman and an American man expatriate it Weimar Berlin and starred Jill Haworth and Bert Convy. Michael York took the role of the rather naive young man who while renting a room, falls in with Liza Minnelli and her hedonistic lifestyle.Repeating his role as the Cabaret emcee is Joel Grey who was the Best Supporting Actor for 1972. I think it would have almost been impossible to do a film version of Cabaret without Grey. He's one fey and evil man who is quite willing to adapt to the new Germany. My guess is he found a boyfriend later on in Ernest Roehm's SA and later paid dear for it, either killed during the Night Of the Long Knives or died in one of the camps.I've always loved the contrast between the Von Trapp family who saw what was coming to Austria and took measures to flee and Sally Bowles who kept on in her words, going like Elsie. York could see what was coming as did many others in her crowd. One can only hope she did eventually.Liza Minnelli's best song was one especially written for the screen version by songwriters John Kander and Fred Ebb. With all the awards Cabaret won, amazingly that Maybe This Time didn't even rate a nomination for Best Original Song. In an era when good film songs were at a premium, that was inexcusable.One other comparison with Sound of Music. The song sung by the young Aryan pure Germans, Tomorrow Belongs To Me is a frightening number. I could see young Rolf who became a Nazi while courting the Von Trapp eldest being part of that.Cabaret is a film guaranteed to last forever, something that will never date and something we always have to be reminded about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably the last great movie musical, most likely one of the finest of all time. Fosse's direction and choreography are shattering. Grey steals the entire picture with one of the most devlishly divine characterizations ever presented. Many of the elements from the original musical have all been minimalized and the story is better for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This globally acclaimed and masterful film was definitely one of the most risky and dared projects in cinema history and thus it also easily could have been one of the biggest failures ever. A cheerful musical about...Nazis?!? Especially during an era when films began to be very spectacular and explicit ("The French Connection", "Deliverance", "The Godfather"), a love-story set amidst the rising Nasism seemed like a very bad idea. And yet "Cabaret" is still standing as one of the most crucial films of the 70's, although it has to be said that the actual love story is secondary to the immortal songs and ? especially ? the portrayal of frustrated Germany during the years prior to WWII. Bob Fosse stylishly and appropriately alternates footage from inside the moody bar with scenes from the romantic life of variety star Sally Rowles (Liza Minelli). Sally is involved in a slightly peculiar triangular relationship with German industrialist Maximilian and English language teacher Brian. Meanwhile and all around them, supporters of the Nazi ideas become more and more numerous and their presence soon begins to have a direct impact on the lives of everyone. The acting performances are fabulous, especially Minelli and Joel Grey who plays the sleazy master of ceremonies who pretty much indirectly narrates the whole story. The songs are downright magnificent and masterfully choreographed, with great costumes, make-up and sound effects. The sequence in which Brian and Maximillian are in a public park where the majority of German citizens there seem to permanently turn to Hitler's ideas in intensely disturbing and powerfully highlighted trough an ambiguous song. A lot of film fans, especially around this website, will surely disagree, but Bob Fosse's "Cabaret" righteously stole some important Oscars from "The Godfather"...Maybe not even enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was twenty when Cabaret (the film) came out and remember it as a cinematic icon of my generation. I was 21 when I played in a pit orchestra for the musical theater version. I am steeped in Cabaret, in other words.Funny thing was I have only watched it one other time, until today, over a period of 38 years and I was only moved to rent the video just to see it again. That was in about 1989. So today, in 2011, I have watched the newly purchased DVD of what I thought would be a fascinating romp through Berlin c.1931. It wasn't. It was boring. Was I shocked!? Not really. After I'd watched the first half hour I remembered how coy I thought it was at the time it was released. The Isherwood novel on which it is based is much racier and decadent and paints a vividly dark portrait of the newly Nazified Berlin. This homogenized, choppy, poorly scripted, poorly acted (except in one case) second rate period piece by Bob Fosse is simply eye candy nothing much more. To Fosse's credit the choreography is splendid, the best part about this movie. The other outstanding performance is Joel Grey's nuanced and frightening Master of Ceremonies in the cabaret itself. I also enjoyed Marisa Berenson at her most beautiful, anticipating her stunning portrayal a couple of years later in Barry Lyndon. She also gins up the only true humor in the entire movie with her charming, wide-eyed daughter of the Jewish gratin in Berlin.Some of the songs are good, especially Mein Herr, but most of them are pretty forgettable, though not as dire as those in famous tuneless shows like The Phantom of the Opera, Chicago and Wicked. Cabaret is dark, but so was Oklahoma! Thing is, Oklahoma! is a classic masterpiece of filmed musical theater, Cabaret is a travesty of an intriguing novel turned into a very shallow piece of Broadway glitz. Liza Minelli is all fingernails, eyelashes and big, moist puppy-eyes. She is utterly tiresome as Sally Bowles, a fatal flaw in any film when the leading actress is a washout. She dances well and has a fine body, she sings okay, the queen of belting, but she can't act, beyond the eyelashes, and her chemistry with ALL the men is zilch. Michael York is perfect, in theory, as the gay leading man, though he's not allowed to be gay here for too long before he and Minelli suddenly find themselves gazing intensely (for them) into each others' eyes and falling into bed. Ho-hum.Was I disappointed? Yeah, I was. Isherwood's book I Am a Camera deserves a great adaptation for the big screen. I don't know if there are any American singing actresses who could bring any more depth to the role of Sally Bowles than Liza Minelli did, so it may all be a moot point. A straight dramatic film of the original material could be great in the right hands.Sorry boys, I know some of us like to dress up like LizaMinelliSallyBowles on Halloween, or any old time, but beyond her parrot-like appearance, she flopped in her great 15 minutes of fame on the silver screen.Still, I give Cabaret four stars for the choreography (which IS great) and a couple of the songs and Joel Grey's creepy mastery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated film adaptation which fails to do justice to its source</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who caught Joel Grey in his last tour of the stage musical Cabaret would almost certainly have to agree that the production as presented in the 1960s was looking a bit staid and conventional - words that were never meant to describe Cabaret. This shortcoming was overcome brilliantly in the amazing Broadway revival from a few years ago. Unfortunately, the film version shares neither the narrative strengths of the original stage production nor the energy and canny instincts of its latter-day revival. Director/choreographer Bob Fosse makes some very strange and not necessarily good decisions in rendering the material from stage to film. Most detrimental is his choice to cut any musical numbers that cannot be placed on stage at the Kit Kat Club in Berlin (with one notable exception), which means a large quantity of numbers fall by the wayside. To somewhat compensate, he has added some new material, of which only Mein Herr is really memorable. He has also cut or minimized characters from the source and failed to suitably replace their loss. For instance, the doomed second-string romance between a German landlady and Jewish tenant, which resonates strongly because this may be their last chance at love, has been replaced by a romance between rich beautiful young Gentile Marisa Berensen and poor Jewish guy Fritz Wepper, which has absolutely no dramatic impact at all. Berensen comes across as a spoiled glamor puss only mildly disappointed in the thwarted romance, which is depicted very half-heartedly by Fosse. It seems inconceivable that Grey won an Oscar up against the majority of the supporting cast from The Godfather. Not because he is bad, but because his role as the Emcee is so inconsequential in the film. He really has no wow moments and his much-acclaimed "Money" number is even watered-down in that he is forced to share it with leading lady Liza Minnelli. The leading romance in the film is a total bust. Michael York and Minnelli share no chemistry. Fosse adds a new character played by Helmut Griem to turn it into some kind of bisexual love triangle, which must have seemed daring in 1972, but the allusions to naughtiness are all we are left with and it simply fails to impress. As for Minnelli, Cabaret would become her last cinematic highlight. She is not remotely convincing as a second-rate chanteuse in a run-down Berlin night club, nor is she believable as an object of lust. With so much make-up splashed on her and her unflattering bob cut, Minnelli often comes across as Divine's svelte younger sister. She does well by some of the songs, but her Sally Bowle's has no depth whatsoever. In both the Isherwood stories and in the stage play, Bowles may well be a self-destructive party girl, but she comes to realize it. Minnelli seems to have no self-realization whatsoever. When her character has an abortion in the play, she recognizes both her self-destructive and selfish streaks. In the film, when Minnelli claims not to know why she had an abortion - she really appears to be clueless - as if a page of her script got stuck together. In all versions of the play, the Sally's have realized that the "happy corpse" of Elsie sung about in the title song actually may well be herself. In the film, Minnelli belts out the number with no introspection or subtlety - she realizes she has a hot number and nothing more. I think Minnelli is quite accomplished in the earlier Sterile Cuckoo, but this must have been a really weak actress year at the Oscars if her over-the-top mugging and sledgehammer delivery is what took home the gold. Unfortunately, she has been playing this way on screen - with mercifully less frequency - ever since.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life is a Cabaret: Sad with Few Happy Moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was younger I liked this film because of its high-energy performances. After I watched this film last night, I had a change of heart because I gave myself the opportunity to analyze the characters.The leading characters have no redeeming qualities, while the supporting cast added a silver lining. More on this later.Liza Minnelli's dancing and singing are on point and were delightful to watch. Cabaret inspired a slew of imitators. It is easy to see where many dancing female pop stars got their moves and act from. Bob Fosse and Liza Minnelli deserve a lot of credit for their body of work.Onto the negative aspects of the film. Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli) is a walking stereotype of a cabaret act and veers on being caricature. She is so desperate, vapid, needy, promiscuous and is not a lot of fun to be with outside of the cabaret and parties. Ms. Bowles has unresolved daddy issues that contribute more to her personal failures more than she acknowledged. Brian Roberts (Michael York) starts out as a fly on the wall who has plenty of wiles of his own. He seems conflicted about his sexual orientation. He knows that he may be gay, but had a few affairs with women knowing that he went against himself. Mr. Roberts is resolute about social issues (e.g. growing Nazism and anti-Semitism), and this is where he shows his might. The film is much more sympathetic to Brian than Sally. We never get to see how Sally was affected by the growing right wing movement in Germany. Instead, she is depicted as too much of a superficial escapist to even care, which is worse. Brian's character gets to show all of his facets, not just his sexual and fun-loving side.Cabaret's brighter spots is the Master of Ceremonies (Joel Grey). Under the guise of humor, he tells the truth. He is the quintessential court jester of Shakespearean times. The MC keeps the movie from turning soppy and unfocused. His mischievous appearance only adds more to the fascination. Grey's work cannot be underestimated.Fritz (Fritz Wepper) is pretty one dimensional, but because the film addresses anti-Semitism, his presence gives the film a greater heart. His relationship with Natalia (Marisa Berenson) is a big turning point for each other as Nazis take hold of Germany. When one contrasts Natalia with Sally, we the quintessential virgin-whore dichotomy that is as old as dirt. Natalia is "good" because she is virginal, sweet, conventional and cultured. Sally is "bad" because she is loose, dirty, vulgar and overly sexed. These women do not intersect. In fact, Natalia's critical of Sally's overt sexual expression.Baron Maximilian von Heune's (Helmut Griem) presence introduced another facet of Brian's personality. He has a price just like Sally and can be a rent boy under the right circumstances. Fancy items like cashmere sweaters and gold cigarette cases come with a price. However, the film treats Max and Brian's affair much more subduedly and respectfully than Sally.In the end, Cabaret did not leave me happy, with the exception of Fritz and Natalia's marriage. Overall, it was not a feel-good movie, despite the cheerful dancing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was inventive in its time seems like an over-long music video now.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no denying that the movie version of the musical version of "I am a Camera" is an artistic triumph, but in repeat viewings of this, I have sadly discovered that overall, the whole movie just lays there while many sequences stand out, particularly those where Liza Minnelli sings. She has never topped her triumph with her Oscar-Winning performance, and even if some detractors say that either Diana Ross or Cicely Tyson should have won that year, she still retains the power of presence, even if the character of Sally Bowles is supposed to be of just so-so talent. Forget the fact that Minnelli is as American as they come, her talents are just too large to indicate that she could be lost in the world of a tacky Berlin nightclub. Like the same era's Josephine Baker, I think Liza's Sally would be more than welcome on the Paris stages of the Moulin Rouge or the Folies Bergere.Then, there is the fact that the film altered much of its story from the musical, being closer to the original play. Those who have seen the original musical (or its recent revisal, back on Broadway once again) can see the power of the fear factor involving the Nazi's coming rise to power as the old world falls to pieces, lives crumble around them, and yet, Sally goes on singing about "When I go, I'm going like Elsie!". Gone are the stage subplots of the Jewish grocery store owner who courts a non-Jewish German landlady and the neighbors whose sympathies lie with the Nazis as their powers rise and aren't afraid of exposing their feelings of hatred to the world around them. In its place is an almost bi-sexual subplot involving the American version of Sally and the very British version of Cliff (Michael York) and the menage-a-tois that seems to open up with one of their acquaintances.Certainly, nobody other than Bob Fosse was better selected than to direct this movie, although he was busy with "Sweet Charity" in 1966, leaving "Cabaret" to Ron Field on Broadway. The dance moves that made "Charity" so ahead of its time (especially those involving hats) are very prevalent here, and Fosse instills a delightful sense of trashiness into each and every musical number he creates. Joel Grey sensibly repeats his role as the slimy looking emcee, adding an Oscar to his Tony for the same part, and making us wonder what befalls this strange creature as the curtain falls on his finale "Au Wiedersein". Minnelli is genuinely sexy here, especially with "Mein Heir", and her vulnerability is obvious with "Maybe This Time", not heard in the original, but added to subsequent revisals. When she gets together with Grey for the newly written "Money Make the World Go Round", it is as if Judy Garland and Gene Kelly have come back to life in "For Me and My Gal", only with a less angelic setting and darker intentions. She rocks the title song off the screen, and it is easy to see why she continues to sing songs from this show more than 40 years after the movie exploded her into the front line of legendary performers. Two disturbing moments that haunt me to this day are Grey's "If You Could See Her Through My Eyes" (re-installing the lyrics of "She Wouldn't Look Jewish at all!") and the frightening Nazi anthem, "Tomorrow Belongs to Me", where an angelic faced blonde soldier boy increasingly gets angrier and angrier as the older generation looks on in shock as the world around him falls to crap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cabaret is of course excellent on its own terms but if you have read Christopher Isherwood's book "Goodbye to Berlin" on which, (via the stage play "I am a Camera") it is based, some of the flaws, the concessions to the mainstream, become more apparent. Isherwood's protagonist was in no degree bisexual, Sally Bowles was an English clergyman's daughter who "sang badly", and there was no conventional glamour or glitz. While the film is certainly dazzling and the "Tomorrow Belongs to Me" sequence in particular is a true coup de theatre, compared to the book it takes on shades of "The Sound of Music".</fullReview>

Liza Minnelli puts the squeeze on the audience, overacting in a watchable way. Her character is deliberately annoying in a way that supposed to be poignant as the movie goes on. It isn't but she's so dynamic in the musical numbers that it hardly matters. Michael York is beautiful and sometimes even charming as her leading man. The most effective element is the growing influence of the Nazis, their presence is felt as strongly as any monster's in a horror movie. ***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I suppose this is a successful enough sketch of a world, Weimar Germany in the early 1930's, so between Caligari and Riefenstahl's Hitler; chaotic times, turbulent, with a battle waged on the streets for the soul of a peoples exhausted from twenty years of poverty and inflation, so a peoples looking to have a soul again, a coherent image for themselves. I say Riefenstahl's Hitler because those murky years culminate with her Triumph; a film staged on the behest of Hitler to 'document' a great new image for German soul, the document all in this being staged to be an identity.So how apt that our film is all about staged images attempting to seduce? And even more apt, a seduction that trivializes and dehumanizes complex life on the other side of that stage.So this should have been a great film, an acidic set of false images for Nixon's America.But glamorous Bob Fosse was clearly not the person for a job that required New Hollywood blood. We get only the sketch. The more we wander off into this world, the more we discover it's all one big set. It's movielike where should be life, formulaic in its dramatic entanglements, for instance the trio of lovers with the rich baron, the unwanted pregnancy, the German gigolo who falls for a young Jew heiress. It trusts the viewer to know how these things will pan out and sacrifices required, that Krystallnacht is only a few years away.So okay, everything's a stage where all the main players have to conceal a part of them from the eyes of a larger audience (homosexuality / ethnicity / love life), except her, an open sexual being - of course an American - who is a cabaret dancer and aspires to act in the movies.Which leaves the actual show. Now the test of a good musical in my eyes is how well it can weave song and dance, as expressions of inner heart, with the world at large that in one or the other way offers the inspiration. How deeply can it visualize impulse that cannot be put to words?Flimsy weave here. We're shown a segment that is about sexual mischief or the sudden swell of nationalism, and then cut to burlesque that lampoons the situation we have just witnessed.It dehumanizes, because where we imagined complicated life, the show hammers home a cardboard satire. There is no heart in the thing, and is consumed by the audience in the same decadent way. So maybe the film posits as root of evil - evil that would go on to sweep Europe in a few years - a society that is ashamed to confront that part it has to keep concealed, and instead prefers the safety of a fabricated cardboard image.That is fine. But we still have a film where she, wounded, liberated, gets out on a stage to sing it doesn't strike any spark, because nothing here has a soul of its own. Fosse gambled on prefab reality and lost any sense of reality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Chicago and thought it was a really clever film telling a story of and with live musical shows, and this film has exactly the same qualities. Sally Bowles (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Liza Minnelli, daughter of Judy Garland) is a stage performer with a very likable voice, and one day meets English gentleman Brian Roberts (Michael York). Basically this film shows their little on-off love story, the interferences with it, and the musical life that Sally lives on, and off the stage. I think this film is quite essential for all of its quality songs and music, and obviously Minnelli and York make a good film couple. Also starring Helmut Griem as Maximilian Von Heune, Oscar, BAFTA (newcomer) and Golden Globe winning Joel Grey as the fantastic Master of Ceremonies and BAFTA and Golden Globe (supporting and newcomer) nominated Marisa Berenson as Natalia Landauer. The director Bob Fosse was against Francis Ford Coppola for The Godfather for the Best Director Oscar, I can see why he won, he also won the BAFTA and was nominated the Golden Globe. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Music for Ralph Burns and Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Picture and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, it won the BAFTAs for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Sound Track and Best Film, and it was nominated for Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing and Best Screenplay, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Musical/Comedy, and it was nominated for Best Original Song for "Mein Herr", Best Original Song for "Money, Money" and Best Screenplay. "Cabaret" was number 18 on 100 Years, 100 Songs, the film was number 5 on 100 Years of Musicals, it was number 17 on The 100 Greatest Musicals, it was number 45 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die, and it was number 78 on The 100 Greatest Films.

		<shortDescription>The promise of an enduring masterpiece ruined by a dog of a love story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there's somewhere a Purgatory for filmmakers, Bob Fosse should be sent there and put to write over and over again on a blackboard: "I shall not sabotage a masterpiece I have started, even less for a lame love story". That's criminal. I can forgive talentless directors for giving me a dog--as they can't offer me what they don't have--but not one who got it made and who instead ruins his masterpiece just minutes after he started it.Let's be clear on this: the first 6 min. of Cabaret propel the movie right into classic territory. Even if I consider myself a complete ignorant on technical stuff such as lightning, cinematography or choreography, I still can appreciate that spectacular introductory number; the brilliant superimposition of what's going on at the stage with random urban Berlin scenes, mixed with shots of Brian arriving to the city; the frantic camera movements following the out of--this--world, Fellinesque, dancers; the changing lightning silhouetting the orchestra against a background of bright bluish haze or bringing to attention the mocking facial features of the deceptively mischievous MC; the deliciously moody, decadent, atmosphere of the place; the Dix living paintings, all that is screaming 10/10! But then the film suddenly changes pace, it deflates, as we are introduced to both leads and we get to know them better in all their lameness &amp; insignificance.I can't imagine in what universe it could be seen as interesting--let alone touching--a love affair between such a pair of losers, even more considering that what Fosse had already in his pocket was nothing less than the opening chapter for what could be a real life epic for which The Downfall is already providing the final chapter; both films cinematographically bracketing the most fascinating period in modern History: the rise &amp; fall of the Third Reich. All he had to do was to stay the course, combining live action with on-stage references, using the Kit Kat club as the proverbial chorus in Greek tragedy--as he did with the back alley beating of the bouncer. Then, inserting in the empty spaces episodes of every day lives of characters, combined with pertinent glimpses of the social and political realities in pre-Nazi Germany, as he did for ex. with the bit of the kid singing Tomorrow Belong To Me and then everyone in the terrace joining him, perhaps the most terrifying scene of the whole movie, the one everyone remember best. I saw it for the first time in the 70s and it stuck in my mind forever.Brian &amp; Sally's is not a love but rather a Why Not story. This is how it goes: awkward boy meets awkward but outgoing fellow expatriate girl. As they are both in foreign land she offers him they room together--why not. Then, as both have no present sexual partners, she proposes they sleep together--why not; you get the picture. Utterly lame. No wonder they finally separate without a single tear being shed, just with a casual wave of a hand. Fosse knew well that his "love story" was a dog; the mystifying thing is why he decided to dedicate it most of the movie. Even more so when it doesn't start with champagne, or with a tense but joyful shedding of diverse pieces of clothing, but when her spirits are so low, because her dad doesn't even give her the time of the day (who could blame him for that?)that the door is opened for him to seduce her. Can you say Loser?.This is how Cabaret should have been made: no Sally-Brian romance; they should have remained just friends and been instead our hosts to the story, fading into the background when necessary--i.e most of the time. No Fritz &amp; Natalia love story either; poor Wepper seems lost not only in his own feelings but also in his Fritz role, he just doesn't know what to do with it. A love affair Berenson--Griem would have been more appropriate, as they are both the best actors here, besides Grey--not to mention the most attractive. For ex. they could have eloped and fled to America--with a few tips from Heddy Lamarr maybe. As for acting, just watch the scene in Natalia's house to see who the true actress is. Berenson's marvelous there, managing to be touching, sensitive, vulnerable, while hilariously funny at the same time, while Minnelli seems completely lost, she doesn't even know what to do, overwhelmed by Berenson's persona. And an Oscar for that? You gotta be kidding. (I'm sure Curly could have done a better job if confronted to someone like, say, Lawrence Olivier).A filmmaker ruining his classic, maybe trying to address the whims, fears, of the studio or accommodating the tastes of U.S audiences; but there's a price to pay for that. 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film musicals last big hurrah...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A love story set in a Berlin night-club during the rise of Nazism.Musicals, more than any other form of film, are the most dangerous to make: It only takes one or two bad songs, an ill-chosen star or an ill-judged theme for the whole affair to collapse, not just in to failure, but in to an object of public ridicule. Think about the film version of A Chorus Line for a minute.However when they fire on all cylinders - as it does here - you have something that will live and play forever.Director Bob Fosse's name will, indeed, live forever with Cabaret which not only works as a great musical, it also operates as a fairly good love story and imparts (without too much depth) a sense of time and place drama. For these combined reasons I think it is the best musical ever made.Liza Minnelli was born to play Sally Bowles the brash and breezy night-club performer. She turned that year's Best Actress Oscar in to a one horse race. Michael York will never get a better part and plays it to perfection; although hardly a technically demanding performance. Joel Grey was good (and deserved his Oscar) as the spooky compare, but having said that plenty of actors could have played the role just as well.The best thing about this movie is that really does look like a Berlin night-club. The dancing is not ultra-slick, the make-up is thick stage slap not the movie variety. The place really does look dusty, seedy and cheap. The songs sound like they really would be performed at such a place. The original stage version - so people that have seen it say - was much more standard in musical performance and values.Those wanting the whole story of the rise of Hitler as well will be left disappointed. The politics of the day hang in every frame, but they are mostly background rather than foreground; but allow a sense of "let's enjoy ourselves while we still have a chance."The only fly-in-the-ointment is a homosexual sub-theme that some viewers might not find to their taste.If you like musicals and can live with a bit of a limp-wristed camp then Cabaret is a film for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cabaret; or how to wave goodbye at emotionless friends</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Cabaret" boasted big songs, big ideas, and big actors ? yet it felt long, dull, and convoluted to say the least. Edging on the historical, but focusing mainly on a squabble of young love, the muddled themes of originality, independence, and sexual revolution seemed to take backstage for overacting, choppy editing, and a twisty story that begs for more but desires nothing. In the Oscar world of "The Godfather" vs. "Cabaret", the obvious winner is Coppola's film ? but how did "Cabaret" even get in the running? As it took me nearly three viewings to conquer this behemoth, one has to question the 1972 value, and whether this musical stands up next to the others nearly 40 years later. In this reviewer's opinion, it is an obvious "no", but arguments will apparently follow.If discussing this film around the cinematic water cooler, there would be no doubt Joel Grey would be discussed. His portrayal, as small as it was, as the infamous Master of Ceremonies has yet to be repeated in any film to date. In various moments "Cabaret" felt like it was directed by Terry Gilliam, complete with the flash and darkness subsequent in his features. Joel Grey brought it to the table, and will forever be a frightening, yet influential image in my mind. He made the nearly 2-hours redeemable. The excitement in his swagger coupled with his level of pizazz completely overshadowed his co-star Minnelli whenever the two shared the screen. His performance alone, the transformation itself, is what made "Cabaret" worth a view. It was he and Minnelli's duet of "Money Makes the World Go Round" that saved this film from utter obliteration. It was reminiscent of a modern day "Moulin Rouge", but it was the surrounding story ? without surrounding characters ? that caused the pain known as "Cabaret". One must also applaud Bob Fosse for his direction, for without him, these dark scene filmed with Grey would have just been as bland as the story. Fosse took this flimsy story of three characters that we are emotionally void for, and pulled in some great song and dance numbers to buffer the pain that was sure to follow. His work on "Lenny" was outstanding, and while this didn't speak as greatly, you could see his influences on the script and final edit.To bookend the positive, one must also ask "Where did 'Cabaret' fail?" Without wasting pages of words, "Cabaret" failed because of the sloppy editing, the poorly developed historical slant, and due to the massive disappointment from the actors. This could have been a memorable song-and-dance rooted with historical symbolism-esquire film, but instead fell flat thanks mainly to the horrible nature of Liza Minnelli. Her flat voice matched well with her disassociated character, which carried no emotion, flaunted no values, yet tried to win our heart. She sang decently, but I just couldn't stand behind her as a central focus. Her entire relationship with Michael York is flippant. Does she love him? Does she love money? What is her true background? What does she want from life? Mix these unanswered questions with the uncomfortable hint of sexuality between York and Minnelli, and you have nearly 90% of this movie. From Minnelli's undefined character, to the passive aggressive York duel-jobbing as both language educator and African safari supporter, there just isn't a character you can stand behind. As we get close to the middle of the film, our writer seems to realize this and the extremely vague Maximilian is introduced as a man who enjoys the company of both Minnelli and York. For "Cabaret" to work, there needed stronger characters for us to follow ? ones that were defined, yet complex, not just jumping from emotion to emotion. How did Minnelli win an Oscar for this mess? Outside the of intermittent use of Grey, our writer - Jay Presson Allen ? tried to incorporate what was happening in Germany at the time with the Nazi movement, with the chaos of a cabaret show. In theory, this would be a great idea ? but it failed because of again, the lack of focus with our characters. In one scene we are troubled by York's disagreement with one of Minnelli's haphazard choices (a big decision that was diminished by choice) and in the next, we are dissecting the idea of a German Jew. It just didn't flow well together. In another scene, we are forced to listen to a young Nazi soldier sing a ballad that evokes singing from everyone ? and our characters just drive away. For me, to best summarize this film would be one of the final scenes between York and Minnelli as she takes him to the train station. She leaves by merely waving her hand, demonstrating her care for the characters and ours as well. When this film was over, I took it out of my player, walked away waving unemotionally. "Cabaret" failed because there was nothing for the audience to hold onto. When the breakout actor was someone that didn't speak but merely sang that should speak about how the film as a whole turned out.Overall, both with presentation and delivery, "Cabaret" failed. Minnelli's acting and eyes told a different story, and portrayed a character that just didn't fit for a feature film. What was attempted as original just felt stale after the first several scenes. Fosse's direction and Grey's performance are the only two saving qualities of this film, as the flakey York does his best as a love interest. The dual sexual roles are just too abashing for both the actors and the viewers. I was eager to witness this film, but nearly 40 years later, this film has not held up. Bravo to small part and big directors, "boo" to those that think Minnelli can carry her weight as an Oscar winning actress.** Waves eagerly as you leave this review ** Grade: * ? out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Caberet - Great Music but Depressing Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's like the Emperor's new clothes: Everybody says it's wonderful. I hated it. Of course I understand what the story is all about. It's about the Nazis destroying the soul of Germany. Jews denying that they are Jewish to avoid persecution, and, in this case, losing a perfect love. So what do we have here? Only the music and decadence of the Kit Kat Club. Joel Gray as the MC is haunting. Liza Minnelli as Sally Bowles is riveting and gives the musical performance of her career. When the music stops, the movie is hollow. Sally is a foreigner in Germany. She has few friends and passes the time with fornication and drink between musical acts. She is in a "love triangle" with two men. One may be bi-sexual. She gets pregnant and has an abortion. We are shown searing images of the coming fall of Germany. A man is beat to death in the alley. A German youth sings the praises of Hitler. Jews looking truly terrified in the marketplace. Innocent German children who know nothing about the nightmare to come. Most depressing, and intended to be so. Long, inane, boring dialog that goes on forever. It only comes to life in the Cabaret and I am sure that's the point of the movie. I just saw the 135 min. restored version on TCM and it still looked "cut" for missing scenes which I can only assume are nudity or sexually explicit. I'm glad I saw it on TMC. I don't need to own this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>oh, mr. york!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>am so excited to have seen this on the big screen for the first time last night at the brattle. I was just swept away by the energy that the medium-magnification added. the sweltering sexuality of and gentle chemistry between minnelli and york is practically shocking against the standard of modern screen pairings, which often seem cold, commercial and clumsy. so many recent romances skip right over the obvious (when people go through the hassle of being in love with one another, it's usually because they are desperately drawn to each other as individuals)and cut right to the same boring generic sex scene. in cabaret: we have a pg-rated movie with enough passion and electricity generated by the characters'*close proximity* to make one blush in the dark.the writing is brilliant, but it's the actors' complex performances that just launch sally and brian into the realm of epic lovers: many of the best moments in the film happen without dialogue. the depiction of intimacy is so well done that, when this couple (who seemingly had it all over fritz and natalia) cannot find the courage to stick, the frustration and pain of the split is visceral. major non-pms-induced tears streaming and a big lump in the throat not experienced since seeing the restored print of Nights of Caberia on a big screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Minnelli does a wonderful performances, and it is too bad that most other actors and actresses in the crew do not match up. The stage scenes are top and impressive, especially the "money makes the world go around" song. Otherwise there are obvious Hollywood flaws. The Nazi rising is over-explicit, as like the audience is children told all through the film that "Nazism is bad". The script could have been better. A bad script often restraints the actors from performing well. The direction could have been better as well. Nevertheless, it is entertaining, and worth seeing for Minnelli and the musical parts.3.5 / 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visible flaws, but hard to shake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maximillian (Helmut Grier) says at one point in the film that Sally Bowles (Liza Minelli) is like a charming child, but he "is always relieved when she is taking her nap." That nicely sums up my reaction on seeing _Cabaret_ again after 30 years. Minelli's performance is incredible but overpowering, and I'm relieved when she's off screen. The affair between Brian and Sally is a bit of a strain as well, but only because it is frustrating and slightly unbelievable. Minelli, to her credit, makes her character's ambivalence obvious, but York, though a good actor, plays it too straight, showing neither the reasonable doubt nor the required level of intentional denial (especially for a character who, for a bookish Cambridge student, is both remarkably perceptive of Sally's playacting and bold in his contempt of Nazism) necessary to make us believe that he's as caught up in this faux romance as the script requires him to be. There are other flaws as well. The music strains believability, as it is obviously scored for and played by a much larger ensemble than the one shown on screen. Unlike most others, I found the "Tomorrow Belongs to Me" sequence to be beautifully shot and edited but embarrassingly obvious. It's as if someone thought that the film had better make it clear to the densest of viewers that Nazis Are A Bad Thing. Finally, the VHS I saw was cropped, worn, and badly transfered; DVD viewing seems mandatory.Little of this matters in the end, though, as _Cabaret_ is so bold, well-structured, well-performed, and arresting that the flaws fade quickly from memory. Even on the awful print I saw the lighting is incredible and the editing exciting, and Minelli's over-the-top musical performance beats doubts into submission faster than a bunch of Brown Shirts after a night of elbow-bending. Fosse is equally overpowering: never a subtle director (which is usually to his credit), but always a subtle choreographer. The image of the blank faced "Cabaret Girls", swinging their out-thrust pelvises back and forth in doubletime while staring dead-eyed at the audience, sets the chill of the movie in the first five minutes, and that chill never leaves. Joel Grey, as the evil MC, threatens that the girls may take off their clothes; if they did, it would be like a striptease of corpsesSee it on DVD, and don't turn off your brain. It's worth all of the criticism and the praise it has received.</fullReview>

Having stated that, I would like to add that this is a rare addition to the musical genre in that it is not a musical comedy, rather a musical drama. It also very cleverly takes us through the advent of Nazi-ism in Germany, while centering on the lives of the primary characters. Anyone who has seen Chicago should see this film as well, as it will show the former film's inspiration - only with less flash. --Shelly</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cabaret is famous as the film that made Liza Minelli an international star. The choreography of the Berlin night club routines is exceptional, but the film is also an extraordinary evocation of pre-war Germany and, unusually, helps to explain the allure of Nazism in an age of enormous flux and decadence. The idealistic renditioning of The Horst Wessel song by Nazi youths is a particularly memorable example. There is a pervading sense of both menace and unreality as more and more of the leading characters become entwined in each others' lives. But then there is always the club...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the years since "Cabaret" came out, Liza Minnelli has pretty much become a joke, but she does quite well here as Sally Bowles, the airhead cabaret singer in 1931 Berlin who doesn't notice the Nazis taking over. Michael York is also good as gay Brit Brian Roberts (listen to what he says about her body). But the really neat character is Joel Grey's androgynous Master of Ceremonies. More than just a "musical", one can certainly see how the Nazis were taking over, especially with the man singing "The World is Mine".On a few other topics, the book "Non Campus Mentis: World History According to College Students" says: "Cat berets were a favorite form of German entertainment at this time." Also, someone wrote a book alleging that Hitler was gay. Robin Williams says that it was obvious, what with the Sieg Heil and all the leather.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Succeeds as a Musical, But Fails as a Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very stylish look at pre-war Germany. Dramatic stories are spliced in with music numbers done at a slightly seedy, slightly bawdy cabaret club. The songs and dances are visually fun to look at and have just the right amount of sensuality and theatrics. In many ways they look like an obvious inspiration to the later hit CHICAGO. Grey is amazing. He has no speaking lines and yet gives a very unique one of kind performance. His presence is distinguished and really gives the film it's unique flavor and personality. It's best seen to be really understood. The stories though between the songs seem awfully trite. There is nothing really profound or interesting about them. They tend to just bog the whole thing down. They also seem to make Germans look uniformly dopey. Minnelli won the academy award, but it is hard to see why. Yes she certainly does command the stage when she is singing and dancing, but she seems completely misplaced for the setting. It's almost like THE STERILE CUCKOO goes to Germany. Her kookiness and insecurity seems like just more of the same stuff we have already seen from her. One really can't sympathize with her nor really wants too. It becomes overdone and seems to push the viewers patience. Having her paired with refined English teacher York helps...a little. Yet their romance seems hard to believe. Having this educated, good looking man become jealous every time she talks to another man seems even more unnatural. Technically it is sound with a good eye for detail. Yet dramatically it falters. It's just not strong enough to be anything more than a slight diversion. The only interesting scene is when a young clean cut teen wearing a Nazi uniform gets up and sings a very impassioned pro German song. It perfectly illustrates visually all the rampant nationalism and brain washing that went on and is both creepy and sad at the same time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bob Fosse you Bastard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The manic pixie dream girl's manifesto/what Bob Fosse thought about Nazis. We follow the befuddled Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli) as parallel to the rise of Hitler. Sex and booze are pretty well enjoyed in Berlin, 1931 and Nazis are, thus far, a joke of organization spouting "tripe" to be ignored.Fosse seems at first to be only focused on the melodrama of an annoying foursome. A first date is in front of anti-communist posters. Second dance number interlaced with a Jew being beat up. First fight between secondary couple and two Nazi youth members drops a dead dog on their doorstep. Each personal drama is surmounted by a gain in society by the Nazi party. Sally herself is nothing short of a 20 year old version of the crazy old bat Miss Minnelli we have all come to know and in sitcoms the last decade over. But here she is "an underage femme fatale," complete with a shapeless body and Josephine Baker haircut. Her lover Brian Roberts (Michael York, you know him as the old mentor of Austin Powers) is stuffy and British. Secondary characters include the bi-curious Maximillian, worrisome rapist Fritz and na?ve darling Natalia. Yes folks, if ever you've wondered "will rape win me the girl?" you now have your answer: "of course! Especially if it's a vulnerable Jew."There's some bad over-dubbing in a little boat scene which I can only imagine makes Fosse roll in his grave with aggravation to this day. Luckily, for my devout love of Fosse, everything else is characteristically perfect: shot composition, editing, color pallet are all polished. Themes are tightly controlled in the sets, writing and music. It really is unfortunate that three of the four main characters are so heinously annoying.Easily the best thing about the film, though, is the cabaret host. He is our narrator, and bookends. He lets us know what's going on behind Minnelli's uber annoying presence. His androgynous and mime-ish expression is delightful as he sings the narration of the film in a super fake German accent. He lets in Fosse's signature surreal conduit to his true message: the Nazis were bad for hurting Jews, sure, but REALLY they were bad for shutting down the clubs and doing away with drag queens and everything that is fun. PS. Liza Minnelli won Best Actress for this. Just because she's Judy Garland's awkward daughter doesn't mean she should go around getting credit for exemplifying infuriation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>8 Oscars ? Hmmm...well, I just don't get it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is set in Belin beginning in 1931. Despite the rapid rise of Fascism, you would never know it inside the bawdy cabaret where much of the movie is set. Here, it is all laughter and gaiety--no sign of the coming war. The apparent stars of this show are Joel Grey (a master of ceremonies who has no other role in the film) and Liza Minelli (an incredibly screwed up American singer and dancer). The utter banality of the cabaret as well as Liza's personal life are a deliberate counter-point to the seriousness of the day. Despite antisemitism running amok, Liza is oblivious to it all--living her hollow and self-indulgent life. How she screws it up and the bizarre relationships she has are makes up about half the film and the rest consists of song and dance numbers. In many ways, it's like two totally separate films fused together.Surprisingly, I found I enjoyed the non-musical portion much more. Liza plays a fascinating character--a perfect film example of a borderline personality. This personality disorder is typified by love-hate relationships, self-absorption, self-destructive behaviors, magical thinking and an inability to accept that they are not the center of the universe. It's obvious that the writers had worked with some mental health professionals to nail this so well. While not fun to watch (after all, who wants to watch a self-absorbed idiot?), it was fascinating. Some of Liza's odd and self-absorbed behaviors included sexual relationships with gay and bisexual men which are destined to fail, extreme promiscuity, alcohol abuse, shallowness and magical thinking. Sadly, in some ways this sounds a bit like Ms. Minelli's real life, though I do wish her the best in her recovery.As for the rest of the cast, they were mostly there for Minelli's character to play off of. Yes, Michael York and others are there, but most of the reason seems to be to provide texture to Minelli's life as well as to provide SOME semblance of normalcy. They see that Germany is slowly descending to Hell, but Liza's character is simply oblivious.CABARET is a very good film, that I won't argue. But for the film to have garnered eight Oscars--that I find very hard to understand. Now it's true that many of these were for musical or set design awards, but still the film doesn't seem that exceptional. Perhaps I am just missing something or perhaps it's because I've seen other films about the Nazi period in Germany that just seemed better. Or, perhaps it's because I preferred the parts of the film where they were NOT singing--for as a musical, it's songs aren't all that memorable. Aside from the rather annoying "Money Makes the World Go Around" and "Cabaret", most people would have a hard time remembering the songs that play such a prominent role in the film.Also, while I do agree that Minelli deserved the Oscar for her demanding performance, I was very surprised to see Joel Grey get one as well. Yes, he did also work hard, but he really had no lines at all in the film--everything he did was singing and dancing and clowning around on stage. With no life beyond the stage, it's very surprising that he won. I assume that part of this was because with three nominees for Best Supporting Actor from THE GODFATHER, the three actors split their votes--allowing the unusual performance by Grey to grab the trophy. I know Grey can act, as he's been amazing in other roles, but here he just sings, dances and acts bizarre---an odd choice for the award.Overall, while this was a very interesting film, I didn't particularly enjoy it. I know MANY disagree with me and they may be right, but given my tastes I just didn't care for the film. In fact, had the film not improved in the second half, I probably wouldn't have finished watching.A final note to parents. This is a VERY adult film with lots of sexual content and frank discussions about homosexuality and abortion. Think twice before showing it to the kids!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Film has the widest range of abstraction of any art. You can have `real' things, you can have `imaginary' things, you can have real people doing imaginary things. You can, in fact have dozens of types of `folds' of interesting relationships between elements IN the performance and the act of giving the performance. Musicals are natural for this kind of folding, especially the `Moulin Rouge' kind of musical. That was an extreme exercise in overlaying one abstraction on another and then flattening them: book, absinthe vision, outer play, inner play. The anachronisms of the songs stretched the levels in other directions.Here we have the absolute simplest musical folding: there is never an overlay between the world of the story and the world of the performance within. The two are kept straight for the most part. All the songs are on a stage within the story. So we have two amusements here: the first is a rather simple story about an aimless life as it wanders through sexual exploitations and confusions in a hostile world. The second is the stage act itself, which is presented to us more or less as it was/is presented to the German audience of the 30s. The brilliance of the film is supposed to be the superposition of these. Some of this works, for instance Minelli's `acting' is a collection of stage movements and we never really register whether we are watching a stylized reality or a `real' reality in which a person has chosen to be stylized (a la Holly Golightly) in order to survive.But other elements of this are shockingly ineffective. The basic appeal comes from our enjoyment of watching the show, but this is at the same time we are repeatedly and bluntly shown that watchers of this sort of thing are less human, less real themselves, because of it. Another dimension: Nazism spread largely because of its theatrical trappings, a path long blazed by the decadent tradition we see here -- the Berlin stage made Hitler possible, just as it previously (and still does in the UK) `performed' the country in terms of its elite. We sense this, we can't avoid it since the point of the enterprise is to raise the issue the other way: politics into the play. But it is glossed over in a way that makes willing conspirators of us.How far we have come, from this unintegrated sorting out of the mechanics of performance to what we have now with the recent `Rouge' and `Chicago.'Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very much of its period</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That period being, of course, the early 1970s. Here, Liza Minnelli gets the Barbra Streisand treatment from Bob Fosse - right down to the fingernails - and becomes a big movie star by essentially playing herself - or, to be more precise, the "Liza" character she'd already been honing in her nightclub act for several years. Everyone else just fills in the scenery. Whether you love it or hate it depends very much on how you take Minnelli and her frenetic, arm-waving style - and how appalling you find Fosse's choreography, which was already entering its drill-team, fingers-snapping-in-unison final period. Some things please endlessly. Some, unfortunately, just date.The passable Weimar-pastiche songs of Kander and Ebb and the leering, "decadent" Kit Kat Club MC and his orchestra of doxies can't hide the fact that the whole conception is pure candy-cane American Entertainment. The subplot about the meet-cute couple played by Marissa Berenson and Fritz Wepner is pretty bland, and the movie's attempts at seriousness vis a vis the Nazi threat are ham-fisted and obvious. (Just because they're "Serious" doesn't mean we have to take them seriously.) The relationship between Sally Bowles and Michael York's Isherwood stand-in is more interesting, given the sexual politics of the early years of the post-Stonewall era, but only up to a point. Is it really so much of a surprise that "Brian" has slept with the rich Maximilian, I wonder, when we already know that he's sleeping with Sally, who's done up more or less like a drag queen in every scene? I suspect some of the trouble has to do with Jay Presson Allen's script, with its typically telegraphed Big Points, rather than with Fosse, who was trying to transpose a musical to film in an imaginative way. I suspect also that without Minnelli, there wouldn't be much to look at, and the pretentiousness of the original musical would just be lying there in painfully plain view. With her, however, it's all her show - if that's your pleasure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Music, Vapid Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film looks at the lives of an American cabaret performer and a British writer in 1931 Berlin as the Nazis are coming into power. The musical numbers, which are confined to a nightclub, are excellent, brimming with energy. Most of the film, however, is devoted to the vapid love life of Minnelli and York, and it is not very interesting. Minnelli performs with gusto, but she and York have no chemistry and their relationship is not believable. They become the best of friends hours after meeting. While Fosse gets credit for the musical numbers, what was the Academy thinking in giving him the Best Director Oscar over Francis Ford Coppola for "The Godfather?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What an interesting contrast to its stage version...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh whoopie, look at this- I get 100th comment.Right... my original interaction with this movie was last May (2005) when I was given a CD of various Broadway songs... one of them being the revival (1998) version of the song "Cabaret," from "Cabaret" of course...So when a production of the show came to my city this last month, I was eager to see such. I adored the show, and a week later I had the soundtrack to the 1998 revival.Well you know, I couldn't exactly see the show every night, and my friend had told me how strangely different than the play the movie was, so of course I had to see it.This was a VERY WEIRD remake.I see that people have already picked up that "Married" was left out... but the thing is that it isn't just "Married" (at one point, we can also hear a record of "It Couldn't Please Me More" and "Sitting Pretty"), but the entire plot line between Fraulein Schneider and Herr Shulz was left out.In the play, these two are humongous characters, and very good characters might I add. These two are completely dropped. In the play, Max is hardly a character, but in the movie he's humongous.However, I am not saying that this was a BAD remake- but a very odd one; and so much different than the play! I could babble on and on about this, but I do have other things to get to.VERY inappropriate as well- the film has been rated PG, which surprises me, for "A Chorus Line" (which came out not much later) was rated PG-13, and this was much worse. In short, don't let your children come anywhere near it.Ooh gawed, hated Sally's hair.The styles of Sally Bowles were atrocious; whereas in the play they were a bit unappealing, but not as exaggerated as in this version.One thing I'm quite surprised I haven't commented on- I was very bummed by the amount of the Master of Ceremonies bits they took out... the Emcee was one of my very favorite characters in the play, and yet his part was so much smaller in the movie...However, this is not to say I am not impressed with this- as an original idea picked up from a very impressive play, I am quite fine with it. However, as a remake of a play, it is terrible.If you haven't seen the play, and you're ready for an extremely ironic, dark, somehow amusing, extremely disturbing movie, go ahead- watch Cabaret.If you've seen the play and want to see it again, don't expect it of this movie version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bowled Under</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the kindest things to be said about this are 1) that it has been over-hyped and 2) it has dated badly. Watching in 2005 (courtesy of a free DVD inserted into a newspaper) a movie made in 1972 is, of course, fraught with built-in problems. This is true of any movie yet some - the Judy Garland vehicles Meet Me In St Louis and A Star Is Born for ironic example - wear their age well and make it easy for the 21st century viewer to appreciate what all the 20th century fuss was about and others, like this one fail, alas, to preserve whatever magic they possessed at the time. The score is serviceable certainly and Kander and Ebb have contrived to create words and music redolent of the tinny harshness that characterized Weill and Brecht who WERE actually writing words and music at the time that Cabaret is set. The overall success of replicating authentic 30s German music is negated by the insertion of Maybe This Time, written especially for both the movie and specifically Liza Minelli, a favourite performer of the composers, and both song and delivery reek of a much later decade and another country. The casting of Michael York doesn't help; another honors graduate of the giant Redwood School of Acting he would have been okay playing against someone less flamboyant and manic than Minelli and with alternative casting the overall effect might have been less like a clash between a Dutch Elm on its last legs and a Mexican Jumping Bean. It IS watchable, but only just.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Settles For Being Okay, if Even That</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cabaret had the capacity to be a great and wonderful movie and settled for being only okay. The music is very good as is the artistic aspect such as the makeup, costume design, and art direction. The acting is mostly pretty good and although the direction isn't nothing special it also isn't particularly inept. The film fails I think mostly because it never has any real concentration on anything. I wanders around looking for something to focus in on, or a plot. It has several other flaws that come from the big one like the fact that they never bother to create any character development, or to give us any good dialogue. Cabaret misses out in so many big places that even the many small ones it gets right can't bring it back to life, making it of course fail, but not horribly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just so-so.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I can never cease to wonder how Bob Fosse beat FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA (for THE GODFATHER) for Best Director in 1973. It's a travesty, and Academy voters usually put into play politics more than actual deserve when making decisions (ie how did SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE beat SAVING PRIVATE RYAN for Best Picture in '99?) I thought the songs were excellent, and I applaud Bob Fosse's choice to exclude all songs (except TOMORROW BELONGS TO ME-which I must say was frightening in its context) that didn't take place in the Kit Kat Club. It always seems unnatural when a character bursts into song cooking dinner or reading a book. The songs themselves were also of top quality, especially WILKOMMEN, CABARET, and MONEY MAKES THE WORLD GO 'ROUND. They are executed with energy comparable to a stage production and the arrangements were superb. Fosse's choreography, fast-paced cinematography, and lighting almost transports the viewer to Broadway, combined with the "stage acting" method of over-exaggeration of Joel Grey. Liza Minelli was just okay. She never impressed me very much, especially because of her drug habits, and her haircut and makeup were very annoying and distracting. Michael York is not much of an actor and his character would've been better played by Michael Caine or Alec McCowen. Marisa Berenson was good though, too bad she didn't do much else after this besides Kubrick's BARRY LYNDON. Helmut Griem was also pleasant to watch, albeit his part was too small (he is introduced almost an hour into the film and disappears about forty minutes later and never resurfaces).Geoffrey Unsworth's cinematography was excellent, although not as good as Gordon Willis's for THE GODFATHER the same year. As Broadway musicals turned films, this one is just so-so. It lacks the bravura of FIDDLER ON THE ROOF and WEST SIDE STORY but is far superior to THE MUSIC MAN and GIGI. I suppose no Broadway musical can be as good on stage, and this film certainly does nothing to prove this theory wrong.In spite of these negative comments, I found the film to be enjoyable, although it could've been shortened by 20 minutes, and if released only a year later, it would've deserved the Oscars it won, plus Best Picture over THE STING and its director George Roy Hill, but it can't hold a candle to THE GODFATHER. It was pleasant, but nothing great. I rate it at about middle-of-the-road at 5 or 6 out of 10. Highlights: CABARET, WILKOMMEN, MONEY MAKES THE WORLD GO 'ROUND, TOMORROW BELONGS TO ME, Kit Kat Club scenes camerawork and choreography, Marisa Berenson, and Helmut Griem.I wouldn't strongly recommend it to anyone except devout Fosse or Minelli fans and musical lovers, but I would suggest watching it if you have nothing else to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What A Nonsense Of A Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: SPOILERS AHEADCabaret is a movie that doesn't know what it wants to be? on the whole, it's an otherwise generic love story, which wouldn't be so bad, if it weren't also trying to be a movie about pre-WWII German society in decadence, the rise of Nazism, and a statement about female independence. There are only two fully developed characters in the whole movie - Sally Bowles and Brian Roberts - that could be a good average if the movie weren't trying to tell the story of at least four other characters!Subplots come and go, and some just go nowhere, like Fritz's love for Natalia, a Jewish upper-class lady - and what purpose did it serve that rather brusque self-confession that he was Jewish, too? - or Sally's involvement with Maximilian?We see several examples of Nazism taking over Germany - like SS beating a man in alley, the Hitler Youth, etc.,- but it's just so superficial and hardly developed, like the filmmakers didn't want to bother with a story that would have been more interesting than Sally and Brian's relationship.It's not a bad movie per se: Liza Minnelli's performance is outstanding, although perhaps that's the only outstanding thing about this movie? or not; Joel Grey winning the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor over Al Pacino was an outstanding farce! Elements like the sets, choreography, the score, the costume design are pretty good, too, but as a story Cabaret fails.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done musical numbers but the story is only so-so and the comments of Nazism are just clumsy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sally Bowles is an aspiring actress who sings in a cabaret in early 1930's Berlin. She is fun loving and wild and befriends Englishman Brian Roberts when he comes to live in a room in the house she is staying in. As the friends become lovers, the rich Max von Heune also comes into their lives and threatens to divide the two. As the cabaret continues, the nature of Sally and Brian's relationship changes and the anti-Semitism and the Nazi party begin to rise in Germany.This film is on many professional critic's top 100 list and is also generally well regarded by most people so I thought I'd better finally get round to seeing it. While I think the film was enjoyable and worth seeing, it is far from the classic that time seems to have painted it as. The actual story doesn't really work that well even if the relationship dynamic makes it interesting. The fact that I didn't really like any of the main characters was a problem for me and it stopped me getting into their story as well. It is still enjoyable enough but not as engaging as I would have liked. The other threads of the film also distract from it despite one of them being better than the main narrative ? the cabaret numbers themselves.The musical numbers have a great sense of period to them and get the tone right ? naughty but not out and out crude like the modern equivalent can often be. They are cruelly funny and quite daring (not by today's standards but the film takes us back to their time) and fun to watch. If only there was anything good to say about the film's clumsy attempts to bring the rise of the Nazi's into it ? it doesn't do anything with this strand but it is obvious that is somehow meant to fit in rather than just be a background. The worst example of it is the man being beaten up while the camera cuts to a cheering audience ? how much more obvious can you get?The cast do well but the best roles are those around the cabaret performances simply because it is the strongest part of the film. Minnelli is good, as much as I hate to admit it. Her performance in the main narrative is good even if her character is difficult to like or really relate to ? but I won't deny her the praise for playing it well and for being good during the musical numbers. I suppose on the basis of her performance she deserved the Oscar, maybe all the more so for not having great material. Likewise Grey deserved his as he is great fun and very enjoyable in the film's best scenes. Without any musical numbers to help him out, York only has his character's story to work with and therefore delivers a rather unsure performance that doesn't work to the same degree that the material doesn't. Likewise Griem and Wepper (who appears almost annoyed with the plot he is lumbered with!). The stars of the film are the musical numbers and this is apparent from the Oscars going to those involved with them rather than the cast involved solely with the main narrative.Overall this is an enjoyable film but not a great one or anything approaching the requirements for me to call it a 'classic'. The actual story isn't as good as it needed to be and the background rise of Nazism is badly handled. Luckily the musical numbers hold it all together and keep the film interesting and enjoyable even if I must admit to be left feeling disappointed by how uninvolving the story and characters were.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Not a Near-Miss... It's a Complete Misfire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had no inkling of how popular this movie was until I picked up the DVD and saw how many awards it won (only one of which-- Joel Grey's Best Supporting Actor bologna-- was actually well-deserved). I had always assumed it was another musical lost in its time-- you know, one of the Jesus Christ Superstars of the day. But there's a difference: "Jesus Christ Superstar" is sensational, electrifying, and at times riveting. "Cabaret" is crap-aret.Liza Minnelli is terrible at just about everything, most especially acting. She's a fair singer, but on screen she means nothing. She brings absolutely no emotional weight to the role. After seeing how well the original Sally Bowles, Jill Haworth, could act (please see "Exodus"), it's a freak of nature that Minnelli beat her for the role. The entire film is like a punchline and it's all because of the leading lady, who has no rightful place in popular culture except the subject of catty jokes in shows like "Queer as Folk," "Queer Duck," and "Will &amp; Grace." Michael York is, was, and always will be great, but Minnelli actually succeeds in dragging him down to her level. He gave a better performance in the super-camp "Logan's Run," for crying out loud! The only good performance in this movie comes from Grey, who actually does astonishingly well ("astonishingly" considering the quality of his costars). But even his best efforts aren't enough to salvage the whole thing.As opposed to the fearlessly stylized visuals of his directorial debut, "Sweet Charity," Bob Fosse under-utilizes master cinematographer Geoffrey Unsworth. The film has no visual scope and even the exterior scenes are so dank and so poorly constructed cinematographically that they, too, look like they were shot in someone's basement.The only good song? "Mein Herr," a rare moment in Hollywood History when Minnelli's camera-centric sleazing actually works.Whatever you've heard about "Cabaret" from its proponents, don't listen. It'll drive you crazy. The film is terrible, visually glum and uninspired, poorly scripted, dismally acted, and shoddily slapped together, haphazard. For all the bad things people say about 1972's "Man of La Mancha," it doesn't pretend to be anything it's not. The worst crime of all? The awards "Cabaret" stole from "The Godfather," a true classic of American cinema.A note about my personal tastes: I *love* musicals. Seriously. Normally, the fact that a movie is a musical is enough to salvage it from a 1-out-of-ten rating in my book. But nothing can save this travesty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Did I NOT Miss This?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had no idea that cabaret was a loose translation of the words "really bad." Oh maybe I am just being a little too tough on this movie...nah. Typical of most major motion pictures made in the era - the 'star' always has to be some kind of a center-stage scene hog. Was this an adaptation of some Broadway jaunt? Silly me - of course it was. That being the case, I do not need to sit and watch the 'live-action' version - I am sure it is twice as long as twice as boring. Let's face it, I have no desire to waste money twice, just to end up comparing two "Cabarets" (oops two "really bads" I mean). Although I must backpedal a bit and be a little more truthful. I fell asleep for a good portion of this flick, so maybe I did miss the good part. To be safe, I have officially added "Cabaret" to my "not to see again" list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite brilliant, IMHO. No, I'm referring to my comments. The movie sucks.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading through some of the comments on this movie, I was struck by two things: 1) What, did only die-hard Minelli fans review this movie? That would explain the glowing reviews for this terrible movie. 2) How on Earth did Fosse beat Coppola for Best Director? The Godfather is an absolute joy to watch, and it's damn near impossible to find fault with it. Cabaret is torture from title to credits, and I don't think I have the energy to detail all the things wrong with it.But I will start with the biggest: Liza Minelli. Just goes to show you how good of an actor Michael York is to pretend to be in love with her (though she was the looker in her youth). The mascara alone in the movie is enough to scare away lesser men. She's ridiculously annoying in the role, and distracted from everything -- EVERYTHING -- else in the movie. If she weren't so concerned with being her mother, which she's never going to be, she might have been able to stop hamming it up for a bit.As for the film itself...maybe I was just watching a bad transfer, but I've seen copies of old home movies that look like they've been filmed on better quality material. The story's better told in the play version anyway. All in all it's just an awful, awful film. There are plenty of good movies about Germany's slide into the Third Reich (or would it kill you to watch an actual documentary?), and a piece of crap about some girlie bar holds no emotion, no point, and no actual value.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie was WEIRD!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, well I saw this one a couple months ago, and boy was I surprised..but not in a good way! I like Liza Minelli a lot, but seriously, this movie was really out there. Some of it was just plain disturbing. Those ugly men prancing around in wigs/lipstick/dresses was seriously nasty, I mean, maybe it was realistic, but if that's how grizzly reality was back then, I would have rather not seen it! And the underlying theme of the movie was that Life is a Cabaret, yea right! If life was really like that with all the dark undertones and weird twisted crap then I wouldn't be around anymore.I can appreciate the fact that they were addressing a serious issue, that being pre-Nazi Germany, and the songs of the movie did correspond to the events of the movie which was good. I can say that the movie was very artistic, and it can be appreciated for that, but it being what it was about, and what it was promoting, I just can't be OK with it overall. In conclusion, don't watch this movie unless you like WEIRD MOVIES!! If that's what you're looking for then go for it cuz it's perfect for you!</fullReview>
