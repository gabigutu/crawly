		<shortDescription>The Power Of Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A stunning outing for Tom Ford. The images are, clearly, out of an aesthete's mind without being shallow, ever. I believe there is a dramatic reason behind every frame. Colin Firth, looking truly handsome, goes through a day of torment with remarkable civility. I felt involved and shaken and couldn't help but make mine his pain. The flashbacks with Matthew Goode are truly vivid and truthful. This is a step forward in explaining through images that love is love no matter who you are, where you come from or what your circumstances are. It could have been a man and a woman, the fact that it's a man and a man is almost irrelevant. We recognize the feel of it and Colin Firth's performance is the magic stroke that makes that not only possible but natural. It is a sensational debut for fashion star Tom Ford. True to himself an artist that promises great, wonderful things for the future. I can't wait.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Isherwood, Ford and Firth, not necessarily in that order</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A startling surprise. Tom Ford's debut as a director tells, in exquisite images, a very personal story, based on a short story by Christopher Isherwood. What makes everything fly so high is a fantastic performance by Colin Firth. I've followed Colin Firth career from the very beginning "Tumbledown", "Another Country", "Apartment Zero" where he creates a character never seen on the screen before or since, "Pride and Prejudice" where he reinvented D'Arcy's character, "Fever Pitch" where he showed a new face in riveting tragicomic strokes. So I should have been prepared for something new and special and maybe I was but the effect his performance in "A Single Man" had on me was (is) totally unexpected. It changed my perception of things, it made me look inwards and think of things I had put aside. I can't wait to see it again. I saw the look of love and that look remains knocking in my mind as if to keep me awake and aware. Tom Ford takes enormous visual risks in the telling of his story. It may work for some, some others will certainly dismiss or ridicule. I, for one, stand up and applaud.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Colin Firth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Ford's debut has an immediate effect and an after effect. We are taken immediately by the "preciousness" of the image. Limpid, exquisite and slightly detached. The after effect is a whole other story. Colin Firth's face comes to haunt you. His pain and his deep period of reflection has a powerful, contagious effect. Colin Firth creates a character that contains a doses of his D'Arcy of Pride and Prejudice and a pinch of his Adrian LeDuc of Apartment Zero but the rest is totally inedited. His middle age man that spends a day drowning in a memory that tortures him has a resonance that touches countless personal memories. Love without other implications, because love is all there is. I applauded until my hands hurt when I found out that Firth had won the Copa Volpi at the 2009 Venice Film Fest for this role. This was so richly deserved. I doubt I'll see a better performance this year. Bravo!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinema doesn't get much better than this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I attended the North American Premiere of "A Single Man" at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. This is the first foray into film for esteemed fashion designer Tom Ford, directing from his own script based on the Christopher Isherwood novel. In a word, "A Single Man" is a triumph.It is easily one of the most Oscar-deserving films of the year. Colin Firth's performance screams "Best Actor" (which he did win at the Venice Film Festival), Julianne Moore is exquisite, and Nicholas Hoult (About a Boy, Skins) is on his way to stardom. I was simply awestruck.The curtain rises on a despondent George (Firth) having lost his longtime partner. Sapped of energy and will, he struggles to wake each day and function as the brilliant college professor he's expected to be. Few notice the change in him, but one student sees George as a magnet pulling him forward to a place even he doesn't understand. Kenny (Hoult) seems to glow like an angel in George's dark world and, yet, is a puzzle and presents a challenge which he doesn't necessarily want to confront at this stage in his life. As is his custom, he turns to Charlotte (Moore) for a warm shoulder but the temperature drops amidst the chill surrounding George's bleak existence.Everything about this film -- the look, colors, pacing, shots, composition, cinematography, costumes, soundtrack -- says that an extraordinary amount of love and care went into it. Special mention to director of photography Eduard Grau and editor Joan Sobel for their keen abilities to work lockstep with Ford in projecting his vision onto the screen. Abel Korzeniowski's score is haunting and moving. Despite his design genius, Ford was generous enough to entrust costume designer Arianne Phillips with the freedom to work unencumbered. Production designer Dan Bishop, with art direction by Ian Phillips and set decorator Amy Wells, created two worlds -- a cold, stark one in which George sees only hopelessness, and another warm, colorful one in which he has hope.What stays with the viewer, though, is the enigmatic friendship between George and Kenny. Nicholas Hoult is absolutely mesmerizing in this. The way Ford shot him made people gasp. He's lit, framed, and shot like an Adonis. Of course, that's the idea here. This will definitely be a break out role for the 19-year-old. The camera loves him, and it's a pretty daring performance.Most of all, this is a tour de force for Firth and a stunning achievement which is destined to be a highlight of his distinguished career. The range of emotions and the extent to which his character must convey them through his eyes and facial expressions, with the copious use of long takes without dialogue, left me wide-eyed with wonder.This is the stuff of great movies. They don't get much better than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Single Man In Venice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the films I saw at the 66 Venice Film Festival, 12 in all, "A Single Man" is the one that stayed with me. I must admit, it wasn't love at first sight. My first reaction was a sort of rebellion against, what I felt was "far too beautiful" and slightly cold. But now, days after, the mood and guts of the film come back to my mind as if asking me to see it again. I will, as soon as possible. Behind the apparent stillness of the film there is a torrent of emotions and Colin Firth is at the very center of it. A day of grieving for a man who lived his life within a perfectly color coordinated world, coordinated in every sense of the word until death comes unexpectedly to turn everything upside down. I couldn't help but remember another Firth creation "Apartment Zero" (1988) where the color coordination of that character was gray, zero and the hinting of color coming into his life turned his world upside down. I loved and adored that performance and "A Single Man" reminds me, not so much for its similarities but for its differences. It's actually forcing me to go out and search all of Colin Firth's work I've missed. I also believe that Tom Ford, a living fashion icon, is here to stay as a filmmaker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Colin's George and Adrian</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen "A Single Man" twice already at different screenings and I believe I will see it again and again. Yes, for me is one of those films. Thank you Tom Ford and thank you Colin Firth. I love Colin and my favorite performance of his dates back to 1989 "Apartment Zero". George Falconer, Colin's character in "A Single Man" seems to me the flip side of Adrian Leduc, Colin's character in "Apartment Zero". George has had a real life and grieves the death of his companion. Adrian Leduc never had a companion and his grief is based on his total inability to connect with people. George believes that human connection is at the center of everything and puts that thought into practice. Adrian worships James Dean, George doesn't think that much of James Dean, he actually says it. Adrian wears white shirts made of cheap material and he launders them himself. George wears impeccably cut white shirts that he has professionally laundered. They seem tiny details but they become overwhelming when you know both characters. George even hurts himself and wears a band aid just like Adrian during the last 15 minutes of "Apartment Zero" I love Colin Firth because he's an actor that can give you so much doing, seemingly, so little. It compel us to participate and include our own thoughts and feelings. The love of George for his lover is as pungent and real as anything I've ever seen on the screen. It is a cinematic triumph and as I'm writing about it I feel a sort of urge to see it again, just as it happened to me when I saw "Apartment Zero" for the first time. I felt then that Colin deserved an Oscar nomination for Adrian, he will get it for George. This is the first comment I ever wrote and it comes out of a profound need to share this emotion. When movies can do that, film lovers all over the world have real reason to celebrate and I'm celebrating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a powerful movie revolving around a remarkable performance by Colin Firth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never cried so quickly in a movie. Literally, I was ten minutes into the film and my eyes began welling up. It's a beautiful and gut-wrenching love story, with a surprising yet bittersweet ending. Yes, this film is not a "happy-feel-good" production, and, yes, you may very well leave the theatre pondering the validity of the relationships in your own life, but that's the point. When you get past the "artsy" cinematography, in essence, it is a story of love, loss and self-reliance that we call all relate to. This film is certainly not for those who enjoy the action and adrenaline packed blockbusters of the recent past. But if you are in the mood for a thought-provoking and dramatic plot-line, sprinkled with the brilliance of Colin Firth and his co-stars, and a rather large pinch of Tom Ford, you will not regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A role tailor-made for Colin Firth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Tom Ford at the helm, the very least you'd expect from his adaptation of Christopher Isherwood's novel is a parade of gorgeous men in well-cut suits. Certainly there's enough Kennedy-era period detail here to satisfy the most ardent fan of Mad Men (and an uncredited voice cameo from Jon Ham). But the meticulously edited trailer gives no hint of the warmth and humour that underscore this potentially bleak meditation on love and loss.The action takes place over the course of just one day (and night) -- 30 November 1962 -- in the life of handsome, middle-aged college professor George (Colin Firth). Like his friend, neighbour and one-time lover Charley (Julianne Moore), George is an expat in LA. He has a good job and a well-appointed home in a picture-perfect suburban street, but since the death of his long-term lover Joe (Matthew Goode) a few months earlier, George has been going through the motions. Now today it appears that he is putting his affairs in order, with a view to ending it all.I must confess that I never swooned over Colin Firth's Mr Darcy back in the 90s and I've found it increasingly hard to relate to the repressed, lovelorn and frankly lumpen Englishmen he often plays. But here he's a revelation. As George's day unfolds, a series of reveries -- erotic, nostalgic, humorous and sad -- reveal the man behind the immaculately suited exterior. Whether perched on the loo wryly observing his neighbours, lavishing praise on a bemused secretary, or enduring a discourse on bomb shelters from a colleague (Lee Pace), Firth shows a welcome lightness of touch. He's tender and tolerant as Moore's gin-sodden hostess berates him for his inability to be the (heterosexual) man she needs. And his obsessive-compulsive fumbling with a gun and a sleeping bag are hilarious.Moore expertly conveys the fragility and hopelessness of a woman once married and once feted for her looks, who is now staring into the abyss through the bottom of a bottle of Tanqueray's. It reminded me of some of her best work -- in Safe, Boogie Nights and The Hours -- and made me wish she'd stop wasting her talent playing second fiddle to the likes of Nicolas Cage and Samuel L Jackson. It's a film in which the camera restlessly prowls in search of physical perfection: in the well-tended gardens of George's neighbourhood; the piercing blue eyes of flirtatious student Kenny (Nicholas Hoult); and the chiselled looks of Goode's doomed lover. But the script, co-written by Ford and David Scearce, ensures that this never descends into pastiche or glossy melodrama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A genuinely pleasant surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved Isherwood's novel (it's a novel, not a short story as a previous poster claimed) ever since it appeared back in 1964, to scathing reviews. Gay love wasn't taken seriously back then. Stonewall was five years away. But Isherwood was always his own man. Over the years I've mentioned the book to gay filmmakers, several of whom knew it and liked it. But all were chary of adapting a stream-of-consciousness narrative to the screen. That Tom Ford (of all people) has taken it on and done so well by it is rather astonishing. Yes, being the Fashion God that he is the film looks lovely. But it isn't all "look." Ford really understands what Isherwood was driving at. And while casting an actor as great as Colin Firth is a logical production decision, knowing what to do with him requires real talent. And Ford has talent by the ton. Matthew Goode is lovely. Nicholas Hoult a real surprise -- especially if you know him only for "About a Boy." And Julianne Moore is perfect as always. So much better (and more important) than "Brokeback Mountain."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Colin Firth and Julianne Moore shine (as usual) in Tom Ford's brilliant directorial debut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Ford, you surprised me. I don't really follow the fashion world too closely at all, so although I naturally knew his name, I wasn't familiar with his creations. I haven't read the Christopher Isherwood novel (yet), so Colin Firth and Julianne Moore were the ones who actually got me excited for this project. And I wasn't disappointed ? it actually exceeded all my expectations, and alongside Jane Campion's "Bright Star" (which unfortunately is being almost completely overlooked this awards season), it's the most poetic 2009 film I have seen so far.Firth, always elegant and fascinating, plays George Falconer, a British professor in 1960's Los Angeles trying to cope with the death of his long-term partner, Jim (Matthew Goode). It's been eight months since Jim's death, and George decided to end his life by the end of the day ? and it's this day we see in this admirable film. George spends time with his best friend Charley (the always wonderful Julianne Moore), with whom he had something in the past (and still has hopes of winning him over again), and now is an unhappy divorcée. A young pupil, Kenny (Nicholas Hoult, who has grown up a lot since "About a Boy" and "The Weather Man"), who clearly is infatuated with George, harasses him until he finally gives him the attention he craves. These two different encounters will be decisive for George. As sad as the overall tone and the theme of mourning can be, "A Single Man" is by no means depressing. Ford uses and abuses of "artsy", but very efficient and intriguing camera angles, and a classy score by Polish composer Abel Korzeniowski. Eyes, lips are shown in evidence throughout the film, and naturally, the costumes are all superb. George's long day's journey reminds me a lot of Virginia Woolf's classic "Mrs. Dalloway". Marleen Gorris was able to do a correct but somewhat cold adaptation of Woolf's novel in 1997 (scripted by Woolf scholar and talented actress Eileen Atkins, featuring the magnificent Vanessa Redgrave in the title role), but I thought she wasn't much to blame for the film's coldness since that's one of the most complex novels to be translated to the screen. After seeing "A Single Man", I even dare to say Tom Ford could do an interesting and very personal adaptation of "Mrs. Dalloway". Also, this is one of the sexiest films since Alfonso Cuaron's "Y Tu Mama Tambien" (2001) and Bernardo Bertolucci's "The Dreamers" (2003), and Nicholas Hoult's incandescent presence has a lot to do with that. He gives an efficient, brave performance for an actor his age, and although I'm sure Jamie Bell ("Billy Elliot"), who was the first choice for the role, would've been terrific, Hoult doesn't disappoint. It's not every day we're given a film with such emotional intensity and exuberant sensuality, and "A Single Man" proves that Tom Ford is certainly a promising director, having given us not just a great first film, but one also one of the year's finest and most unusual creations. A film to be felt and celebrated, and I can't wait for the DVD - it's a keeper. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A glossy, muted 'Brokeback'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As his directorial debut designer Tom Ford has made a highly accomplished, lushly -- a little too lushly -- beautiful film about a gay man struggling with tragedy -- the recent death of his lover. The story, from Christopher Isherwood's elegantly simple novel of the same name, set in 1962, concerns an Englishman living in Los Angeles, a professor of literature, who, in Ford's version, lives in unreal splendor. He is like a Fifties fantasy of tasteful bachelorhood. His house resembles a Frank Lloyd Wright masterpiece. He has an immaculately ordered wardrobe housed in a beautiful wooden dressing room. He drives a lean, classic Mercedes hardtop two-seater. Most elegant of all, he is a suave Colin Firth, whose understated suffering is tempered with good manners and restraint. Sweeping string music takes us back and forth between the present, as George Falconer (Firth) goes bravely through the day, and a halcyon past when he savored perfect moments with his lost companion of sixteen years, Jim (Matthew Goode, the movie 'Brideshead's' Charles Rider), a handsome young American met romantically outside a seaside bar wearing Navy whites, now dead in a car accident on a trip to visit family. It's all too exquisite in its sweet sadness, and George's friend Charley (Julianne Moore), a boozy divorcée, also English, also lonely, lives in another kind of equally glamorous dream house, the glitzy overdecorated kind, a fitting showcase for a woman whose expensive clothes, beehive hair and elaborate makeup accompany a grand manner. And though George is inconsolable, and his life now -- the story recounts only one day of it -- has been reduced to just going through the motions, he seems to be offered some choice opportunities to forget his troubles. He's being relentlessly stalked by a fresh-faced and pretty young male student called Kenny (Nicholas Holt, the BBC "Skins" star, like Goode actually English but playing American) who might be any gay teacher's fantasy. Coming out of a liquor store George encounters a to-die-for young Spaniard, Carlos (Jon Kortajarena, a former Ford model) a dreamy Mediterranean James Dean with a Castilian accent who's ready to jump into the Mercedes and into bed. These scenes are all in the novel, though one imagines George in casual tweeds and all the accouterments so splendidly on view are less significant in the book than what simply happens. Sometimes in this film the visuals completely take over.Even George's suicide preparations are nice to look at, as well as genteel -- the way he's received politely by name at the bank when withdrawing valuables and arranges important papers and keys on the floor for people to find, leaving a handsome wad of cash for his irreplaceable Latina housekeeper. Charley is a great friend; her invitation to dinner t?te-?-t?te at her place causes George to put off self-immolation for a few hours and they share a discreet drunk together and have a wonderful laugh dancing the twist. This sequence is superbly done and Julianne Moore, an American playing a Brit, does some of her best acting ever. If it feels overdone, on the other hand Ford's film is unquestionably cinematic in the way it drenches experience and memory in inter-cut images, and what could be more 1960 gay than remembering a beach scene with one's lover as if it had been photographed in black and white by the German Thirties sensualist Herbert List?Even though it's a mite too gorgeous and glossy, this is an admirable and in some ways quite wonderful film, and that's because its emotions, however muted, seem real. Designer Tom Ford would not be expected to do things inelegantly. Gay man Tom Ford would not be expected to cast any but the most delicious young men. (Colin Firth isn't young, but his performance provides us with the richest depiction of an older gay man in film since John Schlesinger's Sunday Bloody Sunday.) If Ford overdoes the poshness, he doesn't distort or satirize the period. Though this is an immaculate world -- even a pesky little boy with a toy pistol is perfectly turned out -- there is real, believable suffering. George has his 'Brokeback' moment, a flashback scene of the time eight months earlier when he got the phone call informing him, belatedly and with the unspeakable buttoned-down cruelty of the straight world of that era, of his longtime lover's death. If Colin Firth doesn't get an Oscar nomination on the basis of this scene alone, but also for all the richly modulated moments throughout the film, Hollywood will have performed another of its 'Brokeback' travesties -- proving that it only pretends to be gay-friendly but when it comes to hard truths prefers to look away. Because there's a lot of hard truth behind the gloss, about the "invisible" minorities George speaks of to his literature class on Huxley's 'After Many a Summer Dies the Swan,' about how it is to grab private happiness from a world of meanness, and about hedonism. Isherwood knew whereof he spoke, and Tom Ford, working with David Scearce on the screenplay, gets those parts absolutely right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life and Its Suffering Do Go On</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Loneliness and loss frame the movie A Single Man. George's life partner Jim dies in a car accident. George has lost his world and contemplates suicide while everyone around him is fearful that their world will end, too, during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis.George's flashbacks with Jim focus on their personalities, rather than on their sex, unlike so many other movies of today, where "making love" predominates "love". Yet the emphasis centers on their good times together - almost too good to be true. Herein lies a paradox, because if it really was so, then George had a better life than most of us, and frankly, it's difficult to feel too sorry for him. Get on with your life, buddy, and be thankful for what you had!On the other hand, after an emotionally arousing but apparently nonsexual encounter with Kenny (here again the theme of love versus making love), George puts away his gun and burns his letters of goodbye, only to then suffer a fatal heart attack. In his dying moments he reunites with his beloved Jim, but we can only speculate whether it's merely reveries or authentic life after death. The credits roll at this point, so we need also wonder about Kenny's state of mind when he finds George's body. Life and its suffering do go on.The film's advertising is slightly misleading in that George is shown lying next to Charley, his woman friend with whom he had a past relationship. Sure, this is designed to attract straight viewers, but anyone hungry for psychologically rather than sexually mature scenes between a man and woman will find it here.We are born single and usually die alone. A Single Man dramatizes our loneliness in a powerful and literally haunting way. I seriously recommend watching this film alone to let it capture you in its rumination.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unbearable Portrait of Grief</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Colin Firth plays George Falconer, an English Literature teacher who wakes up ready to commit suicide. For the past eight months, George has been grieving the death of his lover, Jim, for the past 16 years. Unable to live without him anymore, George prepares his last day on Earth, which includes giving one last lesson to his class, on the subject of fear; buying bullets for his revolver; and at night having a final party with his best friend, Charley. George just wants to get through the day and kill himself with dignity after the party. The movie basically follows him through the day as he makes his preparations, and the big question is, Is he really going to do it? The movie is not easy to watch. For one thing, it paints an unbearable portrait of grief. Colin Firth displays pain in his voice and face throughout most of the movie; even when he's smiling or seemingly content, there's in his eyes a vestige of sadness and weariness. Secondly, George is such an instantly likable character, it's painful to watch him going about his life knowing he wants to put an end to it. It's so easy to fall in love with him, that his pain becomes ours very quickly.The simplicity of the movie's premise is made up by Firth's outstanding performance, and also by Julianne Moore's. She plays Charley, a woman he once dated, and the only person who knows he's homosexual. I don't know how long she is in the movie, perhaps 10 or 15 minutes, but in that short time she gives an amazing performance as a woman who doesn't have much to look for, like George, who doesn't have anyone else in her life, no dreams, no future, just memories of her good days with George.Tom Ford also complements the movie by giving it a very distinctive visual style: pretty much every scene is unique in the way it looks and the way it is shot. One of my favorite examples is the way he portrays the cluster of emotions in George, visualizing his pain by showing imaginary scenes of him drowning. Not only is it a lovely metaphor, but also connects with a scene in the movie that is the closest thing to happiness George feels in it.Although this was Tom Ford's debut movie, and he showed what a good filmmaker he can be, for me the revelation of this movie was Abel Korzeniowski, a Polish film composer who brings a unique sound of melancholy to the movie. How he was ignored by the Oscars is beyond me.A lot of things in this movie were ignored by the Oscars this year, and yet I think this movie, being the intimate character study that it is, has better chances of outliving all other movies in competition in years to come. I hope so, because movies like this is the direction cinema needs to go in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Powerful As It Gets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this film was announced, I knew it would look fantastic, but I wasn't ready for the intensity of this production, the incredible performance by Colin Firth, and certainly, one of the best films of the year. "A Single Man" takes place during a single day in what might be the last day in the life o a devastated human being.Framed with superb art direction, a keen eye for accurate recreation of a period long gone, and one of the most haunting scores in recent history, we see how George is going through the motions on his way to what he perceives as the solution to his sad situation. From the moment he wakes up to another miserable day, he has finally found a purpose, and this time, he has something to look forward to. Still, as unpredictable as life is, a series of events occur to have him pause and reflect on whether he's making the right decision.It is as if divine intervention might offer him an opportunity to reconsider, or is it just a couple of disguised attempts from other people who look for something less profound. These are interesting moments in the film when a hustler and a young man try to connect with George, and he certainly seems to appreciate their attempts, but he also seems to question the sincerity of their respective motives, or is it that he has already given up on trying to find happiness? There are other possible lifelines, and here comes Charly, a long time friend, who was at one time, romantically involved with George. It is also obvious that Charly never really got to know who George was, and at a critical moment, she seems to unaware of how desperate the situation might be. The scenes between George and Charly are incredibly sad, mostly because of her inability to read what is happening to her best friend. Yet the scenes pale in comparison to the everyday scenes where George's reveal that he wants to somehow overcome the pain and desperation he is going through. He looks at the eyes of strangers, yearning to see if he can capture some of the energy he now lacks. Ironically some of them find him attractive and want to connect, but it just might be too late for George.The film is lovingly photographed, with Ford's masterful hand taking us through the potentially last moments of George's existence. Some people might argue that it is just too beautiful a picture to deliver its devastating message. Yet, why is it that metaphorically speaking, isn't it worse when people are unaware of the beauty surrounding them that makes the situation more pathetic? Firth can see the beauty, but he can longer enjoy it. His world might not be perfect, but he lives in an amazing place, has a great job, good friends, and yet his broken heart can't take it anymore.The film will rank as one of the greatest romantic tragedies of all time, peppered with flashbacks of George's happier times, and showing the contrast of wasted possibilities, nothing will prepare the audience for the shocking ending, and it might lead to a never ending debate of whether the ending fits the rest of the film. I believe "A Single Man" is an amazing accomplishment, led by the best male performance of the year, one full of complexity and going beyond gimmicks, much like Vivien Leigh gave us a full character, with its contradictions and an incredible range, here comes Firth, showing how an another can give us a lifetime of experience in 90 minutes, with a smirk, or a sorrowful look that speaks more than a thousand words. He recalls Heath's great performance in "Brokeback Mountain", another character whose tortured plight touched us.</fullReview>

I left the cinema somewhat bemused and feeling that my expectations were not entirely met. I expected substance only to be confronted with mostly form. The latter was interesting and would appeal to many people but when stretched out over the entire length of the movie it tended to be a bit wearing.Everything appeared prim and proper. The audience is given to believe that a university professor in the America of the 1960s is so well remunerated that he has the finest furnishings, the finest wardrobe (where sartorial elegance is constantly on display), and all the other good things that life can offer. This is what happens when there is too much of a stress on form and beauty -- it moves into the realm of make believe. Depending on one's point of view this either helps to shore-up a rather thin storyline or it makes its thinness even more apparent.And where was the punchline? Perhaps it came in the abruptness of the ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Boring Man.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George is an English professor who has recently lost his longtime boyfriend in a car crash and is having trouble dealing with not only the loss, but his extremely lonely life.A Single Man is an extremely overrated movie. It consists of one boring scene after another of George just talking to someone about something irrelevant and uninteresting. Intersperced between these are flashbacks of his life with his deceased lover in which they, you guessed it, talk. The visuals can be impressive at times and Tom Ford's use of altering the colors to emphasize scenes is the only thing I can really commend about A Single Man.Apparently George is a guy magnet as well because everywhere he goes he meets an overly attractive and absurdly articulate gay man. Every single person in the movie appears to be a poet who has nuggets of wisdom and life lessons to impart. George is an English professor, so that makes since but there all plenty of dumb people walking around who aren't going to shake the foundations of your beliefs with one conversation.Also, A Single Man continues the annoying Hollywood trend of making homosexual main characters that have no other characteristics aside from their sexuality. All the conflict, events, and many of the characters are simply byproducts of the fact that Colin Firth is gay. I understand that gay people have to deal with persecution and I could never fully understand what they go through, but it's not like every minute of their lives is devoted to the fact that they're gay.I also believe that directors/writers do this just to draw attention to their movies. If Colin Firth were straight in this movie it wouldn't have received nearly as much critical acclaim and would have been relatively forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everyone should find "A Single Man"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I couldn't fit my whole review here, so please go to Lost In Reviews.com to find it and read more. Thank you.Would you ever suspect that you would love a film by a fashion designer turned first time director? I didn't quite know what to expect from Tom Ford as he told his version of the book, A Single Man by Christopher Isherwood. I knew from the trailer that everyone was going to look their very best, but not much more until I sat down to watch it.A Single Man is the story of George, an English professor in 1962 that has recently lost his partner of 16 years to a car accident. With the disapproving family not allowing him to attend the funeral, George is left to fester in his own pain for 8 months. When he wakes up from yet another painful night of memories, he decides to end his life and we spend the rest of the film watching George live his last day with moments of clarity.We see George in almost every scene in the film and get little bits from other great actors here and there like Julianne Moore, who plays Charley, his neighbor and best friend, who he has been very close to for years. We spend the most time with her and she does not disappoint. Charley has come over to California from London as well as George and so they have a past. She spends her days passing the time with a bottle of gin or applying makeup, but when she has George over, she is also very attentive and a true friend while still getting drunk. Matthew Goode plays Jim, the deceased partner and lover, and we get to know him from George's flashbacks. He seems to be just perfect with George. They seem to literally complete each other. Every flashback of Jim will put a smile on your face.Ginnifer Goodwin plays a nice neighbor and Lee Pace stops in as a co- worker at school. Both parts are very brief and I would have loved more of each. They are both great actors and even in the few scenes we see them in, we could see a history with George. I love Ginnifer in Big Love and she seemed just as warm to George in this film. Just with a kind hello or a smile in her eyes, you could see that they knew each other more than we get to see. I imagined that when her husband went to work, she would have him over for tea or something completely innocent like that. Lee Pace was in one of my favorite movies, The Fall and I was actually taken back by the utter lack of use of his character. He completely fit the look of the other characters as well and already has a sixties look. Kenny comes along, played by Nicholas Hoult, who you may remember from About a Boy with Hugh Grant. He is almost all grown up now and not afraid to approach his professor and ask him some very personal questions.As George tries to get through the day so that he can get home and get things in order, many things get in the way, life. He begins to talk with his student Kenny in a way that might be more romantic rather than a professional relationship, and he spends a few hours with Charley over dinner and drinks reminiscing their lives apart. Much of this film is spent making the viewer feel like a fly on the wall in George's life. At points in the story, there is dead silence, only the sounds of a real life and we are immersed in his world. Other times in flashbacks, the pain is so much, that the noise is deafening. Ford shows us this by muting the most upsetting parts of his life and leaving us just the images to be burned into our minds.This is not your every day, mainstream kind of film. This is a film directed to a certain audience and open minded story lovers. Ford chose to shoot this very artistically and seems to blend black and white scenes seamlessly with color scenes and then completely drain the color in front of your eyes. This is a film that will immerse your soul and use all of your senses to encompass the nature of the story. The symbolism is very faint at times, yet so prominent. A gay man in the sixties is an invisible man, yet he chooses to live in a glass house. The world outside of the memories he holds with Jim are very sterile and bland. Every scene is very gray and dull and seems lifeless. Until these moments of clarity come in and almost instantly, there will be a burst of color that everyone will appreciate.At times, the cinematography was so great, I thought I might be witnessing a perfume commercial in Italy, in the way that Chanel No. 5 would entice you to purchase their product to become beautiful and stunning, Ford entices you to become visually intrigued with the characters. The colors and close ups of the opening scenes are where this is felt the most. There is a dream sequence that I am speaking of, specifically, that seems like it puts you in a daze. Sometimes, the shots were so tight on a conversation, I felt uncomfortable. I wished for a break from the reality and wanted to pull back, but in the end, I'm glad Ford kept my eyes glued to the scenes. In this way, it truly feels like seeing through the eyes of another. The way he looks at someone else may not be how you would see them, but it's refreshing to have a risky director give it all to show that to us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Colin Firth carries this very slight film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this film is beautifully shot, there is not much beneath the surface aside from Colin Firth's honest, no frills performance. This wonderful actor somehow manages to get through a line like, "We're born alone and we die alone," and make it sound interesting. Supposedly the story takes place during the Cuban Missile Crisis, to which nobody seems to be paying any attention. I was a young child then, and the entire country believed that we were on the brink of World War III. Nobody left their television or radio. People were out on the streets talking, crying, praying. Did Tom Ford even bother to crack a history book and do even 10 minutes worth of research? Everything in this film is background for the main character's mood. It's one of the most solipsistic films I've ever seen. It's a serious subject about a character named George, a gay man living in 1960s Los Angeles, whose lover dies tragically in a car accident. George is not allowed to go to the funeral because he is not a member of the family, and one wonders if his sense of loss would be less acute had he been allowed to mourn in public. But that theme is never explored. Instead what we get is a series of aborted pickups with gay models (at least that's how they appear), a ridiculous classroom lecture from George on the "all we have to fear is fear itself" theme, which I believe has been examined by far more interesting and deeper philosophers, and a frustrating evening with George and his best friend (Julianne Moore). She too, knows how to give gravitas to ridiculous dialogue. A disappointing movie, frosted over with "meaningful" silence, and aesthetic window dressing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I knew nothing about Tom Ford and of course about the movie before I saw "A Single Man". It just happened that I was on my own and wanted to see a movie. As I was alone I made a decision to see this movie. Just like that. And I have to say - Thank You Tom Ford. It made my day, my week, my month !!!! This movie like a poem, like a cool breeze after a hot and humid day. I came out of the movie theater full of senses of satisfaction and joy. It just felt right, good, light and joyful in the same time. Visually and mentally this movie left me speechless. The scene where George is lecturing about "different kind" of minorities was just more than perfect. I love movies which "compels" us viewers to get "something" - the main point of a movie and more by ourselves. And this movie one of them. So much to think about, so much to enjoy by watching and so much to discuss after it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film about attachment and sadness of loss.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very chaste presentation of the essence of attachment. The gender of the leading characters matters, but it is not the main issue. Sixteen years of love, intimacy, and fusion of two soul mates. It is believed by some that when one swan dies the other flies very high and plunges to its death. If it's true that the pair of swans can't outlive one another, then this story is about that. As far as the "gay theme", this film has made it possible to de-sexualize the theme and to further the insight which was presented in "Milk" to a higher plane.Firth plays impeccably. Only the scene with the sleeping bag was slightly and unfittingly comical and somewhat distracting.The main emotional experience for me was a profound sadness. The nostalgia for a perfect match of the mother and the child must be familiar to all of us. Exactly this instinct made the people and the dogs resonate with George's death-bound drive. The more fortunate of us encounter another person, whom we feel such a bliss of joining with; and the potential tragedy of loss.I'd be very surprised if Colin Firth doesn't win for "Best Actor" in all the awards there are for 2009.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brooding tale of a professor from England teaching in Los Angeles who is mourning the death of his partner in a car accident.Everyone is telling Colin Firth that he doesn't look well and that he should watch himself. The film centers on one weekend after class. For someone contemplating suicide, Firth alternates via flashbacks with his male lover and meeting a South American hunk at a parking lot.On Friday afternoon, he lectures his class on Aldous Huxley and fear. I was ready for a Franklin Roosevelt lecture on having nothing to fear but fear itself.In her brief appearance on screen, Julianne Moore is effective as a lady friend of Firth's. With an authentic British accent, she laments the fact that her husband has left her.The problem with brooding films is that they lack depth and to be perfectly honest, they become quite boring.How many college professors have a student over for drinks and a swim? For sure, for Firth and this film, this was certainly a weekend of reawakening and yet in the end, it was a lost weekend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possible spoiler. A grieving man, college professor, homosexual, has lost his long time lover/partner. His every day life since that fateful event is colored gray. Difficult film to critique...All in all, an uneven first(?)time direction by Tom Ford. My first thought was to fast forward, finally I just turned it off and waited until the next day to watch the last 45 minutes. My scoring is probably generous. I keep having to remind myself that this was the 60's era, long before the the gay revolution. I never understood the young student character, but the Spaniard character was a great cameo role. Hated, absolutely hated the ending... Why not cut while George is sitting on the edge of the bed with the George talking over the shot, brilliant. Enjoyed Firth in the classroom expounding about fear. I appreciate Firth as an actor more and more. He alone carries this poignant and flawed film from beginning to end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1962 wasn't a good time to be gay. When George Falconers's lover of sixteen years, Jim, is killed in an auto wreck, poor George isn't even invited to the funeral - even though they had been together longer than most married heterosexual couples can manage. He is definitely persona not grata around the parents and other family members, and he's told of the tragedy as an after thought. The Love that Dare Not Speak Its Name. Can't recall who wrote that, but it was certainly true of homosexuality in 1962, even in liberal LA. (This movie is set at about the same time as Brokeback Mountain by the way.) As polite society put it, George was a confirmed bachelor. As a neighbour less politely put it, George was light in his loafers.Even George's neighbour, long time friend and one time lover Charlotte, can't quite believe that what George and Jim shared was real love, Wasn't it, she inquires, really just a substitute for the real thing? No replies George angrily, probably the only time we really see his teflon demeanour crack.A Single Man is a superb movie. Moving, beautifully crafted, well written and fabulously well acted. The only reason I haven't given it ten is because the ending is perhaps just a little too 'pat'. Fashion designer Tom Ford can feel justifiably proud of his debut as a film director. The movie is based on a Christopher Isherwood story and written for the screen by Ford himself and David Scearce. Every scene is beautifully constructed, perfectly lit and the design is, as one might imagine of someone with Ford's artistic eye, unimpeachable. Every detail of early 1960s life is here, from the interiors to the attitudes.When the movie opens, Jim has been dead eight months and George cannot come to terms with the loss. Every day it's agony to wake up, every day just has to be gotten through. George, a college lecturer and an ex-pat Brit, has lost his soul mate, his life, his love, but cannot even express that loss openly at a time when homosexuals were still persecuted. He is invisible and his grief doesn't exist to the world, except for Charlotte (Charley), neighbour and fellow Brit, who sympathises and yet still yearns for George in a naive way, a feeling still lodged in the recesses of her under-used brain that all would be right with the world if they could only get together. Julianne Moore is perfect as Charley, a heavy drinking and smoking, rich, divorced fashionista with no proper job and way too much time on her hands, as clever women so often had, in those pre-feminist days.The story follows George through the day he has chosen to end it all. Suicide will end his pain. He methodically puts his affairs in order, leaving everything neat and tidy, right down to the clothes for his funeral, the insurance policies neatly laid out on his table, last compliments paid to his staff and co-workers. He buys bullets for his old gun, and, in a scene infused with black humour, tries to decide how best to shoot himself so as to leave the least mess for his house cleaner. But he can't quite get it right, so goes off to the liquor store to buy a bottle of whiskey and while he is there, meets one of his students, Kenny, himself struggling to come to terms with his sexuality. A series of people reach out to George in small acts of kindness throughout his day, and the movie turns on whether or not these small acts will be enough to convince George to go on with life, or whether he will still pull the trigger.It may sound like a rather gloomy subject, but A Single Man is life affirming, and moving, and an excellent study in bereavement. Colin Firth gives the performance of a lifetime, beautifully contained and you have to feel he may have finally have shaken off the ghost of Mr Darcy and his Thinking Girl's Crumpet tag forever. He is a much better actor than he is usually given credit for and should be a bigger star than he currently is. I would not be surprised to see both Firth and Moore nominated on the strength of these performances. This is obviously subject matter close to the heart of Tom Ford. It will be interesting to see what he comes up with next time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A poor man's 'American Beauty'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a meditation on melancholia - a painfully slow meditation at that. And like meditation, you may just want to get up and do something else after a while. Trapped in the silent stillness of grief, we watch as Colin Firth's character, Prof. George Falconer tries to remember how to breathe after the sudden loss of his long-term love. The hopeless desperation of his character is beyond miserable. A handsome cardboard cutout in a suit, he tries to assemble his sanity as the jaws of grief bite down.Every single scene features George and therefore the film never moves away from the heavy grip on the emotions - turning mine into a kind of filmic flatline. I felt dead and empty for the duration.Tiresome in its stylishness, the grainy scenes and ubiquitous monochrome of the decor and costumes become as dull as the subject. Grief is dull if prolonged, and in life as well as in film, it needs to be punctuated by something, anything, else. This film does not give you that much-needed reprieve from the horrid gloom; it never lets your feelings off the hook. At times, I felt as though I needed some breathing apparatus, at others, I was bored.Julianne Moore is brilliant. A strange mix of vulgar vulnerability; a true paper rose fading into the night clutching her beloved bedfellow: a near-empty gin bottle. You can almost smell her desperation. Colin Firth's performance is average; he's reserved and English. Save for a subtle mincing run along the beach, he is just being... well... Colin Firth. But with a stylish haircut and strange glasses.To sum up, a poor man's 'American Beauty' for this decade. 'A Single Man' doesn't have half the character of Sam Mendes' masterpiece, however. In that film, the desperation kind of unfolds so it's much easier to stomach. This film is concentrated on one man and one problem. In a nutshell, too miserable to be memorable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tom Ford has has delivered a movie that is the epitome of style over substance. Pictures, performances, mood, music, colour, image, all beautifully chosen and cleverly assembled, combined to leave this viewer feeling that he (Tom) should only ever be left in charge of perfume commercials in future. It started well, a scene in which the lead character hears of the death of his lover and partner of many years, and of how he is set to be excluded from the funeral, was intense and deeply moving. But the movie fails to follow up on this early promise, preferring to show us how beautifully the once happy couple lived (only beautiful things around them, and each of them in the perfect position in their perfect home). For me, the truth is that this period piece only shows how much we Homo's owe to the fighting drag queens of the Stonewall riots, and how little to the comfortably off defeatists who despite the wherewithall, hid from society at large and did nothing to help themselves or other Gay people (log cabin Republicans feel free to recognise yourselves). I doubt if the positive reviews of this movie would have been garnered if the subject matter (which I presume was supposed to be the hidden grief of the Gay Colin Firth character, and the injustice of it) hadn't been 'Gay'. For me this 'hands off' mentality (from the critics) allowed Tom to get away with wallowing in shallowness (if that isn't an oxymoron)? Tom Ford was never a designer, rather a really great stylist, and he's no film-maker, rather a great ad-man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is like its director's mainstay, fashion: looks great but mainly it recycles what has come before. Mr Ford has got his production and lighting DOWN. The thing could be an ad for some kind of 1950s Disney retro community, or a set piece in one of those GQ spreads where they predict the next retro trend (lounge, anyone?) into which they throw a few insouciant models in amped-up thrift threads. And the polluted sunset skies of L.A. are so juicy I wanted to take a big old bite! Other than that, and other than solid performances from Firth, Moore etc, this film is a mass of clichés. Man has epiphany after life-changing moment? Check. Early 1960s repressive? Check. Crude connections between conveniently-playing news clips and narrator's interior life? Check. Sexual outlaws drinking too much? Check. Older lonely person has mind-transforming moment with young sexpot? Check. For this kind of thing, American Beauty did a much better (and funnier) job.This is the sort of film you would show to a high-school class: its issues are crude and simply presented, its actors look great, it's got a few good lines, but ultimately there's not much there to think about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A Single Man"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A Single Man" is your prototypical awards hound. It has rich atmosphere, assured performances, and not an ounce of originality. The debut of openly gay director Tom Ford, who previously made his name in fashion design, is a curiously impersonal film, a contented period drama about the loss of a partner, and a long hour and forty minutes. The storytelling is generally reserved and mature, but straightforward to a fault, packing shopworn scenarios and relationship dynamics that, while successful enough on their own merit, fail to elevate the material beyond each inherent cliché.But one of the biggest reasons "A Single Man" never soars is that it suffers from some confusing and amateurish stylistic choices. Early in the film, for example, George Falconer (Colin Firth) peers out of his bathroom window. Through filter effects and desaturated imagery, we meet a family straight out of a sixties public service announcement. The actors address the camera, as though we might literally be watching some 8mm home movie. Surely these are George's memories. However, the scene, which spans multiple shots and angles, ends with a mother turning starkly to her side. We cut back to George, who ducks to avoid her gaze. Never mind that there's almost no way that she could literally have seen him through a fence, foliage, and into the dim interior of his bathroom, but the visual shorthand indicates we had moved in space and time. The perspectives from which we see of the family are totally incongruent with George's, but we're still led to believe that these two stylistically independent scenes are occurring simultaneously and within mere feet of one another.And that series of misleading cuts is a minor gripe compared to a mistake made in the overall sequence of scenes. "A Single Man" begins with a dream in which George is beside Jim (Matthew Good), his dead lover, on a frozen river, a car overturned behind them. Jim is dead. The scene is undoubtedly the most visually striking in the film, but its placement completely undercuts the power of a following flashback, during which we witness George receiving the call informing him of Jim's demise. The scene might have been quite potent if we hadn't already been shown the body, but Ford relegates it to superfluous reiteration in showing it to us second. As a result, rather than carrying the emotional weight that it should, the scene feels languid, heavy-handed, and manipulatory.Worse still is that Ford doesn't seem to understand his own protagonist. A contemplative discussion between George and a colleague is derailed by point-of-view shots of nearby shirtless male tennis players. The director uses close-ups and slow motion to add emphasis to each glowing Adonis, even though it doesn't makes sense for Firth's character. George is intellectual and collected, but harbors a deep sorrow, which is and should always be the root of the film. The loss of Jim weighs heavily on him, so to turn around and have him ogling others in a completely inappropriate context is beyond counter-productive; it's developmental sabotage. Had the same relationship been heterosexual, the close-ups thereby featuring women in sports bras glistening in motion, it would be clear our protagonist is an insincere pervert, which George clearly isn't. Ford employs a dangerous double standard in this imagery.The bottom line is that "A Single Man" is a mediocre drama riding high on Oscar buzz in at best a middling awards season. The performances by Firth, Good, Nicholas Hoult, and Julianne Moore are opaque, but the content of their exchanges wants badly for substance. Their playbook passion undermines what could have been a deeply resonant human story, which is instead utterly neutered by pretension. There simply isn't one genuinely surprising or transgressive moment in the film, even in scenes that take a lighthearted approach to suicide and prostitution."A Single Man" may disguise itself well-enough through impressive art design as an awards- caliber film, but behind the slick veneer and A-list stars, this paint-by-numbers portrait of heartbreak is singularly underwhelming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Firth's performance does the vast majority of the work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Single Man is a film about loss and grief as it pertains to an English professor who has lost his partner of many years and who has decided to draw a line under it all and commit suicide. In terms of traditional plot there is not a huge amount to be said because for the majority of the film we are following him through various interactions while he also flashes back to times with his deceased partner. Some have accused it of being dull and, while I don't totally agree, I can understand where they are coming from because it is a film where a lot of time seems to be spent going almost nowhere in terms of narrative flow.This seems like a deliberate decision to give this film a very still air to it, reflective and contemplative mostly as befits the subject matter. Unfortunately in terms of the "feel" it is perhaps too much in this direction because it can feel still to the point of being cold at times ? like it has no heartbeat anymore; not often perhaps but often enough to bother in a 90 minute or so film. Thankfully there is one factor in the film that is hugely above all others ? Colin Firth. He is excellent here and his character is totally convincing with his upright exterior barely concealing the pain he faces daily and he catches this sense of constant melancholy really well throughout the film. The only downside of this is that he is the entire film and I didn't always like the feeling that, were he giving a lesser performance, perhaps there would be very little else to engage me.Certainly the supporting cast aren't enough. Moore is good but not given enough screen time to make more of her character. Hoult surprised me by how very stiff and poorly drawn he was ? I've seen him do well before this film and he is certainly capable of more; I suspect he was directed thus to be part of the stillness of the piece as for sure he makes no ripples here. I haven't read the source material so I cannot say whether Ford did a good job of translating it for the screen, but to me he seems to have left the heart of the film to be entirely handled by Firth as actor ? a decision that worked well for Firth, but not for the film. The direction is still and moves within beautifully designed sets and costumes, while the cinematography is good enough to survive the slightly gimmick feel that the visual toning that some scenes have.Overall, A Single Man turns out not to be that good a film. It is overly still and it moves at an slow pace that does hurt it at times. The massive saving grace is that Firth is tremendous and that in all the stillness his slightest touch is magnified so that he delivers the heart and humanity that seems to be lacking in so many other regards. Worth seeing for his performance even if it does feel like he is delivering despite the rest of the film, not with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Colin Firth's big moment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is not that uncommon that, within the film industry, people take a shot at directing despite having started in a completely different field, be it writing (David Koepp), acting (Ben Affleck) of, uh, production design (Saw V's David Hackl). Some, like Clint Eastwood, have even managed to turn it into the high point of their career. In the case of Tom Ford, however, the choice is a strange and fascinating one, given that he's best known as a fashion designer and his most significant contribution to the movies prior to stepping behind the camera was taking care of Daniel Craig's outfits for Quantum of Solace. And yet, somehow that makes him an ideal candidate for the job, given his sense for the visual, which is why A Single Man is among the more interesting directorial debuts of recent years.Based on the eponymous, celebrated novel by Christopher Isherwood, the film is set during one single day in 1962. The protagonist is George Falconer (Colin Firth), a respected English professor who has become dissatisfied with life after the death of his longtime partner Jim (Matthew Goode, seen in flashbacks), to the point that he contemplates suicide. However, with the help of an old friend (Julianne Moore) and one of his students (Nicholas Hoult), he might still be able to find something to hang onto before it's too late.As mentioned before, Ford has an eye for how a picture should look, and on that level A Single Man is practically faultless: the period reconstruction is reminiscent of Mad Men, a thing that shouldn't come as a surprise given the costume designer is the same (and as a bonus, Jon Hamm has an uncredited vocal role at the start of the movie), and gives a perfect idea of time and place. Unfortunately, it's another visual element that constitutes the film's sole big flaw, namely Ford's intriguing but ultimately grating decision to make the cinematography match the main character's mood (in short, the happier he is, the brighter the images). It's an approach that doesn't sit well with the thematic simplicity attached to the unpretentious screenplay.More than anything, though, this is an actors' film, specifically one actor: sure, Ford deserves credit for making sure even the small parts are given to proper thespians (Lee Pace, Ginnifer Goodwin) and coaxing a lively, sympathetic performance out of Matthew Goode (compare with his other period piece, the rather dull Brideshead Revisited), not to mention Julianne Moore who hasn't had the chance to play such a meaty part in quite some time, but in the end it all comes down to Firth's ability to carry the entire picture. And carry it he does, leaving his trademark mannerisms behind and getting under the skin of a profoundly tragic yet immensely likable character, exuding charm as much as he makes us feel his pain. It is, without a doubt, his best work to date, as the BAFTA and the Best Actor prize he picked up in Venice appear to confirm.Proving that sometimes great things come from the most unexpected sources, A Single Man is an admirable achievement: utterly gorgeous, moving and driven by an astounding central performance. If only all directorial debuts were like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Single Man stars Colin Firth as George, a middle aged college professor living in California. He is trying to deal with the loss of his lover Jim (Matthew Goode), who died in a car crash while visiting his family. The two had spent 16 years together, living a private lifestyle, sharing intimate moments by themselves, with their two dogs, and with a few friends like Charley (Julianne Moore), a friend of George from London.George is drowning in the memory of Jim. He can barely get through the day. He is bombarded with constant reminders of the life they shared and it eats him alive. We find George hanging by a thread. He is having serious doubts about his situation and is fumbling with the idea of ending it all. Over the course of 24 hours, George will be presented with several obstacles that could persuade him from taking the plunge.I am not very familiar with Firth's work. I have seen him in a handful of films like Love Actually, Shakespeare in Love, and A Christmas Carol. He is a fine actor with a solid body of work, but this is by far his crowning achievement. He has just the right amount of intensity coupled with a certain reservation. He hides his emotions, letting them through privately or to his close friend Charley. Where Firth shines is his ability to convey how he feels with facial expressions and body language.There is a lot to be said of Firth's performance. Moore too deserves praise for her portrayal of George's lovesick friend from back home. However, I would like to praise three people for their stellar work on this film. Writer/director Tom Ford, cinematographer Eduard Grau, and composer Abel Korzeniowski.Ford and Grau together create one of the most eye popping and visually stunning films of the year, dare I say the decade. Look at the way the colors fluctuate from muted tones to vibrant, lively colors depending on George's mood or state of mind. The way memories appear to be brighter than the present. There is a saying that memories fade. For George it is the exact opposite. He is a man who clings to the memory of his lost lover. Triggers like an old photo or a stranger's dog spark a flood of memories more vivid and alive than George himself.I said earlier that George is a man who is drowning in the memory of his lover. Ford and Grau take that almost literally, showing us images of George naked underwater, twisting and squirming around grabbing at the water. It's a profound, beautiful image. One of many found throughout the film. Regardless of whether or not you agree with the images, one cannot disagree with the powerful emotions they evoke.Another way to evoke emotion is through music. Korzeniowski is a Polish composer who is sure to gain a lot of accolades for his composition for this film. His use of ticking clocks reminded me of the type writer used in Dario Marianelli's composition for Atonement. It doesn't just keep the time of the music but is a representation of George's life. It ticks on and on but much like the heart, clocks don't last forever. The music is somber and soothing, like we are floating alongside George in the water.Rarely does a debut film evoke this much emotion in me. 2009 in particular has given us some of the best feature film debuts in recent memory (Moon, (500) Days of Summer, Paranormal Activity, In the Loop). What makes A Single Man so special is Tom Ford. A fashion designer by trade, more notably credited for bringing Gucci back from bankruptcy, this film is his first and only credit outside of being the tailor for Quantum of Solace. This could be the birth of a new artist, the likes of which we haven't seen in many years. To have such a strong debut is an excellent sign of the things to come. At least I hope.</fullReview>

The script was non existent the acting wooden and wholly unbelievable. I was not convinced by Firth's performance, no depth to his portrayal of someone bereaved. The fact that his partner's family excluded him from the funeral was not explored. A common mistake in period films the sets were all too pristine and uniformly of the period, the cars just out of the showroom condition. whatever era one lives in there are always ob-jet, furniture pictures etc from previous era's hand me downs etc. In its favour the film looked nice Tedious, I wished he would top himself so I could get out of the cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the set up - lover dies in car accident - within about fifteen/twenty minutes of the start, this movie has nowhere to go, but insists on going there anyway! It just bores itself along, as the pained living lover contemplates suicide. The writing is tedious, the direction totally interested in how good looking the background is, and the acting ( there is an excuse in the obvious lack of direction) is mundane. Colin Firth is a disappointment - smirking at times seems to be his way of describing how he can see through everybody and everything, but absolutely hopeless at showing inner pain. The one scene where he lets go is done silently and in slow mo (direction!?)!!!! Julianne Moore is hopelessly actorish in being a lush in the sixties, and it is left to the supporters, Goods and Hoult, to come over as realistic. Although the latter is just put in to help the plot along to its limpid forgettable end. Fort a film about love, it is remarkably coy, but I suppose that is deliberate as it is set in the sixties! Wow! Boring, uninteresting, with nothing really to say, and I forget to notice the set design which has so much effort put into it as a result!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's 1962. George Falconer (Colin Firth) struggles months after his life partner Jim (Matthew Goode) dies in a car accident. He wasn't allowed to attend the service. He intends to shoot himself. His friend Charley (Julianne Moore) tries to cheer him up. His student Kenny Potter (Nicholas Hoult) becomes attached inappropriately.The pace is deliberate. There is a lack of drive. The sense of sadness can overwhelm the movie at times. Director Tom Ford has a great eye for visual beauty. It's a magnificent looking movie. Every scene has a meticulous style. Nicholas Hoult has a great creepy vibe. Colin Firth is solid as a reserved man on the brink of breakdown.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Colin Firth perfectly embodied, with an incredible accuracy, his hyper sensitive character and his performance greatly contributes to the sincerity of the movie, and this is the only true satisfaction that can be drawn from it.First, the script consists of a succession of very linear anecdotes, it tries to be profound however what emerges is a clear superficiality, the situations, the characters are stuck, and though the film is concise (barely 1h30), you're bored.Second, a lot of people point out the cinematographic skills of Tom Ford, yet nothing really stands out from his approach: the mise-en-sc?ne is rather good but the over-sophisticated cinematography suffers from a few dispensable tics and most importantly, it's not subtle at all, think of the work on the colours and lighting too obvious to be good.Tom Ford, who apparently stake everything on aesthetics, should have been as demanding regarding his story, which is ultimately shallow and feels empty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tom Ford's film is predictably stylish...is less-predictably moving, sexy, and funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fashion guru Tom Ford turned first-time director for this hypnotizing adaptation of Christopher Isherwood's novel (which Ford penned with David Scearce) concerning a gay college professor in early-1960s Los Angeles who decides to kill himself after his lover perishes in a car crash. Ford warms the screen with color flourishes, allowing sequences to literally bloom, while leading man Colin Firth stuns with yet another consummate actor's performance. Firth, often expressing his character's inner feelings with only his eyes and a bashful smile, is sardonic, curt, bemused, angry that life is continuing all around him, and adamant to end his life--but how to do it? Ford's handling is well-composed and beautifully modulated, though the midsection with Firth and flirtatious socialite Julianne Moore doesn't really connect with the rest of the picture, and the penultimate scenes (a pick-up, a nude swim, and some conversation) aren't charged with any particular emotion. Nevertheless, the finale is an ironic heartbreaker, and Firth is quite wonderful to watch. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stupifyingly sad; superb acting. Bravo, Colin Firth!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like drama. A comedy is good for a chuckle. And a musical is great for a hummable tune. But what I really love is something to "sink my teeth into." I like something that moves me, something that makes me think (or feel), and something that plays upon my heartstrings. If that movie happens to be sad, that's par for the course.A Single Man is not just sad, it is STUPIFYINGLY sad. It ranks right up there in my book with Sophie's Choice in its sadness quotient. The movie takes place in 1962, a much different time from our current "open" society and concerns George, a forty-something seemingly proper straight-laced college professor. Although I don't think the word is ever once spoken in the film, George is a homosexual who had been in a 16-year relationship with another man. When Jim dies in an auto accident, George is overcome by grief to the extent he feels like he's drowning, a recurring image in the film. Charley (presumably short for Charlotte), played by Julianne Moore, is his only outlet. Charley and George were one-time lovers, or - it would probably be more accurate to say - sex partners. While Charley continues to hold a torch for George, George loves Charley, but only as a friend, in fact, his best friend. Upon learning of Jim's death in an impersonal phone call from a cousin who "feels he should know," and being shunned by Jim's family, it is to Charley that George rushes and there follows a scene of his crying on her shoulder that is so sad as to be painful to watch. Charley, bitterly divorced from another man, regrets that she and George never married and had a family of their own, and even speculates out loud to George that Jim was a "substitute" for something else in his life, which engenders an angry outburst from George. Even Charley simply does not understand. There are two other unspokenly homosexual characters in the film with whom George dances around a dalliance, but nothing ever comes of them, as in both instances, neither one is able is "come out." The things that go unspoken in this film make even the viewer feel like he's ready to burst; pity then poor George. Colin Firth is simply and utterly amazing in this role. He plays it as the epitome of repression. In fact, the mood of repression in the entire film is palpable. But one must remember this is 50 years ago, and although arguably relatively recent in our history, when one considers the various cultural and social revolutions that have taken place only SINCE that time, one can appreciate George's sensation of drowning and feeling like he can't breathe. Many of the cinematic shots are in close-up and Mr. Firth's controlled facial expressions have got to be seen to be believed. This is one of the best acted movies I've ever seen. Bravo, Mr. Firth!George is so grief-stricken and bereft and lost, he contemplates suicide. I won't give the ending away, but this is a four-hankie movie. If you're looking for a happy ending, stay away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie creates a feeling of involvement very early. The main character is special and you feel for him. Colin Firth plays George, a gay college professor who has been devastated by the tragic death of his partner Jim (Matthew Goode). Isolated by his sexuality in a time before civil rights evolved to include the gay community, George cant even grieve for his lost love without the prejudice and condemnation of Jims family who don't want him at the funeral. Instead George turns to his soul mate Charley (Julianne Moore). Charley is a tragic but liberated woman of the sixties who loves George and clings to the relationship she once had with him. While George plans his own demise he interacts with friends and strangers, students and ex lovers while maintaining a tangible lonesomeness. The natural forces of life and death continue and conclude the story exposing the fragility and fleeting beauty of life and love.</fullReview>

This beautiful looking film is not always a benefit for this look at the surrender to despair. Aloof and alluring he goes about his last day before his plan to commit suicide with an eye for the world he is about to depart.It's as though he is taking one last look at the cocoon of confinement that has been his prison without passion since his lover left, not only this life, but him. Self-pity is not very attractive to those watching but is the attraction of this study of a very personal way of dealing with death and abandonment.The pacing is pragmatic for the subject matter and it all wants to seem truly sympathetic but fails to be empathetic, and not because the man is gay. He just isn't very interesting or inviting and for that matter neither is anyone else in this film. Not one character emerges as nothing more than softly spoken surrogates for a self-conscious Director and screenwriter and an even more self-involved character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Single Man: all style, no substance?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Ford's directorial debut A Single Man, based on the 1964 Christopher Isherwood novel, is a thing of beauty. From a lingering shot of a perfectly mascaraed eyelash to a languorous close-up of full, plump lips dragging protractedly on a cigarette, Eros makes his presence felt everywhere.It's not just the human form itself that is so enchanting ? and enchanted ? here. Objects, too, whether a car dashboard or man's suit, ooze sex appeal. Unfortunately, it is this aspiration to the sublime, this self-consciously artful approach, not to mention the too- mentionable fact that Ford is a fashion designer, that has led some critics to wonder if there's too much surface in this movie. A Single Man looks wonderful, they say, but it glosses its content, it loses its depth. Even the excellent Colin Firth ? slim to the point of ripped ? looks just too damn good.Which is strange, you'd think, given the depressed subject matter. Set in Los Angeles in 1962, A Single Man is a day in the life of aging English professor George Falconer (Colin Firth), who's struggling to come to terms with the death of his partner Jim (Matthew Goode) in a car crash. It is ostensibly a portrait of a grieving man, one whose mourning for the man he loves and has now lost is stunted and repressed. After all, you can't mourn for a love which, even in the early 1960s, still dare not speak its name. He wasn't even invited to the funeral.But while A Single Man is a sometimes moving study of living after the end of one's reason for living, its scope is broader. The Western world, too, seems at its end. In the background, the Cuban missile crisis is playing itself out, a symbol, it seems, of a world poised on the edge of self-annihilation. But the sense of exhaustion, the sense of a world consuming itself, goes deeper. While there might well be a postwar boom, with cars and TVs and dental products available everywhere, there is little in the way of euphoria. Rather there is a sense that something is being lost, that the best which has been thought and said in the world, the Great Tradition, the liberal arts, is being lost to the unfeeling, virtueless world of commerce and consumerism.Not for nothing is our single man here a professor of English, a voice of that disappearing world of high culture. Assessing his current students, Falconer notes that they 'aspire to nothing more than a corporate job' and raising families of 'Coke-drinking, TV-watching children'.If Falconer himself is struggling to see a reason for going on, for living after the end, A Single Man is also struggling to see much future for humanity as a whole. In the portentous words of Kenny, Falconer's flirty, arch student, 'Death is the future'.But if the death drive in a decadent early 60s California seems to be in the ascendance in A Single Man ? a fact rather unsubtly emphasised by the inclusion in Ford's screenplay of the question of whether Falconer will shoot himself ? it also explains why the film seems so concerned with surfaces, with enchanting the appearance of things. To death, to Thanatos, A Single Man counterposes life, Eros. He might be stranded in a dying, muffled world, but beauty is constantly arresting and taking possession of Falconer. While a colleague harangues him about nuclear war, Falconer's attention is caught by two men playing tennis, their naked chests and stomachs glistening in the autumnal heat; while a secretary is informing him that someone has asked for his address, Falconer is drawn to her eyes, her mouth, her hair. A Single Man sublimates. It gives to the everyday an allure, a beauty which, just occasionally, will take Falconer away from his dream of death.But only occasionally. Because it can't stop time. Throughout A Single Man the loudly ticking clock is a symbol of the harsh, unsentimental, all-too-rationalising modern world. It is also the herald of the inevitable. Little wonder that in A Single Man, that which is not a product of human thought and society, that which is not rational ? namely, feeling and sentiment ? is idealised. 'Sometimes I have moments of absolute clarity', remarks Falconer. 'I can feel, rather than think; the world feels so fresh. It's as though it just came into existence.' The desire to stop time, to have the 'now' forever is as suicidally death-laden as the world that is exhausting culture, killing feeling. But in A Single Man this decadent posture becomes an ideology. It urges a plunge ? literally so, given the underwater body imagery ? into a world of pure sensation, of pure, thoughtless physicality. In other words, an immersion in surfaces.A Single Man bears an uncanny resemblance to Thomas Mann's Death in Venice. But Mann's novella was an ironic portrait of art in the era of its impossibility. Things were too easily disenchanted; there was no elevated meaning to be embodied in art, religious or otherwise. Instead, beauty was too easily reducible to sexuality, the sublime to sublimated homosexuality. A Single Man, however, refuses to break the spell; it refuses to yield to the temptation to reveal the sex-and-sweat root of its aesthetic ? for all the homosexual longing, there is no sex in this vision.Instead, the vision, despite its subject matter, is almost uplifting, almost affirmative ? there is life after the end, it seems to say. 'I had a hunch you were a romantic', Kenny tells Falconer. And so he must remain in this beautifully superficial film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All About Colin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If ever there has been a film that is all about one man, this is it. Colin Firth gives a performance that tears strips off of The Kings Speech and for which I feel he has not been given nearly as much credit.A starting point: This is not a cheerful film, so do not expect a happy ending!My first thoughts about the substance of the film, its direction, production and performances, are with the use of colour. As George goes through his day there are flashes of brightness that break through the dull colourings of the rest of the film. These reflect those moments in the day where George is connecting with humanity and with the world, where the pits of his depression are forgotten if only for a moment. And once these fleeting moments are over the colour drains back to the subdued tones that reflect the characters inner pain and turmoil. I loved this; it takes you on the journey with George and adds a degree of empathy that would otherwise be missing. This is not someone who is mad at the world, he can still recognise beauty exists.Secondly, the performance of Colin Firth is exceptional. His expressions and delivery make it impossible not to feel sympathy for George. There is never any pity and this is important as it shows the strength of the character and his convictions. The path he has chosen is one that he feels he has no option but to follow. There are no tears, no tantrums and no drama. It is (I imagine but hope never to know) as feeling like that should be/is.Thirdly is the writing. I think minimalistic would be the right description. There are no lengthy dialouges, no explanations as to why he is doing what he is doing and no heartfelt albeit cryptic farewells. We know and understand from his actions and the flashbacks we are shown why he has ended up here, there is no over egging. This goes back to the way Firth uses his expressions to tell a thousand words. There are few others who would have been able to fit the part so well.Having said that there were issues. I was not impressed by the supporting cast. I am sure Nicholas Hoult has a long career ahead of him but I just didn't like him in this. I could not understand his characters motivations and whether he was being genuine/creepy/manipulative. There seemed to be a lack of emotion in the performance, not helped by having to acquire an American accent. Likewise, Julianne Moore (who I have always enjoyed watching) was below par in her performance as well. The chemistry was not there and, again, her English accent was less than impressive.On the whole, however, this is a film that will move you. It is beautiful with a tour de force central performance. Without giving too much away, there is positivity here as well. Redemption can come in many forms, sometimes when you least expect it. Which makes the final scene even more crushing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life and Symbolic Death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's your last day. What would you do? For professor George Falconer the answer is easy: retrieving important documents, closing bank accounts, writing letters to his friends as well as his last will. With unflinching actions and melancholic gestures, Colin Firth creates a most enthralling character, imbued by the sheer emotion of loss and yet adjusted to the repressed feelings he considers necessary to suppress even in his last day. After losing his partner and lover, there is no deterrence in his decision: he will kill himself at the end of the day.How then could he spend his last 24 hours? Many would have extravagant and unordinary ideas, but the truth is that George Falconer upholds his daily routine facing this day as any other. He wakes up, takes a shower, gets dressed, drives to university, teaches his last class and decides to join his old friend Charlie (amazingly interpreted by Julianne Moore) for supper. Tom Ford's remarkable film takes Christopher Isherwood's novel and turns it into a tour de force in which emotions and the human condition are on full display.Everything seems different when you realize you are watching things for the last time. And so George finally lets go, acting and speaking to people in ways he had not even considered before. Through constant flashbacks, the viewer catches a few glances of the relationship George had with Jim. They had been together for 16 years and if not for a fatal accident they would still be together. Can life lose all meaning once we lost our loved ones? It certainly would seem like it; George finds himself not only disgruntled but also devoid of any hope. He dreads tomorrow. And why should he inflict himself with the torture of existing, day after day, if existence has proved to be so painful and dire? Some answers can be found in Slavoj Zizek and Jacques Lacan theories; more specifically in the notions of real and symbolic death. Evidently, we will suffer a biological death in which our bodies will fail and eventually disintegrate, that's what happens with Jim. This death occurs in the Real, and it entails the obliteration of our material selves. But we can also suffer a Symbolic death that has nothing to do with the annihilation of our actual bodies, but rather the destruction of our Symbolic universe and the extermination of our subject positions. Whenever people remember our names, remember our deeds and so on we continue to exist in the Symbolic even though we have died in the Real. Therefore, Jim is not truly dead as George remembers him constantly, but here evocation does not provide the necessary narrative of closure, the grieving process remains incomplete.There is a fissure that separates the two deaths which can be filled either by manifestations of the monstrous or the beautiful. A concept that a Spanish hustler rescues during a conversation with the professor "Sometimes awful things have their own kind of beauty". That is why the presence of Kenny, Nicholas Hoult's character, is of supreme importance. He is not only the embodiment of beauty but he also provides the companionship George so urgently needs. Only through Kenny and the bonding they start developing will George experience an epiphany ("A few times in my life I've had moments of absolute clarity, when for a few brief seconds the silence drowns out the noise and I can feel rather than think, and things seem so sharp and the world seems so fresh"). A revelation in which he will understand why is it important to let go of the past, to put the pain away and to take a real risk: to accept life and keep on living.</fullReview>

(As he won the 2010 Oscar best actor award for kings Speech I wanted to go back a little and check out some of his best was as per critics) Taking place in 60s the movie is about a gay English professor who is based on Los Angeles. As the story starts it has being a year after he lost his partner in a car accident. And at present he finds it difficult to cope up with is grief. Thus decides to suicide. While trying to finish up his last deeds before his departure he is approached by a young male student from his class. They find a connection.A Single Man is not the typical romantic movie or the drama. It speaks of a social reality which many of us may try to avoid or turn the blind eye. And the exquisite quality in the dramatic movie making just cannot get better than this. And the plot delivers more than just sex and a total different perspective of love and attraction.The movie is filled with brief cutaways, insightful dialogues and minor details which pack the screen with subtle beauty. The cinematography is elegant and creates a whole mood for the plot and its flow. The weight of loneliness and grief combined with the uncertainty totally engulfs the audience.Collin Firth delivers a totally mesmerizing performance no doubt. Each scene and each line is dramatically perfect. His character speaks of emotion, survival, intelligent and ego.If you taste is for dramas and dramas that makes a different then 'A Single Man' will not fail you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just let me get through this goddamn day...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you didn't know that director Tom Ford was a fashion designer, you probably would have guessed his former occupation while watching his feature-film directorial debut in 'A Single Man'. At times the style and cinematography are oh-so reminiscent of those French perfume television advertisements which make little sense to anybody outside the fashion oeuvre. However Colin Firth isn't here to push a bottle of Chanel into the audience's faces, instead he puts forth a magnificent performance as a man trapped in the past who believes that the future holds nothing for him to live for after the death of his lover. While the direction is competent and at times stylistically quite beautiful, it is the performance of Colin Firth which brings alive this adaptation of Christopher Isherwood's 1964 novel of the same name."Just get through the goddamn day." Situated in Southern California, a month after the Cuban Missile Crisis in November 1962, George (Colin Firth) is a man on the brink of suicide. After the death of his lover Jim (Matthew Goode) in a car accident eight months ago, George fails to acknowledge that there is any meaning in life. Constantly dwelling on the grief of the past and never wanting to touch upon the uncertain future, 'A Single Man' follows George throughout a day in suburban California as he travels from his day job as University Professor to the home of his close-friend Charley (Julianne Moore), before meeting one his students Kenny (Nicholas Hoult) who seems to understand George for who he is.When you take on-board a project in which the main brunt of the narrative is focused around the inner workings, the inner-psychological nature, of a man battling the issues of grief, repetition, loneliness and nihilism, you need a strong leading actor or actress in which to convey the character at hand, and Colin Firth does this perfectly. Without his beautiful, enigmatic performance as George, the man caught in an unsustainable past, this film wouldn't necessarily fall flat, but it would require a heavy amount of restoration to its narrative. Firth sustains a quite minimalist story for over one-hour and thirty minutes and never lets up. While Nicholas Hoult, Matthew Goode and Julianne Moore provide the perfect backing ensemble, however it would have been interesting to have been able to see further character development within Moore's character Charley and how her and George's life crossed paths in the past.With that said, it must also mentioned that despite Firth's performance, director Tom Ford, cinematographer Eduard Grau and Art Director Ian Phillips provide much of the stylistic visual spectacle by simply choosing to linger on George's pain. While the contemporary shooting locations and angles can at times become tiresome, the true genius is in Ford, Grau and Phillip's ability to simply linger on George's pain. In the scene in which George is deciding how comfortable to he wishes to be while committing suicide, juggling between the idea of merely laying on the bed or becoming engulfed by a sleeping bag, the camera silently loiters catching every uncomfortable moment and emotion drawing the audience further into the life of a man with no nothing to live for. While the sets and locations themselves are impeccable put together and create a brilliant aesthetic backdrop to Firth's musings as George.Delicate, stylish, and at times disturbingly funny, 'A Single Man' is a stimulating exploration of a character's psyche and how we can all never let the notion of grief go, no matter how hard we try to leave it behind. Driven by Colin Firth, with an all-star cast behind him, Tom Ford should be incredibly delighted with how his first feature-film has turned out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A decent story which lacks solidity and is a bit of an anticlimax.The only element that keeps you going through to the end is Colin Firth's flawless genius. George's relationship with Jim is explored with sensitivity, and his grief is palpable, but the credit goes to Colin Firth's understated acting rather than any in-depth exploration of the relationship through the story. One accepts the fact that it's a slice of life depiction in the life of a single man coming to terms with his solitude, but it leaves the viewer with a deep sense of disquiet which isn't cathartic. The only memorable takeaway is the little nuggets of wisdom "Fear, after all, is our real enemy. Fear is taking over our world. Fear is being used as a tool of manipulation in our society. It&#x2bc;s how politicians peddle policy and how Madison Avenue sells us things that we don&#x2bc;t need."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Single Man-**1/2-Watchable-Directed by: Tom Ford, Written by: Tom Ford, David Scearce, Christopher Isherwood (Novel). Starring: Colin Firth, Julianne Moore, Nicholas Hoult, Matthew Goode, Jon Kortajarena, Paulette Lamori, Ryan Simpkins, Ginnifer Goodwin, Lee Pace.Isherwood's novel comes to life as a homosexual college professor (Firth) deals with the death of his life long partner and contemplating suicide as encounters with an alcoholic neighbor and a smitten student of his makes him rethink his decision.A nicely crafted adaptation of Isherwood's novel takes us down a journey into the depths of deep sorrow aided by fine performances from Firth (in his most dynamic role yet) and Moore as his alcoholic neighbor and sharp, personal direction from fashion designer Ford.The thing that weighs the film down is the fact that the storytelling is dry and boring with no new insights on the issues of grief except for the fact that it presents it through the eyes of a homosexual. It is hopelessly downbeat (though it may be necessary) and lacking a punchline.It is hopelessly flawed, too flawed for its own good, but it presents two actors at the peak of their power and a new director who is sure to bring good things if he continues at this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creative but unappealing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Single Man (2009) - Perhaps I should have lowered my expectations, but Colin Firth's Oscar nominated performance gave me hope that I was to also see a great film. His performance was exceptional and the film had elements of greatness, but it was, overall, very unappealing to me. All of the positive elements like the Art House look, the amazing sets, the perfectly suited wardrobe, the creative camera angles and closeups, and interesting choice of varying levels of light in the cinematography for the different scenes were all fascinatingly unique to the director. On the one hand, I'm sure this film was engrossing to many. I believe it deserves the accolades it received. The performances were outstanding and the plot unfolded in a thoughtful and unique way. Firth was well-deserving of his nomination. Director Tom Ford deserves any praise.On the other hand, I prefer to be a full participant in a film rather than an onlooker. As a viewer, I found the above elements all a bit too visually distracting. I was conscious the whole time of being a viewer and was never engrossed like a full audience participant. It was hard for me to care what happened to Firth's character or any of the characters for that matter. In hindsight, it just was not my kind of film aesthetically. I know that now. I don't plan to see it again and would only discourage anyone from doing so only if one prefers a more traditional approach to filming. Otherwise, one may find what was unappealing to me very entertaining. Regardless, I don't see how any viewer could come away without being depressed on some level. It is anything but an uplifting film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In spite of the absorbing detail revealed in this slow-moving film, it all doesn't seem to add up to much of a point. We have the camera lingering longingly on eyes, lips, and assorted body parts of its characters, yet it doesn't seem to have a sense of logic or pertinence.The film for me failed to speak with a solid central theme. The various characters our downcast professor meets during his final day all sound and act with the same lack of motivation or involvement than does our prof.In short, all the characters appeared on the same eye-probing level. They seem to be searching for something in each other, without contributing a whit to their own personal agendas. In a way these characters reminded me of those in "Women in Love," that is, adolescents in adult bodies, ambling nowhere and fumbling every step of the way.While the cast was uniformly fine, the director seemed diffused and lacking cohesion. It was unfortunate that he chose to jazz up his film with flashy camera shots and editing; there may have been a more concise story to tell underneath the glitz.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding performance from Colin Firth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an odd film that will not appeal to everyone - it did not especially appeal to me - and it probably works better as a book (it is based on a 1964 novel by Christopher Isherwood).Set in Los Angeles at the time of the Cuba missile crisis of 1962, it tells the story of one day - possibly to be the last - in the life of British professor, discretely gay George Falconer (Colin Firth) but with repeated flashbacks. The narrative is seen through the prism of three relationships with George, all former or would-be lovers: his beloved partner Jim (Matthew Goode effecting a convincing American accent) who is recently deceased in a car accident, fellow British expat Charley (Julianne Moore managing a very effective English accent) who want him to return to her or London or both, and a sensitive student Kenny (Nicholas Hoult) who sees his pain and wishes to assuage it in the best way he knows how.Firth gives an outstanding performance in the eponymous role and his portrayal of grief is heartrending in this melancholic tale. However, director Tom Ford has given us a self-indulgent work which is visually clever but ultimately unsatisfying with a particularly unconvincing conclusion (which is presumably Isherwood's 'fault').</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A day in the life of a single man, Firth shines through.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a curious film on several levels. First off, its writer/director is a very successful fashion designer and this is his first movie. Second we have three straight actors in gay roles. Third we have an American actress playing a British lady, and two British actors playing American men.But it all works, and I believe the movie is better for the fact the director has no prior experience. We get unique camera angles and rely more on facial expression to convey meaning. The movie is about how we "connect" with people as we go through our lives.Colin Firth is Los Angeles area Prof. George Falconer who lost his partner of 16 years very tragically in an accident in Colorado. This was 1962, and a gay partner was not considered "family" so George was asked not to travel to attend the funeral. This shock, which happened 8 months earlier, was not easy to get over.Julianne Moore is British lady Charley, whom Georges loves in a platonic manner, even though they had a relationship years earlier. Matthew Goode is the dead partner Jim, and we see him alive in flashback scenes. Nicholas Hoult (who was the 'boy' in About a Boy) is Kenny Porter, a student in George's class.While the director and the main character are gay, it isn't so much a "gay movie" as it is about a person who loses a mate and had much difficulty dealing with it. Good movie.MAJOR SPOILERS: On this day, a Friday, George has decided that he can't cope anymore, he goes to the bank and gets personal effects, including will and insurance policies, out of his safe box. At home he lays everything out orderly, including several notes to different people. He buys bullets for his handgun, and sets about to kill himself. But Charley calls at 10 minutes to 7PM to remind him of their 'date' that night. Later he meets up with Nicholas who seems to have a genuine attraction to George. They have a drink, go swimming in the ocean, they go to George's place, clean up, and George passes on an opportunity for romance. The boy sleeps on a couch, and while George is preparing for bed he has symptoms of a heart attack, falls to the floor, and dies. But he had a very good last day, he "conneced" with people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A magnetic film that sucks you into the screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My girlfriend took me too see this film last week, and other than the title I had no idea what it would be about.If I would have known in advance that the film would be about dealing with grief for the loss of a partner and a gay partner for that matter I would probably not have wanted to see it.But it turned out to be the best film that I have seen in many months. The film is set in 1962, and I really felt that it actually WAS 1962 in the film. In my view the setting was of the same quality as Mad Men.As the story developed, using flashbacks, I really got attached to the Colin Firth character. His nihilistic attitude, the cheeky gay encounters, the dancing with Julianne Moore and the clumsy hilarious suicide-by-gun rehearsal, a classic scene, the naked night swimming and the surprise ending all still stick in my mind.I think a lot of people will recognize a part of themselves in Colin Firth's persona in this film (for example fantasizing about suicide), and that is what contributes to the success of his performance. On some level it is like looking in the mirror.This gripping film comes highly recommended, it is pure escapism, most of the times it makes you forget that you are in a movie theater, which for me is a benchmark of great film making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fashion designer Tom Ford's entry into moviedom is a surprise in every aspect. Not only did he accomplish to film Christopher Isherwood's novel about a man in circa 1962, who tries to pull his life together (or does he?) after his boyfriend of sixteen years died in a car accident, without pathos or tear jerking, both Ford and his d.p., Eduard Grau, rise to the occasion and are presenting not just a feature but moving portraits, where colors get drenched and enhanced, the actors are positioned like a work of art and every shot in this amazing movie is suitable for framing. Granted, I never understood the fuss about Colin Firth who - for yours truly - is the unsexiest man alive, but - boy! - can he act. His scenes with Julianne Moore (in another powerhouse performance) are operatic in the best sense of the word. That's "About a Boy's" Nicholas Hoult, all grown up and considerably slimmed down, as Firth's doting student who might bring back some meaning into his professor's existence. Honest and heartrending. A must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Promising debut but a bit hollow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Single Man is based on the novel of the same name by Christopher Isherwood. Set in Los Angeles in 1962, at the height of the Cuban missile crisis, it is the story of a British college professor (Colin Firth) who is struggling to find meaning to his life after the death of his long time partner. The story is a romantic tale of love interrupted, the isolation that is an inherent part of the human condition, and ultimately the importance of the seemingly smaller moments in life.I was looking forward to watch A Single Man, mainly because it's fashion designer Tom Ford directorial debut and partially because I heard good things about it. To be honest, the film didn't leave up to my expectations but it's not a bad film either. Where to start? First, although the main character is gay, I look at this film as, above all, a love story. I think love surpasses gender and sexuality and therefor I would say this film can be enjoyed by everyone. I'm just saying this because there's a lot of people who will immediately dismiss A Single Man because it is a "gay film".The production values are terrific and as expected the art direction is impeccable. Everything from costumes to sets to camera work is simply amazing. Visually, the film is absolutely outstanding. No question about that. Story wise ? Not so much. Not that it is a bad story but I don't think it is story enough, so to speak, to be made into a film. I guess the best word to describe the plot would be uneventful. I feel as if it's not so much a story but more of a character study of a Man who's hurting, either way I didn't find the story satisfying enough. Maybe the novel didn't translate so well into film, I honestly don't know. The fact of the matter is, if you take the visual aspect of the film out of the equation, then A Single Man would probably be a very mediocre piece of work.Colin Firth, who was nominated for an Oscar for his performance, was in fact pretty great as the lonely and depressed George but I don't think his performance was necessarily Oscar material. Julianne Moore had much, much less screen-time but she was equally as good. Nicholas Hoult, one of the most promising young British actors delivered a solid performance. Overall, a nice watch and a very promising debut by Tom Ford but I wish the story had a little more content to it.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like a perfume commercial</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like subtle films, in general, but I failed to see the point of Tom Ford's debut feature, 'A Single Man'. It tells the story of a single man, surprisingly enough, a gay man who has recently lost his long term partner. His life is superficially attractive and unstressed, although a little dull; but in the absence of his beloved, he aches with unhappiness. The problem is that this is not the set up for the film, but its entirety; and while the movie is a depiction of grief, I didn't feel that it conveyed this emotion with sufficiently unusual power to justify the complete absence of plot. Ford is known as a designer not a director, and the movie is certainly designed, an idealised version of the recent past and echoes of Scorcese's 'Casino' in the way it captures the light and the aesthetics of the American west. But this is too little to hang a movie on; there's definitely a mood here, but no underlying substance.</fullReview>

I divined the impression that this was to be a classy work of intelligent fiction but which was in fact a work of bilious and delusional self indulgence. It must have been a great coup for the production company to have suckered Colin Firth into what must be the worst role of his career. I admire him greatly as an actor and know him to be a pleasant and charismatic person but quite how and why he allowed himself to be lured into playing this role in this hideous and grotesque movie will forever be a mystery to me, he can't need the money. I see already, that this movie is fading into obscurity and was quickly removed from the 'new releases' shelf at the video store and relegated to the cheapo five day rentals shelf, no doubt it will speedily acquire the dusty patina of disuse and be finally removed one day to finish up in a thrift store.

		<shortDescription>Love and Death in California</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The tone is that of an elegy, the mood mournful, the suffering exquisite. If it wasn't set in Pasadena, it could have been called "Death in Venice, California". It's the story of what may be the last day in the life of George (Colin Firth), a middle-aged college professor. He's still mourning the death of his male partner of many years, who died some months earlier in a car crash. George intends to commit suicide. The gun is loaded, the necessary papers and paraphernalia, even what I assume is to be his burial suit, are as carefully laid out as he is turned out. When he actually gets ready to do the deed he just can't get comfortable and rearranges the pillows on his bed, tries the shower stall, encases himself in a sleeping bag...then the phone rings.Along the road to the intended suicide George has a series of flashbacks of himself and his partner and a string of encounters that threaten to derail his plans. These encounters are about the connections he makes with other people. There isn't really much of a plot, but I was never bored. Outside the liquor store he meets a sensitive male hooker named Carlos with whom he has a chat and rejects an offer to do the dirty, even though he presses a bill in Carlos' hand. It's a sweet and touching scene, as each man offers the other something more than mere sex. They each provide the affirmation that the other man needs. George then has a dinner date with his only friend, a blousy, alcoholic woman of a certain age (Julianne Moore in a role once reserved for faded screen queens like Joan Blondell). She's so stacked with make-up, hairspray, heels, gown and booze that I was holding my breath waiting for her to become undone. The closing of the door on her, however, is a palpably sad moment. Most significantly, George continually encounters a persistent, wise-beyond-his-years student from one of his classes (Nicholas Hoult) with whom he has a midnight swim in the ocean and whom he invites home to dry off. They appear to be kindred spirits. The student's penetrating gaze seems to see right inside George to the very marrow of his bones. George, who does not like to have himself so acutely read, is at first uncomfortable and irritated, then captivated as the student, Kenny, stirs up some life in him. I'm not sure whether or not Kenny is actually gay; nevertheless, his interaction with George in his home, with sex hanging in the air, is breathless and subtle. It's one of the best scenes in the film, and I'll tell you why. It's about trust and respect. George doesn't go out of character once, which is both a disappointment and a relief.If you think about it, you realize that George, as presented in this movie, is a narcissistic person. There are few signs that he's actually living outside of himself and his own needs. He's zoned out in class (until he hits a topic - repression of minorities - that impassions him and threatens to blow his cover). He doesn't seem to want be part of any wider community, gay or otherwise - although in the time period of this movie, the early 1960's, it was dangerous to leave the closet, especially if you were a teacher, and one would want to avoid situations where one would be scrutinized. Then too, what middle-aged gay male with his hormones intact wouldn't love to get close to a gorgeous Latino hunk like Carlos and light cigarettes like they're making love, or be befriended by a beautiful, soulful lad like Kenny. Even George's ex-partner, who, in one idyllic, black-and-white flashback, hangs out with George on some craggy rocks overlooking the ocean, was a younger man. "A Single Man", which lovingly photographs these guys, sometimes plays like a middle-aged homosexual's wet dream. Yet I must temper this remark. We're so conditioned to watching strictly heterosexual images on the screen - babes and hunks - and settling for a guy taking his shirt off strictly in a heterosexual context, that the homo-eroticism presented in a mainstream movie such as this, made by a gay man (only a gay man could have created this particular film), with big stars is quite a jolt. For some, it may be the jolt of unfamiliarity; for others, it will be the jolt of recognition. I hope, though, that director Tom Ford can get over his predilection for inserting extraneous and distracting shots into scenes, such as those close-ups of lips, eyes, etc. They make the movie look like a cosmetics commercial.Having noticed all the acclaim surrounding "The King's Speech", and having just seen Colin Firth on "Piers Morgan", I was persuaded to watch this movie. I'm glad I did. I can't imagine "A Single Man" without Firth - he's that good. He not only defines his character; he illuminates the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Christopher Isherwood once said that his 1964 novel "A Single Man" was more about middle age than gay love but in this adaptation for the screen, Tom Ford, the former Gucci fashion designer, has, in his debut as a director, managed to produce a handsome designer ode to sex, life and death from a gay point of view. It could be called "A Day in the Life and Death of George Falconer", Isherwood's alter ego (Colin Firth). Ford has George waking up some months after the death of his lover Jim (Matthew Goode) in a car accident with the intention of ending the day with suicide.During the day he goes to work, teaches his English Lit class at an LA college, does a little shopping including buying some fresh ammunition for his handgun (only in America), and goes to dinner at the home of an old female friend (Julianne Moore). Fairly routine, except that one of his students Kenny (Nicholas Hoult), a good-looking and very forward young man is more or less stalking him. They wind up in a bar at the Santa Monica waterfront and frolic in the surf a bit. And then it's back in the Mercedes to Georges' elegant pad for a quick? no this is not what it seems. You'll have to see the film to see what else. (Isherwood and the George of the book, by the way, lived much more modestly.) Tom Ford seems to equate intimacy with close-up. I thought at one stage Julianne Moore's eye shadow was going to smear the lens. His dream sequences and flashbacks, however, are inspired. Here his designer skills are apparent. Best of all is his use of Colin Firth's facial expressions. One long tortured look from Colin is worth a thousand words. It is a wonderfully understated yet effective piece of acting - even we recalcitrant male heterosexuals feel we are right inside George's head. Love is love, whether or not it dares speak its name. Surely an award-winning performance, Academy members take note.Much has happened in sexual politics since the era in which this movie is set (circa November 1962, just after the Cuban Missile crisis). Jim's parents don't want George at the funeral ? now he probably would be welcomed. But otherwise the outside world impinges little on this story. Isherwood wrote from fears that his much younger long term lover would be taken from him but in the event it was his Jim, the artist Don Bachardy, that nursed him in his final illness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Julianne's Floating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's something offensive about this, and it is a rather delicious experience finding out what it is. Of course, there is the feint, the whole business about gay love being unremarkable. Even ten years ago, most of the American public would have struggled a bit with this. But already it is a non-issue, even though much is made of the filmmaker's intent. That's not it.And the thing is marvelously crafted; it really is. The way all the pieces are stitched together is not so great: we do have an amateur filmmaker helped by scores of A-list technicians, so deep coherence is too much to expect. But it does hang together, and that is because it doesn't actually go anywhere. Its a tone poem, so all everyone has to agree on is the tone.We have consistent abstractions: the fifties and a remembered time-shifting. An ambiguity in who we know is our observer. Ritualistic film methods used to portray ritual death. A score that deftly integrates with Firth's laconic appreciations.The story setup is just perfect: we are placed in a situation where our job (we are told) is to appreciate touch as purpose in film narrative, where our hero is a professor trying to teach just that ? and succeeding with at least one student. He is in a relationship with an architect, who has placed him in a clean glass house. The stance is worth noting: we see this partner always in the kind of neatly designed clothes and space that the filmmaker is famous for defining. As a kind of missing influence in our hero's life, he makes a hole for Ford for fill. So the narrative structure is richly designed.It is the presence of Julianne Moore that disturbs. Usually, she can find the place to occupy that supports the project. Her acting style forces her to understand the nature of the long form narrative in order to find that place. But there is no long form here, only a tone, an emotional style, an affect. (What a concept, because the affect is supposed to reflect something genuine.)You can see her struggle. She doesn't have a director to help her; he serves essentially as the emotional dresser. So she is cast onto her own devices to create a history and a future in which to place herself. She unsettles the whole thing, reminding us of what we are missing. This isn't a film so much as an advertisement.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

Why in the world does he have a little boy, who looks like a mannequin, interacting with the main character - a 50+ year old male? I found that this movie is more about Tom Ford than anything else. Tom Ford is an older gay male who apparently finds happiness around beautiful young boys - which is quite sad. There's more to life than a pretty face and youth and that message does not come off in this film. This film could have been so good and so meaningful, instead it left me feeling empty and questioning the message.Nice try Tom Ford, but it was over done with all the color fading and the over the top laughable iconic imagery like the owl and the moon. For God's sake...the only thing good about this movie was the acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In our society we are told by our elders to always "be ourselves". People are supposed to like us when we do that. Sometimes we don't do that, whatever the reason may be. Even worse, though, is when we cannot.This is life for George. He is a homosexual expat British literature professor living in LA. It's the early '60's. He lives in a suburb with really annoying little kids. His neighbors know him as the eccentric man next door. George has to hide himself from nearly everyone he meets. Only in his empty home in the company of Dear Jim could he become a human. But he cannot do that anymore since Jim died in a car crash. George is now alone. He is A Single Man.George's life has become an enigma he does not wish to solve. He rises from bed today and dresses in an unnaturally kempt suit. It's too slick and tight to be comfortable. He has reverted to his external persona, the fake one, even when home. He has to teach a class today, but cannot focus on his lecture. He decides to clear his life of its empty remnants and is ready to die. But he cannot do that just yet. Another person enters his life right as he is ready for everyone to leave it.And the saga of the Single Man has ended. The presentation was directed by fashion designer Tom Ford. He has excellent visual aesthetic. George's present life has is drab and gray both figuratively and literally. Only in flashbacks to his prior life with Jim are frames immersed in sunlight. Near the end of his life, George sits at home with a new person. The home is shrouded in darkness but George is clearly visible. The light is focused on his face. Soon everything will be dark.Colin Firth portrays our George. His character is quite and speaks intermittently. We must look to his pensive face to see his emotions. Firth does this remarkably well. We can feel for George and enjoy the film because his presence reinforces our volatility. If only, if only.If only Ford had more in mind than the visual when he directed this film. What contemporary social policies the novel was so careful in dissecting are only scarcely evident in this version. Christopher Isherwood wrote the novel which is autobiographical but also a nonfiction breakdown of the gay community stereotypes, among other subjects. George is an outsider not just in his sexual preferences but in his outlook. He is cynical and understandably annoyed with much of his surroundings. At times a person will recognize the transmutation of Isherwood's novel into Ford's film. And I use that word carefully. The novel creates a character that is pitiable because he is too unsuited for his environment. The film creates a character that is pitiable because his situation is sad. A definitive version of this story can still be made. Ford depersonalized A Single Man to its base plot elements, which was a poor decision. Firth's performance salvages it from begin another playset on the soundstage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was completely involved with Ford's simple but effective "A Single Man". I wasn't familiar with the Isherwood story, but appreciated that the main character, George Falconer, was an English teacher--a way to pay tribute to literature and art in this very artful film.So many beautiful moments were poignant without becoming precious or pretentious, but perhaps the most memorable was the scene when George encounters a dog like the breed he had once shared with his late partner. That moment, with it's barely concealed grief and the awkward tenderness, had a resonance that is rare in today's popular cinema.Firth demonstrates immeasurable depth without overarching angst. The main scene with his dear drunk friend, Charley, allow us to see more texture and longing without dissolving into sentimentality. Julianne Moore is practically effervescent as the liquor loosens her libido and threatens to tear the tissue of her long and complex relationship with George. Oh my, but she is so bewitching and sad, sad, sad.The watery and floating fetal-like images were a bit over the top, but easy to overlook given the overall quality of the narrative, the performances and the stunning sets often accompanied by the oppressive October, 1962 hysteria. That international incident seemed somehow so trivial in the context of George's closeted grief.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excessive mannerism of content and style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Ford reveals all his career as a fashion designer in this first production, concerned as he is with an aesthetic rendering of the whole story, which loses depth and intensity as it progresses. Dresses, make-up, gestures, glances, all seems to be artfully designed, but also in a mannerist way, as if he were working for a grand fashion show. I have not read Isherwood's novel, but I just perceived slow motion shots, affected close up of eyes, reiterated focus on bodies, lacking any real intensity of content and style. Colin Firth seems a model preparing for a grand fashion show, he is so self-centred and showing the same face-expression from beginning to end, that he becomes such a bore, and we ask if such a self-centred man could really commune with any human being. Julianne Moore should have been given more screen time, her story is only hinted at, and her personality too evanescent, but she could have been better and more deeply explored. The only praise, that of a tactful treatment of the theme, no morbidity is to be found and a delicate attitude throughout the whole development, if any development really unfolds, although some clichés are sometimes evident and a little pathetic. In the end, a rather banal and mannerist attempt to depict sensitive souls, but a very disappointing result.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a Stunningly Brilliant Fim</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now and then a film comes along that is so perfect as examined from every angle that restores faith in the art of motion pictures. Such is the case with A SINGLE MAN. Starting with the beautiful novel of a gay British professor's planned last day of life in Southern California by Christopher Isherwood, adapted for the screen by Tom Ford with dignity and the power to open up the subtleties of Isherwood's book without treading on the solemnity of the books message, directed by that same newcomer Tom Ford with conviction and identification with Isherwood's characters, and then acted with consummate skill by Colin Firth as single man George who is surrounded with an excellent supporting cast - this film is in a class by itself and hopefully those who decide on the awards for best film/best acting will honor it. George (Colin Firth) begins what appears to be a rather ordinary day for a teacher of English in a close by college, the voice over by Firth relates the routine of rising and facing another day of loneliness he has been experiencing since the accidental death of his young lover Jim (Matthew Goode), yet there is something unique about this day: George is preparing for his last day on earth as he sets out his funeral attire and his gun and other accouterments that suggest he is seriously going to end his life. He busies himself with getting to class, leaving money for his housekeeper Alva (Paulette Lamori), facing students who seem to be uninvolved with life in general and his course on Aldous Huxley in particular, then clearing his office and progressing with his exit plan. Little things happen: he observes his neighbors, the Strunks (wife/mother Ginnifer Goodwin, grumpy husband/father Teddy Sears, the annoying yet perceptive little girl Ryan Simpkins and brothers Paul Butler and Aaron Sanders) as they 'play at ordinary normal life'; he talks with his longtime friend Charley (Julianne Moore), an ex 'lover' who shares his life secrets and invites him to yet another evening of food and drink and thwarted seduction; he is followed by one of his students Kenny (Nicholas Hoult) who despite the age difference offers a sense of caring and need for closeness; and he encounters a young handsome Spaniard Carlos (Jon Kortajarena) whom he befriends but decides not to pick up as a physical diversion. Little incidents remind him of his longterm relationship with his beloved Jim and these reminders are magically captured in flashbacks in tonal colors that create a sense of aging scrapbook pages. How George's planned 'suicide day' ends gathers all of the beauty of this film in some moments as finely tuned as we are likely to ever see on celluloid. Colin Firth IS George and the subtleties of his characterization are almost unbearably beautiful to watch. His home feels like Isherwood's home in Santa Monica: there are even drawings by Don Bachardy, Isherwood's lover, sensitively placed in the set. Julianne Moore gives another brilliant performance as the distraught alcoholic aging friend of George, and Nicholas Hoult and Matthew Goode give us characters to admire and to love. For this viewer this is as perfect a film as is possible to make. Highly recommended on every level. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sexually Repressed Man Portrayed Skillfully by Firth and Directed Stylistically by Tom Ford</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is an aching rawness at the core of this handsome 2009 drama which marks the feature film directorial and screen writing debut of renowned fashion designer Tom Ford. As one would expect, the film carries a pronounced aesthetic identity from someone who obviously has an eye for frame composition, visual flair and period detail. At the same time, Ford's preoccupation with the visual elements can get disruptive as he unnecessarily punctuates scenes with exaggerated changes in the film's color palate. Fortunately, what grounds the production is the sensitive work of the ever-dependable Colin Firth (BBC-TV's "Pride and Prejudice"), who plays George Falconer, a 52-year-old college professor struggling to cope after the death of his longtime partner. The actor skillfully brings the pained nuance out of a protective character caught in an emotional straitjacket due to the repressed year that was 1962 when the story takes place.Based on the 1964 novel by Christopher Isherwood ("Goodbye to Berlin"), this is a somber tale of what George is planning to be his last day alive. Jim, his partner of sixteen years, died several months earlier in a car accident, and George just cannot move on with his life. Resigned to his fate, he spends the day going through the details of getting everything in order to ensure no one has to pick up after him. George cleans out his office, empties his safety deposit box, arranges his clothes neatly, and prepares to send farewell letters to his circle of friends. As he draws closer to what he expects to be his final moments, he becomes more immersed in memories of his past with Jim. However, two flesh-and-blood people figure prominently that day - his best friend Charley, an aging alcoholic socialite with whom he made a long-ago attempt at a fling, and a smitten student named Kenny, who appears to be grappling with his sexual identity through his obvious but inarticulate attraction to George.Firth holds the film together with a genuinely thoughtful performance. You can sense the tortuous anxiety and resigned complacency that he brings to every scene, but none of it overwhelms the character or the viewer. Take note of the way Firth economically handles the heartbreaking scene when George finds out over the phone that Jim has died. Obviously crestfallen, George maintains his composure as he is told that he is not invited to the funeral. Stuck in a mid-century time warp of her own doing ("Far from Heaven", "Savage Grace"), Julianne Moore still manages to impress in her relatively brief scenes as Charley, bantering with George over gulps of gin in that recognizable balance between knowing indifference and unrequited romanticism. Nicholas Hoult ("About a Boy") projects Kenny's eagerness a bit too easily, but he manages to convey the right level of vulnerability otherwise. Matthew Goode ("Watchmen") plays Jim in idealized flashbacks, while Spanish model Jon Kortajarena smolders appropriately as a down-on-his-luck hustler George meets in a liquor store parking lot. Ginnifer Goodwin ("Big Love") and Lee Pace ("Pushing Daisies") show up in brief cameos. Spanish cinematographer Eduard Grau manages to capture all the varying, Almodóvar-level moods that Ford obviously wants to convey, even if the neophyte filmmaker sometimes goes overboard with his approach.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mastery of Subtlety</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Who knows the secrets of the human heart?" The Crying Game George (Colin Firth) is a gay middle-aged English professor from England in the 1960's, who has lost his lover. True to the title, he is alone, and many frames depict his isolation from the community (classroom shots have him separate from the students, who sit in arena seats at a studied distance, and most shots are of him alone) and his private grief (extreme close-ups of his lover's body or private moments of dreamlike reverie about his romance).Although the film's dramatic highlights involve George's "dance" with a young student, Kenny (Nicholas Hoult), who is pursuing him romantically, the real pleasure is seeing a fine actor in the role of a lifetime. Firth moves his face sparingly, but when he expresses, that feeling is immediately translatable. He is a master of subtlety.Not to be dismissed are his scenes with former lover Charley (Julianne Moore), which display both actors' smooth transition between deep affection and the reality that heterosexual love is no longer possible for him. Charley is a modern lady who can take the rejection, but the idea is central to experiencing the price all pay who enter into the modern arena of love.First-time director Tom Ford, a fashion designer, does an effective job of connecting impressionistic shots with the overall theme. Some might object that the many artsy shots may be too precious as he too hard tries to be a high-class first time director. I happen to like the artful approach because those impressions are usually all we have to assess the interior life of one as private as George.Ford is visual by trade; whatever he can do to make film even more artful is welcome with this critic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. World famous fashion designer Tom Ford dives head first into the movie world as writer (screenplay) and director of this one. As expected, the visual details are impeccable - from the "glass house" to the color scheme to the set design to the wardrobe and make-up. All that is missing is a character we care about.Colin Firth has been nominated for many awards for his performance as George, the grieving professor, who in 1962 lost his partner of 16 years. Not even sure grieving is the correct word. Mostly, George has just given up on life. He gets up every morning and puts on his facade and begins the false-front that is his day.We see, in flashback/daydream form, Mathew Goode as George's partner. They seemed to have been very happy together. We also see Julianne Moore as George's neighbor and long ago shot at a "real" relationship (her words). Ford has a nice touch showing Ms. Moore applying make-up as she puts on her best front for an evening with her grieving friend, George. It's all a bit pathetic actually.Anyway, here it is 8 months after his lover's death and George has apparently decided to end his misery. We are locked in to his preparations, which are every bit as fastidious as his morning routine. My favorite parts were when George gets shocked out of his little world and has to interface, even briefly, with a colleague or neighbor's kid. The way he maintains is front is the key to what's ticking.Overall, it is impossible to argue with the praise being heaped upon Mr. Firth for his fine performance, but this film is really pretty shallow and gives us nothing to really ponder. Maybe the Christopher Isherwood novel (source material) is better. Evidently the subject matter clicked with Mr. Ford ... too bad he wasn't successful in sharing his connection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flat as Cardboard!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marginally, I will be generous and say that the Mr. Firth is looking well toned, and that in fact, his grief on the phone initially was good. But I can only say good, it was not carried out throughout the remaining part of his performance. I don't see this as an award winning performance. It was wooden at best, reactionary off others but very unreal. He did not convince me that he really embodied George. In fact, I think it was stale. Mr. Ford may have used this as a vehicle of cinematography and graphic color, but still the nuances did not add to the performances. I know effort was put forth, but even Julianne Moore's performance was lackluster. Perhaps this was meant to encapsulate a socio-political point, in this day and age, but I found it weak and I found performances as flat as cardboard. I can't believe that the Weinstein's purchased it. Weak performances and perhaps not even worthy of rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My what a dreadful waste of time. Artsy, predictable, boring, there was simply no excuse for this thing. Colin Firth acts like he's in a vacuum, he has no real chemistry with ANYBODY in the picture but himself. His 'woe is me' persona gets old fast and frankly, I couldn't wait for him to end it all--and when he doesn't well, I wanted to suck on a gun myself. Also, what the heck was Julianne Moore supposed to be doing? Her character was almost as tiresome as his. Add to it all, the total creepiness of this English professor allowing one of his students to hit on him. And lastly, how IS that kid going to explain that dead body to the cops, his parents, anyone? Sorry, it took me a while but NOW I know why I hated this film so much. The scene near the end of the movie where the kid is dressing Firth's wound was a blatant ripoff of the best scene in 'Milk'--you know the one where James Franco is stealing the picture with the back of his head. Now Lord knows, 'Milk' had its problems but Penn and Franco burned up the screen and made you believe that those two people were crazy about each other. Furthermore, I was really pulling for that relationship to work and when it fell apart, I felt badly. Firth and Goode, on the other hand, are couple of waxworks going through the motions and were incapable of making me feel anything.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Single Man follows a homosexual English professor in 1962 whose boyfriend dies and finds it difficult to continue living life afterwards. The plot is one that we've all seen before. The only real difference is that it's a homosexual relationship over a heterosexual one. And unfortunately, it's presented in a way that we've pretty much already seen too. While there were a handful of things and scenes that I really liked, overall it really just isn't all that unique when it comes to plot presentation, which is unfortunate. Its a largely predictable movie, too, and the characters and their relationships aren't incredibly well developed. It seemed like characters just had instant bonds with each other for almost no reason. The characters are, like I already said above, just okay. The actors portraying these characters were quite competent, but the characters themselves weren't all that special. The main character, George, supposedly struggles with losing his boyfriend, but in all honesty I didn't see that. There were a few scenes where it was shown, and these were the scenes that I liked the most. But in all the other scenes he seemed fine. Actually, he seemed quite content for most of the movie. One thing that stuck out to me was the selective coloring. For a large part of the beginning the coloring makes it appear darker and duller, while the scenes where the main character was happy were bright and colorful. It was an interesting way to show us how George was feeling, but for a man struggling with the loss of his lover he seemed to get happy an awful lot. Another thing I didn't like was the ending. It just sort of happened. No foreshadowing, no hint at it being possible. It just did, with no explanation of any kind as to what actually happened or why. While it's suddenness is mostly realistic, it's still abrupt, and that just rubbed me the wrong way. Overall A Single Man is good. As far as presentation goes, it's nothing really special, nor are the characters, but the acting is solid and the selective coloring was pretty cool. In the end I would recommend this movie, but it just wasn't as much my thing as it was many other people's.</fullReview>

And I am surprised and not too surprised it's Tom Ford. I am surprised cuz I have no idea he direct movies, not surprised because it is very Tom Ford, their photography is always stunning. Throughout the movie, the set, the costume, the makeup, the styling, all impeccable!!! That has to be a lot of work and it shows! I searched and apparently it's the same group of people that did Mad men, the quality just really draw my attention. The movie itself is intense at times, I wouldn't say it's the best film or the most interesting story, but again, it's very beautiful and Colin Firth is a great actor that pull the whole story together.Overall definitely worth the time watching it. Good job Tom Ford!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not an easy topic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this movie is watched easily today, one has to think what it meant back in those days to have different sexual preferences than the majority of the population. The character depicted by Colin Firth is immaculate. He is such a talented actor, but still this role came as a shock for me. The way he behaved when relaxed and the way he changed completely when in the company of his friend or companion was breathtaking.I really liked the idea of adding color to some moments to showcase his state of mind at the time. This movie is not easy to digest, mainly cause it goes against all sorts of stupid clichés that are still part of our societies. But it is a movie about losing a loved one and it clearly depicts that feeling of hopelessness that comes with. The hero of the movie seems to be finding a moment of clarity towards the end and this is also something that stands true for all of us, no matter how big the loss is. Life goes on, and this was a message that was apparent throughout the movie. It's a sad movie but one that allows you to rethink of the things you value, the things that oppress you and the things that don't allow you to be yourself. And once you think of all these things to just ignore them and live your life to the fullest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never written any movie review before, but this time I simply had to do it. I finished watching "A Single Man" exactly 15 minutes ago. I remember that I had a chance to see this movie last year (and I really wanted to, since Colin Firth is one of my favorite actors) but after I read that gay theme was actually what the movie was all about, I've decided not to watch it. I thought that me being a girl couldn't find anything to relate myself with in this movie. But I was wrong. I expected to see lots of nudity scenes between two men and that was something that I didn't want to see but today after reading so many positive reviews, I said to myself:"Let's see what this movie is all about" I am surprised how amazing it is. The movie was exactly the opposite of what I expected it to be. There are so many sentences that make you think about this life and what's the point of living it. It makes you think about your own life and you start raising questions about yourself whether or not you are satisfied about your life, what kind of changes you should make about it, do you want to continue living your life dwelling about the past or you want to enjoy your present hoping for a better future, because there is a good sentence in the movie that really made me think about my own life and it was one said by George (Colin Firth): "If one is not enjoying one's present, there isn't a great deal to suggest that the future should be any better." The movie is great. I cried a big part of it while I was watching. I'm disappointed by the fact that it didn't get an Oscar. However, my final words will be: If you had any doubts about watching it, I suggest you to stop having them and go and see it. You won't regret it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A closeted man struggles with the loss of his lover and contemplates the value of life over the course of one day.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Single Man is a work of art. The acting and cinematography are both superb and are what make this movie. Tom Ford's aesthetic eye is clearly visible throughout, as the movie is visually stunning (though a lot of that credit also has to go to production manager Dan Bishop and dp Eduard Grau).The use of an older, grainer film works wonderfully. It helps set the time period while simultaneously giving a sense of timelessness and nostalgia. I have never seen color used as beautifully and effectively in any other film as it is in this one. The color is leached from George much of the time to show his emptiness and isolation. Whenever he makes a connection with someone, color makes its way back in the picture. Towards the beginning, as he lays in bed contemplating loneliness and suicide, it is very washed out. Not long later, he sees the secretary at his office, and she smiles at him. There is a close-up of her lips, and the red from her lipstick is emphasized. The color visually represents the feeling and you can actually see the warmth of her smile and its effect on George.The music is also phenomenal. Abel Korzeniowski based the entire score on one simple melodic theme, which helps to unify the film as one piece, as one single day. The melody builds and is finally completed at the end of the movie. I have not read the book, but the movie is excellent and given Ford's reverence for the source material, I can only assume it is a quality adaptation. The storyline itself is transformative and intimate, and the ending is bittersweet. Mostly bitter. I take solace in the fact that George died happy, but the irony and the sadness of him finally choosing life and having so much potential, only to have it stolen? it was to me, the most tragic ending there could have been, even more tragic than if he had committed suicide, because at least then, he would have been getting what he wanted.Overall, the movie is excellent and I highly recommend it to everyone.</fullReview>

Colin Firth's capabilities as an actor are proved yet again, amazing, along with other cast like "Goode" although realistically this is a one man movie where the plot and script revolve around "The Single Man's" past and present life, his encounters and his summing up of what is past and how to carry on in the future, that is not to say the supporting cats all are convincing in their roles but the movie revolves around the one main character. I would not recommend watching this movie if recently split up or depressed as whoever wrote/screen play did their research very, very well and brought up emotions in me long suppressed, the realty of this movie is heart and soul wrenching for those who know.Great Movie but the ending left me wanting, can't tell you why because it would give it away, worth watching. Again Colin Firth to show such realism in this type of role is testament to his great acting ability, bravo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Single Man feels more like the prelude to a fashion show than an actual motion-picture, and whilst the film and plot are impeccably solid, it suffers from a certain aura of "style over substance" and not enough depth as it could've had. The debut film of fashion ingénue Tom Ford, A Single Man is both heart-achingly melancholy and richly probing into the life of a lonely homosexual widower in the sixties. Colin Firth is brilliant and brave in the role, whilst Julianne Moore and Nicholas Hoult offer beneficial support, however both are slightly over-shadowed by the pace and performance of Firth. Seemingly inspired by the work of Lars Von Trier, A Single Man is really quite beautiful but not one of the best films I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is odd but not really in a bad way. i mean that it is good enough that you don't need to ramble on and on to explain it. I knew of the director Tom Ford but I didn't make the connection between the Tom Ford I knew of and the one that directed the movie. Once the connection was made some of the things about how the movie was made started to make sense. Anyway, A Single Man was incredible. Beautiful photography, every shots were magnificent. I liked how George Falconer's mood was palpable with Colin Firth's micro-expressions and the slight shift of colors in the frames. The colors went from dull to luminous very subtly. Falconer's intentions are clear but I enjoyed how it fluctuated. It made for a more realistic tone and context. It seemed like the world was trying to help him and I loved that.@wornoutspines</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Miscast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actually the novel is rather good. And the film does not depart all that much from it, just enough to create questions. Why, for example, is the character of the student in the film version made so damnably androgynous? That is certainly not Isherwood's doing. The cashmere sweater is as gratuitous an instance of miscasting as is its feminine counterpart in the boy/man/girl wearing it (few college dudes of the time wore cashmere sweaters). On a similar note, Julianne Moore playing the role of the British girlfriend is as odd as picking British actors to play the American parts. Her character in the novel is much more edgy and unpleasant than Moore's portrayal allows.On a positive note, I liked the smoggy exteriors, because that's exactly what the L.A. Basin looked like in 1962. The mountains were nowhere to be seen except on rare rainy days. There were also at that time beaches where a nighttime swim in the buff was possible, like directly in back of my house on Balboa Blvd. in O.C. If only the film had made Kenny a more masculine American type like the guys who went to USC and surfed on weekends, the essential contrast between George and him would have made their coming together (the main thrust of the story, after all) a true climax, irrespective of the lame ending this strange adaptation tacks on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was ten years old in 1962 and, scion of an academic family, recall overhearing snatches of adult conversation in muffled tones about homosexuality ("acey-ducey"), Christopher Isherwood, Castro, Soviet spies, building bomb shelters, Aldous Huxley. The dreamlike sequences into which such references intrude in Tom Ford's film- the decors, fashions, hairdos, evoke a host of hazy memories Without explanations, I feel a connection with the adult world I observed then, the repressive roles that enveloped this generation. Colin Firth carries in his entire being the weight of his age, having lost the one person who allowed him to break into an authentic self. Julianna Moore captures the pre-liberated frustrations of a women playing unsuccessfully at the "feminine mystique.".Besides the acting, the fact that this film is the first effort of a fashion designer is the major source of the film's appeal. It is visually "dressed" in terms of settings, costumes, conversations, visual effects. There may be no lingering "meaning" to attach to its memory, but it provides a fully satisfying visual experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Colin Firth stars in a remarkable love story revolving around coping with loss.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To deal with loss means to deal with sorrow. There's never been a more artsy and stylish transportation through the feelings of a saddened man than in Tom Ford's "A Single Man." This film transports into a world of melancholy poetry that has the capability of making you grief for the lead and see a love story both before and after a man's heart was broken. Colin Firth does a terrific job of acting here as George, a lonely English professor in 1960's Los Angeles who is suffering emotionally after the death of his partner from a car accident. George has had enough and before contemplating suicide he visits certain people that show how his life still has sociability even though he is in misery. Some people include his English female friend named Charley (Julianne Moore), a student who may want more than just education and a Hispanic immigrant. Colin Firth really does a strong job holding us into his performance and not boring us or having us loose interest with his struggles. We spend every scene with his character and what's nice is that he makes very scene intriguing to watch due to his characters crisis. Many singled this film out as an actors film and do not recognize the beauty and rich potential to inspire broken-hearted people everywhere. This film may seem completely depressing, but what audiences can find interesting is that George has a great life besides his lovers death. He interacts with everyone he meets in a benevolent and easy- going way allowing him to connect with others handsomely and has wealth to provide for himself greatly. Tom Ford shows us how in life you have to just let things go by making the best of the options and opportunities life has to offer. Spending time in misery and wanting to die doesn't solve anything. Tom Ford directs this film in a very artistic way and makes it clear he has a gifted eye for manipulating the camera to capture the feeling of George by which way the cinematographers and editors film each shot. George is isolated in many scenes (single man) which doesn't call for much dialogue, but we still are able to see his feelings through Ford's directing and Firth's powerful acting. Ford also does a really good job of making us feel sorry for George and help us visualize what it would be like to step in his shoes, causing "A Single Man" to be very moving. The end of this film is a connection between sadness and hope. It is a symbolic twist that is both resolving and depressing. "A Single Man" shows the lifestyle of a man trapped in depression and loneliness due to the absence of his lover. Ford shows that without love it is extremely hard to enjoy life, but however in order to break away from solitary we need to keep pushing and find another way to store the bonds of love.</fullReview>

The story itself is not that sad, it's just another commonly found relationship story for me. And the development is also not very special. But the sad aura this movie convey is just great that it keeps me quite depressed throughout the entire movie. Nicholas Hoult's performance gives another good addition to all the other aspects of this movie. From me, I think this movie is a nice job but not quite a good entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Artistic Film turns out pretty good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Single Man is a drama about love, death and also how to deal with these things in your day to day life. The message it shows can be powerful at times in this movie(not always) but still has the heart that a film like this needs to reaffirm "life is worth living". With some great acting seen mainly from it's lead man and an artistic look that we don't always see so much, A Single Man turns out to be solidly pretty good, and here below is why I felt that about it all.The story is slow and for such a short running time really has to cram everything in, although any longer and I think most would be sick of it. It has a deep core of emotion and you really get this when it is just the main character reflecting on certain events, it can really strike a cord with you and lets you delve into his mind. It also I think likes to deal with the fact that homosexuality was very frowned upon in that era and so the film really smacks the point down that, people then were gay but looked down on also in society. Colin Firth is very good in this and no doubt why he received an Oscar Nomination, his portrayal is as said emotional yet when he seems most out of it, he deals with getting back to his life well, and Firth fits the mould well. I wasn't too keen in Julianne Moore here, she isn't bad whatsoever but she just seemed to over dramatic and the character maybe is to blame, but her talents are wasted on such an annoying woman. Nicholas Hoult finally brings a bit of new acting styles to the film, but never up stages Firth at any point, Colin controls this all the way through.Tom Ford the director injects an artistic vision in to this which can at times pay off, but also not do that well, it can very annoying to see the shades of colour used and the sets can seem as if they are too glossy maybe. Hand it to Ford on the writing, he amongst others do well in the script department and even simple actions are done in a way you just know is straight from the page. Although the sets aren't the best, they are unique I will say and some parts look amazing here.My main criticism is mostly in the sense that the story can be dull at times, very very slow and although Firth never suffers from this, he certainly doesn't gain from the speed. As I also alluded to with the artistic part, the colours and shades used when people are happy and sad make for a very annoying and over used effect which yes, work for the first few times but by the end, it is just too bright in most senses.Who will like it, well if you want a Drama that deals with life and death then this could be a good one to watch, if you are slightly down in life yourself, this isn't for you as parts can be, well very depressing. It has the odd bit of comedy thrown in, not massive laughs but the odd smile and chuckle and so it can brighten up your day so there's a point for anyone who wants a Drama with both good and bad.Overall it is Solidly Kind of Good, not quite Good mostly resulting from the more dull parts of the movie. It is far from bad though and in truth, if you want to be an actor, look no further than seeing Colin Firth so in this, truly one of the role models in the modern acting world. One more thing, For anyone who likes the 60's, this could be a great trip back, the sets and settings are truly 60's style and if anything Tom Ford over does the style used throughout the movie.</fullReview>

I have never liked Colin Firth as an actor but after this one, I'm starting to view him in a different light. Maybe its because he was able to take on such a courageous role as a gay man in the 1960s which i doubt many other actors would be eager to take on. Also I absolutely love Matthew Goode!

		<fullReview>After twelve years of being together, I lost my partner in the fall of 2007. I later watched A SINGLE MAN on DVD when it was released and found it incredibly difficult to sit through, yet amazingly truthful. Trying to be objective about this film is about as tough as being caught in the desert and finding a glass of ice water, but in retrospect, the gorgeous performances by Firth and Moore, the intricate photography and the intensely exquisite score by Abel Korzeniowski, A SINGLE MAN is a breathtaking and accurate account of the loss of love from the perspective of a gay man. His explorations into potential heterosexuality stemming from the combined pain of loss and his orientation, the guilt he had from missed opportunities to show love, and the eventual "surrender" at the end left me completely drained. After finding a new life and a new love who I'm proud to have married in March of this year, I think I could watch this film again with a bit less of an emotional connection and be a bit more critical, but the images are still there in my mind, so I wonder if finding them again after some much needed closure might make me love this film even more? I think so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death confronts life in this superb drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched this now when it came on TV on the BBC in the UK. I was captivated throughout this excellent film.Others quite rightly have commended the performance of Colin Firth. I would like also to bring attention to some other aspects of the film.There are many beautiful shots in this film. It is a pleasure to watch. It is elegant and proceeds at a measured pace. The use of the camera is often inventive as well as stylish. Tom Ford has created quite a harmony between the acting of Colin Firth and the overall style and feel of the film. A Single Man shifts between telling the story directly and impressionism. The film is set in Southern California in 1962 at the time of the Cuban missile crisis. It captures that time superbly. Colin Firth's character, George Falconer, is a professor of English Literature at a university. The academic world is one where liberal ideas for the time are common. That period has quite a unique feel about it and this is reflected so well in this film.A Single Man is based on the novel by Christopher Isherwood which I haven't read. This film is a remarkable efficient cinematic exploration of many issues. Death, grief, memory and life. The film is a witness to the consequences of different types of death violent, natural or suicide. Death is contrasted with life. George Falconer is looking at death in its many forms but his students are exploring life. The final scenes of this film are effectively a discussion between life and death.This is truly a superb piece of film-making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fashion designer's Tom Ford directorial debut is strong on visuals for a low budget film but the slight story-line lacks a strong punch despite excellent acting from Julianne Moore, Nicholas Hoult and Colin Firth.Adapted from a book by ­Christopher Isherwood, the film ­follows an unhappy single day in the life of a bereaved single gay man, George Falconer (Firth) whose partner has died in a road accident. Falconer is an ­expatriate ­Englishman in Los Angeles in the early 1960s. A college professor teaching English to students who are about to enter the beatnik or biker generation.The future does not matter too much to him, he wants to kill himself. We see his relationship with his partner in flashbacks including how left out he feels when his partner is buried by his family. We also see him have a platonic but close relationship with Moore who plays another expatriate.One of his student's (Hoult) tried to befriend him and eventually the two connect as they swim in the ocean but just as life might open up to him, fate deals another blow.The film is slow moving and requires attention from the viewer to become involved with it. Despite great photography, the script is weak but people look and dress wonderful. In fact its been described rather cruelly as 'Grief by Dior.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite its perfect melancholic tone and superb cinematic filming, "A Single Man" is damaged by unrealistic additions that only delay the inevitable...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>------------- MY RATING: 73/100 -------------*CONTAINS SPOILERS*"A Single Man" is a film involving around a mid-age homosexual Englishman in the 1960s who resides in the US, works as a professor and suffers from the loss of his boyfriend in a car accident.The movie has the perfect melancholic tone which is only enhanced by its majestic soundtracks and probably the best cinematic filming for a drama movie. As the movie progresses and with the knowledge that the protagonist is to kill himself at the end of the day, we get to see how a man who is about to die (and knows it) reacts his last hours. He is getting distracted at his work, he notices undetectable facial and body details and sees the colors much more brightly.Undoubtedly, the movie, through its protagonist, makes you wonder about several important things. First, about our society and how fear is distorting facts (or "fake facts" as the splendid professor would say) only to manipulate the masses in the end, starting with consumerism and political ideology to fascism and racism. How a set of stereotypes are forbidding willing individuals to live their lives without fear and how political correctness is shaping a convenient, boring and predictable society. Secondly, how youth is full of energy, optimism, nosiness and confidence and how an older man is curious about those attributes which diminish with age. Thirdly, how "unwaiting" events can fundamentally change your mind while it is fate which will have it its way in the most ironic way. I will never forget how George put his gun in the desk and locked, how he burned the letters he made for his suicide, only to die minutes later from heart attack. And fourthly, how surprising and depressing is to realize that for every man there is only one possible future: death.The movie also has (at least for me) a spiritual side. The colleague enters George's life and makes him reconsider his decision to kill himself. We even see him taking George's gun and sleep with it to prevent him from his act, without explaining us how the young man knew the protagonist is planning to die. For me, the young man who step in the last day of George's life is some sort of a "guardian angel" or Jim's reincarnation.However, "A Single Man" is damaged by unnecessary/unrealistic additions (like Carlos and even the colleague), distorting the direction the movie is heading from its first minutes. I, personally, would like to see how a man who is going to kill himself spends his last day, every preparation and detail and then go on with the inevitable act, all dressed up with the memories and the reasons our character has taken this tragic decision. Spawning a homosexual colleague who notices that his professor shares the same sexual preference and a Mexican who originally tries to get a free bottle of whiskey are unnecessary, unrealistic and a bit of cliché. Cliché goes for the character as well, why all homosexuals must be portrayed as Englishmen?All and all, the movie delivers in the end. Just not exactly what you expected...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie absolutely floored me. I don't think I have the words to express how great Colin Firth's performance in this movie was. Julianne Moore also does a great job in her role as a woman who has turned to the bottle after her own romantic endeavors have failed. If I had one minor quibble about her part, I would have to say that her accent was a little hokey-sounding to me in some parts, but this is a very minor flaw. It only really bothered me at one or two points in the movie. I honestly could find no flaw with Firth's performance in this; he played a really complex, multi-layered character with adroitness.The other major reason to watch this movie was just the sheer beauty of the filmmaking. Could I have expected anything else from Tom Ford? I was DROOLING over the fashion, and I'm not normally a 60's/Mad Men-type junkie. I also really enjoyed the glimpses of 60's architecture we got to see, and the underwater scenes were beautiful as well.I really loved this movie for its strong character acting, and overall it's a thinking person's movie. I absolutely adored George's (Firth's) rant in front of his students, and the ending few lines of the movie are also a treat. Definitely don't miss this if you're in the mood for a film of sheer beauty in every way possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprise from Tom Ford and Colin Firth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a lot of films about homosexual love. A number of good films about homosexual love much less. But there are only few of the gorgeous, subtle and profound films about homosexual love. «A Single man» - is one of those rare units. And even if it is a new challenge for society and for a long time failing foundations of morality, but, unlike most motion pictures with a similar «problems», «A Single man» is deprived of aggressive provocations. This drama is not shocked viewers, not urges understand that love is beautiful in all its manifestations once again. This intelligent and refined movie, affecting the most vulnerable and delicate strings of the soul, affecting perception. A feeling of touching the creative product arises from the very first frame. This is not a soulless mounted film, it is an ideal and intricately cut dress. Exactly. «Maestro» Ford's hand is felt in every frame. It's not professional and highly refined directing, it is openwork quirky art. Ford like himself, without the assistance of numerous tailors, at first accurately plan, then manual and jewelry stitch knit his creation «Haute couture». Such an unbearable final! Expected, intuitively guessable, but impossible and intolerable! Bitter, tearing the heart of its equity. Yes, it is the same unalterable truth: no matter how hard life is, no matter how it seemed empty, hopeless and is pointless - it is the most valuable gift, tired of which is an ingratitude and unpardonable sin to cast it aside.Despite the biting drama of the plot I want to dive into this film, revealing the soul without mercy, dare to feel every emotion, experienced by heroes. It's not an exciting action, but our eyes stayed glued to the screen, fearing to miss even a fraction of a second of happening. There are no superfluous frames in this movie, no meaningless episodes and tedious deviations. Every detail is unique and distinctive: every gesture, every phrase, every gaze. Every moment is filled with the finest aesthetics. All the most important aspects and components are amazing organically and skillfully combined in the movie: the deeply-psychological direction, the languorous «cognac and coffee» camera work, open dramatic acting, living art entourage, amazing soundtrack, simple, but consuming ironic dialogs and the plot causing disruptions of audience's heart rate. Not every melodrama with the «classic» love story permeates the soul so skillfully, making the way to the heart, which is painfully clenching from a drama anguish. Courageous and quiet Colin Firth's charisma not absolutely prevented him to be a multi-skilled actor. There is no wonder, that Tom Ford chose his candidacy. Slightly stern face, strong good complexion, balanced facial expressions and smooth, but clear speech. A kind of cold-blooded and majestic Viking with a penetrating alive gaze. This is George. The indomitable outwardly, self-assured, charming, slightly prudish intellectual in stylish glasses. Lost, bereft of meaning, with a pang inside. The George's role finally helped Colin Firth to tear off a firmly grown mask of «Mr. Darcy», which, despite the impressive number of a variety film roles, tightly merged with the actor's image. The sustained sufferings, without picturing hand-wringing and desperate cries, fits of hysteria and the head beating against the wall ? that's a dramatic minimalism in acting with a convincing psychological depth of experiences. There are no any platitudes and simulated exaggeration, excessive passions and provocative riot. This is «gently», gallant and delicate story about the misery and suffering of a lonely tormented man, expressed with excellent sophisticated style of a newcomer in directing. Certainly there were many grumblers willing to criticize the pomposity and aesthetic richness of visual range. Say is it worth to frame such unbearable gay's suffering in such a highly artistic and refined cover? Let the soul's torments unfold in traditional dull-gray tones, it's no need to stress suffering with strokes of gloss and decorative theatricality. Groans a La Fashion. Suicide's preparation with the costume, unfolded on the table, - like scene catwalk. In my opinion, this is an outright ignorant bias to Tom Ford's craftsmanship. Similarly, as if the film was made by a dentist, critics will surely appeared, which instead of encouraging the director newcomer's decisiveness, they have been mocked the operator's focus on the actor's oral zone with indispensable demonstration their full dentition. There were «originals», thus criticized Tom Ford for his flamboyant fashion. But what else can we expect from designer? Every creator has his own «handwriting». We don't expect, for example, that Baz Luhrmann will change his traditional chamber music and drama in favor of other receptions! We don't also expect, that Quentin Tarantino will be satiated with his love to the plot's absurdity, making a clear and linear narrative, which there will be no place the violence's aesthetics cultivation in. In the same way, it would be foolish to expect something else from Tom Ford, entirely unusual to him. Any Master puts all the best, that he has, in his debut creation, using his most winning and favorite «tools».Brave and commendable experiment! In my opinion, this experiment was shiny successful to Tom Ford! Now, if the other designers followed his example, running their debut movie! Curious, what would they get? What kind of playful surrealism would Jean Paul Gaultier birth?</fullReview>

It's not very often that this quote becomes the case within any piece of art, but the verisimilitude of A Single Man struck close to home in a profound emotional level.Tom Fords directorial debut shows an auteur in the making who understands the art of film. Colin Firth plays lead role in a memorising performance that has come to define his career. Special praise must also go to Abel Korzeniowski who's Score throughout the film is a voice in its own right.A film about lost love, solitude and the existential angst of life. I believe I will return to this film many times in the future, like a old friend you never tire of.A small criticism of A Single Man possible comes in its overly contrived image. Tom Ford's previous career as a fashion designer, becomes very evident to the eye from the opening credits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Colin Firth is good. Very, very good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was directed by Tom Ford and co-written by Ford and David Scearce, based on a novel by Christopher Isherwood. Ford takes loving care with long scenes of faces as the characters reveal their interiors. The cinematography is by Eduard Grau, and it's great. The original music is beautiful; it's by Abel Korzeniowski.The story is about a college professor, George Falconer (played by Firth), who in October 1962 has decided to kill himself, as he's never come to terms with the accidental death of the love of his life, Jim (played by Matthew Goode). Having set his intention in the morning when he wakes, we live the day with him as he sees things and remembers things. Firth is wonderful at showing Falconer's feelings, and Ford lingers on Firth's face to great advantage.The movie's designers brought the Sixties back with excellent sets, costumes, makeup, and hair. Princess phones with rotary dials and AM radios abound. The Cuban Missile Crisis has everyone but Falconer on edge -- the people around him fear for their futures, but Falconer has no future this fine autumn day.This is a movie of mood, and although the dialogue is important, what we see around Falconer and what we see in Falconer's face as he sees around him are the most important parts of the movie. He spends much of the day in reverie, with some irritation at the intrusions of people into his privacy. Yet Falconer is ever civil to those around him, even if he wishes them ill."A Single Man" is a very good movie. Despite the subject matter, there is much warmth and humor in what George intends to be his last day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Colin Firth at his best...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you liked Colin Firth's performance in Kings Speech, you will like this movie also. Based on a novel by Christopher Isherwood, A Single Man examines the life of man after a terrible personal loss. Set in the 1962. when homophobia was in full swing all around, it also deals with the issue of homosexuality. These two issues intertwine and create a complex environment in which Firth flourishes as a shy and reclusive man that has too deal with normal, everyday problems plus these two. Cinematography, costumes and camera-work have taken us back in time, and I enjoyed envisioning the life back then and the strange vibe that was in the air. Since this is a Tom Ford's directorial debut he seems to have bright future in directing. It reminded me of American Graffiti and Dazed and Confused, two movies that also captured some past moments and the atmosphere that was present back then.George Falconer, an English professor at a Los Angeles area college, decided to kill himself tonight. Still suffering from the death of his partner Jim, he sees nothing worth living for and his Webley revolver is ready. Going trough his daily routine he remembers the good days with Jim, but what he doesn't realize is that people around him also see that something is wrong. His neighbor Charley (Julianne Moore) also senses that George might need some help. What will happen at the end of the day is up to you to find out, enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me it was more than a movie. Only a strange experience and a deep travel. Beautiful and harsh, delicate and bitter, a kind of jewelery and definition of life, about abdications and small gesture, about love as a cinnamon bread, it is one of films in which every word is only skin of a invisible snake. Colin Firth is magnificent. And the mixture between director and Isherwood is a really surprise. A story about a gay professor is , in fact, map of ordinary searches. So, the nuances are all. The orange slices, the usual gesture, the faces, remains of past, shadow of lost person and the kiss as key of different levels of a single world. Julianne Moore is the same. And Nicholas Hoult is the secret ingredient. A film like a piece of Chopin in the skin of Mahler. A game in fall colors , with small toy, in a glass house.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a long time, I have been wanting to watch 'A Single Man' and finally got the opportunity last night. It really is a beautiful film. Fashion icon Tom Ford cowrites and directs his first film based on Isherwood's novel. Thus, to an extent, 'A Single Man' is expected to dazzle the viewers with its breathtaking visuals. Ford's attention to detail is first rate. The cinematography, editing and visual effects and score are superb. The score especially contributes beautifully to the atmosphere. What I find particularly outstanding about the visuals is that the images are quite simple and yet the way Ford captures and presents them through the protagonist's point of view just reminds you that there's beauty all around us, just the way George notices.As phenomenal as the visuals are 'A Single Man' is not about the 'look'. It's far from superficial. Ford really understands his characters and what Isherwood was telling the reader in his novel. I do not want to reveal more about the story about one could tell that Ford put a lot of heart into this.Needless to say, Colin Firth delivers a transcendent performance. He is one of the few actors who can completely own a role and make it his as though its tailor-made for him. Julianne Moore is equally remarkable as George's best friend who has always silently loved him while the other part of her unsuccessfully tried to keep everything together. Their scenes together are both delightful and heartbreaking. Nicholas Hoult definitely holds his own and Matthew Goode is brilliant.Ford's balance of gloss and subtlety is remarkable. He has created something that is visually stunning, atmospherically tense and emotionally engaging. I'm very interested to see what he will do in his next directorial venture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A reflection of lost love, it proves though even painful memories last even before a dying heartbreak.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say "A Single Man" is certainly one of the better and most haunting dramas of the past few years that I've viewed. It proves that the past can haunt a person especially a lost love can lead to a broken heart that will conquer one's life. Yet thru it all memories are fond and the best medicine to last before the terminal heartbreak literally takes a life away. Always remember memories can't be taken away from someone.Set in 1962 Los Angeles, CA during the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis Colin Firth(one of the best actors in the business)is George Falconer a British professor who after losing his lover Jim starts to grieve and feel the pain of the loss. Slowly and sadly it's eating him up inside. The film is mostly a flashback of reflections and memories of the good times he had with Jim, as the visuals from director Tom Ford are painful yet dreamy pleasures of escape. During this time George's only comfort is the company and friendship he has with Charley(in Julianne Moore's best supporting performance)a female friend now in L.A. who he once romanced in England, yet despite her charm and appeal this still can't take the pain and loss away for George. So sadly as expected a grave end is reached. Overall this film is a great reflection of pain and loss it proves memories last forever even though they may not save us from death the spirit of them will live on. As "The Single Man" is one film that one's memory can reflect on.</fullReview>

I love how Firth's behavior just take over the whole movie, he reflects everything of what man is after losing his lover.He gave the year 2009 something to talk and think about.. really everything about this movie was very well made.. the outfits, the 60's, the music.. every scene was beautifully done..My favorite scene is the scene where he hears by phone his partner just just had an accident and deceased.. Colin Firth radiated so much sadness and as a viewer, you are swept away.. During that whole scene, you hear complete silence.. which makes it more hard to stomach for the main characterBeautiful done by Director Tom Ford, very great debut !

		<shortDescription>Highly symbolic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is great, really top-notch stuff.Some people, walking into this film may think that its just a story about gay rights and that these ideologies will be forced down your throats, but its anything but. This is not a film about human rights, it is a film about loss. I felt very moved at times by what the characters were facing.A Single Man, is set in 1960's Los Angeles, in which a man who has recently lost his boyfriend decides to 'change it all' during the course of one day. Throughout this day we see his sadness, his happiness and the honesty of his poetic mind. Colin Firth delivers a great performance, dancing between total bluntness and depression, yet still managing to produce a few laughs.The chemistry between Matthew Goode and Colin Firth is really well done, the audience really begins to care about the two as a couple, yet they know that its only a flashback.Juliane Moore is also good in her role, same goes to Nicholas Hault, Tom Ford's direction is really well done, making the audience feel as though Colin Firth's character would. The cinematography is noticeable, in that their are many symbolic elements seen throughout. However this can get a bit annoying, almost as if it were being shoved in the audiences face that 'this is good' or 'this is deeply meaningful'.But all in all, I did enjoy this film, and it slightly bothers me that this is Tom Ford's only film, as he has great potential.A Single Man= 7.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish!...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Really well made and, given the director, there is no surprise that it looks immaculate and extremely stylish. A great performance by Colin Firth as George is the highlight of this piece. He is ably supported by Julianne Moore who, as Charley, put on one of the best English accents I've ever heard from an American on screen. Also worthy of note were Nicholas Hoult as Kenny, Matthew Goode as Jim (in flashback), Jon Kortajarena as Carlos and Ryan Simpkins as the neighbours pesky daughter, Jennifer Strunk.Although it's an extremely stylish and well made film I must admit I found it hard to watch despite Colin Firth's excellent performance. I guess the subject matter of the piece is something I don't find I have any interest in. Don't get me wrong, it's not a homophobic thing, I have had friends that are gay and it hasn't bothered me in the slightest. This one just didn't do a lot for me I'm afraid; if it had been made about a heterosexual couple I guess it would never have seen the light of day, and that's just where the problems begin. I think it's a story that has been told many times before but because it's about a gay man in the 60's and it was made by Tom Ford it's special. Well, for me, it wasn't all that special; I will, however, still give it a good score because I think it was very well made and I do appreciate its style and Colin Firth's performance.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED (Just).My score: 6.0/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the recreation of the period, to Colin Firth's career high performance, A Single Man is full of surprises and genuine brilliance. Firth plays a man struggling with the death of his significant other. A simple enough premise, and one that could go in a thousand directions. The best thing about the film is how Firth seems to be more okay than people give him credit for. Yes, he does dabble in suicide etc. But this is ultimately a feel good film. The feel good factor comes through thanks to some sly humor, such as Firth acting out being shot in the head.It has it's moments of simple power, never overplayed, and the soundtrack adds to the beautiful visuals. It doesn't quite know where to go after a certain point, but there's enough brilliance to justify multiple viewings.</fullReview>

The chance meeting with the Spanish youth from Madrid who worn a James Dean outfit and was obviously a model rather than an actor.Julianne Moore was superb as a sixties rich dolly bird, all Green Onions and pop art dress.

		<fullReview>In this film we have Colin Firth playing George Falconer, a single man in his late 30's who's been ripped apart by the death of his partner. I was very impressed with Firth in this film; I would have never thought he had a character like that inside him. The film itself is beautiful, truly. The color changes very often as it shows past and future, Falconer was happy with his past but is upset with his future. It has a marvelous music score by Abel Korzeniowski that really brings out the best in the film. In my opinion, Tom Ford the director has created something so wonderful in his directorial debut. I read the book once the film was released so I could compare and oh boy was I satisfied with this movie. Tom Ford took tiny details from the book and transformed them into important scenes in this movie. Falconer often feels he is reliving his past and these past tense scenes really prove originality in the film. I enjoyed the supporting characters, all with real, honest and unique personalities. If I could some up this movie in one word it would be Artistic. A truly flaw free film with wonderful 1960's costumes and a stunning performance by a leading Actor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Gay Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The script by director Tom Ford, from a novel by Christopher Isherwood, is autobiography squared. It is a slice of Tom Ford's life. It is also a slice of Christopher Isherwood's life. The life depicted -- that of an artsy homosexual intellectual in mid-century Los Angeles -- is interesting enough. What's really good about the film, however, is how skillfully the actors underplay the subtleties of homoerotic desire, love, and loss. Viewers who aren't gay will appreciate the gay experience without feeling put upon. Colin Firth in the lead is really quite good. Julianne Moore, as his straight British friend, is a bit manic, but that seems to be the role that was written for her. The two homosexual relationships depicted are positively glowy by comparison. The sets and costumes, like the music and hairdos, are all period pieces and to die for.What doesn't work is the story. It is a self-indulgent tear-jerker that goes nowhere good. The moral of the story seems to be, Life's a bitch, and then you die, so -- especially if you are gay -- enjoy it while you can. Deaths occur from time to time to illustrate this not terribly profound point. The result is a movie that is more style than substance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"A single man" has echoes of the Italian and French Nouvelles Vagues :it's more European than American.It depicts a long wandering of a man ,who after his partner's death ,cannot overcome the pain;no matter if the man is gay :if he had lost his wife ,the tragedy would be the same.It would be easier to find solace and comfort,had he been straight, because ,in the early sixties ,homosexuality had to be kept secret (see the funeral "reserved for the family")and the only person who can help the professor is his old friend Charley ,a woman whose life has"suddenly gone the waterspout" ,as Tennessee Williams 'Blanche would say,Tennessee Williams whose spirit hangs over the movie.This long wandering reminds me of Louis Malle's "Le Feu Follet" ("the fire within")which depicts the last day of a man who decided to take his own life ;there are also echoes of Antonioni's works of the early sixties,such as "La Notte" .Besides,London is ,for the hero and his female friend ,some kind of lost paradise:Charley knows that if she came back,nothing would be the same cause now she's getting old .Julianne Moore's hairdo resemble those of English stars of the mid-sixties ,Dusty Springfield or Julie Christie.A movie made of looks and smiles and sadness ,with close shots of shirtless young men playing tennis,female lips,the extraordinary sequence with Janet Leigh's eyes in the background,the night swimming ,which,as REM would sing,"deserves a quiet night "(wish they had used the song for this sequence;but it was the early sixties and the members of the group were just born ).The scene of the young girl with her pet in a jar she called "Coliseum" sums up all the fear and hatred the straights feel for the gays .Superlative performance by Colin Firth,with good support of Moore and the whole cast;it is nonetheless a very intellectual movie,which can possess considerable appeal for people who like works such as "hours" .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Single Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been looking forward to watching this film for almost one year (since last year's Venice Festival), soon afterwards I became a little bit apprehensive, too many lessons learned from precedent experience have proved that the higher my expectation is, the higher possibility of disappointment would occur. Luckily now I can get some relief since I am standing firmly on the love side of this polarized film. The story took place in a single day in 60's, a gay professor decided to commit suicide as his long-time partner died in a car accident, the content is rather thin even given the fact that the whole film only lasts 99 minutes, the whole keynote is gloomy, but it manages to blow my mind with a sharpened perspective of life and death, how to choose a path to consume our remaining days, the sentimental pathos is strong and powerful here, thankfully by a marvelous performance from Colin Firth, which is affecting and shows genuine nuance to perfect his role (for example the scenes where he gets to know the bad news by phone, a tour-de-force interpretation one could ever imagine). Colin's new film THE KING'S SPEECH seems to on its way to be the biggest award harvest in the coming Oscar, I am eager to see if this time Mr. Darcy could finally get his due Oscar (actually I should shut myself up as I haven't seen CRAZY HEART yet). As for my goddess Moore, she ushers a difficult supporting role within her limited screen time, which potentially manifests her character's both repulsive and sympathetic two-sides. By the way, it is a truly supporting role (I heard Maggie Gyllenhaal should be lead in CRAZY HEART, shut up again), but this year, please push Moore in lead (THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT), it will be ridiculous if she goes supporting, there have been too many ludicrous examples in Oscar before (to name a few, Jamie Foxx in COLLATERAL, Catherine Zeta-Jones in CHICAGO, Jake Gyllenhaal in BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN). Words get around, I am not a fashion pursuer, so I had no idea of Tom Ford's background before he made his debut film (I feel so ashamed of myself, that's why I bought a copy of MILK today, make a frantic last-minute effort to be trendy and chic). But the stunning shots (over-saturated color) and overflowing slow-motions do imitate a tone of Wang Kai-Wei. As a matter of fact, the gay theme only serves as a set piece to attract more attention, if the story changes into A SINGLE WOMAN, I think it is also feasible but less tasty. However as his feature debut, Tom Ford has done an excellent job to make a short novel into a charming while touching film prose, though it can not cater for all audience's criterion, but who would expect a gay-themed film could do so!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on a novel written by Christopher Isherwood, this is a sad but beautiful film that requires attention and patience during slower moments but is hugely fulfilling. It addresses the power of love, the pain of loss, the burden of grief, joy of life and the search for lost youth with insight and compassion. Nicholas Hoult played a very credible mirroring of Firth's character as he would have been in his youth. I loved the the use of color and formal composition techniques and thought them to be more than just surface trimming. If I had any complaint about "A Single Man" it would be the mawkish dream sequences at the very beginning and the end otherwise it was gorgeously shot and with stellar performances by Firth and Moore and a beautiful score by Abel Korzeniowski who I must confess I never heard of before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tom Ford's elegiac tale of George Falconer, an aging professor struggling with his lover Jim's death and life's meaning as he contemplates suicide and reassesses his relationships with other people and the world, is also a literary and dramatic marvel. However, its real power is not in the internal monologue and character-driven dialog of the movie, but in the cinematography and how life and memory struggle in and out of focus for a depressed man too involved in his grief to notice the real palpitations of death stirring inside of him. George Falconer is lucky enough to be working over and coming to terms with his own mortality on the day his body chooses to fail him, but the audience gets the real message in the rhythmic modulations of awareness, memory, and light.A Single Man's slick (and floating) camera work is a serious and personalized reappropriation of techniques like Schindler's List and Pleasantville, but Ford wears his inspirations on his sleeve with a score right out of Vertigo and a direct (and obvious) allusion to Psycho. Nevertheless, the references are more literary than imitative, it's just a little difficult to break away Ford's style from his character building, which is why the movie ultimately is more engaging in its poetics than its drama. The characters' relationships have, in a sense, hit their high points before the movie has started, except in the case of the young student who finds himself attracted by George's final rant against fear in society. This technique somewhat reflects the audience's own position outside of the historical drama of the time, where the Cold War that George's life is set in has already hit its resolution, even though more exploration into the nature of the conflict is necessary. Thus, it's a somewhat ironic movie when the young student reflects, "You always seem to be about the past, whereas I have no patience for it." --PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Simple Triumph</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Colin Firth heads a superb cast in this delightful motion picture drama based upon the sensitive poignant Christopher Isherwood novel 'A Single Man'. An exquisitely created cinematic debut from director Tom Ford that floats effortlessly along an agonisingly sorrowful tale of love, life and death. Wonderfully shot in just three weeks this film is achingly beautiful film takes place on 30th November 1962 revolving around a day in the life of emotionally challenged English professor teaching at a Los Angeles college at a time of the Cuban missile crisis. The award winning Colin Firth takes up the lead role of George Falconer, a native Englishman, now residing under the Californian sun, who is finding the going a little tough. It has only been eight months since Jim, his beloved partner of sixteen years died in a terrible car accident. An event that still haunts George on a daily basis, even though he wasn't there at the time of the accident. The only reason Jim and George were not together at the time of the crash was that Jim was on his way to visit his horribly homophobic and stuffy family. Colin Firth shows his true ability as master craftsman of this acting business in a tear- making scene back at the time of the accident when Jim's family inform him of the accident, death and the fact that he is not welcome at the funeral. Mr Firth plays such rapid flux of emotions from concern to shock, pain, anger and total obliteration with just his eyes and face as few others have the ability and skill to even attempt, let alone triumph. All the way through the film, there is a delicate and gentle narration from Firth as George, which provides tender insights highlighting the story. The film then follows the emotionally charged and surprisingly full last day in Georges life. There are so many moments of pure beauty that it would take a months worth of Sundays to list them all here, yet I've never seen such a film that held 100% of my attention 100% of the time.There is even a brief little cameo appearance from Don Bachardy in one scene, Don was the long-time partner of Christopher Isherwood, and according to Tom Ford, was a great help during the writing of the screenplay. In the scene he's in, he wears Isherwood's lucky red socks!It is a deeply moving drama, heavily accented with sorrow and depression, yet delicately light and compelling from start to finish. I am not always a fan of slipping into black and white to indicate the recollection of memories in movies, however the delicate and enchanting colour changes here are perfect and tell the story of emotion in visual beautifully. Such exquisite cinematography and intelligent scripting and interpretations helped ensure box office and critical success for this 2009 dramatic masterpiece of love and longing. The fact that this was Tom Ford's first outing as a director and he financed the entire film himself is incredible and amazing and he should be applauded and celebrated for creating something so utterly magical and compelling. The setting, sets, scenery, costumes and musical score are all wonderful aspects of a movie made with care, attention and I dare say a big dollop of love, so perfect are they all, either in isolation or together. I am trying to find fault with this film, but such a task is proving difficult, I will settle with the fact that it was not long enough and for me could have been eked out another ten minutes or so! Seriously, it is a faultless movie and whilst the influence it offers is still relatively limited due to its recent nature, I am sure it will be felt for years to come. It achieved an impressive total of ?16 million approximately at the box office. I would also add that maybe this has set a bar in terms of quality that other serious mid-budget films will forever onward have to match to be considered truly great.

		<fullReview>A couple of minutes in from starting to watch 'A Single Man' directed by tom Ford I knew it was a world class film. It had be hooked, its is one of the most beautiful and sublime films I have seen to date. I found out about it after talking to some of my college lecturers about films that show hidden wonder, American beauty was one of them, the ice storm was another and a single man was the last one. My only wish for this film was that I watched it a lot sooner.Its true to say I am not the biggest Colin Firth fan so my hopes were not very high at all for this film but this film has changed my view on him completely. Nicholas Hoult who is also in the film did an amazing job. He has really grown from that little boy in 'About a Boy' and Tony in 'Skins' I will not talk about the plot that much as anything I say may lower the true stranded of this film. It is best enjoyed with an open mind and a love of new age cinema.This film has everything I wish my films would have it it. It is done to a fine art. The soundtrack took me right into the characters minds, the cinematography is so interesting and different to Hollywood films today. It really inspired me in the way I hope my future films will look. It was also clear that a lot of though went into the composition and the way each and every shot looked so well polished. Another aspect that really stood out for me that I normally look over was the use of colour and saturation. The way the vibrancy showed the mood and past to the present.Watching this has shown me what is right about my FMP film but most importantly what is wrong with it. The way that the most important parts in Georges head is slowed down is perfect. Seeing this film had changed how my final out come will look. I now plan to make my film more personal then I had planed. I now want to show the same about of speed up footage to slowed down footage.If you want to see the best that cinema has to offer then look no more. Watching this film has given my motivation the push it needed to get out there and make a film that people will remember!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And just like that...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to start saying that this film is easily on my top 10 of all-time.The direction , the OST , the acting of Firth , Moore , Hoult , the message(s) of the film , the minor characters ; everything fits and works perfectly like a Swiss clockwork.It's really touching to see the life that Mr. Falconer has , an omnipresent deep-silent pain haunting him , the hypocrisy of society margining him for being homosexual , his incapacity to form a family , etc.I'm going to state that i'm an ABSOLUTELY cold person and rarely (if ever) touched by this kind of things , but this movie is special for various reasons:1)First of all , you can practically touch Falconer's sorrow due to losing his partner , his constant struggle against the society and the world , and waking up and saying "Just get through this g***** day"...2)Scenes showing clocks are omnipresent , adding the film a claustrophobic touch and making the end highly cathartic and touching.3)The hypocrisy of neighbors and society in general , shows Falconer as a lonely , sad and depressed man , living a reality that tortures himself everyday.4)The OST is a MASTERPIECE with all letters and in capitols! The score is the film made musical notes , it's just beautiful , sad , melancholic , deep , powerful , in a single word , a masterpiece. I'm going to put "George Waltz" in my funeral , for sure...5)I cried on the end , and i don't cry since 4-5 years :) Well , a 10/10 indeed &amp; highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Last Kiss</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George is a 'single' man. He is middle-aged, punctilious in his etiquette and decorum and lastly a moribund soul. Eight months after the departure of his 16 year-long partner, he finds the essence of his life nebulous.Every paraphernalia in his abode is redolent of the very many days and memories he shared with his effervescent and faithful partner Jim. The last resort George now seeks is suicide. Except that his last 24 hours are unexpectedly eventful, and in the due course incandesce the ephemeral yet consummate clarity about his perception.Colin steers his character from gloomy and defeated to introspective and blooming. The finest moments are reserved for the first half though the entire product stirs the viewers' souls. There is a scene within the first fifteen minutes into the movie where the spectacled George gets to know about Jim's death from the latter's cousin. The director avoids any unnecessary maudlin and shoots the sequence adroitly. Jim's courteous cousin plainly tells the bad news and sympathizes with George but curtly adds that the funeral is only for the family. This was probably the turning point for George and I was shivering in my seat with vicarious melancholy towards George and anger, repulsion and contempt towards Jim's inconsiderate parents. And this maybe the reason George pictures the dead Jim with the overturned car and the snowy weather; he couldn't bid his final goodbyes to his partner. During the entire conversation, George's tone drops low, he takes off his glasses and his turned to stone when he hears the news. After the call, he sits for a while till tears naturally trickle down; his brain is taken over with grief, till he finally, in a state of delirium runs to Charlotte, who comforts him. The 5 minutes or so are so finely and powerfully utilized that the director and the actor deserve an applause. And this was pivotal for the movie, which if not executed well would've completely obliterated the impact felt later.George wants a perfect day without much commotion. He wakes and freshens up, keeps his gun with him and attends his last lecture. Today seems unnatural for him as he takes more interest in his neighbors than usual. He begins looking at things of beauty in a way he hadn't looked before. In his college, he bursts out about minorities to his slightly stunned class. Colin is breathtaking as he wisely and consciously acts the scene, not sounding patronizing or too obvious for his students to doubt over his sexuality. One guy however is drawn towards him and in a charming conversation between them remarks that George sounded as if he lived in his past. George manages to excuse himself to fulfill what he had decided.But committing suicide isn't a joke. If one has a reason to live, no matter how insignificant, he would be reluctant to actually execute the step. Ask me: I once in a fit of rage tried to suffocate myself with a pillow but gave up even before I felt any discomfort as I had many reasons to live. George has a humorous encounter with his gun, which refuses to shoot him (according to him). So George pretends to be 'interrupted' by a phone call and visits his friend from childhood, Charlotte (Julianne Moore). In another brilliant scene, Julianne, a divorcée who secretly loves him tries to allure him, deeming Jim a 'substitute' for her. Her being loose with words turns their relationship a bit sour, yet George advises her to start a new life in England, which he rejects. So its George advising Charlotte about something he isn't to let go. In the penultimate scene, George, stalked by Kenny, confronts him only to be enlightened by his openness and care-freeness. Kenny shares his own views on life after which he asks George to do something absurd to prove that he isn't 'full of s**t', skinny dipping. In a dreamlike sequence, both take a dip and have the time of their lives. On reaching home, Kenny realizes about George's secret and tests it on the latter. When George realizes Kenny's intentions, he is obliged and has now a will to live. However, the looming heartache finally decides to take away his life, which completes the circle.Colin creates George, a separate entity that is alive, breathing. What makes him outshine the rest of the fine cast is the ability to empathize with the psychology of a gay man without turning him into one of those ' gesture-loving, highly sugary, multi-color wardrobe owning men who talk as if their lower jaw is about to fall apart from the upper'. He wears a sweater in the film, and is quiescent, relaxed in his approach. Colin is spot-on in imitating the way certain androgynous or gay men laugh (in the scene with Julianne). His chemistry with Matthew is so natural and radiant, and that too in such a short screen time together, one feels they're actual lovers. He followed the principle of getting into the character, having a line of action, knowing exactly how to rise and fall to balance the ends and giving the audience the pleasure and pain of George. Was his inspiration Stanislavski by any chance? Matthew is competent, and really simple and elegant in his short role. Julianne was so flagrantly snubbed by many award shows, it's a shame. She is almost flawless as Charlotte, a divorcée who conveys her rebuff so sublimely, every moment measuring Colin, knowing he won't be hers till she blurts it out. Nicholas is daring, certainly a rising star if he just gives a little more control to his voice and personality to his character.A single man is like a placid river, with ebbs and tides to balance the flow. When it enters the sea, one gets a complete movie. The ending is poignant, yet I really wanted George to live. Overall,, an overlooked gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Colin Firth - "A Single Man" was a must-see after "The King's Speech"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know how he does it, but Colin Firth's performance(s) in these 2 films is just awesome! In "A Single Man" he tells the story through minimal words, but his face, his emotions, expressions just say it all! I was mesmerized just watching the emotions he portrayed in this film. While I wouldn't give it a "10" overall, the acting - his, Julianne Moore, Nicholas Hoult were so well done they captured the film for me. It's a bit disjointed to follow w/flashbacks, etc. but a well done film, and Firth's acting certainly deserved more awards. Let's hope he nabs a bunch for "The King's Speech" - best film of the year to my mind!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't do justice with this review compared to the others before me, but I want to share my experience as best as I can. I was a fan of Nick Hoult before I saw this movie, and saw this movie purely on the basis that he was in it. In seeing A Single Man, I am astonished by the subtle use of color by Tom Ford and the amazing facial expressions by Colin Firth. To watch the despair and joy and lust in his face and eyes is simply amazing. Nick Hoult has grown obviously since his first main stream movie, About a Boy and I think he will take a lot from this film as well and build the base for an outstanding acting career. His portrayal of Kenny in this movie had me guessing from the start all the way to the credits. He shows flashes of innocence followed by complex maturity. This movie isn't for everyone, but romantics I believe will absolutely love it, I know I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ford's First Film Packs a Quiet, yet Powerful, Punch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing you'll notice about fashion designer Tom Ford's directorial debut is that it bears none of the usual earmarks of a maiden voyage into movie-making. Faithful to the spirit of Christopher Isherwood's modern classic, this beautifully understated film is all the more powerful because of its quiet, controlled delivery. Like the novel, this probably isn't a tale that would appeal to the young. If you're looking for a roller-coaster ride or fireworks, hot sex or neatly packaged happily-ever-afters, you're not going to find them here. What you will find instead is mature, brilliantly realized art on every conceivable level.Set in 1962, A Single Man is true to the attitudes and aesthetics of its time while managing to remain completely real and relevant today. It is a tale simply told, yet astonishingly rich in subtext. I've always believed the concept of perfection to be a myth, so I watched this film twice in succession, the second time putting it under a microscope as I searched for the telltale flaw that would support my theory. I searched in vain. There is not a single misstep in this remarkable piece. Every choice made here is absolutely, inarguably the right one.In a more than Oscar-worthy performance, Colin Firth plays George, a middle-aged college professor who is grieving for his longtime partner, Jim (Matthew Goode). We see George dress for work and beat the hell out of a frozen loaf of bread, teach a class, share dinner, a dance, and a kiss with his best friend (the always excellent Julianne Moore), fantasize about pissing in the face of a neighbor's obnoxious child, remember his life with Jim via a series of flashbacks, skinnydip with a beautiful and persistent young student (Nicholas Hoult) and wrap up his affairs -- even to the point of buying ammo for his gun and laying out his own burial attire -- as he goes through the motions of a single day, a day that he fully intends to make his last."Sometimes awful things have their own kind of beauty," someone tells him. In that instant, we see what George sees, that in an odd way, that is even true of his grief. Ford's background in design is evident in the stunning visuals, and an almost subliminal vein of sensuality that has both nothing and everything to do with sexuality runs throughout the course of this piece. Deeply personal without becoming self-indulgent, smart as hell, darkly droll and ultimately ironic, this is a prime example of film-making at its finest.Simply put, I'm undone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible performance by Colin Firth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despair, hope, redemption. This is what this movie is about. A man is living a lie, forced to play a role forced on him by a society that would reject him if he revealed the truth about himself. He is single, but not from choice but because of the repressive nature of a society that is driving him to contemplate suicide. Now, this single man is actually well liked, respected and even admired, yet he is not happy and for good reason: he is an emotional fraud. He lacks that courage to emerge from his shell and when he finally meets someone with whom he can connect, it is too late. All his plans are for naught; life plays a cruel joke on him. Just when he thought that he had turned over a new leaf, had been redeemed, hope is renewed, it is all taken away from him in a twist of fate that underscores our vulnerability and makes one wonder whether any of it is worth the effort. We worry, we make plans, we despair, we have hope, we hope for the best, deal with our fears and in the end, poof! It's all gone. What a great movie. Colin Firth gives one of the great performances as a English college professor who is struggling to find a reason to live as he prepares for his own death. This movie makes a powerful statement about life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Live each day as if it's your last</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Colin Firth is "A Single Man" in this 2009 film directed by Tom Ford and also starring Julianne Moore, Nicholas Hoult and Matthew Goode. Firth plays a professor mourning the loss of his lover (Goode) in an accident. He decides to end it all.According to the special features, the thought behind this film is to live each day as if it's your last. Because the character has made that decision, his senses are heightened, and he's able to let go in a way he never has.I admit that I wasn't terribly impressed. To me, it was style over substance, the changes from black and white to sepia and color, the focus of the camera on odd things - it just all seemed terribly precious. I didn't actually pick up that because it was this man's last day on earth that a little girl's shoes seemed a brighter color than previously. Maybe I'm dense.Set in the '60s, Julianne Moore looked perfect as a glamour girl from that era, right out of a magazine, and Matthew Goode and Nicholas Hoult were very good. Colin Firth is always excellent.All just a little too precious and, I'm afraid, uninvolving.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unrealistic and overrated.Colin Firth (George) a wise professor suffering due to losing a lover, conscious of Aldous Huxley's quote "Experience is not what happens to you. It is what you do with what happens to you", sets his mind to commit suicide ?? Assuming he was love stoned and didn't hear what was coming out of his own mouth, could a professor of Philosophy be so ignorant to think his love could be more special than anyone else's ? Consider the scene with Julianne Moore (Charley)for instance, George gets really aggressive after Charley implies that the love he had with Jim was just a substitute. Georges goes on saying that his love went for 16 years whereas Charley's only lasted eight years.(You would not really expect such comments from an authentic character Tom Ford was trying to implement). I found that the character Tom Ford built for George was unrealistic in relation to the main idea of the movie. leaving it unbalanced and in a contradiction to itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beautifully directed, well-acted, and nicely written, A Single Man is one of a very few compelling films I've seen in a while. It's about a day in the life of George Falconer (Colin Firth), an English college professor struggling to cope with the death of his lover Jim, played by the dashing Matthew Goode *sigh*.Tom Ford does a wonderful job with his directorial debut. I've read others say it was overdone, but I personally didn't think that was the case. It was very stylish, yes, but not disgustingly so. And I loved that effect where he plays with the color saturation at different moments throughout the film.The actors, of course, were very good, and made the film much more of a treat to watch.A film which strikes a good balance between style &amp; substance, A Single Man is definitely something I would recommend others to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A SINGLE MAN is about appearances.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"You must get through this goddamn day." With this affirmation George begins his day. College professor George (Colin Firth) lives a tidy, orderly life of silent desperation since the death of his partner of sixteen years. Today George plans to put a tidy, orderly end to it all. He puts his affairs in order and packs his brief case for his last day of work - gun in tow. A SINGLE MAN is a singularly beautiful film. Several reviewers have commented on how fashion icon-turned-director Tom Ford's use of style distracts from the film. But style and beauty are really the point. It's all about appearances.Keeping up appearances was vital to a gay man in the early sixties. The restraints of society didn't allow men to express deep sentiments. George must contain his emotions even when he is told that his life partner has died in a car accident and that he isn't invited to the funeral because it's "only for the family." Actor Colin Firth gives a glimpse of his pain while struggling to keep it at a socially acceptable level. Director Tom Ford cues us in on the depth of his feelings through music. But today George has nothing to lose, so we see hints of his true sentiments. He lingers on the scent while petting a stranger's pup. He raves about the secretary's beauty. For the first time, he shares his thoughts with his students about how people are afraid of those who are invisible to them - like the Jews. George is invisible in his own life. But he is still too guarded to share that with his students.I'm afraid Tom Ford made George a bit too guarded. I think I would have felt more for George if I had seen a deeper connection between George and his lover. But George's memories are shallow. That's really a shame because this is a film about the importance of human connections. Throughout the film, I hoped that George would find the connection he needed to make life worth living. A SINGLE MAN is a deep film about appearances and our need for connection. It is an important film because it is still sadly relevant. Hopefully, it will help us connect with the beauty in all of us.

		<fullReview>Suddenly, that seems to be the hottest year through the 20th century. And this film has done much for it.The story is about the homosexual teacher. His lover since 16 years has just died. He can't live and he can't die. He has fallen so low that he hasn't the guts to get out of the hell that life is.Colin Firth is good, but the female friend Julianne Moore is maybe the greatest American actress at the moment. Her work is so clever in every detail. The drunken laughs, the hysterical way of trying to dance, the way she walks in despair, tells us even more of a hopeless situation than Colin Firth does. It's all splendid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>During the early 1960s in Los Angeles, a gay college professor named George (Colin Firth) is grieving after the death of his lover. Consumed by the overwhelming sense of fear and paranoia in this Cold War environment, George plans this to be the day of his own suicide. The film follows his last day in its entirety, as he prepares for work, tries unsuccessfully to reach out to his final class and meets with his friend Charley (Julianne Moore), a woman who wants him to resume a normal relationship with her because they used to sleep together. George also catches the eye of Kenny (Nicholas Hoult), a student who continues to pursue him, even though their intent for each other is largely implied and rarely spoken.As a fashion designer Tom Ford has imposed his artistic merits in his directional debut of Christopher Isherwood's novel. Although this is a small film, spanning over a minimal time period, Ford has ensured that it still holds a significant level of beauty. The juxtaposition of colour and the contrasting lighting, switching between a black and white and a highly saturated colour scheme, engraves George in a world of uniformity and expectations, but also the beauty that is to be found in the ugliest of things. It is a shame given many of the film's stylish qualities that Ford has shown his inexperience as a filmmaker by lingering on these visual aspects. The first act of the film is leisurely paced because of Ford's insistence for slow-motion montages that shift in and out of colour and focus. It is certainly pretty but it also remains a distraction from the film's core performances. The film's score as well, though it has been nominated for a Golden Globe Award, is slight over-bearing too. Contextually, Ford handles the material more skilfully, incorporating the subtext of fear and uncertainty seamlessly into George's lecture and his talks with Kenny. It is quite apparent what he is referring to when he is discussing the fear of minority groups within this era.As with the film Crazy Heart, it is the performance of the lead actor here that ensures that a reasonable film is made into a far more memorable one. Colin Firth has been nominated for an Oscar and justifiably so, because he has rarely been better. His seriousness and intensity shown is subtly drawn, as too is his sense of self-containment. Right from the start the film cleverly shows the image of George's body sinking under the weight of the sea. It is this suffocation of his entirety that is continued to be expressed throughout Firth's performance and even his costume design as well. His thick rimmed black glasses and tightly fitted suit smother and suppress his being, his values and his ideals. His true orientation can never be revealed in public. It is beneath his cold performance as the professor at work that one uncovers the very same man who is extremely charming and suave, sometimes funny and capable of impressing the most distant strangers. It is also the vulnerability and the anger shown briefly, but imposingly, which makes this very fine performance truly emotional. Julianne Moore has a small but pivotal role as Charley and her character is suitably frivolous, while also providing a critical point of conflict for George's ideals. Hoult has matured considerably since his early role in About a Boy and he is solid here as the student who gradually breaks through the barriers of George, without ever overtly stating his intentions.This is a small and largely uneventful film, but it is still one that will hold great significance for those who can sympathise with George's values and ideals, as well as his consuming grief. Firth's performance is a subtle and complex one that demonstrates the frustration of suppression and a sense of anguish that builds inside of him. When Ford chooses to focus on this performance, rather than his own artistic flair, one understands the power and skill of Firth to provide this film with the emotional core that the story deserves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tom Ford, previously a player in the fashion industry, makes his directorial debut with "A Single Man", based on Christopher Isherwood's novel about a homosexual professor's having to deal with the sudden death of his partner. George Falconer (Colin Firth) is a closeted British teacher in 1962 Los Angeles who spends an entire day contemplating his future now that his soul mate has gotten killed in a car wreck.This is not just a "gay movie" as it were. George is not at all flamboyant. Rather, the film looks at the world that George inhabits, and how it relates to his past and future. His only true confidant is Charlotte (Julianne Moore), an acquaintance from London who also has her own issues. The setting in the midst of the Cuban Missile Crisis (despite taking place after the latter had passed) clearly mirrors George's personal horror.This is definitely a movie that I recommend. Like "Brokeback Mountain", it shows how the character's fear of being openly gay has damaged him. It appears that what ends up happening was building up for years. Director Ford knows how to balance the plot, narration and visuals (a world of bouffant-haired women) perfectly. I wholeheartedly recommend "A Single Man".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deeply personal story told with impersonal detachment...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A SINGLE MAN lacks the single most important factor it needed to draw the viewer in--sympathy. Instead, we get an impersonal view of the story with occasional flashbacks and a feeling of detachment toward our main character. COLIN FIRTH plays the character with casual restraint and stiff upper lip as he goes about systematically preparing his own demise after his partner of sixteen years has died in an auto accident.The humanity of the man is shown only on a very superficial level. So are the characters surrounding him--including JULIANNE MOORE as a nearby neighbor with whom he once had a casual affair. She too is caught up in her own sorrowful existence, unable to give him the solace he needs because he's still pining for his gentle partner.NICHOLAS HOULT is appealing as the young student who seems obviously infatuated with Firth (whom he keeps calling "Sir" no matter how intimate their conversation gets), but the scenes between him and Firth lead eventually toward nothing--and the ending is not only unsatisfying but completely unexpected, as though the writers couldn't decide how to craft a more relevant ending for the story.After so many glowing reviews here and elsewhere, I was prepared for a much more insightful story and was very much disappointed, given the talent on display here. I don't think Firth, talented as he is, gave a performance worthy of an Oscar nomination.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Single Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The biggest reason to see this film for me was to see if I would agree with the fact that the leading actor was nominated the Academy Award, and of course I did. Basically, set in the 1960's, English Professor George Falconer (BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Colin Firth), originally from Britain, is living in Los Angeles and isn't feeling like his life is pointless. Eight months ago his partner of sixteen years, Jim (Matthew Goode), died in a car accident, and Jim's family weren't planning on telling George, or having him at the funeral. Deciding that he doesn't want to live anymore, George first wants to spend a last day getting things in order before he commits suicide in the evening. As he gets everything ready for the potential suicide, bullets for his gun and a resting spot in his house, he reminisces about his time with Jim. But also, as he spends time with people who see that he is not his usual chirpy self, he sees that there is actually beauty in the world when you look closer. People including Spanish immigrant, aspiring actor and gigolo Carlos (Jon Kortajarena), his best friend also from England who secretly lusts for him despite him being gay, Charley (Golden Globe nominated Julianne Moore), and English student Kenny Porter (About a Boy's Nicholas Hoult) who is overly curious about his teacher, maybe in a loving way. It eventually comes to the point when George is going to commit suicide, but after a few interruptions it looks like he may have changed his mind, but he still dies from a natural heart attack. Also starring Paulette Lamori as Alva, Ryan Simpkins as Jennifer Strunk, Ginnifer Goodwin as Mrs. Strunk, Teddy Sears as Mr. Strunk, Paul Butler as Christopher Strunk and Aaron Sanders as Tom Strunk. Firth does very well as the gay and not wanting to live anymore teacher, Moore does an impeccable English accent, and Hoult does an impeccable American accent. I think the really clever thing about the film is that the colour is really faded/tinted, and when something meant to be beautiful happens the colour goes really vibrant. As an overall film, it is not so much suspenseful, you just keep watching to see what Firth is going to do next, so it is a really likable drama. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Costume Design, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score for Abel Korzeniowski. Good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heart-felt adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walking out of the cinema after seeing this film I was actually choked up and could hardly get any words out of my mouth, such was the level of emotion I felt. It's about an Englishman, George (played by Colin Firth) who is an English professor at a university in Los Angeles. He lost his long term lover in an accident and has been suicidal for some long time. It's set in the era of the Cuban missile crisis, and political and social conformism. The time frame of the movie is the day in his life when he decides to commit suicide. It's a very tender beautiful movie. I never expected to be so moved by the film. I'm possibly the most incredibly unfashionable person ever, and actually, at the age of nearly thirty, and despite some affluence, still wear, almost exclusively, clothes bought for me by other people and family cast-offs. So it was going to be a hard job for fashion icon, and Gucci dynamo, here turned director, Tom Ford to convince me that there is some merit to fashion as a consolatory philosophy. You can see though that for George (Colin Firth) in this movie, the elegant, neatly stored shirt and ties he wears are like armour. Recently I fell in (unrequited) love with a wonderful young lady at work and have had a difficult time going through the daily motions (much like George). I've recently bought a (ludicrously expensive - eek!) Ralph Lauren shirt with black and white stripes. Now, whenever I feel like I'm going to have difficulty just existing, and firing off the emails, I wear the smart shirt. Helps me feel like I'm not part of a blue-shirted tap-tapping slave-force. Like George I'm also a perma-singleton and can testify to the devastation that the state wreaks on the soul. I think part of what this movie is about is trying to rise above that state and still manage to see the beauty in life, even if that be the dirty beauty of a sunset through smog, twisting the night away with an old friend, or the kindness of a few others.The two key ingredients of the movie's success outside of fashion considerations, are the ending, which I won't reveal, and the acting of Colin Firth, which is simply a revelation to me (I'm probably the last one to join that camp).It was a little unusual that the three men we George with in this movie have fashion model looks. I felt it might be a little more believable if they were less beautiful. As well there was a black and white scene that was reminiscent of a perfume advert. Minor complaints in a movie that was pretty much a triumph.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually Striking Character Study</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Ford makes an excellent film debut here, his experience in both fashion and photography is something clear throughout the entire film, as seen through the crisp images, interesting choices of camera focus (primarily body parts, eyes, mouth, chest, etc.) and the use of beautiful people, essentially runway models. I would say the film is essentially about two things, the inner mental struggle of a grieving man (Colin Firth) and a visual aesthetic that revisits the look of the 60's through a modern lens. Another thing that stands out to me in this film is its marvelous soundtrack. Abel Korzeniowski and Shigeru Umebayashi do a marvelous job with this one. Every track is perfectly suiting for the mood of the film, and overall the scores these men have written are beautiful orchestral pieces worth listening to on their own.Though I have been stressing the visuals and sound of the film I should note that Colin Firth and Julliane Moore give wonderful performances. Firth seems to easily fit the role that Ford handpicked him for as he constantly wears a slightly subdued expression of unease and disconnect, giving him the sense of being not quite in the moment at almost any moment in the film. The moments when Firth allows his character to feel again and connect with the world around him make this film shine.Overall this is a great film worthy of seeing, I only rate it 8 and not 9 because of a few minor problems I had with what I would deem authenticity issues with Nicholas Hoult. Go out and see the film though, it's well worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moving and beautiful, sometimes affectedly, but Firth and Isherwood rise far above</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Single Man (2009)A beautiful story, based on the novel by under appreciated writer, Christopher Isherwood (whose Berlin Stories, a collection of two 1930s works, are a favorite of mine). And given depth in a rare performance by Colin Firth, well cast, well done. The panoply of secondary actors is excellent, from Julianne Moore to several men cast as lovers or potential lovers to the main character. But it is Firth's George, no last name, who commands our sympathies--and being sympathetic is key. We really care about him as things clarify over a very brief time how he has gotten to his despair, and why it seems reasonable that he can't get out. With more subtlety and honesty than many other films about men in love, A Single Man breaks important ground about pre-Stonewall America. The time is the early 1960s, with many and multi-layered flashbacks, all kept cogent.The filming, that is, the directorial choices by Tom Ford in his first film, are striking and rather complex. Besides the interweaving of time periods there is a use of several kinds of color, from black and white to vivid color to a muted zone between. This makes for an effective, if sometimes designerly, flow through it all. There is no sense of restraint when it comes to being deep and romantic, which I liked in general. The music alternates between plaintive viola and chamber scores to evocative period music. The dialog is filled with innuendo and declarations of love or, in a parallel, loneliness. There are close-ups of eyes and faces in a way that is both commanding and sometimes deflecting--we are sometimes forced to see the filming rather than what is being filmed and why.This might be the one main distraction here. The director forces artsiness on the movie which might have either gone further (requiring a fuller artfulness) or not as far (removing the most affected parts for the benefit of the emotional content of the actor's performances). This struck me even in the opening shots, which at first seem beautiful and elegantly sad, but which soon repeat and seem to parrot other movies which have done better, with more economy, and with stronger purpose. Here it is all metaphor. Related to this, for me, is an awkwardness in the blocking, especially when an actor is naked and we aren't supposed to see certain private areas. Rather than doing this subtly (or not doing it at all), we sense instead that the actor isn't moving normally, as though he is aware of the camera. The actor is, of course, aware of the camera, but the character is not supposed to be. A small point, maybe, but the little intrusions of film-making craft matter in a movie that parades its craft as one of its strengths. As a final nail in this small argument, notice the scene near the end with Firth and Moore on a couch. It's so badly edited it's offputting, with arms changing position from one cut to the next.Not that I expect more, really, because so much is so right. There are many beautiful moments, and the whole tone and intent of the narrative plot is stunning, necessary stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Falconer has a great life. Or, at least, it would seem so. He lives in a fashionable, upscale neighborhood, near cheerfully photogenic neighbors, in a stylish glass-and-wood house that seems directly out of Architectural Digest. He drives a sporty little Mercedes. He dresses in fashionable, conservative clothes. He is articulate and dryly humorous, assets in his profession as a literature teacher at a southern California college where he is liked and respected by his uniformly clean-cut students. And though he is discreet and low-key about his homosexuality, he seems fairly comfortable with his closet door being slightly ajar; surprisingly open seeing as how the time is November of 1962.But George isn't happy. His lover of 16 years, Jim, died suddenly eight months previously, and George has been walking around in a fog of bereavement ever sense. On the particular day that A SINGLE MAN is set-- November 30 -- George is planning to end the evening and his life by committing suicide. That is pretty much what A SINGLE MAN is all about, George spending the day trying to tie up the loose ends of his existence so that his death won't leave behind too much of a mess ? well, no more of a mess than a bullet though his brain would surely cause.Directed, co-produced and co-written by fashion designer Tom Ford, based on a book by Christopher Isherwood, A SINGLE MAN is a tasteful, somewhat understated, occasionally amusing slice-of-life (or slice-of-death?). George, as played by Colin Firth, tries to go through his day doing all the things that are expected of him, while working out the bits and pieces of business necessary to carrying out his suicide. Like cleaning out his safety deposit box and buying bullets for his gun. He has a pleasant, but lively dinner with his gal-pal best friend (and one-time lover) Charley (Julianne Moore). He has a nice friendly chat with a Spanish male prostitute (Jon Kortajarena) who casually tries to pick him up. And he has several encounters with Kenny (Nicholas Hoult), a handsome, preppy student who is all too obviously flirting with him and also all too obviously eager to consummate their relationship. Indeed, the aggressive, persistent and sweetly sincere Kenny looks as though he could be George's rescuing angel. Maybe, or maybe not.All of this is told in quiet, elegant good taste. Ford captures, if not the feel of the 1960's, then at least the feel of early 1960's advertising. George's neighbors look as though the are posing for ads featuring typical Americans from Life or Look magazine. Scenes are frequently shot in choreographed slow motion. Sudden close ups suggest new wave cinema. Ford has an eye for a certain artful look. Perhaps it is just a bit too artful for it's own good, as it never really gets very deep into either the mind or the soul of George. Ford tends to fixate on the superficial look of George's existence. If the film didn't pause now and again to work in flashbacks of his life with Jim (Matthew Goode), it would be difficult for the viewer to immediately realize George's ultimate goal.But you do care for George. He is a nice man, a decent man and a truly sympathetic character. Firth's subtle performance gently seduces the viewer. As the entire film is designed to build up to his final choice ? will he or won't he end it all ? - it is clear where our sympathies lie. Making the film's twist ending all the more disagreeable. George makes his choice ? then the story mocks that choice. A story that would have been complete and satisfying with a shot of George's suicide note to Charley burning in the fire place, instead continues on to show us that George's decision just didn't matter. Just as George is cheated out of the power of his choice, the viewer is punished for being foolish enough to care. A story about a gay man trying to take control of his destiny instead shifts gears suddenly to be a tragedy about life's cruel indifference to fairness and the ultimate fragility of existence. Whatever point the ending is trying to make is lost in the film's misplaced sense of irony. What could have been a bittersweetly uplifting drama instead becomes just another example of a gay man dying as apparent punishment for this sexuality. And what could have been inspiring, ends up being as retro in its thinking as it is in its sense of style.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really good artistic piece of American cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've said this many times and I'll say it again, "The importing thing is how you tell it". So, that being said, There is no problem within this film fanatics mind with Clichés (Wich by the way are considered so because they work and always have worked, it mainly depends on how they are used), stories told more than once or with familiar places.In the case of A Single Man, we have all this beautifully told, with great poetic cinematography and direction. Amazing performances and outstanding music, resulting in a great and really simple but depressive story brilliantly executed, with grace, calm and beauty above all.Don't care if it reminds in any way to "American Beauty", which in my case it didn't but I see here that to many it did, thats a great film to be compared to, so If i was the director I'd actually see that as an honor, even if those who compare it don't intend to do so.A single man is a great piece of American cinema, specially when it delivers such great but calm pace in times when everything, specially the movies, are always in a rush. I believe this film is an excellent reminder that it still is possible to create good non independent cinema in the U.S with out it having to be a big budget. It's basically a really good artistic, sensible and well thought piece of American cinema at its best. Oh and MAN was this a really sensual and erotic piece, and I'm not even gay... :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm not handsome enough to see this movie, I had to sneak in.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fashion all-star Tom Ford's directorial debut is an adaptation of Christopher Isherwood's landmark novel A Single Man. Set in 1962 (and brought to life by the production design crew responsible for the razor-sharp Mad Men series), the film stars Colin Firth as George, a gay English professor living in Santa Monica, trying and failing to deal with the loss of his lover of 16 years. He visits with his friend up the road, the similarly bereft Charley (Julianne Moore), and is pursued by a student, the young Kenny (Nicholas Hoult). Deeply romantic and with an absolutely vicious attention to period detail, Ford's film at time seems like a (surprisingly pleasant) extension of a mid-90's cologne ad into an hour-and-a-half-long film. Everyone in it is physically stunning, occasionally to the point of distraction as I'm not sure they made men as waifishly thin as the Prada-ad model-gaunt liquor-store parking lot boy in cuffed jeans George runs into. George's apartment and car and clothes are all precise and perfectly tailored and matte and incredibly expensive ? we are to assume that George's deceased partner was the breadwinner, I assume ? and he moves through it with the preoccupation and handsome distraction of a man remembering an old lover's smell. George lies in a flashback in ridiculous repose on a jagged German Expressionist rock, an afternoon dalliance in the desert of sad memories or something like that. It gets a little ridiculous, but in the exact absolutely pleasurable way that fashion photography is ridiculous. If I knew George, I'd find him insufferable. I'd much rather be George. Ford and Firth's quiet, lush detailing of George's desperate grief attacks head-on the issue of gay rights by being adamantly anti-polemical. That George is gay is both intrinsic to the story and utterly inconsequential: aside from being beautiful and looking like it cost hundreds of thousands of dollars his sadness is normal, and ordinary, and real, and that Firth manages it so well is unsurprisingly the true grace of the film. He is one of the best actors working, and is perfect in the role. The effectiveness of Ford's film rests entirely on Firth, and his subtlety is perfect. It's slow, and measured and at times, it's dull, Ford's film reawakens what's become lately an unfortunately idle idea in cinema: that there is pleasure to be found in looking at handsome people. Firth, looking thinner than normal, is jaw-droppingly handsome, in his narrow suit and big glasses, in his nice car and beautiful home. There are moments in the film, such as the one when George sits looking into the smoggy sunrise that are as true in a way to the heart of cinema, the heart that's not voyeuristic but artistic and beautiful, in a way that has been almost forgotten. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An American film with European sensitivity, finally.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Ford's exquisitely perceptive effort of a Christopher Isherwood story here is not to be lost on the homophobes who won't see it, and the more enlightened among us know that love is love no matter with whom and is a delicate gift easily lost by anyone, as was seen in this so touching and painful early 1960's story of a gay L.A. small college professor played by Colin Firth. It showed all too well that we are lucky in life to find true love even once as George did here, no matter the gender preference, and that it is always something to which we should everlastingly aspire even when it is the very last thing we think we could ever do again after our hearts are broken, as George also felt. Even though George had his one great love Jim taken from him in a heartbeat, he had not learned yet in life that one can treasure what was shared earlier and lost and still gain back hope for future happiness with another. Most of us learn that hard lesson somewhere in life, or suffer greatly as George did in his until he found his fateful answer.Colin Firth has been on the brink of stardom since his powerful turn in "Girl With A Pearl Earring" and this may/should be his breakout film, but one never knows about a film that surely will play as poorly in Peoria as it plays strongly in San Francisco. This film is for the cities and for the critics and for other sensitives wandering the anonymous heartland with antennae alert enough to spot greatness and meaning in a subdued and graceful piece that will never achieve high box office success, but will be known as a creative success by those who care about the heartfelt love and life story it needed to tell to so many.Julianne Moore was at her best overt, unselfconscious self as George's liberated but lonely Best Female Friend Charley who wanted more from a treasured past affair with George well before he learned enough about himself to choose a different love path.If life happens as it should, as George said it does, then maybe this film ended as it should have, but I sure wanted it to allow George at least an alternate choice of reprieve from his torture that crippled him until nearly the last minutes of his life. Sadly, that was not to be, but George did find blessed peace in the end and that is really all we all will ever get no matter how well or poorly we live our lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clichéd</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I told myself at the start of this film that if the director had the male lead remove his glasses (to indicate in a clichéd manner that the character was becoming less of a "nerd") that I was going to walk out. Well, the glasses were removed, as I expected, but it was so near the end of the movie that I persevered.Two general classes of film are worth watching in my estimation. The very good and the very poor. The attraction of the latter is that they are such a rich source of criticism. You can wallow in the failures -- and this film has plenty.A woeful toilet scene. Obligatory in European films but badly handled by Hollywood, and in this case simply unnecessary. Included to extract some mindless laughs: man on toilet ducks his head when he sees female neighbour looking at him from across the yard (audience laughs on cue). Then he answers the phone with his pants down (audience laughs again).A practice suicide scene comes across as botched. Did the director really plan this as a humorous sequence? The audience tittered half-heartedly, not really knowing what to make of it. If the director planned this scene to be played straight, then the tittering betrayed it as a complete failure. And even if he did plan it as a humorous scene, where's the empathy for a person contemplating suicide? Either way it's a failure -- either of intent or empathy.The Foley artists had a field day with this movie. Listen for the crickets every time the sun goes down. There are even crickets indoors.This film is a litany of clichés. It has no warmth and shows little respect or understanding for the difficulties faced by the male lead. Its aim is to woo viewers with slick images, shallow emotions, and a few cheap laughs to lighten the supposed serious intent. It is a manipulative movie with few redeeming features. Let me mention the only one: the scene where a student is able to prevent an intended suicide by leaning in a car window and simply talking to a person in crisis. A touching moment in an otherwise barren film.I turned to my partner when the glasses were removed and said to her: "I was intending to walk out if he did that". She said: "You've misunderstood. This is a flashback to his younger days." It slowly dawned on her during the ensuing minutes that it wasn't a flashback. Just like the gratuitous toilet scene, this was just another example of a director lost for originality who felt he had to make the male lead "groovier" for the ending of the movie, by the overused expedient of removing his glasses.A disappointment. So much talent, time, and money wasted in attempting mass appeal instead of honest story telling. It is a real pity that directors dumb down their films to try and sway their audiences.</fullReview>

Plus he has no medical nor narcotic background to be so down as he is. I get that losing someone you love can wreck you, but not in his way. The compulsive order he puts things in is unnatural to me, I don't know any (gay) men that live in that way. It makes it hard to connect with the story. The aesthetics is just good film-making, but not genius. Plus some errors were made. Eg. in case of a heart attack, it is your left arm that hurts, not your right one.In short, its overdone.

		<shortDescription>Dated, tepid drama, masked by brilliant, arresting, visual Tour de force</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First-time director Tom Ford (a fashion designer by trade) has made a visually arresting film based on an old Christopher Isherwood novel. The film is so well shot and the art design department does such a great job of recreating 1962 Los Angeles, you kind of feel guilty criticizing the film, based on the weak screenplay.The plot of 'A Single Man' is minimal. Colin Firth is George, a college English professor, who has just learned that his ex-lover, Jim, has been killed in a car crash. George's emotional state begins spiraling downward. One of George's students, Kenny, attempts to befriend him but George is too distraught over Jim's death to initially show much interest. A young man from Spain attempts to pick George up but he too is rebuffed. George seeks solace from his good friend, Charley (Julianne Moore) who he's known for years. In a fit of jealousy, Charley implies that George's love for Jim was really a 'substitute' for true (heterosexual) love. George angrily rejects Charley's insinuation but they manage to calm down and patch things up.Finally, George realizes that killing himself is not a good idea and that his life is worth living. He accepts Kenny's invitation to go swimming in the ocean and then brings the young man back to his house. However, Kenny merely falls asleep on the couch and nothing intimate transpires between them. Ironically, at the moment that George finally admits to himself that his life is good, he has a heart attack and dies.There is very little dramatic tension in 'A Single Man'. I kind of hoped something would happen between Kenny and George but nothing really does. The biggest dramatic moment in the film is George's argument with Charley and her accusation that somehow his love with Jim wasn't genuine. Charley knows that George has been gay for years but still cannot accept the fact that their sexual relationship never blossomed. That's why it's hard to believe that such a good friend as Charley would make such an insensitive comment. In real life, people usually 'move on' once it's established that a relationship has become platonic.The sight of two men kissing each other and the even bigger idea that gay people can have normal, loving relationships, might have been shocking when the novel came out in 1964, but 'A Single Man' (the movie) feels dated today.In addition to the grand cinematography, 'A Single Man' has a stellar cast and a soundtrack that reminded me at times of Hitchcock's 'Vertigo' (in reading the closing credits, I noticed Tom Ford utilized a piece by Bernard Hermann, the composer who Hitchcock used for a number of his films including 'Vertigo' and 'Psycho').Despite the dazzling visual style of this film, nothing can save the tepid storyline which is dated and lacks dramatic punch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie blew me away. For some time, at least. The suits, the house, the hair, the car, the grass on the lawn - suave like an Esquire advertisement come alive. Colin Firth subtly shows the struggles that professor George Falconer goes through after the loss of his love, while his long time friend Jennifer (Julianne Moore) longs back to glory days and one of his students is interested in more than just the professor's literature course. But then, after ten minutes or so, when the stage is set and the characters adequately sketched, the scenario writer was probably replaced by a writer of Harlequin romantic books, because the dialogue turns awful and there are a dubious number of obsolete (homo- )romantic/erotic scenes. Even worse, the pace slows down to zero. Sure, both Jennifer and the student make their move, and Mr. Firth contemplates "being quiet" for the weekend and beyond. However, it's all in such a glacial pace that I nearly yelled to the screen: "What's wrong with you" when Mr. Firth inquires for the umptieth time why the student has come over, and when violins are put on repeat while Mr. Firth shows his eternal grief into the camera. I would prefer the Esquire since I can leaf through it, which does not take forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Firth's Best Work Singled Out...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First time writer/director Tom Ford, adapts the novel by Christopher Isherwood, A Single Man starring Colin Firth, Julianne Moore, and Matthew Goode.When College Professor George (Firth) loses his lover Jim (Goode) to a tragic accident while visiting his family, George endures a high level of depression and despair. Not even his long time friend Charley (Moore), who has a heavy drinking hand, knows the depth of his pain. But when he encounters a student with a seemingly high zest for learning (Nicholas Hoult), George may have got more than he bargained for.The artistic integrity and liberties taken by Ford here are some of the best by a debut director in quite sometime. Ford knows his material and knows his power in the directing chair. Though at times, the film can drag and lag throughout, there's no denying the velocity and vulnerability given by the actors, more notably, Colin Firth.In the performance of his career, Firth examines a man with no will to go on to the next stage of his life. As he loses his world in a single whim, his day in Los Angeles could not seem more empty. Firth executes this feeling with poise and veracity. Mostly worn on his heartrending features, Firth knows no boundaries of an actor. He goes after each feeling and emotion with effortless rage and honorably cruelty.Julianne Moore, in her brief screen time, is magical and utterly charismatic in her role of Charley. She's tender and jovial but under the layers lies a completely devastating performance, one that Oscar can hopefully take note of this awards season. After the film's heart wrenching ending, you'll take Moore's character home with you, completely distraught and hoping for safety.Matthew Goode, completely warm in his respective role is memorable and gives his all in his minimal viewing on screen. Hoult is an extraordinary talent with many great roles ahead of him in the future.In the end however, Ford's decisions with cinematography by Eduard Guau are the true achievement of the film. Aside from the breathtaking works by Firth and Moore, the cinematography stands out as brilliant piece of cinema style. He's made a stamp for himself early on in his venture into cinema.The narrative is slow and at times dreary, but performers will pull you through along with a decent score, A Single Man gets the job done with truth and candor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Drama? Really?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film last night on Sundance and came away thinking it was a documentary or reality show.The only redeeming value in the film was the appearance of Julianne Moore. This movie was released in 2009 and her face and figure hasn't changed much since the late 80's when she appeared nude in 'Short Cuts,' both front and back, wearing only a shirt while washing and ironing a party dress that had become soiled. I thought that was a cute and innocent scene. I was amused when Matthew Modine's character said with gusto...'you're not wearing panties!' My God, she's his wife; he acted so naive but he is a great actor as is Moore.In 'A Single Man' Moore fakes a British accent wonderfully. She ranks right up there with Julia Roberts, Cate Blanchett, Meryl Streep and Nicole Kidman, the latter being my favorite, when it comes to acting ability. Why do I like Kidman? She'll take on any role and take her clothes off when necessary; plus, she's drop dead ten beautiful. Why wouldn't a virile man want to see her naked (preferably in person); same for Julianne Moore.So, back to 'A Single Man.' Colin Firth is a fine actor; seems to fit well playing a homosexual male. I really like gays because they are bright, good looking and, for every gay man, that's one more woman for me. Lesbians? I have never met a lesbian I didn't like. Gays and lesbians are so intelligent, I can talk to them for hours. They don't talk about family and show me pictures of their kids, bragging about Tom or Julie graduating from Notre Dame and holding a six figure job. When I talk about my own life, they don't retort with comments about their lives. Why can't gay people be heterosexual? They are so much more interesting than the people I usually encounter. Perhaps I should move back to a big city.I guess there is redeeming value to this film. I contradicted myself based upon my opening remarks. Being gay can be difficult. It is a complex lifestyle. I learned that from this film, so I raised the rating from a '5' to a '7.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tom Ford's dreamy creation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very untypical movie, mainly because of the fact that the man responsible for directing it was previously known only as a high-end fashion empire's creator. A Single Man deals with homosexuality and its struggle to gain support during the post-war era in the USA. But it's mainly a sad story about human's inability to cope with a sudden departure of a loved one. It's very slow-paced, with a lot of quiet sequences made to present its very sorrowful tone. The general presentation, in a highly graceful manner, makes it appear as an independent art movie, reserved for a specific group of viewers.This movie is as stylish as Tom Ford's clothing collections. He took care of everything, from the smallest details. The interior designs are subtle and very modern, the clothes are high-class. Even the ways the actors speak make the dialogues seem like an artistic flow of carefully chosen sentences. And the Californian aura is so fantastically pleasant to look at; it almost makes you want to be there.In its very subtle art form it delivers a notion so profound, that it's almost shocking. Within the visually beautiful and dream-like cinematography you can actually feel the tenderness and overwhelming grief coming from the main character, George. During his last day on Earth (he intends to commit suicide later on) he travels around town and meets many very different people. There is his friend from England, Charley, who tries to help him cope with the loss and in the meantime wants to strengthen the bond between them and make him ignorantly fall in love with her. Then there is also Kenny, a teenager on the verge of discovering his true sexuality. Through all of the encounters George tries to remember how wonderfully he felt like near the departed Jim and that the hole in his heart can never be filled.Colin Firth did a really good job as the protagonist. The grievous show that he puts on, with the help of his rich assortment of mimicry abilities, makes his performance believable. And even though he seems phlegmatic at times, in this artistic visage he is like some divine creature purposely meant to be damned for eternity.It's a very true story that every one on of can relate to at some point. There are many different ways of dealing with death of someone close to us. Some will probably recover after, some will not. Then there are those, who will respond with the most extreme thoughts. But sometimes even in the darkest moment there is always a possibility of encountering someone or something that will make one believe there is another purpose to stay alive for a little longer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a stunning movie in every aspect.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>EDITEDGeorge Falconer (Colin Firth) feels lost. Not only is he still grieving the death of his longtime companion, Jim (Matthew Goode), but he's also a Brit teaching English at a California college. He's so distraught with heartbreak that he's decided to kill himself, and proceeds to get all his affairs in order while carrying on with what otherwise would be a normal day. He gives an unusually forceful lecture to his class, revealing enough that a perceptive student, Kenny (Nicholas Hoult), senses something is wrong with the professor; collects his important financial papers from his bank; buys bullets for a handgun he owns; and makes a visit to his best friend (Julianne Moore). But throughout these methodical preparations, George keeps running into people -- a colleague's daughter, a attractive gay hustler, and the sympathetic Kenny -- who offer him glimpses of why he should stay alive.Starring, Colin Firth, Julianne Moore, Nicholas Hoult, Matthew Goode, Jon Kortajarena , Paulette Lamori , Ryan Simpkins , Ginnifer Goodwin , Teddy Sears , Paul Butler , Aaron Sanders.Directed by first time director Tom Ford who was is a well known fashion designer too.Nominated for 1 Oscar, Best Lead Actor for Colin Firth. he won that years Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival.so this is a drama based on a novel. this is story of a man George Falconer who is a a depressed gay British university professor living in Southern California in 1962. the movie shows him coping with the death of his long time partner Jim. he died in an accident but George survived. he is now very sad and depressed and feels like nothing is left in this world, he is broke down the whole world seem to have crashed down for him, he tries to continue with his routine but can't stop himself from thinking about him. just can't seem to move on. he tries to take his life. will he? or not?this is a stylish and visually striking film making of the first rate. a superbly crafted movie by a first time director Tom Ford. this is one of the best movies of 2009 and a really satisfying one too. this may not be the kind of movie to everyone but it just superbly moved me. i think more and more Fashion designers should make movies because their fashion sense comes strikingly vivid in every aspect of their film making.Colin Firth was on the top of the list of every award and festival circuit and this movie was loved mostly because of him. though his performance as a King coping with himself was great but for some reasons i think he should have gotten an Oscar for this movie. he performed far more stunningly in this movie. deeply sad and masterful acting performance. you will get blown away from his tour de force performance. he strikes the screen with his superb presence. his stare his look his thoughts and his actions reflect so much. outstanding performance. Julianne Moore was strikingly astounding in this movie. the moment i saw the first look of this movie, she struck me so much. i thought she will get an Oscar nomination once again, but unfortunately that didn't happen. she was really good. i thought better than her few nominated previous performances. Matthew Goode is amazingly looking guy, i like him a lot. other supporting cast were good. they literally act as supporting figures in his life too at that time. trying to remind and feel him of the life's beauty while not letting him to do anything with himself.Direction though may have slight flaws is easily to ignore, alos because it was his first movie. superb direction with an eye to look things in their very deepness to easily figure about between the beauty and bluntness of life and the story of this movie. Screenplay was good. editing was nice and art direction, cinematography and costumes were stunningly outstanding. also the background score was excellent.a visually stunning and striking movie with a deeply saddened and emotional tone. superb work. must see this movie. it is just so beautiful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A single man's thoughts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is some time now I saw the film, and not unlike many of the reviewers I had a craving way before it played on the screens. Before watching I was absurdly sure I would write something here about it; but after I saw it, the urge somehow vanished. The film did not grow on me; I do not think this applies to the case. Yet a very pervasive, though elusive sense, seemed to me stubbornly, and at the same time repressively, there, that made the film an experience very hard to pin down.That the film feels like a diagonal autobiography of his auteur, is I think beyond dispute, though the rough part is defining in what way this happens: of course a director is more or less involved in a kind of abstract autobiography through his choices, but something unprecedented happens here I think.I think of the great Tadao Ando's undertaking of Tom Ford's mausoleum: a disproportionate gesture for common mortals. A whiff of a somewhat burnt smell, also, in that what fits appropriately the movie is that sense of thanatography, running against the common biographical thread; through the cinematic choices' seams the sense comes off of the film being a self-portrait in death: I have rarely encountered a film that constantly purveys the sense of bodily entrapment and imminent slight shock in each encounter with a beautiful face. Yes, I think it is mostly a very modern sense of being trapped in the body more than a case of chaste lust, abstract beauty, glossed on due to Tom Ford's former profession, that is communicated with each 'subjective shot', especially the ones concerning the young student, as if to make us identify with Firth's awe.And yet, the film is also ironic towards him, especially in the shocking, saddening, and still so resignedly adult end. What are we to make of this approach? The film tantalizes us, and perhaps is tantalized by itself, towards which scale will it choose concerning its involvement in its principal character: sympathize with him, or reflect upon him? I think the meeting point of this particular perspective is us: will we reflect upon our situation, sympathize with our predicament? The film never gets self-indulgent in matters of mourning. That is something we should consider in front of the usually mentioned target of the film's disproportionate sheen. Where these two things get blurred is by the third party of apprentice touch of how to emphasize things with the use of "underwater-naked-body" that is so common; these three points do not produce a triangular level, to say it like this, but are rather blurred by the third one.Take the opening scene, the first the naked-body theme, to call it that, is used: along with the scene that comes next, that is the imaginary visit to the place of the car accident, it sets a quasi-metaphorical tone, that is scandalously and deliciously torn when, in a few minutes, the everyday drabness of sitting on the toilet rim is plainly presented; so much for metaphorical flights, the feeling seems to be, though it was in need of some polishing, I think. Still, it foregrounds adequately the trapped-in-the-body sense.Colin Firth underplays the (director's) autobiographical tension superbly; he knows where he is, the undercurrent, the subtlety, he is a master of perspectives, which allows him a variety of responses that is amazing. Also, it is a fine metaphor for the cunning of acting, where exquisite nuance can meet wild improvisation: I am thinking of the scene he tries to commit suicide in the sleeping bag, arguably the most elegant object in the whole film, where comic understatement has a mannerism and a fierceness that is matched only in the unexpected end. It is as if, in the end, you can't resign quickly enough from life, or beauty; it is only that life has other plans for you, like a heart attack since you had second thoughts about killing yourself. That this effect is retroactively diffusive is perhaps, just another bitter irony from which the eternal youth of beauty shines through, and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film by an artist from another field (fashion design) is hit out of the ball park!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this was the most amazing film. It portrayed passionate love in a rare and immaculately sensitive way. I liked the beauty of the entire film...the sets, costumes, actors, script, story. Beautifully cast. Colin Firth was absolutely stellar. I think he should have received the Academy Award for best actor in a dramatic role.I also thought that Before Night Falls by Julian Schnabel was another unique and incredibly beautiful film of great emotional depth. Perhaps there is something to films made by artists who come to film via another art form. I highly recommend this movie to people who like beauty and romance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great Colin Firth's role in visually enjoyable images</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From its very first images A Single Man shows that it is more than obvious that this film has been made by a fashion designer. Take by take Tom Ford has succeeded to transmit his pedantic vision of things to the cameraman and later to the spectator. Every image to the last one is beautiful in the sense of colors, of decorations and so on to the tiniest details. Maybe sometimes it is too perfect, too neat, but you can't blame him for that!The "next best thing" that makes this movie so enjoyable is, no doubt, Colin Firth. As not an expert of his acting career, it was pleasant to see him in a slightly different role, not again the "mr-darcy-like grumpy, who after all is very romantic". Nevertheless, in this movie the Colin Firth character still keeps him for himself. Only some dreamlike flash-backs gives a look what's going on in his head. Altogether, quite a touching combination and a realistic one, speaking of loss of the loved one ? exterior numbness and interior agony. Colin Firth here is more than capable to give a beautiful combination of both. Relatively small amount of dialogs adds the value ? spoken out feelings have the tendency to become less worthy. What concerns Julianne Moore, she looks as beautiful as always, but the role somehow didn't move me as I think it was meant to. In some strange way Charley's character reminded me a bit Barbara's character from Savage Grace. Also all lonely and pathetic, but somehow undone. But perhaps it's Colin Firth who steals all the attention...As for a débutant in directing, Ford has done a great job, not forgetting to "thank" in some way the grands of the cinema, such as Kubrick and good old Hitchcock. Ford also couldn't resist the temptation to play a bit with the iconic Dean/Brando figure, which adds some kind of sexiness in the grim world of Firth's George. It's all beautifully done, and fits in very organically, but still, leaves us with the feeling that "we have seen this already" . The same thing with the dialogs, though, sometimes they're smart and touching, sometimes they're not smart at all, reminding some petty clichés. Though, all the imperfections are nothing but minor details, A Single Man by itself is a very beautifully done movie, which happens not so often. Respectful thanks to Tom Ford and, hope he does not stop his directing here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visual poetry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a curious bond between film and fashion design: both are fundamentally visual art forms. Before the addition of sound in the late 1920's, motion pictures were just that: moving images, pure visuals in essence. Unlike in novels or plays, the film medium forced artists to tell their stories visually, and to use words sparingly. In a similar manner, fashion design can also tell stories, although the types of stories woven into clothes are far more abstract than the more straightforward plots of films. Another element that ties the two together is that both film-making and fashion design are worlds in which art is directly tied with profit making: no matter how strong or deep the artistic ambitions of the work, at the end of the day, your goal is to sell tickets/clothes. This commercial element separates both film and fashion design from the other fine art forms. And what better a marriage of these two worlds than to have an established fashion designer direct a motion picture.And the results more than show: A Single Man is a deliciously visual film, in which Ford seems far less interested in telling a story through words, and instead, shifts his focus to establishing a mood, a character, emotions and feelings and thoughts are all mixed up in a primordial soup of images. Essentially, A Single Man is a character study, taking place over a single 24-hour period and depicting the impact various individuals in various degrees of romantic involvement with the protagonist. We have his lover, killed in a car crash, the scars of which burn so deep that they drive George to suicide. We have George's best friend for life, infatuated with him but whose feelings are not returned, as she is of the wrong gender for George's taste. And finally, a young student of George's, representing perhaps a fleeting hope of a future love, of the simple naivety of the future generation. All these characters drift in and out of the film as we see events through George's point of view, and it is quite a unique one at that.In order to solidify our connection with George, Ford employs what may be one of the most interesting uses of color I have seen in a recent film. The entire movie is de-saturated and drained of color, to emphasize George's dreary existence. And yet, every once in a while, something will literally brighten up George's life: the smell of a wild flower or the perfume of his secretary, his friend's green eyes, or the angelic, beautiful face of young Kenny, so full of hope and joy. Memories of his time spent with his deceased lover, on the other hand, are presented in stark black-and-white, beautiful memories but deadly and dreary to dwell on. It is a stroke of visual genius that is more than complemented by the fantastic and sleek cinematography, and top-notch 1960's period production and costume design, with an astute attention to detail, no doubt stemming from Ford's own personal familiarity with vintage clothes.But the true crowning achievement of the film is its central performance. Colin Firth is nothing short of mesmerizing as the hollow George, drifting almost dream-like through what he thinks will be his last day on earth. It is an incredible, admirably subtle performance, in which Firth perfectly captures every gesture, every restrained emotion, and truly delivers a fascinating character study worthy of the greatest actors. Firth has always stuck to more lighter, romantic comedy fare like Bridget Jones' Diary, Shakespeare in Love, Love Actually and Mamma Mia!, but I had always felt the potential was there. But he truly shines in this role: I think it's safe to say that it is the single finest moment of his career, not to mention my personal pick of the best lead male performance of 2009. Another performance really stands out, and that is Julianne Moore as Charley, George's platonic friend for life. It is a slightly more showy performance as Charley is characterized by an overtly sympathetic and bubbly personality, despite her loneliness and her tragically unreciprocated feelings towards George. It is an excellent performance that perfectly compliments and enhances Firth's turn, and I am surprised that Moore didn't get more attention for it.A Single Man is not a film about story, but rather, about a man, and more broadly, about a man in a certain time and what that means considering the context. It's the 1960's, the sexual revolution is just beginning, and open homosexuality is becoming more and more commonplace. It is not an issue that is overtly discussed in the film, but it is an important theme that is quite prominent. Where does young Kenny stand in all this? Does his seduction of George stem from genuine romantic feelings, or is he simply part of the "hip, bohemian" revolution, experimenting sexually but nothing more? George was deeply and genuinely in love with his life partner, and yet it is hinted that his parents did not approve. Ford takes the correct approach and does not bring up these themes and implications directly: rather, he lets the visuals, the images, and the characters' actions speak for themselves, and the result is a remarkable piece of film-making, especially considering that it is a directorial debut. If Ford ever considered a career change, this would be the perfect field for him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Single Man...a quiet, thoughtful film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was quite surprised after viewing this film, Colin Firth was brilliantly cast as George and Nicholas Hoult was breathtaking as Kenny. I have not read the short story but it would have been interesting to read some reviews after it was published. Nicholas has the most beautiful eyes and was quite the innocent looking but not necessarily the innocent in intentions!! Julianne Moore had a small part but played Charley well, her laugh was most annoying. I thought that Tom Ford did an amazing job with his first feature film - gave the characters an honesty yet vulnerability quality. George scene with Jim reading books quietly by the fire showed us that there are no differences between "real" (straight) love and gay love - you can feel love for someone regardless of their sexuality. The clothes were impeccable and beautiful (what would you expect from Tom Ford, he is brilliant designer).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw "A Single Man" last night. I've been waiting to see it for a while, I saw the trailer a few weeks back and was blown away by the look of the film. Every shot in the film is like a work of art worthy of being framed and hung on a wall. Directed by Tom Ford the man who's known for 'redefining Gucci'. He's an incredible photographer and has taken the leap from advertising to film very well. The film is just visually stunning. The use of colour to display emotions was well done. The pace of the film was steady and didn't feel too long or too short. There are numerous flashbacks in the film to his gay relationship which are great, and enjoyable. The setting of the film in both time and location is authentic and absorbing. I could go on about how enjoyable this film was but there were some downsides. The script is basic although I don't think it needed to be anything more than that to work. The character played by Nicholas Hoult is perhaps a little bit annoying but I'm probably prejudice as I'm not a huge fan of the actor. There are I think some continuity errors but they're done in a way that's confident and so they don't take away from the film too much, although I did personally find them distracting. The film got a bit weird towards the end but I think it was a reasonably solid ending. I like the character played by Colin Firth. I'm not normally a huge Colin Firth film but he did a good job in this. His character was very watchable. Julianne Moore also did a very good job. The soundtrack was great and authentic. It added to the smokey erotic style of the film. The film is very erotic. Lots of lips and slow motion flesh. Anyway to some up a very enjoyable film, made the way good films should be made.www.duncancowles.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing this movie twice now, I am of the opinion that it is a masterpiece. The score on IMDb.com is inexplicable.The Isherwood story, the screenplay and dialogue, the astonishing performance of Colin Firth, Julianne Moore, the character development, the score, the themes, the recurring visual images, the visual beauty of the film, the vivid portrayal of the minutiae of California life in 1962 -- the movies just don't get better than this. During both viewings I was transfixed because the movie spoke directly to me. It moved me.It's a profound story about grief, but it's a wonderful story. George is an intelligent, sophisticated man, holding it all together, but he is heartbroken and planning his suicide. We are shown his life as he undergoes his preparations. The viewer can see how plainly rich his life is, and how life is beckoning to him in one wonderful event after the next. He is blind to it because of his pain, but the whole time he is engaging in profound discussions with everyone around him about hope, love and fear. The messages are not subtle: all is not lost; live in the present; you can love again; you will be loved again. Will he get the message before it's too late?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Best Gay-themed Films Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Single Man is a drama film based on the novel of the same title by Christopher Isherwood. It is the first film directed by Tom Ford,a legendary fashion designer. The film stars Colin Firth, who was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of George Falconer, a depressed gay British university professor living in Southern California in 1962.It also features Julianne Moore,Matthew Goode and Nicholas Hoult.George Falconer feels lost. Not only is he still grieving the death of his longtime companion, Jim (Goode), but he's also a British teaching English at a California college. He's so distraught with heartbreak that he's decided to kill himself, and proceeds to get all his affairs in order while carrying on with what otherwise would be a normal day. He gives an unusually forceful lecture to his class, revealing enough that a perceptive student, Kenny (Hoult), senses something is wrong with the professor; collects his important financial papers from his bank; buys bullets for a handgun he owns; and makes a visit to his best friend (Moore). But throughout these methodical preparations, George keeps running into people -- a colleague's daughter, a attractive gay hustler, and the sympathetic Kenny -- who offer him glimpses of why he should stay alive.What stands out from this film is the spectacular performance of Colin Firth.His acting will move you and make you care for George while watching this film.Aside from that reason,this movie stands out as one of the best gay- themed films ever made.It is definitely dramatic but also enormously stylish and disarmingly funny.And most of all,it is not unapologetic from its point-of-view as it offers a raw view of the gay experience that has nothing to do with sex.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent....such an underrated film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit I only saw this film because Colin Firth was in it &amp; I am becoming quite a fan of his work.The film takes place over the course of just one day - 30 November 1962 - in the life of handsome, middle-aged college professor George (Colin Firth). Like his friend, neighbour &amp; one-time lover Charley (Julianne Moore), George is an expat in LA. He has a good job &amp; a well-appointed home in a picture-perfect suburban street, but since the death of his long-term lover Jim (Matthew Goode) eight months earlier, George has been going through the motions. Today he has decided to end it all &amp; goes through the motions of putting his affairs in order &amp; saying good bye to one ones he will be leaving behind.As George's day unfolds, in a series of daydreams - nostalgic, humorous and sad - they reveal the man behind the immaculately suited exterior. Whether perched on the loo observing his neighbours, lavishing praise on a bemused secretary, or enduring a discourse on bomb shelters from a colleague (Lee Pace).Firth shows a lightness of touch. He's tender &amp; tolerant as Charleys gin-sodden hostess berates him for his inability to be the (heterosexual) man she needs. And his obsessive-compulsive fumbling with a gun and a sleeping bag are hilarious. Most of all it is his achievement in the range of emotions he displays &amp; the extent to which his character must convey them through his eyes &amp; facial expressions (especially his reaction to the phone call when he received the devastating news that Jim had died). He should of won the Oscar for his portrayal of George.Moore expertly conveys the fragility and hopelessness of a woman once married and once feted for her looks, who is now staring into the abyss through the bottom of a bottle. She was most poignantly when she says that looking back at her past is now her future. Tom Ford (on his debut as director) did an excellent job from his use of colour to reflect George's moods/state of mind to his constant search of physical perfection: in the well-tended gardens of George's neighbourhood; the piercing blue eyes of flirtatious student Kenny (Nicholas Hoult); and the chiselled looks of Goode's doomed lover.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are on the fence about watching this movie, you really must. If you truly enjoy great movies, with superb story-telling, and some of the greatest acting you'll appreciate this movie. If you are weary b/c of the sexual nature, don't be, I'm a pretty metro-guy, but straight none the less, and moderately conservative, and I wasn't grossed-out or offended by any of the content.The usage of color, and the "in n out" of drab gray to bright and passionate is seriously genius. I've never seen this done before, and I think it is something that is unique to Tom Ford's fashion "eye." My ONLY problem with the movie, is at times, especially when Firth and Moore are lying down, you can tell Firth is wearing a wig, b/c it lifts off his head ever so slightly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This haunting film directed by fashion designer Tom Ford shows the pontentially final day in the life of English teacher George Falconer (Colin Firth). Lonely and in mourning after losing the love of his life, Jim (Matthew Goode), in a car crash eight months earlier, George reflects on his life and throughout the day comes across various people who all see the sadness within him. These include pupil Kenny (Nicholas Hoult), who is seemingly fascinated with George, his old friend Charley (Julianne Moore) who may have a doomed love for him, and a Spanish immigrant and gigolo Carlos (Jon Kortajarena). Unknown to them, George is carefully planning his suicide.Being directed by a highly-successful fashion designer who owns his own label as well as managing to revamp Gucci, the film looks as impeccable and polished as one of his famous suits. A Single Man is directed with an unnerving confidence for a newcomer, and makes the most out of its 1960's setting. George is a rather wealthy man, and as he fiddles around his large, modern house in all its fastidious neatness, Ford manages to create a feeling of both beauty and style, mixed with emptiness and loneliness. As fantastic as this film looks, it never loses its grip on the story, and all the long slow-motion shots of George reflecting or driving his car allows you to really grasp the hole in his heart.Firth is outstanding. For all the recognition he got The King's Speech, his performance here blows it out the water. I've never really understood the mass appeal of Firth, but watching him in the scene where he is informed about Jim's death by a family member, finding out he's not invited to the funeral, and that the majority of the family didn't even want to inform him, his embodies a mixture of British stiff-upper-lipped dignity and utter breakdown. And the scenes near to the end where he spends a night with the impressive Nicholas Hoult, he gazes upon him with a mixture of wonder and lust, and self-loathing and guilt.My girlfriend felt it was style-over-substance, but I disagree. I feel the style was often reminiscent of high opera, where tragedy is commonplace. The slightest facial movement from Firth brought me right back into his story, when the film risked losing me. A moving, emotional, tragic, funny, and (dare I say it?) sexy film that could see the birth of an interesting filmmaker.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a fantastic film :) Went in with little expectation but finished the hour and 40 minutes with a glint in my eye. This movies unique perspective on life was compelling, and so beautifully shot that i hope Tom Ford is a stayer in the movie business.Life has so much to offer, even through times of prejudice, but what we hold dear can be taken away so quickly and painfully. Sadly not everyone has a shoulder to cry on, and this movie makes us aware of this all to clearly. This might not relate to everyone and i guess might be a bit to much for some, but it related to me on a very personal level and Colin Firths performance was stunning. He embodies the character of George in a way that is believable and effortless that you cant help but pity him during his hour of need. The string of characters whom have passed, loved and pitied George not only create a warmth of personal feelings within but build a story that takes you with it and leaves you satisfied at its sad but poetic ending.Nicholas Hoult and Julianne Moore's performances are written superbly and both prove once again what special talents they are as actors. Im now scrolling through the IMDb database for further films to watch of all them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Falconer is suffering from a pain which cannot be easily felt by some of the people around him. Unknown to everyone, George, a university English professor, has experienced the blow of losing his lover, Jim, in a fatal accident in which he is told by a distant relative of the deceased; he is not even invited to the last rites for the man that shared his life, now gone and leaving a big hole in his existence. It was a sad time for being gay in America, as well as any other place. George is left alone in his moment of anguish, being robbed of not even being close to the dead man he loved so much.Falconer is conducting a class on the work of Aldus Huxley, the English novelist. It is a complex work he is teaching to a class that is half attentive to what he is trying to teach. There is only one student, Ken, who appears to be somewhat connected to the subject at hand. Falconer is a somewhat jaded individual, not expecting much from the young people he is trying to interest in the work of a writer, who also happened to be English, like him.There appears to be no point in keep on living; something has died when Jim died. There will be no one else for George Falconer. In fact, George wants to put and end to his solitary existence. For that, he must make preparations for his own demise. The one person he feels closer to, Charley, a woman from England who lives in Los Angeles and knew about his relationship. George goes to Charley for dinner, something that does not go according to his plans.In flashbacks we get to know about the kind of relationship shared by George and Jim, how they met, and how they were attracted from the start. Preparing for a suicide, George, is not quite ready to pull the trigger of the gun he has prepared with care, as well as the arrangements for what will follow. Those memories bring him back to the bar where he met Jim. To his surprise, he sees Ken, his student there. They drink, and Ken proposes a dip in the ocean, where George suffers a blow to his forehead, something that Ken insists in treating at George's place. George Falconer is not ready to love again, but Ken, with his fresh looks and his youth, plays heavily on his resolve.A great film co-written and directed by Tom Ford. We saw it when it made its commercial debut. On second viewing, recently, we were amazed by the intensity in the story, and the amazing portrayal of the main character by Colin Firth, whose performance is what keeps the interest of the viewer. Based on the Christopher Isherwood's novel, Mr. Ford made a fantastic debut as a director. Famous as a fashion designer, one can see the way Mr. Ford combines colors and patterns to create a story that is well felt and marvelously executed. The work of Edward Grau, the cinematographer, the film evokes the era of the 1960s, when the action is supposed to take place. The musical score by Abel Korzeniowski enhances the wonderful images and has a way for blending together.To say that Colin Firth was excellent, is an understatement. Mr. Firth makes the audience think he is none other than George Falconer. The grief he is experiencing is real. He has not gotten over to a unexpected freak accident that took his lover's life away. It is one of Mr. Firth's great characterizations in his notable film career. Nicholas Hoult, the English actor, is impressive as the young Ken. Julienne Moore brings to life her Charley, a sort of playgirl that would have been happy bedding George. Finally, Matthew Goode is only seen in flashbacks as Jim, the dead lover.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a rather stunning debut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alas, I haven't read Isherwood's source novel, so some of the questions I have about this film that would probably be answered by the text must be for me, as of now, unanswered. But the film as it is has an auteuristic confidence that is refreshing and surprising. It's not quite at the level of greats such as Wong Kar-Wai or Tarkovsky, but at least a Scorsese. The mis en scene, the colors, and some of the directorial decisions are really quite good. Firth's devastated response to news of his partner's death is frontloaded in the movie, thus winning our confidence in the first fifteen minutes of the film.This is a film that rewards more than on viewing. The first time I watched it, I was too overwhelmed by the colors and sheer sumptuousness to notice the drama and movement of the film. The second time I watched it, I could let myself be more fully drawn into George's character. I wonder, though: Why is fear such a theme in the movie? Clearly he is afraid to die, but this doesn't seem to spring from the massive wound of his lover's death; the greater theme should be the attempt to recover meaning from a life that's lost meaning. Indeed, Ford's modulation of colors is a sublime response to this theme: a man, whose world is usually almost monochromatically gray but with moments of almost painful saturation, is certainly a man whose response to the trauma is detachment into a grey ether, but upon whom the world intrudes with almost painful sensuousness. Hedonism, narcissism, alienation, emptiness are the themes. But maybe underlying all that is fear, the same fear that made Firth's acting so genuine in that moment when his character hears of the death - Firth, the big intelligent English professor, sinks slightly into his chair as he blinks out his tears, knowing that now he's completely alone in the world, and nobody is there to protect him from it.Julianna Moore gives a zestful performance as the wonderful but slightly un-understanding Charley. It's a pity that, in the script (and, I suppose, the book), the interlude with Charley is followed by one with Kenny. Tom Ford obviously has a stable of model-caliber individuals at his disposal, but perhaps he could have chosen one with less shapely facial structure but better acting abilities? His selection of women is better, or at least less muddled by the charms of masculine beauty. In any case, I look forward to Ford's next turn behind the camera.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Single Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1962, America: English professor George (Colin Firth) wakes one morning to the decision that he is going to kill himself at the end of the day; his life seemingly means nothing since the death of his long-term partner Jim (Matthew Goode). He spends the rest of the day taking everything around him in, whilst reliving painful memories of the past...It is without question that this is the film which Colin Firth SHOULD have won an Oscar for in 2010. His performance virtually carries the movie out of a slightly arty, perhaps pretentious mawkishness and fills it with humanity.That's not to be so incredibly harsh at the film; it is certainly beautiful to look at, first-time director Tom Ford very aware (perhaps a little too much) of colour and light in his world. In particular, emphasis is placed heavily on clothes. In one scene where George is sitting at a bank when a neighbour's daughter steps forward to speak to him, the camera pans up her body, showing off her blue dress in spectacular fashion.The script, adapted from a novel by Christopher Isherwood, is perfectly fine up to a point. George is in every single scene, which certainly helps. Lesser characters are not as important as this single man, though there is perhaps a little predictability within some of the scenes, not least the ones featuring Nicholas Hoult as one of George's students. Both endings feel a little predictable too, though you do need to be paying attention to the early stages of the film in order to get it.The day pans out fairly quickly, which is by no means a bad thing. It would perhaps have been a little more interesting to have seen more of George's teaching of his students. What is refreshing is that, for a film that is about a gay man, there is no struggle for George to be accepted; it is only hinted at about unseen characters - firstly one of his neighbours, secondly the parents of his late partner JIm, who decide to hold the funeral for "family only".But this is truly Firth's film. Though there is a nice little mini-scene with Julianne Moore as a friend of George's going through her own personal mid-life crisis, her accent superb and flawless, without Firth's quiet desperation the scene would just seem out of place. There is as much humour in his performance as there is sadness. The scene where George finds out about Jim's death in particular stands out as a feat of epic acting skills, a brilliant school for all aspiring actors to watch with unwavering eyes.Perhaps, ironically, "A Single Man" is just about that - a single man who can carry an entire story, an entire film on his shoulders with seamless ease.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is just as beautiful as it could be! All characters are good looking, and the costume and make-up along with the smooth camera work, not to mention the original score which is breathtaking, none of these are effortless!The whole story travels back and forth the fact that Colin Firth's partner was killed in a car accident, and those moments when the beloved was still alive seemed to appear in every corner at any given time. Colin planned to commit suicide after the day he went through all unfinished business had to be solved. However, one student broke into his plan and reminded him of life experience which aroused the desire and passion inside his broken heart. Though the movie ends with an accidental tragedy, I can still appreciate the hope that Colin sees within his eyes, and that's one big comfort I get from the movie. Julianne Moore is one of the best actresses in the world. Though she didn't show quite much, she gave the deepest impression at once. The best scene was there at the table when Julianne told the story as following? Then they both burst into laughter, and that's really hilarious!(Julianne: The other day at the car wash, a young man looked me up and down, and asked me, if I was a nature blond? Colin: What did you say? Julianne: I looked him straight in the eyes and i said, well let's just say, if I stood on my head, it will be a nature brunette with a lovely breath Colin: You didn't! Julianne: I did!)I have to admit that I am not so satisfied with the way how it ends, but I guess that's just one possibility life could be?. Fragile as life is, you can still live an energetic and passionate one!</fullReview>

But you can guess that this drama has a lot to do with loneliness with a title like that. And it played very subtle and fine (as does our main actor here). Not so subtle, but still very fine, is the cinematography.Very vivid (and not) colors, give the movie a depth that people may very well love and adore. Of course you could also see it as on the nose, but I think that would be sarcastic and unnecessary with a movie like this. On the other hand the relationship(s) of our main character might be too much for a more delicate person.

		<shortDescription>Firth brings it to life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fashion designer turned filmmaker Tom Ford has made a rather dull but fashionable film from Christopher Isherwood's occasionally dull but still sharply observant novel about an aging British professor (Colin Firth) in 1962 Los Angeles who must adjust to the loss of his younger lover (Matthew Goode) who is killed in an auto accident. Occasionally the film expands upon and even surpasses the source (for example, the painful phone conversation through which Firth learns of Goode's death). But mostly Ford and his fellow screenwriter David Scearce prefer to invent new characters, reconceive existing ones and add unnecessary layers (such as amusing but superfluous suicide rehearsals or the ponderous, lingering presentation of Firth's offputting suburban neighbors and their children). One of the biggest disappointments is the waste of the gifted Julianne Moore as a fellow Brit in whom Firth confides. Moore is forced to act up a storm, fake accent and all, to overcome the extremely misconceived twisting of her character from a rather frumpy, housebound, middle-aged divorcée to what appears to be a well-heeled and glamorous fashion plate. Her house looks like the backdrop for a Sixties fashion shoot. There is little warmth or life in Ford's vision. A sizeable ? even excessive - portion of Isherwood's book muses on the body and its processes. But Ford is more interested in exploring stylish clothing than the flesh beneath. There is a downright anti-eroticism about the film even though in the novel many of the professor's thoughts are about sex. When carnality does loom, the camera angle changes abruptly. We get the sense of a man who is deactivated inside instead of one whose mind is grinding away, producing an unending series of wry conclusions about the state of Cold War American society seen by a gay Brit, that is, a double outsider. The professor's running commentary to himself and others on 1962 America is almost entirely dropped in favor of repeated shots of TV news broadcasts about the Cuban Missile Crisis which was raging at the time. Firth himself, given so little to work with, still registers from the start as a distinct character with blood in his veins. Flashbacks to his relationship with Goode suggest nothing much more than a spread for GQ magazine and provide no back story that would explain his suicidal ideation after Goode's demise. So it is up to Firth to express a depth of devotion in defiance of the film itself, and he does so compellingly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this movie will be remembered as one of Colin Firth's best performances of his career. He plays a university professor George Falconer who recently lost his gay lover in a traffic accident. This is a very stylish film but not for everybody's taste. It is slow paced. It is very visual with strong dramatic score but there is not much dialogue or story. The strong visualization of the character's inner world, his dreams, his memories, his desires is what defines the style of the movie. The objects he selectively perceives are often shot in slow motion style (with strong dramatic score) to emphasize meaning. If you like psychological movies and enjoy a good cinematic style, you will enjoy this one. Juliane Moore is, as always, brilliant in her role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Imperfect but impressive directoral debut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the ironically titled "A Single Man," a movie based on the Christopher Isherwood novel of the same name, the protagonist George Falconer (Colin Firth) is a gay college professor whose partner of 16 years (Matthew Goode) has recently been killed in a car crash. As it is 1962, George has lived almost his entire life in the closet - and now he's even being forced to grieve in isolation. To make matters worse, his lover's parents won't allow George to attend the memorial service, and now he has to return to work acting as if nothing out of the ordinary has happened in his life - as if his heart had not just been ripped out of him by the thoughtless cruelty of an indifferent Fate. The one person with whom George can be truly open and honest about himself is Charley (Julianne Moore), a longtime female friend who accepts his homosexuality but whose own conflicted feelings for the man greatly complicate their relationship. Yet, George has his own conflicted feelings to deal with, when, in the depths of his despair, one of his young male students (Nicholas Hoult) begins to make romantic overtures to him.Rather than tell the story, which takes place over the course of a 24-hour period, in a strictly linear and straightforward fashion, Tom Ford, in his directorial debut, relies heavily on intense close-ups, visual tinting, voice-over narration, dream sequences, flashbacks, memories, imaginings and endless images of ticking clocks - signifying the slow but inexorable passage of time - to give a more fragmented and otherworldly quality to the story. However, such an approach, impressive as it is at times, carries some risks with it as well - for the artiness frequently acts as a distancing device that prevents us from entering the mind and feelings of the protagonist as fully as we would like to. That being said, the style does provide an interesting visual correlative to the life of secrecy and repression George is being forced to lead by a society that, still at that point, was not quite ready to accept anyone who might threaten its self-proscribed parameters of what, in its infinite wisdom, it chose to deem as "acceptable" and "normal." Oddly, with Firth's heavy British accent, the uncharacteristically deep-hued interiors and airless exteriors, this is one of the few movies set in L.A. that doesn't really feel like it takes place in L.A. (it's reminiscent of "The Man From Elysian Fields" in that regard). Indeed, the movie has more of an East Coast/Old World European flavor to it that further works to dislocate the viewer.As an actor, Colin Firth has never before shown such intensity of purpose or subtlety of technique, playing a man whose outward actions are basically a shield for what is happening deep inside the soul of the character. Firth conveys a wealth of meaning through random facial expressions and understated gestures, as he portrays a man coping with both the tragic loss of his one true love and the burden of conducting a lifelong masquerade to avoid offending the sensibilities of others.In form and in style, "A Single Man" is more a mood piece than a fully developed drama, with the Cuban Missile Crisis, which is taking place in the background, casting a portentous pall over the lives and futures of the people involved. But it is through George's highly specific yet universal story that the film movingly conveys the tragedy of living a life so dedicated to being false to others that one can never be true to oneself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After so many years of leaving my pen behind, I felt like writing again, inspired by 'a single man' directed by Tom Ford. Writing down my thoughts and feelings is never my strongest point and probably will never be, but this film touched me in far too many different ways, especially the conversation George and Kenny had in the bar. When George (Colin Firth) asked Kenny (Nicolas Hoult): 'If the past does not matter and the present is a total drag, then what about the future?' Then he kinda answered himself by saying 'Death is the future. It may not be the immediate future, but it is what we all share. So if one is not enjoying one's preset there isn't a great deal to suggest that future is any better'. These sentences were from an experienced, seems-to-know answer for every question man, who had a lover for 16 years but then separated by death. George has been holding his beautiful moments in the past so tightly, that he can no longer see the future, just as he said from the very beginning of the movie: 'everyday goes by in a haze.' This movie is certainly a breath-taking masterpiece for people who had similar experiences in life. One say: it takes a minute to fall in love with someone, but takes a lifetime to forget that person. One should always appreciate life's little gifts, and of course life itself. ---Hansong Ma, San Francisco, 2010</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is not the same "single" you post on facebook</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To describe the main character as "single" perhaps brings about the same connotation associated with a facebook relationship status. But to describe George (Colin Firth) in such a way, while true, would be trivial. He is a man apart from this world entirely, seeming to feel as if he has no place.The main course of action takes place over the span of a single day. With the death of his partner, he is consumed by melancholy and dreads mornings (although apparently this was the case even before his lover died). He puts up a facade at work and amongst friends but it seems that there is an internal cause beyond his widowed state that is never quite fully brought to the surface. As a homosexual he considers himself a minority, but in 1962 he is not a minority that is feared. He is one that is, as he describes in one of his classes, invisible.Throughout the movie, George throughly buys into this idea. People all around him are reaching out, inviting him to do this or that or simply to be with him, but he stays away from any of that. A visual used throughout has George drowning as he tosses and turns in a large body of water, unable to break free. What finally pulls him out and allows him to find a breath of air is one of his students. They spend an evening together after running into each other (although in fairness the student was looking for him) at a bar and George finds friendship and bliss in this outing. He experiences a rare "moment of clarity."The screenplay is insightful and poignant and Colin Firth brings the emotions to the audience. He convinces us that he has a great sorrow but that it almost seems bottled, for his character faces internal struggles. The problem is that we never get a chance to dive fully and completely into these sorrows. The narrative arch feels restrained by the 101 min running time.Many of the visuals are aesthetically desaturated but obtain their color when George interacts with another person and notices little bits of beauty. There is much to admire about human interaction and George knows it, but yet he avoids camaraderie in much of the film. George is a smart person and I'm convinced that something else that is not hinted at troubled this character.This film won't ever get a sliver of the amount of mainstream attention as "Brokeback Mountain" ever got, but it's characters are more convincing. The love they share for another is indeed the love for another human that anyone can share, and not merely lust-based. The pain George goes through is universal. I felt it, but not as much as I would have had it been on the screen longer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unusual Odd Ball Short but Poetic film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fashion designer Tom Ford makes his directing debut with this film., Described by novelist Edmund White as "one of the first &amp; best novels of the modern gay liberation movement," Isherwood's "A Single Man" presents a stream-of-consciousness portrait of a middle-aged gay man, known only as George, going about his daily routine in early '60s LA. Ford's script remains fairly close in spirit to the original but departs from it in one major direction: Here, Brit expat George Falconer is so bereft over the recent death of his longtime companion, Jim (Matthew Goode), in a car accident that he's planning to commit suicide - a plot point that injects tension into the story. Still reeling after the death of his partner Jim (Goode) months earlier that decimated his perfectly-ordered life, university Professor George (Colin Firth) works his way through a day, with visits from friends &amp; students (Julianne Moore, Nicholas Hoult, Jon Kortajarena) interspersed with vivid memories of the love he lost. Denied the opportunity to properly &amp; publicly grieve Jim due to closeted nature of their relationship, George's internal struggles threaten to overwhelm him in the quiet elegance of his own beautiful stylish &amp; modern 1950s LA Home. Since very few men were "out" in the 1960s &amp; being gay was a crime Professor George is not given the respect &amp; compassion that a straight person would automatically be given under the circumstances. This is an oddball intimate poetic &amp; lustrious film. The film makes beautiful use of color. Cinematography is interesting in that Ford &amp; Cinematographer Eduard Grau's decided to play with the color saturation, often dun-&amp;-dreary color scheme will suddenly morph in a single shot to a warmer palette &amp; different colors schemes.. The story becomes the story of a sad single day in the character's life &amp; his reactions to that grief &amp; sadness. Film contains a fantastic performance by Colin Firth. Unusual Film 4 stars. I liked it -- seemed short at 1 ? hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Painfully Single Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Ford's A Single Man shows us a day in the life of a middle-aged English professor who recently found out that his partner of 16 years has suddenly died. Colin Firth plays George who finds out that his partner Jim (Matthew Goode) has died only because someone sympathetic in Jim's family thought that he should know. He also lets George know that he cannot attend the funeral. In his suffocating grief, George tries to muster the energy and desire to go on living. The only person that he can possible share his grief with is his gin- infused best friend Charley (Julianne Moore) but she is too focused on the brief romance that she had with George years ago and with how "things used to be" that she cannot offer him emotional support. Only a young gay student is able to enter George's life and grief and we're not sure what's going to happen. Will he overcome his grief and discover that he can love again? Will he isolate himself from the only person who could comfort him? He has a gun--will he end his life or the life of another? The conclusion to this day is as shocking as the phone call that George received letting him know about Jim's death.This film is visually stunning. The details of the film from the costumes to the sets to the actors are all captivating. I felt like I was in 1960s Los Angeles. The highlight of the film was really the performances of the actors. Each actor really conveyed what was going on with the character. Colin Firth was painfully alone now that Jim is dead. He has to force himself to live one more day. He has no outlet for his grief. He became single when Jim died; he continues to be single in his grief because he cannot be honest about his situation. In the 60s the acceptance of gays and lesbians was only in its infancy. Julianne Moore is desperately lonely but she looks for solace in a relationship that will never happen (Charley and George) and in the past. Matthew Goode makes us feel loved and alive in all of the flashbacks (which are usually a little brighter than the rest of the film). Kenny (Nicholas Hoult) makes us feel thrilled and curious, just like we all did when we had our first crush. The fact that this is Tom Ford's first film is remarkable. No doubt his years of fashion and attention to imagery were useful with the appearance of this film. The loneliness and fear of rejection that every gay and lesbian faces were no doubt helpful directing the actors and helpful communicating the emptiness that George was feeling. Grief, however, is bigger than Tom Ford and is something that we will all experience. No doubt part of this film's success is its honest portrayal of grief and what it does to individuals and why we need community to overcome it. A Single Man reminds all of us of this in a beautiful, compelling and ultimately surprising way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is based on the novel by Christopher Isherwood, and centers on George Falconer (Played by Colin Forth), a Los Angeles college professor who is finding it difficult to cope with life. Eight months earlier, his lover, Jim (Played by Matthew Goode) was unexpectedly killed in a car crash, and he was not allowed to attend the funeral. In the present day he decides to perform all of his daily duties, before he commits suicide. He reminisces about his life with Jim, and spends his day with various people, who seem to affect his thoughts on his plans. These include a Spanish immigrant named Carlos (Played by Jon Kortajarena), his neighbor, friend, and former lover Charley (Played by Julianne Moore), and a student in his class named Kenny Potter (Played by Nicholas Hoult), who appears to have taken an interest in George.And the film... Almost flawless.The story is not a very clichéd one, and it's remarkable to say the least.The performances are brilliant (Some more than others). Julianne Moore as always was good, but this time, not great. Matthew Goode was a fairly good performance. Nicholas Hoult was great with what he did. And then there's Colin Firth, in his subtle, but emotionally DEVASTATING performance as George. He's the best Lead Actor performance of the year. I really wished he had won the Oscar. But at least he won the BAFTA, instead of going through this whole awards season with nothing.The film is a bit of a complex one, but whatever the movie does suffer from, is minuscule in my opinion.PS. The movie also comes with an absolutely brilliant score I give it ***1/2 out of ****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Is The Loneliest Number</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is it too late to add "A Single Man" to the list of best films of last year? I hope not."A Single Man" does take us through the stream of consciousness mind of a newly single 52 year old gay college English professor living in Los Angeles during the Cuban missile crisis. The film takes us through the day the eponymous single man Colin Firth has decided to kill himself, still grief stricken over the sudden death of his boyfriend of 16 years. He is alert and functional, but emotionally drowning. The color scheme of the film is largely flat, dull, tones, until American fashion designer and first time film director Tom Ford wants us to focus on something which catches Firth's attention like shirtless young men playing tennis, the red lipstick of a secretary, or the color of one of his students blue eyes, by painting them in luminous color. Much of the film is just Firth going through a typical day but soaking in the little details of the world for the last time. Naturally it begins to feel like the first time.Though the story and dialog are nothing spectacular, the direction, performances, music and editing are immaculate. Some might say this is style over substance, but I can't really see what if anything would have been substantial about such a story. The Cuban Missile crisis as backdrop is arbitrary at the level of plot, but metaphorically as the national moment of uncertainty, doubt, and doom it suits Firth's quietly suicidal melancholy perfectly. This is one of those movies were ostensibly "nothing happens", and more often than not were forced to frustratingly observe Firth's constant sensual gaze and seemingly indestructible sexual tension, when we'd wish he'd just give himself permission to enjoy life, sex, and the invitations around him. Then again "his heart has been broken", and as he shouts at Julianne Moore he is not seeking a "substitution" for what he's lost. Somethings are irreplaceable.In one scene Firth and a student with a crush on him, go skinny dipping in the ocean at night. One of those "let's break out of the monotony of our lives and do something crazy" moments, that had me wondering if the film weren't in fact, just as trite as I had imagined at my most skeptical moments. Instead of a playful, carefree scene of splashing, we see only choppy waves and distant figures, and before we can really see what's going on Firth is being dragged back on shore with a gash in his head. The ocean does not care that these people wish to be free and spontaneous. The ocean has no opinions whatsoever.Little details like that, little moments have to be taken into greater account in a film like this, because there are no great plot turns that announce themselves as significant, and no definitive moment that changes all that has come before. We learn more and more about a character, as the film goes on, but nothing shocking or surprising. "I am exactly what I appear to be, if you look closely enough" says Firth at one point.The flashbacks do not communicate to us all the odds and ends of Firth's past relationship, they flutter around important moments (at least to him), the first time they met, a vacation with a scenic view, the notification of the death, the last time they spoke of death not long before the accident, etc. All we learn from this is that these are the things which Firth thinks about, but through seeing them with him, we begin to feel as he does; to experience the world with waves of painful memories lapping over us of their own accord. Besides that their relationship isn't really important anymore, the boyfriend is dead after all, only Firth, his friends, and phantoms all that's left. If their relationship doesn't seemed fleshed out, it's because it's no longer made of flesh.The ending left something to be desired, there are clues throughout the film certainly (every one's comments on Firth's appearance, "my watch is broken", etc), but it is unsatisfying (even if that is the point)."A Single Man" is neither hopeless or optimistic, it's a highly stylized bitter sweet trip through fleeting sensations of being alive in the present and the constant pangs of wishing you could re-experience the past. Some point out that if Firth were not gay and in the 60's he would be able to vent his grief in healthy ways, and though that certainly compiles Firth's distance from the world, like Andrie Tarkovsky's "Solaris" or Michel Gondry's "Eternal Sunshine" or so many "I wish you were here" themed films, it's speaks to a more universal sense of loss; the loss of love to time, and life to regret.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will now officially kick myself for missing out on this during last year's Tokyo International Film Festival, where director Tom Ford (yes, THE Tom Ford the fashion designer) was present to present his debut film at a gala premiere, with time set aside for interviews as well. For its theme, A Single Man may not have made it to our shores, but I'm glad it did despite some wrangling which made its release a little later ? but better late than never.As a debut film by a helmer better known for his style in the fashion world, making that transition outside of one's comfort zone is never easy, but one thing's for sure, that certain sense of style never got lost, and neither was its substance light. It had all the trappings of a well made movie that is ostensibly beautiful to look at, yet accompanied by plenty of heavy emotions that it seeks to overwhelm and bring out that tinge of depression if you would share it with the protagonist, Colin Firth's English language professor George Falconer.For all his modern world (well, the 60s rather) material wealth of a glasshouse, that Mercedes Benz parked in the garage, and sets of impeccably designed suits (well, by Tom Ford himself no less), George is hurting inside ever since his lover Jim (Matthew Goode) passed away in a car accident. For 16 years they had lived a life of bliss, undisturbed in a neighbourhood suburb where the American dream was quite alive in L.A, though now come under threat from the Bay of Pigs incident. Its set in the present, with George going about with much dread his daily life, reminiscing his wonderfully happy past in a series of flashbacks, and currently contemplating suicide to call it quits. But of course ending one's life is never simple, and frankly takes quite a lot of guts and desperation, of which he has two persons to thank for in subtly and subconsciously giving him a reason to live on. The first will be good friend Charley (Julianne Moore) his neighbour, where we're shown that she's the first person he ran to in an effort to seek solace over bad news. A divorcée herself, the story by Christopher Isherwood presents her as a what-if since obviously they both click, and in a pivotal scene, their bantering of how their lives would probably be for the different should they have, somehow, hooked up together.Then there's the personification of the future to look forward to, where it is fairly obvious his student Kenny (Nicholas Hoult) is never trying to hide the fact that he's hitting on his teacher, with those puppy doe eyes and obedience, coupled with youthful exuberance to counter that of a senior citizen's ailing heart. Winner of the Best Actor award at last year's Venice Film Festival, Colin Firth owns this role and brings out a spectrum of emotion from despair to hope and desire, as a man looking to end his life in the best way possible, with his plans largely intervened by Fate, though it comes with a warning to be careful about what you persistently wish for.In its technical areas, the film's colours and tone mirrors in parallel the emotion felt by George, where we start off with shades which are grey and strained especially when he's alone, but with friends and those he would want to be close with, or when it flashes back to his happier past, warmth colours get chosen, and it becomes a lot more vivid. If there's another film that made use of music the same way this one did, it'll be Wong Kar-wai's In the Mood for Love. Here, the tunes by Abel Korzeniowski bring this film to a different level like a waltz that's emotionally rhythmic in its pace and delivery. Shades of Wong Kar-wai also continues in its use of that clock ticking that's almost always in the background to signify the passage of time as well as how iconic moments in our lives define us, just as how time is also something important in the narrative stages of the story reliving the past, spending the present and being hopeful of George's future.Tom Ford scores in his debut feature, and it's fairly obvious his eye for style permeates throughout the film seen in the quality of the art direction, production sets, costumes and make up, with a powerful emotional tale that makes everything else worthwhile. It's one thing making a film with homosexual themes that can be emotionally replicated should you switch character genders around, but it's another ball game altogether when that doesn't work, which signifies a true blue genre tale. This is eye-candy at its best, with an emotional core attached. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good debut for Tom ford but great performance by Colin Firth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'A single man' shows a day 9 months later after the partner of main character George died. We see how he tries to live on carrying the loss of his partner, on what normally would be a perfectly normal day.This movie really is artistic, but not as intelligent. Many times the shots are there for artistic purpose rather then to show us the story. There are a lot of irrelevant Extreme close-ups on irrelevant objects or persons. The same case is with the filters used in the movie. A lot of different filters pass the eye, and that's a shame, because overall it feels just a bit over the edge with all that many of artistic shots. I also felt that when George sometimes was shown with a darker filter, the director simply said to me "pity tah fool! be sorry for him!" and I don't like it when a director comes up with such a simple solution for dramatizing purpose. To summarise it, it's all still a bit too chaotic and it lacks a chosen style . Still Ford manages to show us what a day in the life of George looks like, and how he still feels the pain of his loss and loneliness many months later. The story is touching, and because there was the choice to only highlight one day of George his life, it takes us closer to his life. In that sense, it is a very touching story. You could almost feel George his pain, even tough it is very sublimely hid by Colin Firth. As mentioned before the film mostly takes place on that one day, 9 months later after the death of the partner of George. On a normal average day not too many awkward things happen. The contrary is part of this movie. George meets and talks about the most not-average subject with the strangest people. It even gets to the point where a side character tells George that the weather is the reason for the 'strange light', which is actually another filter for... well you get the point.To conclude it all, Tom Ford has done a good job for his first movie. If you don't mind a movie which tries to be beautiful just by creating art-like forced shots, and you like a touching story, then go see this. If you don't like that, then go for Colin Firth's performance. The way he delivers his part is tremendous, and he certainly would be a deserved winner should he be awarded with the Oscar.7,5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cafe of broken dreams</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on novel written by Christopher Isherwood, A Single Man presents at first view ordinary story about man who irretrievably lost his love. But it's not just a film about unmarried person; inherently it's an allegory of lonely human, who has got ennui, nobody can understand him and his snarled feelings even his close friend Charley though she has the similar problem. Mercilessly life doesn't give him any chance to survive and brings only perpetual suffering. Colin Firth who took a main role here shows us terrific and masterful acting, observing his emotional experience I abruptly began to understand that it's not a tragedy of only one man, this character reflects metaphor, and everyone could be in the same situation, but in spite of it nobody understand him, even after his speech on his lecture, only one student perceived him correctly. This young student was the only person who effectively grasped his emotions and he summoned signs of consciousness in his soul. Their dialogs about past, future and present are amazing. Sometimes they are a little bit trivial but so sincere, sensible, truly and precise. This is frightening picture of broken life and it scares higher then every thriller. Despair and devastation are the only two things that you'll meet here. No hope, no light at the end of the tunnel. Nothing? A Single Man also contains an advanced retro atmosphere; here we can see splendidly detailed town with Great Spirit of 60s. People's outfit, cars, buildings, every trinket on his right place. Can't add anymore words, I'd just say this movie is fantastic masterpiece. I was astonished that it's the first film of Tom Ford. I could never imagine that it's possible to make such work, this movie deserves a lot of award nominations and Tom Ford personally should be rewarded as best debut of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disabling grief</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A breathtaking, gorgeous film with an intelligent and very moving portrayal by Colin Firth of a mourning English literature professor with a love of well-tailored suits, living in a minimalistic Frank Lloyd Wright-inspired house designed by his late partner, who died in a terrible car accident eight months ago. He has lost his zest for life and just has enough energy for going about his everyday duties but not much more than that. Every morning getting up is a struggle and he is unable to share his grief with others because of his secret love; a love he can not talk about; a sort of love that is considered a taboo. That isolated situation only adds to his loneliness. He is a shadow-widower, not welcome at his lover's funeral, not granted that parting-ritual for closure. Him desperately trying to keep his decorum with his voice, while he gets the horrific news over the phone, while we at the same time see him falling apart is heartbreaking to witness. The set-decoration in 'A Single Man' is magnificent. That the early sixties-era is incredibly photogenic was already proved by the TV-series 'Mad Men'. The flawless minimalism is a perfect contrast for the chaos of George's falling apart inside. The spotless exterior makes his situation even more heartbreaking and it is interesting to see how some cope with grief by becoming a neurotic neat-freak where others just let everything fall out of their hands; drop their worn clothes on the floor to a huge pile; leave their paperwork also piled up and unordered on their desk, because one just doesn't give a damn anymore... Why keep things neat and tidy?... Life sucks in a spic-and-span place all the same... Just like Tom Ford shows how, although recognized and appreciated, even the seduction of beauty and physical perfection doesn't really appeal anymore when you grieve over a lost True Love; You can see the aesthetic and sensuousness of that beauty, but it doesn't turn you on anymore. Or maybe just for a second or so, but not much later think: "Naah... what's the point". Because you feel nothing, feel numb anyway. Love and sex have lost their promise and attraction. Grief can disable you in that way. Everything loses its color, its joy, its appeal.... And the memories of loving and happy moments haunt you endlessly. Tom Ford hit those moments right on the spot: like the scene where George and his lover are curled up together, both reading a book: such a striking, cozy image of a Sunday-afternoon-moment of soothing and comforting, 'Was sich liebt das neckt sich'-true love. On the other hand, I could not understand George's close friendship with the theatrical Charley whose personality annoyed the hell out of me! As did her being unable to make a complete smile and a good frown (her expression just stops halfway! Or is it Julianne Moore's botox-treatment that makes those expression-attempts so freakish?). But most of all her not even recognizing her (no less!) best friend's True Love-relationship. One doesn't need enemies with friends like that. What a stupid broad! (But Julianne Moore is a terrific actress! She was wonderful in 'The Hours' and in 'Magnolia'!) I read Christopher Isherwood's book (on which this film is based) some time ago and loved it so much that I was afraid the film would be a disappointment. But although the film is somewhat different from the book and the ending somewhat wrongly chosen, 'A Single Man' has become one of my favorite movies. Because it is such a perfect portrait of what goes on inside a person who grieves from loss of a True Love, with a magnificent acting lead (Colin Firth got a well-deserved Oscar-nomination for this work, although I bet the statue will go to Jeff Bridges - also well-deserved, and long overdue), a feast for the eye when it comes to set- and costume design, and superb acting-directing by Tom Ford.If some people find the aesthetics of this movie a distraction for feeling along with the lead, than they don't get the point of the addition of contrast. That you can't get passed the beauty of the exterior also says more about your one-dimensional point of view than that the art-direction of the movie is over-designed.</fullReview>

I fell in love with every possible aspect of this film. The mood of the whole picture was consistent, beautiful, melancholic-the visual style was complimentary to the story, it was stunning in its own way but it didn't overpower the story or the stellar cast. This film is a great debut of Tom Ford as a director, I hope that it's a start of something he plans to commit to doing for a long time to come. I can't stress enough how rare it's to see a new director with a real VISION, whether it appeals to you or not he commits to realizing his vision and thats inspiring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Channeling The Kindred Spirit Of Marcel Proust (and maybe even,Jean Genet)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those thinking,"who is Marcel Proust?", Proust was a 19th century French writer who's work is something of an acquired taste (his narrative style was v-e-r-y slow,plus he wrote from the perspective of the ruling class,to the ruling class,with little or no regard for anybody else). Christopher Isherwood,however,was a 20th century English writer,who like Proust,in addition to being gay (as was Proust),wrote a series of novels dealing with the gay experience (although Proust mainly wrote as a heterosexual). A Single Man,is the story of George,an English ex patriot (played by Colin Firth),living in California,who is working as a college professor (the school is never named). George has just learned that his long time companion has tragically died in an automobile accident. George is having the worst time with grieving for the loss of his lover (even with his best friend,Charley,a fellow English ex patriot,played by Julianne Moore,who fakes a not half bad English accent,is trying to help). Other characters drift in &amp; out of this difficult period of his life. Tom Ford directs,from a screenplay written by Ford &amp; David Scearce,adapted from the novel by Isherwood. The film's cinematography,which balances muted colour,symbolizing George's depression, with full colour,representing moments of passion (especially when George is faced with the prospects of a one night stand with a young Spanish man,and later with one of his students),as well as flash backs (filmed in black &amp; white). This is a well written drama of a man struggling with grief &amp; trying to find a way out of it. Rated 'R' by the MPAA,this film contains nudity,adult content &amp; the sight of a automobile accident victim that some may find distressing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sort of sentimental and decent character study, but also has it's target audiences</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is basically a sad and romantic movie for gay people. With a approach to try and show that even gays really love one another even if they are the same gender. I found this movie to be sort of mediocre and if they took the gay aspect of it out and replaced the romance between a guy and a girl it wouldn't have been all that unique. Because most romance movies are between a guy and a girl, some may say that is the point of the movie. But if that was the case than it really is a narcissistic film. Although some films it works, like movies about gays fighting for gay rights and stuff. But in this one it just didn't seem like the case. Nothing against gay people, but when gays try to make a huge deal out of there sexual preference and try to always stand out and look and act all special all the time it can get a bit annoying. Fortunately though that wasn't the case for this movie and the way it shows how a gay guy deals with a loss of a loved one a partner seem genuine and sort of sad, especially how he mourns. But because of the romance between gay lovers it will probably intrigue some straight people that watch this movie, while gay viewers will enjoy the heartfelt and touching aspect of it. Colin Firth did a good job in this and I am glad it didn't go into some glossy melodrama for the most part although it seemed pretty clear the target audiences are for gays, especially with it's numerous homo-erotic images. This has some pretty good dialogue and for straight viewers it can be a decent character study. But it really isn't for everyone.6.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting but intimately flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The biggest surprise in Mr.Tom Ford's directorial debut is also its major flaw. It is an interesting, for luck of better word, study of emotional loss, on the one hand. Mr. Ford proves to be not only a fashion designer/magician (he actually single-handedly saved Gucci a few years ago) but also a challenging director of the "excessively understated".At the same time, A Single Man is the unmistakable work of a?fashion designer.While being a modernized but, truth be said, gentle rip-off of the Viscontian Death in Venice, it represents also a kind of sterile, over-stylized world vision, where Mercedes' leathers, interior designs, clothes (?) and, more importantly, human behavior, are all as hysterically elegant as possible. In that sense Mr. Ford's work could be reduced to being an impressionist, colorfully shot autobiography.Definitely a worthy effort however, a joy to behold at moments ? especially the first third contains a beautiful comment on the machinations of memory of the one that got away ? but strangely cerebral and visually elitist ? unless you belong in the world where every damn dress code detail matters. Mr. Firth, a unique image blending of a '60s Mastroianni and a young Yves Saint-Laurent, offers a greatly reserved George, in the performance of a (so far) lifetime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"A Single Man" is by no means innovative, ground-breaking or surprising. What it is -- is best quality filmmaking, which is so rare these days. Great script from a good story, great acting, great camera work. Great directing. I watched it without checking out IMDb first, and, being thoroughly impressed, looked the director up. His first movie?? Wow... While I would vote it in at an 8 (maybe 9), I am giving it a 10 just for that. Can't wait for another one from Tom Ford.Somebody called it "flat as cardboard". Don't fall for that approach. If you are used to look deeper than the surface of your TV screen, you will find a lot to think about. If not -- well, then everything is just as flat as the screen. And for those who detest the idea of gay relationship -- it really does not matter here. It is about how one lived his life, gay or straight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. Only rarely does a film make a lasting impression on me. This is one of those films. From the opening moments Colin Firth had me in tears, before his character had even been established. In a single evocative shot Firth is able to express a range of emotions so potent, real, and engaging that the reason for his grief did not matter. Only as the plot unfolds through beautifully shot flashbacks does the film truly reveal honest expressions of love and loss.Matthew Goode is charming as always, and plays a character so real I had to look twice at the credits to assure myself that this was the same actor who played Ozymandias in Watchmen. Equally alluring is Nicholas Hoult, who manages a believable American accent. And last but certainly not least, Julianne Moore, brilliant as always, playing a complexly tragic lover so wonderfully engaging despite having very little screen time.But credit where credit's due, Tom Ford absolutely shines with his debut film. His lingering shots, his comic timing during moments of tragedy, some fantastic edits, and the ease with which he uses slow-motion and alternate lenses... breath-taking. A must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Colin Firth is The single man, or a single man, in Tom Ford's directorial debut, A single man. A single man is one of the best films of 2009, or that's what I thought. Not in the top five but somewhere else. It's a well made drama.Firth plays a gay school teacher back in the 60's. His lover(played by Matthew Goode) has died in a fatal car accident. And now that he has passed on, George(Firth) is trying to convert into becoming strait. He has kind of a thing with his neighbor(played wonderfully by Julianne Moore) and a student that has a thing for him(played by Nicholas Hoult).Firth is terrific. The film is shot in an interesting form. When Firth is on screen, the screen is gray. But when anyone else is on, it is normal color, and this changes throughout. I found A Single man to be hypnotic, and occasionally kind of witty.Moore does a decent British accent. Better than what you'd imagine. That's because she's a terrific actress. All of the actors here are at least good, even the little known ones such as Holt, who was in 2002's excellent About a boy.There is one weird flaw about this film though: The English actors in this film are doing American accents and the American actors are doing English accents. I don't know, I guess it was just a little something that I noticed. Overall though, A Single man makes my top ten films of the year. It should've been nominated over The Blind side. It's so much better. But it's obviously too late. But really that shouldn't stop you.A single man: A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Startling changes from Isherwood's book, but still fascinating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Ford's A SINGLE MAN finally makes it to my local art-house, and turns out to be well worth the wait. A fascinating example of a film of a book one likes and which I had recently re-read. (I never wanted to see the film of CAPTAIN CORELLI'S MANDOLIN once I had read it was a filleted, travelogue version of the story...).Here though the changes are quite startling as fashion designer Tom Ford creates Isherwood's story in his vision. In the 1964 novel George the university lecturer is a crumpled 58 year old with no interest in fashion and lives in a boxy apartment which was too small for him and his lover/partner Jim (who was killed in an accident). It is now 8 months later and George struggles through the day, keeping his feelings in check as he copes with the University, the students, and his best friend Charley - who is, in the novel, a lumpy middle aged woman who dresses in ethnic peasant attire and lives in a dilapidated bungalow. In the movie George lives in an impossibly glamorous glass and wood house - one laughs out loud at seeing it - with perfect modern style furnishings, which hardly seems possible on his university salary (and it just does not look 1962 style). Charley is now a very glamorous divorcée who drinks a lot and lives in what is like a Hollywood mansion.Colin Firth is totally engrossing as George and Julianne Moore certainly ramps up the glamour as Charlie. Matthew Goode is seen as the deceased partner, and Nicholas Hoult scores as the young attractive student who seems to be stalking George. There is also that attractive hustler who tries to pick him up, in that wonderfully lit scene like a studio set as they are bathed in a golden light against that giant PSYCHO poster. Details like these are fascinating and and its all brilliantly conveyed, Tom Ford has indeed brought his vision to it, as anyone who saw his "Vanity Fair" Hollywood issue will see. I particularly like his brilliantly styled flashback to the '40s when George and Jim first meet at that seaside bar.I was very pleased Colin Firth in a career best performance - he is no longer a lightweight actor - got the BAFTA award.Fascinating movie, fascinating music too - I had to wait to the very end credits to see who sang that version of "Stormy Weather", its Etta James! Its a movie I love the look of, its quite an achievement to (mainly) get the early 60s look right - all the rage now with MAD MEN. Ford also partly produced and co-wrote the screenplay. Its certainly intentionally very homo-erotic too with the camera lingering on those male bodies and in the presentation of Kenny, the student, with the white underwear and that nude swim. Niggles remain though about making it all more glamorous - those perfect white shirts! - and the ending is perplexing as there are slight changes. There is no gun or suicide intent in Isherwood's story, Kenny the student sees the photo of the nude late partner, and remains in the house on the sofa, whereas in the book George wakes up to find him gone and a note left, and then ..... Isherwood takes a detached tone regarding George and his ageing body in the book, but the George in the film looks fit in his late 40s and not likely to topple over any time soon...Looking forward to the DVD and any special features! So, another BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN ? Things were obviously very different back in the early '60s but surely there would have been more interaction with Jim's family - who must have been aware of George's existence if they were together 16 years? (In my own case in 1996 when my then partner died suddenly his family, whom I thought I had got on well with and had met several times a year for 10 years, were on the doorstep the next day to claim his possessions (which they were entitled to) and also tried to claim the house (which they were not) and this was a wealthy middle-class family!). Another comment on that impossibly perfect house - back in '62 Marilyn Monroe for instance was living in a Spanish-style bungalow, quite the style in California, with a very ordinary divan bed; there may well have been stunningly modern houses but I wouldn't imagine university lecturers were in that league!</fullReview>

I can agree, although to my opinion the film contains a bit too much aesthetic exhibitionism. It has a lot of true love and suffering from a process of assimilation. However it was too much aesthetic to be fascinating, slightly overdone. The conversations were rather boring now and then, with few exceptions.

		<shortDescription>Fellini Would Be Proud</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Single Man reminds me of an old Federico Fellini film. The well dressed, meticulously groomed cast, and a central protagonist plagued with existential angst. This film looks beautiful and at least will garner four Academy Awards nods for set design, cinematography, and wardrobe (not to mention the Best Actor nod that Firth will no doubt get).Colin Firth plays George Falconer - one of the coolest film names ever by the way - a repressed man who has woken up without his lover Jim (Matthew Goode) by his side for months. After a phone call from one of Jim's cousins it becomes clear: Jim died in a car accident outside of Denver. George will not be allowed to come to the wedding, family only of course.So now the man who was only allowed some small semblance of happiness must go about his life not allowed to grieve his loss without being discovered. This would be harder for many people, but every morning George cinches his tie knot separating his passions from his brain he becomes a unfeeling machine only passing the time until the Cubans nuke us to kingdom come. Months pass and George contemplates suicide, that is until Kenny (Nicholas Hoult) one of his young students takes an interest in the cagey old man.Colin Firth delivers the performance of his entire career and had Jeff Bridges not done Crazy Heart, the Best Actor Oscar might go to the Brit. Matthew Goode who has also turned in quite a few good performances in The Lookout, Watchmen, &amp; Brideshead Revisited, performs the thankless task of being the lover often ignored in films like Milk. And featuring one of the coolest cameos of the year (put Jon Hamm in every film).I would have never thought that designer Tom Ford would've made a good director but in the film when George finally sees that there is more to life than what's lost the colors flourish and creates one of the most beautiful scenes on celluloid I have ever seen.</fullReview>

Other than this, however, and the slightly obnoxious repetition of "sir" from the young suitor, this is a mesmerizing film that should prove enjoyable to anyone who has ever loved and grieved. At the same time, as a period piece, the reconstruction of the fashions and autos of the times is fantastic.

The musical score was perfectly blended into the drama and poignancy of each moment, never missing a beat. The writing, cinematography, and photography were perfect as well. I felt as if I were in a famous art museum viewing one masterpiece after another, not believing that mere human talent could produce so much perfection! Each character who crosses paths with Colin is beautifully "painted" into the story line. I found myself wanting to purchase the DVD (I never purchase films) as if it were a valuable work of art, About a minute before the end (I didn't know it at the time) I got a phone call, paused the film, and came back about 30 minutes later to view the remainder of the movie. I was blown away by the ending, saddened, but uplifted at the same time. The story was so intelligent. The writers and actors were able to express the innate value and diversity of human life and the way in which people can choose to relate to one another. We were drawn into the seemingly random events that in the end add up to an individual's life experience,for better or worse. A Single Man elevated my day, my week, my month. . .my life. Rented it from Redbox--the best value for a dollar I have ever gotten!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the novel of the same name by Christopher Isherwood, Tom Ford's 'A Single Man' is a declared Masterpiece in my eye. Some films entertain, some films enlighten and some films do the magic of both... 'A Single Man' is one of those rare gems that leave you awe-struck and inspired! Colin Firth stars as the protagonist George Falconer, a gay British university professor living in Southern California in 1962. Who is in a demise after his partner of 16-years passes away! 'A Single Man' is quite painful, as the film is based on a misery and thereafter. Ford makes a terrific directorial debut! His work and understanding to the subject is so fascinating that I was left inspired when the screening came to an end.'A Single Man' salutes the talent of Colin Firth. Firth is like never before. A revelation. In other and loud words, Firth does what Rush did in 'Shine'! Julianne Moore is fantastic in a brief role. Matthew Goode does a superb job as Firth's late partner.'A Single Man' is a Masterpiece all the way. Do yourself a favor: Watch 'A Single Man'. Two Big Thumbs Up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Small Step for A Single Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's always fun to see a film produced by a former creative director or artist. Mitchell Leisen, a great director, had been a costume designer. Julian Schnabel, the hack '80s art celebrity now dabbles as a director, and makes a real contribution as an art director in film. In the case of Tom Ford, one instantly appreciates this former fashionisto's primary talent to be assembling androgynous men and pretty women in a mise-en-scene with great style. But as with his fashion designs for Pinault-Printemps-Redoute, Ford is still reluctant to do anything creative, even when he holds all the cards. In 1999 he was famous for aping Nicolas Ghesquiere and other truly talented designers; and now he echoes Merchant Ivory and other prissy Masterpiece Theater types. It must be very frustrating to desire creativity and never achieve it. On the whole, the viewer will be visually stimulated by A Single Man, but left cold by the wooden, uninteresting acting. That's the director's fault. Julianne Moore is excellent as the blowsy fag hag, but it's her, not Ford's contribution. Colin Firth basically plays an uncloseted version of the character he created in Another Country, for once in his career playing to type. The Tom Ford movie brand faces the same difficulty as his struggling clothing label--there is so much less there than meets the eye.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm quite bewildered with the praise this film has received. Sure, the color tones (or lack thereof) Ford chose to use are pleasant and compliment the story quite well. However, that does not undo the damage done by several pointless slow motion sequences. What was the point? Ford over used slow motion so much that the film was rendered unbearable. The pace was slow, and it seems every moment of the film was an attempt to create some thought provoking blah blah, with the constant cliché music. The story was lacking as well. I understand the film was a portrayal of middle age, loss, and love, however, something was missing. Oh right, A STORY!!!My god, this movie was horrible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sometimes graphic portrayal of a homosexual relationship in the '60s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Making a movie that is clearly a revisionist interpretation of gay relationships in the 1960s is a way of treating the viewers with contempt. The screenwriter makes no attempt to disguise the overtly political message that these relationships were regarded as normal or acceptable in that time. They weren't. Any intimate contact between males in public would have subjected them to immediate arrest, especially kissing. This movie is nothing more than a glorified propaganda film for the gay agenda that does nothing to inform the audience about the reality of life for gay men in that era. Don't waste time or money seeing this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe nihilistic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Single Man is a subtle and dense film, dealing with issues such as homosexuality and the love in its most romantic, tough and realistic ways. It is undoubtedly an ode to those who suffer for love without a coherent logic, because love was never meant to be logical.I was caught by surprise because it is the first and only movie directed by Tom Ford, but worthy of an experienced one. Ford also produced and adapted Christopher Isherwood's novel. The acting and photography are really impressive. The died color image, representing the way Firth's character sees the world is very interesting and embraces you to his personal conflicts.The movie is not simply and only about the suffering of a man who lost someone he loved, but also a representation of what is to be gay in the society in which we live.It is interesting that in the first minutes the character of Colin Firth says that he wakes up not knowing what he is, and he just figure out what and who he should be when he is properly the way society wants to see him. This narrative demonstrates the difficulties that any homosexual still has today. The suffering that George feels means a lot more than what is supposed. It means, above all, the lack of objectivity of a mediocre and hypocritical society that is hidden behind judgments and prejudices.Although it is set in the 60's, it still has a very current context when portraying the insecurity and the way homosexuals are rejected by the society or also their lack of possibilities to be happy like anyone, or maybe that the love between two people of the same sex is not something that may last forever. Perhaps a nihilistic perspective, but it also portrays a lot how society may be responsible for so many obtuse thinking.Tom Ford stated that even people taking his movie like an example for the GLBT culture the movie doesn't has these objectives at all, but anyway, seems impossible to avoid comparisons and some questionings.It isn't just a gay-themed movie, but a human and realistic one that can make anyone think about the most sincere values &#x200b;&#x200b;of life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Today I have decided will be different."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The year is 1962, and George (Colin Firth), a quiet college professor, is about to kill himself. His lover has died and George has calmly decided that he cannot bear to live another day alone. He teaches a class, puts his papers in order, sees his best friend, and is ready to go. Then, one of his students interrupts his plan.This very intimate, somber, arty film has a good script and good actors. Firth gives a wonderful performance as a man who welcomes death; his expressive eyes speak volumes about George's pain. Julianne Moore looks like Ann-Margret with a questionable British accent and is really annoying in a small role. Nicholas Hoult is excellent as the student who makes George think there may be a reason to live after all.The director uses constant flashbacks and stylized photography and changing colors to make his emotional points and I think it all comes across as a bit heavy-handed, as does the Bernard Herrmann-esquire soundtrack. It's a wonderful, delicate story that could very well have stood on its own without the special effects or music that reminds one of "Vertigo." Recommended if you're looking for a thoughtful, quiet film with the message of "appreciate every moment."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Artistic, stylish, classy, elegant. Not surprising from Tom Ford.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Single Man is an elegant and enticing film by fashion designer and first time director Tom Ford. The cinematography is simply stunning - exquisite images and sequences of movement, beautiful contrasts of monochromatic and vibrant colors, coupled with excellent acting and enchanting music make this movie a pleasure to watch.Colin Firth's performance is extremely powerful and convincing. He is an English professor named George who after losing his partner of 16 years in an accident and having tried to go on with his life, chooses this day to be his last. What we see is this particular day, beginning with George getting dressed in the morning, putting on his impeccable suit and dark-rimmed glasses, and escalating to his meticulous preparations for his suicide. His pain is palpable without ever being overly dramatic. Colin Firth's seriousness and intensity are incredible. Ford manages to capture just the right amount of melodrama and bleakness and we not only understand but feel George's tremendous grief, without being overwhelmed by it. There are other things going on in the world around and we watch, wondering if George will or will not commit suicide.George is a man who was deeply in love but who at the same time is in love with life. His sorrow and hollowness juxtaposed with the beauty that he sees in front of him are truly alluring and magnificent. They give the movie a haunting quality, a certain glow which draws the viewer in like a magnet.Julianne Moore plays George's dear friend and portrays her character superbly, capturing the 1960's mood to perfection with her charcoal lined eyes, smoky gaze, pouty lips and cigarette always near. She spends most of her day applying make-up, smoking and drinking, but is the friend George turns to when he feels at his worst. She seems to have a way of picking him up with friendship, memories of a past fling and a bit of gin. Her perfect English accent made me forget whether she was American or British.There are also some sexually charged and ambiguous scenes with a student, played notably by Nicholas Hoult (About a Boy). It is unclear until the very end what the young man's intentions are, as he is quite clearly stalking his professor, but his presence in the story is important. Like an angel, he guides George through memories of his former lover and shows him hope for the future. This film is artistic, stylish, and classy - not surprisingly. However, it relies very much on the visual and perhaps the novel by Christopher Isherwood was able to convey more depth to the story. It is definitely worth seeing for its cinematic qualities and will hopefully leave you wondering, as I am now, what Tom Ford's next project will be. I, for one, hope that a movie is in the making; Fabio believes Mr. Ford should return to making sunglasses. My rating: 7.5 Fabio's: 6 Total score: 13.5 For more reviews please check out http://paulinasmovies.blogspot.com!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Stunning and Impressive Motion Picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Single Man was one of my most anticipated releases of 2009, and it is such a shame that I had to wait this long to see it. I finally did, and I was not disappointed. The film was definitely not as melodramatic as I expected, which is a good thing. It does not have an actual narrative in the plot, which I think proves that there can be films that are about the emotion and feeling that comes with the everyday life. The screenplay is strong, very much dialogue-driven and very substantial. Colin Firth is simply amazing and deserved that Oscar, the best leading performance of 2009, male or female. Julianne Moore was just so brilliant in her small amount of screen time. Matthew Goode is one the actors that I see branching out and leaving great performances in all of his films. The direction itself is mostly brilliant, yet at times flawed. I have read many reviews saying that the film sometimes seems too stylish and that because of it leaves the viewer with a sense of coldness towards the film. I can definitely see why, but to me I was impressed with it enough to not feel the lack of emotion as many saw, but I do agree that the film is impeccably crafted, and I disagree with many saying that it was too well done and stylish, simply because I did not think Tom Ford overdid it. Ultimately, this film reminded me a lot of The Hours, another film that is all about human feeling with amazing performances from the whole cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite holding up to its promises</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are several good things to say about this movie and the best is definitely Colin Firth. He was so good I think he deserved the Oscar for playing this part in such a subtle way. However, even without winning the prize this is an outstanding interpretation. The photography is also good, with desaturated images and very suggestive shots in black and white. You definitely need to be in an aesthetic frame of mind to appreciate all the visual details, which are many and very tasteful.On the negative side, the soundtrack is overbearing with lots of strident violins and the inevitable opera bit sung by a female diva, who might be Callas or anybody else so stereotyped loved by gay men. Definitely low points on sound.The story itself is very simple and luckily (for heterosexuals) not overtly gay. It is a story of loss, love and grievance which may happen to anybody and this universal resonance gives it some strength. We follow the Firth character during a day in his life ? rather a special day, but it is to be discovered only at the end - . He is a British teacher still heartbroken because of the death of his lover in a car crash several months earlier. He is trying to deal with with this loss, but apparently he is failing.And here comes the big deal breaker: given the intensity of his passion and of his sorrow I assumed his relationship was a relatively fresh one. I would have guessed five years at the very most. Unfortunately, according to the film, this relationship was a long-standing one, almost two decades long.Given human nature it is very hard to believe that in the course of all those years spent together this couple never had any problem. Yet all the memories we are presented with are inevitably positive and nostalgic. Also, despite the fact that Firth is playing a professor with some deep insight in human affairs, he seems to be completely lost when it comes to cope with sorrow and appreciate his life.I felt a disconnection between the main character and his actions. He was just too passive considering the type of person he was supposed to be ? clever, well-educated, and relatively well-off. Maybe it is just me but I just could not believe that such a man would give up on life without putting up a little bit more of a fight. Also, the flirtatious bits are a bit silly and quite predictable. What can give you the wish to go on living after the death of a lover? Obviously a new, younger lover?.Of course real life often is that easy. You loose somebody, you grieve and after a while you discover yourself looking at other potential partners. Still, I was expecting something more complicated, given the sophisticated set-up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the cost of the failure to live freely</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>University professor George Falconer, grieving for his lost partner Jim, but forced to suppress it because of the mores of the era he lives in, decides he will take his own life. Whether or not he will carry out that decision will be affected by the people he crosses paths with on this, ostensibly his last day.The film is far too beautiful, fastidiously so, and has a pat ending that is slightly unworthy. No doubt that ending worked superbly in the prose of a novel but it is not sustained by a cinematic telling. All is forgiven though, by the anguish and pain relayed by Colin Firth in a career-best performance. The phone call to Jim's family, relayed in flashback, where he is told - in an aside no less - that Jim has died, is a priceless thumbnail of just how callous, shabby and selfish our species can be. Fighting to stay in control on the phone, he reels inside.Julianne Moore, as the lovelorn Charley, encapsulates the desperation of an ageing one-time beauty. Jim's death is partly a tragedy for her friend, but equally an opportunity for her. She is called on to live up to the friendship, and found wanting. In the process, she gains our sympathy.Ultimately, it is the failure to live true to ourselves that is the tragedy portrayed here. Behind the sheen of the photography is that sad little truth that will reach and touch most audiences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A quiet, restrained and very deep film indeed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you discover an Author and are captivated by the first of his works you read it is quite likely that you will immediately want to explore the rest. That was certainly my experience with Christopher Isherwood. I read Goodbye to Berlin in my teens back in the early 1960s and soon I had worked my way through just about everything significant that Isherwood had written. It isn't actually a particularly large oeuvre ? perhaps a dozen or so major works ? but every one is entertaining, thought-provoking and tumbling with sincerity. For many the best of them all will be A Single Man - I remember its first publication in 1964 by which time a greater tolerance was being shown in Britain, post Lady Chatterley. But still openly gay literature was something of a novelty in our then still rather backward society ? even James Baldwin's magnificent Giovanni's Room was a bit of an under-the-counter purchase! And the idea that a book like A Single Man could be filmed and shown on general release would not have been considered possible ? certainly without what would have been utterly destructive censorship. In our more enlightened age these restrictions no longer apply and it is with great pleasure that we can enjoy such a skillful and honest realisation of Isherwood's work as in Tom Ford's fine movie.The loss of a partner is a common theme in the cinema but I doubt that it has ever been more sympathetically portrayed than in A Single Man ? the book and, now, the film. I would like to make reference to an equally moving account in a much less "Arty" but no less interesting film ? Richard Curtis's Four Weddings and a Funeral. The Funeral in that film was that of the colourful Gareth ? a gay man who died suddenly at the third of the film's weddings. At that funeral Charles (Hugh Grant) remarks "It's odd isn't it ? all these years we've been single and proud of it, we never noticed that two of us were to all intents and purposes married all the time". And these words resonate with those of Matthew, Gareth's partner, who had touchingly quoted from WH Auden's "Stop the clocks" ? a poem which mourns the loss of a partner. Gareth and Matthew and, in The Single Man George and Jim, had partnerships that were so close and so loving that the loss of the partner, suddenly and quite unexpectedly, was too much to bear. Or it was in George's case anyway.A Single Man is a film about the response to grief. About how even the most educated and urbane of men, like Professor George Falconer, can quite literally find the loss of their life partner unbearable. The closeness of the relationship is illustrated in a few flashback scenes ? most memorably one where the two men are sitting peacefully on a sofa and joshing a bit ? as married couples do. They were one another's "North and South and East and West" and for George it is clear that, as Auden put it, "Nothing now can ever come to any good" ? and so he decides to kill himself. In part this decision comes from his loneliness ? a state from which neither his long standing friend Charley (Julianne Moore) nor a handsome and possible gay or bisexual student admirer Kenny (Nicholas Hoult) can rescue him. These are two strong characterisations and the main theme of the film, the search for love and the extreme distress when it is taken from you is played out in their characters as well. Charley's husband left him and while she has many "friends" she reveals that only George is a true one and someone she really cares about. Similarly young Kenny had a relationship with a very pretty fellow student Doris (Nicole Steinwedell) whose undeniable charms Tom Ford cleverly negates by showing her sullen in class and chain-smoking. Kenny has split with Doris and is perhaps seeking something more cerebral and satisfying with the stylish and classy George?A Single Man is a quiet, restrained and very deep film indeed. It is about one key part of the human condition ? our need for love and the way we manage it when it happens - and when it departs. It is a gay film as it was a gay book ? but in a way that is incidental. George could be mourning the loss of a wife rather than a same sex lover ? his response would have been the same ? as Charley points out. To make it work sincerely Tom Ford had to get huge performances from his actors - most of all from Colin Firth who as George is on screen virtually the whole time. Firth is quite exceptional and his Oscar nomination and other awards were well deserved. He is utterly convincing ? something he achieves by understating rather than exaggerating his performance. I also enjoyed immensely Nicolas Hoult's Kenny ? a difficult role to pull off because in less skilled hands in could turn into a sentimental child rather than the sensitive young adult that Isherwood wrote about and Ford clearly wants in the role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One day in the life of a grieving gay man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George is a fastidious college professor at a small college in Santa Monica, California. He is a gay man who has lost his lover of long standing some months ago. As the movie opens George is still grieving, to the point where he sees no future and plans his suicide.Flashbacks fill us in on how George has come to be where he is. He had had a rewarding relationship with his significant other Bill, who was killed in an auto accident. The film takes place in 1962, so gay marriage was not even on the radar screen.After having seen the movie I was thinking of how it could be recast as a more mainstream love story and I found that that was not easy. The fact that George is gay is essential to the story. When George's female friend Charlie says to him that it is too bad that he never had a *real* relationship, George is justifiable piqued. And maybe more than a little hurt that someone who supposedly knows him well never understood his relationship with Bill. I cannot imagine that a close friend of a man grieving for his wife would ever make the comment that it was too bad that that man never had had a real relationship. I doubt that we will ever live in a "post gay" world, just as we will probably never live in a truly post racial world. Gays will always live with a label.One of the most powerful scenes is a lecture George gives in his class about the power of fear and how it is used to manipulate, intimidate, and justify spiteful behavior in response to things that are not understood. Given what we know about George, it is clear where he is coming from in giving that lecture.I think Colin Firth deserved his Oscar nomination. He can say a lot with facial expressions. I found his George believable.The score is often relevant to the action. For example, the famous aria from Catalani's opera "La Wally" (which relates to a person leaving home forever) is a good background for the scenes that have George practicing his suicide methods. I thought that the use of that aria in "Diva" probably would scare off anybody else using it in a film score, but not so.The use of color plays a significant role. When George is feeling low the colors are desaturated, but when he is starting to show signs of life, the use of oranges and reds predominate. Interesting concept, but ultimately I got to feel I was being beaten over the head with it.As George has decided that this will be his last day on earth, he becomes more attuned to little pleasures that the day brings, like seeing two young males playing tennis. His encounter with an attractive student finally brings him back to life. There are some good quotes, like the one from Aldous Huxley, "Experience is not what happens to you; it's what you do with what happens to you." When George suggests to Charlie that she focus on the future, she says, "My future is the past."I guess the message is that it should not take the certainty of impending death to force us to appreciate the small pleasures that come our way on a given day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first thing that struck me about the film was the sheer beauty of every shot, like each scene was a masterfully hand-painted picture, wrought with emotion and exquisitely presented. I especially appreciated the use of different shades of the same colours to illustrate the different moods of the individual characters-all done in an extremely subtle way so that the viewer, without realising, begins to feel for every character.Colin Firth's performance leaves one speechless. It is quite a departure for him as a role but he performs it so brilliantly that the audience is left riding with him on his emotional journey. The chemistry between Firth and Julianne Moore is one of the more enjoyable aspects of the film, as also Julianne Moore's performance itself.Most surprising for me was Nicholas Hoult's performance. Having seen him before in Skins, I was surprised at the versatility of his acting, in a role that was different yet still complicated enough.Finally, the music by Abel Korzeniowski and Shigeru Umebayashi is a real treat; simple and unadorned but simply perfect.This film will grab you by the hand and throw you in. Don't be surprised if you cry at the end-quite a few people in the hall were in tears.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Collin Firth at his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me this is one of the best movies I ever watched. I have followed Collin Firth's work for a long time and his performance in A Single Man is absolutely brilliant! Outstanding, I must add. With modern times comes modern thinking and to be able to show this so well in such a short period of time, is amazing. I know Nicholas Hoult from Skins and he has developed a lot since then. That is most likely due to his mature character which he acted great. I want to point out one thing that to me is a very important matter: being gay. Being gay doesn't take away your feelings or your rights to live a free life. George (Collin Firth) suffered a great amount of pain and void when his boyfriend passed away in a car accident. And even though his boyfriend's family acknowledged their relationship they did NOT let George go to the funeral. 'Only to family' as if he wasn't family. The movie takes place in the 60's I think but the minds of nowadays men and women are still so closed. Our minds should be wide open to different sexual orientations. Life's too short not to live it fully. This movie took me to a place where I found my self very sensitive. The loss of a loved one. The pain, the void and the loneliness surrounding it. A Single Man moved me and amplified my support for gay relationships and I must add, I am a full straight woman. The movie shows how brief a happy moment in life can be: just at the end of the movie George is happy to be in the company of a young man he really liked, Kenny. After only one mere night his life ends and so does the new-found happiness.A must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In our current time of folksy and populist sentiment, I read some early comments on just the trailer for "A Single Man" that labeled it pretentious or worse the "e" word (elitist). Well just forget all of that if you have not seen it. This atmospheric movie about grief directed by Tom Ford and starring Colin Firth, Julianna Moore among others is a beautifully made movie. The 1964 novel by Christopher Isherwood is a first person story with a lot of inner monologue and tells the story of a middle aged college professor who is mourning the loss of his male lover in a era where sexual orientation was only whispered about in most situations. How to portray the inner life of a character has challenged many a movie maker but Tom Ford takes all of the elements that could have failed and succeeds for the most part. Don't go away from this though expecting a "downer" because there is genuine humor here. Colin Firth plays excellently droll opposite Julianna Moore and Nicholas Hoult ( a flirtatious student who you will recognize from BBC's runaway hit "Skins" and earlier "About A Boy"). I especially love Moore and Firth together. They act out a genuinely sad but funny scenario minus the silly baggage gay story-lines are often saddled with. Think Will &amp; Grace if Will had not been essentially neutered and Grace drank too much. One last thought... the above trailer, I think, tries to misdirect from the gay subject matter but the movie never does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Replace a "Jim" with a "Jane" &amp; you still have the same amazing.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>......performance by a Colin Firth at the very top of his game. Oh, and forget any "gay" connotation; it's really not important. Why? Because in an alternate version of this film, Firth would play his role in a same-words, same-emotions kind of way......in EXACTLY the same heart-rending manner we've just witnessed from him on screen. In such a second version, "George" would face loss of his life's love---either female lover or more likely, wife---and struggle toward a way in which to go on. And an English Department blonde secretary, perhaps, would fill in for a "Carlos." But, like "George," only "Kenny" (a neuter character searching for his sexuality and/or a victim of hero worship) would be reenacting his same role in the second version. (Oh, and I suppose we could let old friend, "Charley" / JuIianne Moore, hang around again). In sum, then, I believe it is paramount you realize that in this other take of the film Firth, particularly, would play his character in an identical manner---no matter the sex of his "partner."That's correct, viewers past and future; now you've got it. This is NOT a gay drama (certainly not a gay romance), but rather a tale of love lost (one of life's biggest) and, more importantly, is a lesson in enduring. BUT....if in the end you fail to see it as other than one of the top performances by an actor you may ever witness, then your love of film / movies is restrictive and shallow.****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was mesmerizing from the opening scene right through to the end. The stylish and meticulous direction of Tom Ford evokes an amazing mood. The cinematography is impressive and so expressive. Superb costume design and outstanding period flavor, very very detailed and it genuinely evokes the era in which it is set. Above all is the bravura performance by Colin Firth. I have always liked him as an actor, but this role puts him in a whole new league. All the performances are excellent, and Julianne Moore excels in a supporting role. The pacing is perfect. The score does what a score is supposed to do, to compliment and subtly enhance the scenes. Beautifully done in every way. Fascinating, thought provoking and brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love and grief in slow motion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about an eventful day of an English professor's life, after the unexpected and tragic death of his boyfriend."A Single Man" is beautiful shot, with aesthetically pleasing scenes that do not appear self indulgent. The plot is subtly delivered. It does not require words to deliver its bleak message. The pacing is slow, which gives viewers time to enter the mind of George, to be him and feel his pain. It's portraying love and grief in slow motion. I find the physical side of "A Single Man" rather toned down. Even when the actors kiss in the flashbacks, the kisses are never more than lips barely touching each other. Whether it is due to "A Single Man" trying to make it big in mainstream Hollywood, or it is to follow the gloomy mood of the plot, we would probably not know. Either way, homo-eroticism is unmistakable and well done in scenes such as players playing tennis, or when Kenny and Carlos try to befriend George respectively.I am impressed by "A Single Man", and the more impressive thing is that it is made by a first time director. I look forward to watching another Tom Ford film in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a humble and firm step toward the re-discovery of sensuality in western cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i know i am a little bit late to see the film, as it was released more than half a year already. but it is better late than...more late. the flawless cinematography, and well-put together screenplay hail Tom Ford as an outstanding director and a keen businessman, ready to snatch a vacant niche in the contemporary American cinema. the one, that has been lacking contribution for decades already. the niche of Human Psycho and Sensuality.i can clearly see the methods and general structure in A Single Man the director owes to the pioneering work of Wong Kar Wai, who managed to fuse the Asian deep perception of the nature of human Sensuality and Love with the visual form, accessible to the minds of western civilization. now, what clearly matters, is that Tom Ford puts a humble brick in the foundation of a well-forgotten tradition of sincerity and thoughtfulness, when dealing with Humanity on screen in a pure western production. i am glad this is happening.Tom Ford, i am sure, will continue to create in the current lines, and take his part in a virtual quartet, together with Coens, Aronofsky, and Mottola, to reveal and capture the intricate details of sense and sensibility and deliver it to the audience. it is about time the niches in that area start to become pieces of the puzzle, which come together to build a reflection of a Man (in a sense of a Human Being) on the Big Screen. and it is about time that cinema as an art start to make the spectators think and dream, as opposed to consume and regurgitate.it is even more important, that the current trend happens in a more mainstream setting as opposed to the art-cinema scene, as it might have a power to reach a potentially wider audience as it might have otherwise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fashion and film have always gone together - beautifully. From Holly Golightly's entrance in Breakfast at Tiffany's, unapologetically adorned in Givenchy's signature glamour to the John Paul Guitar's futuristic head-trip of New York street wear in Luc Besson (Awesome) Fifth Element. When I heard, former Gucci designer, Tom Ford was set to release his debut feature film, not only as a costume designer but writer and director, I have to admit despite my appreciation for his work my first reaction was the film would be all style and very little substance. I couldn't have been more wrong.Ford's adaptation of Christopher Isherwood's novel of the same title set in 1962, follows a day in the life of a gay English professor George (Collin Firth) contemplating suicide as a way to cope with the grief of loosing his lover of sixteen years. Despite the film's exploration of loss within a homosexual relationship, A Single Man is not simply a "gay film". Firth's faultless portrayal of grief is an emotion an audience member of any sexual orientation can relate to.In regards to visuals, you just can't fault the film. Ford pays as much attention to the film as he does to fine tailoring of his garments. You could argue the film's style is a little too distracting if it didn't mesh so beautifully with George's experience of grief. Every frame captures perfectly the detail not only of experience but the film's contemporary setting. Slow motion tracking shots absorb every aspect of the tragedy, beauty and angst that accompanied American life in the late 1950's and 60's. Sequences like this break up the intense narrative, allowing Ford to create an experience akin to flipping through a retrospective coffee table book.Ford's attention to detail can be seen midway through the film in what is arguably the film's most poignant scene. As George converses with Carlos a gorgeous male prostitute - with striking resemblance to James Dean, the two are captured smoking Lucky Strikes ? kitted out in the uniform of the 60's - immaculate white t-shirts, blue jeans, gabardine chinos, crisp white shirts and a narrow black neckties. Standing in front of a vintage Hitchcock Psycho billboard underneath the beautiful smoggy Hollywood sunset Carlos' final lines -'Sometimes awful things have their own kind of beauty' give a perfect description of what Ford as director was trying to achieve ? the telling of a story of that expresses the innate beauty that accompanies one of the greatest universal human emotions.All in all Ford achieves a lot in his debut, he manages to tell a meaningful story and in a not so brazen way to shed light on the difficulties gay men in long-term relationships experienced then as well as now. I do get the impression with some of the camera work Ford is still trying to find his feet but I don't doubt he'll get a few more features down the line. The entire cast do an amazing job Firth is totally deserving of his BAFTA; Julianne Moore supports Firth sufficiently, managing with limited screen time to tell her own story. Nicholas Hoult also does a great job, if I were splitting hairs I would say his attempts to express the more philosophical aspects of the film are a little wooden, but as a rising star the only way seems to be up for him. A Single Man is a film anyone from fashion lover to plain old lovers can really enjoy and connect with.I could say more but words don't do it justice go out and experience it for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay so this film opens with death and closes with death but what happens along the way is wickedly beautiful. In the most simplest of terms it's glass half empty or half full. For me, it was about losing oneself and finding oneself. I have not read the novel but I would have preferred a fade to black before George's death. Even still, with the peace and clarity he finds before his demise. I was left with a sort of tranquil calm. I could maybe... just maybe have also gone without a few of the swim sequences. But all in all, I would have to say that they work well in balancing the darker tones. This is without a doubt one for the DVD collection!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Single Man" projects a touching internal struggle with great sensual detail</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You won't find a more visually immaculate film than "A Single Man." Gucci frontman Tom Ford's film debut is something out of an inch-thick fashion magazine. His eye for beauty and sensuality might be unparalleled in Hollywood with just this one entry. Applied to the story of a man torn apart inside with the loss of his lover as he tries to get through a normal day, "A Single Man" gets directly inside its protagonist's head with a barrage of emotion-evoking imagery. Although it sometimes feels like a cologne commercial, it's a remarkable first effort and a touching story commanded gracefully by Colin Firth. Firth stars as George, a British English professor living in 1960s L.A. whose partner, Jim, (Matthew Goode) has died in a car accident. Months later, having never been fully able to mourn Jim's death because he wasn't invited to the "family only" funeral, George finds the daily grind of his lonely life unendurable. The film takes place on the day during which George has planned his suicide and the emotional roller coaster that just one day brings between sensory reminders of Jim and other feelings of desire suppressed by his melancholia.Taking place in a day in addition to a series of short flashbacks, "A Single Man" isn't an eventful film, but more an artistic approach to grief and wrestling with the past. A smell or an object brings on a new memory where Ford slows the film down and focuses on some sensual or sexual detail that he lets linger before the camera, all while Polish composer Abel Korzeniowski pours on some gorgeous strings. The stirring melodies of the score are so crucial to the success of a script that relies so much on storytelling through visual detail where otherwise silence would prevail.Surprisingly for a rookie filmmaker, Ford seems to have mastered the close-up. He's fascinated by eyes and lips (as well as the nude male form) and although the film is not explicitly sexual, the tension is so thick. George encounters co-workers, strangers and a young student (Nicholas Hoult) in particular that are attractive to him and we connect with this subconscious thought because of Ford's technique. Gay or straight or somewhere in between, he draws such incredible attention to the beauty in his film and plucks an innate sexual chord in the minds of the audience. The sexuality is beautiful, touching a times -- not forced and visceral -- all shown through very deliberate and specific shots. You see exactly what Tom wants you to and you're with him from shot to shot.Not every sensory moment feels deeply connected to the story and so "A Single Man" does seem to meander at times, but Firth's performance never lets us stray from the emotional journey he's enduring on the inside. From the first heartbreaking flashback where he gets the fateful phone call to his thoughts about the handsome young Kenny who has developed a crush for his professor, there's never a moment when we're closed off to George. Julianne Moore, playing George's longtime friend and one-time fling, pulls off the same feat in her brief screen time, reminding us that even though George is gay and his circumstances unique, loss, loneliness and being unable to put aside the past are universal obstacles on life's journey."A Single Man" is an art film, not a drama where the conflict is visible and explicit, rather internal and quiet. It is a film visually driven by pristine art direction, sets and costumes in addition to the beautiful cast members. It is a must-see for anyone with a taste that leans toward independent film, in particular imagery and visual symbolism.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the minute the opening credits started I was in love with this movie. The color of the ocean, the bodies in the water, were they alive or dead? The music was beautiful the photography was beautiful. In a way I was carried back to what now seems a very simple time. Although the movie presents a very calm, sedate, mostly uncontroversial view of that time, in what it does depict it is truthful. The absence of answering machines, colored t.v. plastic bags. The presence of smoking in college class rooms, formality in people addressing one another these were all true touches. Colin Firth was almost perfect as (can't believe it but I am drawing a complete blank on his name) Julienne Moore was slightly less perfect. . . her character was completely believable but her portrayal was a dite over the top. Matthew Goode was very appealing and likable. The Spanish man and the male student, besides being very good looking both seemed like very decent men. So far this year this is my favorite movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A gay professor mourns the death of his lover of 16 years. There are excellent performances from Firth and Moore, and this is a remarkable film debut for Ford. This is mainly a character study and the dialog is intelligent. However, the ending is contrived. The wistful cinematography and melancholy score are well suited to the mood of the film. While the theme of loss of a loved one is universal, this is not a film where the the love just happens to be between two men. The homosexuality is an integral part of the film's fabric, with the numerous homo-erotic images suggesting that the target audience here is gay men.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An exquisitely sensitive, sad and meditative film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an absolutely outstanding achievement, nothing short of cinematically miraculous. And what is most amazing of all is that Tom Ford, who wrote, produced and directed the film has never written, produced or directed any other. Like Athena, he has sprung full-fledged from the brow of Zeus. Suddenly there he is. Where was he all these years? He seems to have been a fashion designer, which is a very fine thing to be, though not my area of knowledge, so I cannot comment, but how he suddenly became a cinematic genius is not explained. The film is dedicated to the memory of a particular person, and I suspect it may well have been to a 'significant other' in Ford's life. The lead performance by Colin Firth is probably the best he has ever done in his long and distinguished career, and it is no surprise that he was nominated for an Oscar for it. Julianne Moore as the old friend who has always been hopelessly in love with him is as brilliant as usual. One never expects less from her. How did she do such a perfect English accent? That's acting, folks. This story is based on a novel by Christopher Isherwood, from whose writings about his days in Berlin when young came that much earlier miracle of a film, I AM A CAMERA (1955, see my review). Isherwood lived through the time when being a gay man was illegal, and when gay men were a viciously persecuted minority. This film had to be treated as a period piece because of the social changes which have ensued, which is why we are firmly told in a title at the beginning that we are in November 1962, and we even have a little TV and radio coverage of the Cuban Missile Crisis and a few words spoken about it by Firth, though this emphasis on the period is trivial and of no relevance to the story, just a kind of whisper offstage. The action all takes place in a single day, and what a sad but amazing day it is. Ford's intense close-ups of portions of people's faces while Firth stares hard at them are most effective, and contribute greatly to the mood. The entire film is what is called 'a mood piece'. Firth's cumulative grief at the loss of his partner whom he deeply loved, and who died in a car crash some months earlier, has got the best of him. He is going under. He marches through the routine of the day as a professor at Stamford University in Palo Alto robotically, though he does deliver what for him, as a quiet man, is something of an outburst to his class. The film is interwoven with poignant flashbacks, and everywhere Firth is haunted by memories and pain. The elegiac qualities of the film are the visual equivalent of Ravel's 'Pavanne on a Dead Infant'. The 20 year-old actor Nicholas Hoult does a wonderful job as a student of Firth's who intuits Firth's silent grief and desperation and is drawn to him. Matthew Goode plays Firth's partner in flashbacks, with sensitivity and style. Ford certainly seems to appreciate British actors, because Firth, Hoult, and Goode are all from Britain. (Firth, Hoult and Goode, it sounds a bit like Faith, Hope and Charity, doesn't it? Or is that too British an allusion?) Rarely in recent years have we seen such intensely sensitive and searing emotion portrayed on film so quietly, so gently, almost like the lapping of ripples in a country pond. Firth is so convincing as a quiet, introverted gay man that while watching him it is impossible to call to mind his many earlier roles and the fact that he is straight. In fact, there was a bit of protest in Britain about the fact that Ford did not choose a gay man to play a gay man, but that is just silly. I must confess that I had no idea until seeing this that Firth, fine actor that he is, was capable of such understated and masterly profundity in a film performance. Is it because he has massively matured as an actor or was it always there under the surface waiting to come out and he just didn't get the right parts to show his stuff? He now begins the process of entering the 'classic actor' category, and I can see him as Sir Colin if he keeps on like this. This film is really so sensitive and heart-breaking, so intimate and personal, that one seems to be inside the tormented psyche of the suffering Firth, which was doubtless just what the director intended. We feel every little thing that he feels, and that is so difficult to achieve that the entire creative ensemble responsible for this film deserve all the awards, all the praise that can possibly be heaped upon them.</fullReview>

'A Single Man' has a perfect example of this when the main character dies from a sudden heart attack at the end. It could have happened at any point during the 90 minute boring gay love story but for some unknown reason we have to sit through this over-hyped (because it's Colin Firth) nonsense to get to it.

		<fullReview>Mr. Ford drown this movie in stylization, so much so that it becomes unwatchable. First the lighting of the film...okay, we'll give him that, he is trying to remind us of the '60's by using a film stock that is reminiscent of those washed out instamatic camera photos. But then in other scenes he switches to other film stock and lighting which is random and inexplicable. Then he dresses and coifs everyone to the hilt as if everyone is in one of his fashion shows. Next the set designs, just like his costumes and hairdo's are hyper immaculate which is pointlessly distracting. After that, he throws in smatterings of music such as, instrumental theme songs, arias and in one scene where Julian Moore is getting dressed he even has a Serge Gainsbourg song (I hate to say this Mr. Ford, Gainsbourg wasn't singing those songs in '62). And finally, the editing is jumpy and bewildering.Then one wonders why he has cast Julianne Moore at all; was there a dearth of British actresses? She's a fine actress but doesn't fit in here. Firth is another SUPERB actor who is not right for the role though he really does try very hard to make it work. All in all it seems like Mr. Ford wanted so much to play the lead himself, I must wonder why he didn't.He has made what is meant to be a subtle piece by Christopher Isherwood, so sentimental and gushy that he has sucked the marrow out of the tenuousness of the narrative.Personally, I found this film boring and highly pretentious. An unfortunate use of fine actors and possibly a fine piece of writing. Ultimately a nonplussing attempt all around.</fullReview>

He loved a guy a lot, then he died, that's as far as the past story develops. The present doesn't even develop either, it's just a passing of one boring encounter to the next. Now I'm depressed because I watched this movie and that's not because it is depressing, but because it's so bad and it wasted my time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Gay Agenda PlotIt's November 30, 1962. Native Brit George Falconer, an English professor at a Los Angeles area college, is finding it difficult to cope with life. Jim, his personal partner of sixteen years, died in a car accident eight months earlier when he was visiting with family. Jim's family were not going to tell George of the death or accident, let alone allow him to attend the funeral. This day, George has decided to get his affairs in order before he will commit suicide that evening. As he routinely and fastidiously prepares for the suicide and post suicide, George reminisces about his life with Jim. But George spends this day with various people, who see a man sadder than usual and who affect his own thoughts about what he is going to do. Those people include Carlos, a Spanish immigrant/aspiring actor/gigolo recently arrived in Los Angeles; Charley, his best friend who he knew from England, she who is a drama queen of a woman who romantically desires her best friend despite his sexual orientation.You know the drill. Films like this get backing because there is a gay agenda in the entertainment field. They don't make money but some how no one cares. They attract notable actors who want to get in good with the gay agenda in case they say something off color. Instant pass.So how about the film on its own merits? It's horrible. Overly slow... plodding...cheaply filmed and poorly directed. And the story? Well if you are not totally immersed in the gay lifestyle you will be bloody bored out of your noggin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some Major Misfires</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very thoughtful movie, beautifully filmed and scripted and with first rate performances. Its the type of movie that, without question, is in the category of serious, Oscar worthy film-making and criticism should serve only to measure the work among its peers. Oh yes, it is captivating and thoroughly enjoyable to watch.My major problem is one I believe can be leveled against a number of movies that deal with homosexual characters, circumstances and themes. I don't mind when such works point out the hypocrisy and unfair condemnation of our society in general has against gay men and women. But sometimes I get the distinct feeling such films try to portray male heterosexual family life as foolish, contrived, a fraud, etc. The messages I get is, "You don't understand homosexuality because you're too stupid and superficial." and/or "Who would want such an awful thing as a heterosexual partner and, worse, children!" I got that feeling when I watched 2002's THE HOURS, also Oscar material. I got that feeling watching A SINGLE MAN when the male members of the family next door (in direct contrast to the female members of the family) seemed consistently portrayed as one-dimensional, superficial and discompassionate. The message I seem to get is that if a male does not grow up to be homosexual than he lacks something, is dim-witted or otherwise unable to grasp the finer things in life. Indeed, THE HOURS, A SINGLE MAN, A HOME AT THE END OF THE EARTH, BENT or anything by Gus Van Sant do not just lack well adjusted, moral heterosexual males, they seem to take a stab at them just for being heterosexual males! I'd be remiss if I didn't point out KISS OF THE SPIDER WOMAN, which does a fine job of examining hetero and homo sexual orientations. But William Hurt's character is more of a hero therein; i.e., less of an Everyman. Also, I'm betting that at least some of the makers of my above-mentioned films may despise KOTSW as too condescending.My only other criticism is minor. ASM had scenes that were either ill-conceived attempts at humor or had unintended humorous consequences. E.g., the "hop-off-toilet-with-pants-down" and the "how-to-shoot-yourself-in-style" sequences didn't fit well with the tone and mood of the film.But still a solid "8".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As simple as that</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Ford's debut as a filmmaker is absolutely stunning. It tells the tale of the every-day fight of our neighbour, old love, us and how they or we get by the day, living it as well as we can, sowing our own lives a day at a time. And after all the struggles, after all the pain and cut fingers, we are reminded of the fragile nature of the work of art that we create. Even when Goerge decides to change thread, get on the next bus maybe, his heart races ahead of him and he is confronted with the precariousness of it all.An outstanding performance by Colin Firth and surprises from some of the other actors. Intricate visuals, perfect choice of music. To me - this film is one of the best of the year. One that actually tells a story, that still amazes and makes one think about the simple yet heavy task of 'being'. It's surprising how even an insight into a day of someone else's life can change perception of reality. Tom Ford gives us a moment of clarity, starts from a few seconds and stretches it till it becomes a moment as light and lucid as a fine silk veil.. "And just like that, it came."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A SINGLE MAN (2009) *** Colin Firth, Julianne Moore, Nicolas Hoult, Matthew Goode, Ginnifer Goodwin, Jon Kortajarena, Paulette Lamori, Lee Pace. (uncredited v/o : Jon Hamm) Firth gives an Oscar-calibre (and ultimately well-deserved nomination) and career high performance as a closeted homosexual English professor circa 1962 whose inner pain from losing his partner in a car accident has led his despair to a final day of acceptance ? a pact to kill himself ? that ultimately proves to be a true life lesson. First-time filmmaker ? and one time fashion maven/maverick ? Tom Ford certainly has a painterly eye for fine detail and impeccable recreated feel of the era but it is truly Firth's turn as a deeply wounded and troubled man facing the abyss that is heartbreaking and fulfilling all at once. A real gem of acting by a underrated thespian.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contrary to popular belief, this is no Broke Back Mountain.A Single Man is a wonderful theatrical piece with strong performances by Colin Firth (plays Jim Falconer, a gay English Professor) and Julianne Moore (plays Charley, his infatuated female friend). It is one of the rarest, most riveting and best written and directed movies ever made in America! Basically, Jim Falconer's sexual orientation makes him a pariah in the 1960's sexual revolution. He is a distinguished and extremely guarded professor whose only friend is a woman bent on rekindling their old romance.When he learns of the death of his lover of 16 years, Jim is devastated and starts to plot suicide. Before he does, he begins to seek out the company of others, which leads him to bond with a Spanish male immigrant and one of his male students.I highly recommend this movie for everyone. After seeing it once, I still want to see it again. It is that good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a fascinating and sad screenplay, a harrowing lead, muddled direction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want to give Tom Ford credit on his debut as a writer and director, but it's really on the front of the script that he comes through the best. He and David Scearce adapt a novel by Christopher Isherwood about a day and night full of grief, where an English professor (Firth) has just found out that the love of the past sixteen years - a gay love with an architect played by Matthew Goode- has died in a car accident. He can't go to the funeral, and he can't tell his colleagues or even those around him save for a sort of divorcée floozie (Julianne Moore), and so he goes to work as a professor, putting on a face and meticulously studying the faces and eyes of those he sees around him, as he quietly has a kind-of nervous breakdown.It's in the words that Ford lets these actors speak, and likewise letting his actors like Firth and Moore and Goode and newcomer Nicholas Hault breathe some sometimes uncomfortable life into the characters, that makes A Single Man watchable. Especially for Firth- one of those shoe-ins, like Jeff Bridges, who is perhaps far more outstanding than the material he's given to work with- who makes this closet homosexual in 1962 Los Angeles into a person broken down and unable to connect after his break from his love. His character could get closer to others again, even to strangers like the Hispanic James Dean he runs into in a parking lot as they smoke cigarettes, but it's fascinating to see how he flinches or stares blankly at someone, and how he genuinely feels every step of the way.But unlike a key scene in the film- one of the best of the year in fact where Firth's George Falconer tries to commit suicide, rather badly it would seem, that is shown to us straightforward-like save for some opera in the background sound- Ford as a director sometimes really gets in the way of his own script. His use of slow-motion is fine... the first two or three times he uses it, but it becomes overkill. It might be of some note that he was a former editor and photographer at Vanity Fair, and it comes through that a lot of his images, his focusing on eyes and faces for long stretches, or out-of-focus shots or that repetitive scene of the man naked in water, show this flamboyance of style. But the material, and the actors like Firth and Moore, can take the movie where it needs to go without the high-pitched string arrangements every step of the way, or, again, the device of the camera as a representation of George's inner-landscape, so it goes.And yet even with the problem I have with some of Ford's choices with camera and editing, A Single Man is a recommendation for another interesting look at hard romance from a bygone era. It's a sad and unforgiving movie, but it does have a slight (possibly ironic) reprieve at the very end, and its excesses in style will endear it to many.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is now making the rounds on cable. I'm shocked at the good reviews it received when in the theaters. The movie is full of annoying and repetitious clichés that would be criticized in a first year film class. The actors do what they can with the material, but it's sad to see wonderful actors like Firth and Moore in such a poorly filmed movie. The script is weak; more like a gay fantasy found in a cheap porn movie. The camera work is horrible, not from a technical aspect but from an artistic one. This was Tom Ford's first, and so far only, movie as director and writer. He's got a lot to learn. I have not read the original Isherwood story on which the script is based, but now I have to read it to see how it stacks up with the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Firth first in line for high marks and more coming for Moore, but the Ford administration still needs better directorial leadership.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A Single Man" was heralded last year as one of the most exquisite films of the year. I would not single it out to that echelon, but nevertheless it's still a recommended watch for no better reason than the lavish performances from Colin Firth and Julianne Moore. Firth stars as George Falconer, a British college professor who is in a dismal state due to the recent death of his romantic partner Jim. George's best friend is the gabby socialite Charley, who also has had her share of heartbreak &amp; melancholy, and constantly relies on George for companionship. One could say Mr. Falconer is Charley's Angel. Charley however craves for George to be more like Clooney and less like Michael by still feeling a magnetic romantic attraction towards him and craves for that feeling to be reciprocated from George. Give it up Charley, he is not exactly Curious George. "A Single Man" is set in one day which George plans to commit suicide. Firth is deserving of all the acclaim and awards he received for his leading performance here, even though his stale depressive gaze proclaimed him as the antithesis of the Sally Hawkins character of "Happy-Go-Lucky", another British film. Moore was top notch, and what moore can this woman do to finally get her well-deserved Oscar. Writer-Director Tom Ford, a novice director who is an acclaimed fashion designer, does fit the part more of an astute writer than a stylish movie director with his effort here; loved the screenplay, mixed feelings on his direction. I was fond of how he developed the comradery between George and Charley. And the flashbacks of George and Jim together did provide some foundation to George's grief. However, Ford was out of auteur fashion by highlighting the attraction that George's college student Kenny Porter has towards him. Porter was portrayed more as a creepy stalker than a young man thirsting for knowledge and guidance. Matthew Goode was not bad but not too good as Jim, and Nicholas Hoult could have halted a bit his thespian delivery in his portrayal as Kenny. The film's score, art direction, costume design, and cinematography were done elegantly by more than just a single man and woman. So I tip my hat to those involved. It is not a sin to single out "A Single Man" to your "must see" list, but I would not exactly go "ga ga" in cinematically meeting "A Single Man". *** Average</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Single Man The best thing about being a single man is that you never have to worry about all the little inconsequential details that go into a relationship, like remembering anniversaries or to flush the toilet. Instead, you're free to focus on spell-checking that suicide note before your next attempt.Sadly, the single man in this drama is also contemplating taken his own life, however, he is not doing so over the absence of a female ? but of a male.Set in Los Angles in 1962, A Single Man chronicles the end days of a homosexual English professor, George (Colin Firth), who has recently lost his lover, Jim (Matthew Goode), in a car accident. Forbidden by Jim's parents to attend the funeral, instead, George ruminates over his favourite memories of Jim. On occasion, he even manages to surface from his doldrums to reminisce with an old friend (Julianne Moore) and foster a relationship with one of his male students.Stylistic as it is solemn, A Single Man is a weighty tome with its earnest airs and dirge-like narrative drastically undercutting its artistic and acting merits.As for dealing with a funeral ban, simply attend the service disguised as the deceased's favourite clown.

A gay university professor ? what a déj? vu character ? loses his 16 year long love affair with the accidental death of his lover to whose funeral he will explicitly not be invited. He cannot accept this solitude. So he delivers his last classes, cleans up his office and walks out with the intention of not coming back. On the university parking lot he is stopped by a young student who is obviously making a discreet pass to him. He does not encourage it. On the liquor store parking lot he crosses a gigolo who is making a pass to him too but he discourages it in the end. He visits his lifelong girlfriend of old and walks home to carry out his last living act. But he can't. So he goes to the bar next door to buy cigarettes and a bottle of alcohol. There he is captured by the young student and his innocent looking smile. They drink. On a challenge from the student they go swim in the Pacific Ocean. Back at the professor's place they drink some more. The professor passes away. He wakes up on his bed at 3 in the morning with the student sleeping on the sofa holding the gun. The professor takes the gun away burns his suicide notes and dreams of a new lapse of love and life. But when death has come death has to triumph and it always does, even if it were in the form of a breathing vegetable. The details of the death are in the film. All together that film is by far too light on a subject that is by far too heavy for such a light film. It could have been a masterpiece and it is only an emotional little entertainment.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A strong performance, yet the film falls apart in the end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are strong performances that carry an okay film (Monster, In pursuit of happiness), strong films that carry okay performances (Iron Man, Star Trek), and a well... everything in between. What most directors seem to aim at though is a strong film with strong performances (Silence of the lambs, The departed). A single man is a film that belongs in the first category, as this film would have been a complete disappointed if Colin Firth was not in the lead role. His portrayal of a middle-aged English professor in L.A. is both shatteringly sorrowful, and sublimely tragic. He seems sad, but really does not differ from the average very much. Maybe it's because most people are kind of sad one way or another, but I think it's because Firth portrays a man who every living second has to fight his urge to explode and tell everyone to screw off, but has to comply to societal rules of behaviour. In a majestic speech he says that fear is the cause for most of our behaviour, and in this sense, George is even scared of what he can become if he lets his emotions take a hold of himself. He's scared of living in the depressed state he is in for the rest of his life, and as life seems hopeless, he decides to end his life, and we follow him for 24 hours. The concept seems fine for a movie, but it is in the ending that the film falls (I won't spoil anything). A single man is a film that will be remembered by Colin Firth's performance. Nothing else. Although the message of the film is a good one to take in and analyze, I don't know what to make of the ending. It is one of those "you're supposed to make of it whatever can apply to your life" kind of ending (haha, that is very bad phrasing, but you know what I mean), but whichever way I try to see it, it always just ends up being a very pathetic, obvious and pessimistic message. I sat down with a friend and talked for about 20 minutes on better endings for the film to send its message across, and found around 4. I can't go further without going into spoilers, but I think the ending broke the film. That being said, Tom Ford constructed a beautiful script for a directorial debut, and showed us on screen something we rarely get to see: the beautification of a male body. It has been something taboo and rarely seen until Sex and the City, but Ford not only shows us the body as a way of lust, it shows us the body as a way of connecting to another human being, and the beauty of both a physical and emotional connection. The extreme close-ups of lips, eyes and noses make us aware of the beauty in the physique of both men and women, and how that beauty can make our lives just a tad brighter (Ford uses very distinct grey and primary color lighting to explicitly and exaggeratedly show his character's emotions). Apart from the extreme close-ups as a way of incorporating into the character's mind and desires, the music is beautiful, and the way every shot is perfectly edited to the beats of the score is to envy. The film must have had a great editor, because the pacing of each scene and the non-continual editing styles are perfect and symbiotic with the music, something that should be appraised by many. I recommend watching this film if you like a really strong performance by a female or male actor, and don't care as much about the message or story of the film. The supporting roles are okay, although Julianne Moore's British accent is as fake as Pamela Anderson's breasts: obviously false and distractingly overt. It is a very sad story, and moving at points, but it's something that I had trouble remembering because it just didn't stick to me. Colin Firth should get an Oscar nomination and possibly even the Oscar. It is hard to pull what he did. And he did it perfectly.</fullReview>

So you can imagine my disappointment when I got this movie, but nonetheless I did want to see this movie at some point.The story was alright but I felt it was a "gay movie" that addressed all the issues the Brokeback Mountain faced but this movie was not at all as good as Brokeback mountain.The movie lacked direction that I thought could have been avoided if the story had more depth. At times during the movie I was saying to myself, "Ok what is this movie about?" and , "Can this movie hurry along?" It was Oscar nominated and all, but it felt like this was supposed to be Colin's Oscar winning role, just because he played a gay man. So all in all I suppose if the "gay movie" thing is your type of genre you're interested in, I think there were better films out there that dealt with these issues in a better and more interesting way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found the opening and recurring image in A Single Man hauntingly lovely and involving: I wanted to know if I was seeing a drowning, blissful abandon, or a little of both.Early on, the film impressed me, with its near moment by moment documenting of a critical day in the life of our unhappily alone hero. Unlike other commentators who found the lens' sticking on details of eyes and faces a fashion-induced faux pas and a distraction, I found that hyperdistracted camera, the slowmo effects and amplified clock sounds a pointer to George's slowly losing his grip on normal, glib reality. Like Roderick Usher in Poe's Fall of the House of Usher, his world and his senses are becoming much too much with him. He is palpably like someone drowning and weighed down.As it progressed, this film kept me watching closely, but never really got to me. I was too aware, at too many points, of a cinematic concept, directorial and art ideas, cinematic colour swings, and at the end of the day and the end of the story, that so literary finale. It was a bit of an O. Henry cute trick, that ending.So for me, this was Closely Watched Strains--not entirely without enjoyment and interest, thank you Colin Firth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"A Single Man" proves fashion designer Tom Ford to be a competent first-time director, but the film feels oddly slight and insubstantial, and is ultimately unsatisfying.Colin Firth plays a gay man in the 1960s struggling against the loneliness and despair brought about by the tragic death of his lover. He decides to kill himself, and the movie takes place over the course of the day he's selected for his death, as he appreciates the little things he took for granted and now knows he will never see again. I can see how this might make a good short story (it's based on one by Christopher Isherwood), and it could have made a very good movie. But this isn't that movie. It's o.k., but it feels too insular for its themes to have more universal resonance, and Firth's character isn't interesting enough to warrant the time devoted to him.Julianne Moore has far too little screen time as Firth's one-time lover and now best friend. She does much with the little she's given, but her time on screen is more of a tease than anything else, tantalizing but leaving the audience wanting more, just like the rest of the film.Grade: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mannered style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A Single Man" is an exercise, in this case a director's first exercise, in style; and there is a lot to look at that often overpowers what's happening in the narrative. And it's a powerful narrative at that. Louis Malle joined the New Wave with "The Fire Within," which was a similar sketch of the last 24 hours in a suicidal playboy. Here we have a remarkable performance by Colin Firth as a man lost in grief and isolated by his sexuality. The time-frame is important: 1962 and no one's been liberated. Not women, gays or African Americans, and the atmosphere is stifling. George has no place to express his grief or find consolation. He's "invisible" and he wants to check out of his misery.Watching this film, I was reminded of the superb documentary about Isherwood himself: "Chris &amp; Don: A Love Story." If you want to delve deeper into the era, I'd recommend that film. But Tom Ford, famous as a fashion designer, opts for surface here. That's fine and makes for beautifully composed cinematography that recalls the era. But at the center of the movie (and the narrative) is a major performance by Colin Firth, and all the period detail, beautiful as it is, is eclipsed by Firth's agony.Julianne Moore, one of my favorite contemporary actresses, is miscast. She assumes an English accent that is distracting, and she's made to look ugly and desperate. The rest of the cast is almost negligible although they perform their roles without getting in the way of Firth: Matthew Goode as the deceased lover in many flashbacks that are almost too painful to watch, and Nicholas Hoult as a young student who senses George's grief and tries to insinuate himself into George's life (this relationship is likely a mirror of Isherwood's own relationship with a young man in "Chris and Don: A Love Story").While the period detail is given as much attention by Tom Ford as the very painful drama, a busy but effective score by Abel Korzeniowski &amp; Shigeru Umebayashi unites the visuals with Firth's pain. And as we move towards the resolution of George's grief (at least in the terms laid out by the script) Firth never misses his mark. It's a performance that will be applauded and studied for years to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Please don't waste your money.This was a pathetic, boring, and dehumanizing movie. The filming was marginal and the sound track so overbearing that during the movie I actually left and asked the manager if anyone else thought "this movie is pathetic." He said three people, not counting me, had already walked out of the 11 who had tickets.I can't understand those who think this was a breakthrough film. If you were to take out the gayness of the film and made this teacher bisexual, the man would have been not only boring but revolting. I learned nothing worthwhile by the snapshot camera work that was looking into his mind. His mind was basically pornographic in nature. Zooming in on faces just made him look like a pervert.Others may say I'm just stupid or insensitive to gays, I won't accept this because I thought MILK was an outstanding movie. If you drop all the arts garbage what is this movie really?Why wasn't this movie good? It's full of shock scenes just for the purpose of putting in shock scenes. Sex with his student? Dreaming about kissing a dead body? Being naked on a public beach? All of this is out of character for someone who didn't have enough courage to make an honest decision. He was egocentric enough to condemn others yet was happy to submerge himself in endless self pity.I believe people are afraid to say this movie was terrible. The Jewish comment was just one example of the relentless personal pandering the director pushed on the audience. Why is a contrived character who never grows beyond the temper tantrum stage somehow worthy of sympathy? This cardboard character coasted through life without an ounce of creativity. He never grew as a person and constantly fed off of his own indignation at some persecution that was never presented in the film. I saw no persecution other than a kid saying he was "light in the loafers" and then saying she never "saw him wear those kind of shoes"... That's the joke? Ha,ha.Telling a six year old boy he was going to kill him if he didn't put away his toy gun wasn't funny either. The man was boring and boring and then just a little more boring. Who wants to sit around watching someone without personality whine? Lastly, if he was so distraught why would seeing an owl fly off be the talisman of new hope? It made the character look like a roll in the hay was all he needed to get over this all to massive love burden. What a shallow jerk - not a hero at all.</fullReview>

Colin Firth, Julianne Moore and Matthew Goode perform wonderfully, as do the actors playing all minor characters in the story, but the directing is so heavy-handed that the story becomes a bit hard to follow. Ford has, unfortunately, let the camera become an enemy of the story.Any single frame of this film is a visual wonder. Unfortunately, when strung together they become an hour and a half Calvin Klein commercial and the story gets drowned in the pool of images.I'd have loved this film had they not tried throwing every visual metaphor and effect into it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a movie darling, not a fashion shoot !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Ford's vanity project turns Christopher Isherwood's novel of loss and grief into one long Calvin Klein commercial. The film is so concerned with surface gloss, it's like a parody of the type of film you'd think a fashion designer would make. There is a fussiness over art direction and costuming that always draws attention to itself, but which often doesn't feel right for the characters or even the period (Julianne Moore wears a op-art style dress that didn't come in till several years later, the little girl next door wears ridiculously elaborate dresses to play outside).There are endless slow motion shots of flowing gowns and macro close ups of eyes (and more importantly eye make up) that are utterly meaningless, apart from Ford going: "Look, isn't that pretty!". From Almodovar, to Todd Haynes, to The Bad Seed, Ford steals visual motives from seemingly every queer movie ever made, without tying them to his themes. The film never flows, because Ford's camera constantly leers at fabric, mascara or modernist teak furniture.As to the performances, Julianne Moore gives good fag hag and can this type of role in her sleep now and Colin Firth does his detached Englishman thing and displays a dry wit that makes the occasional moment work. Every other male in the movie looks distractingly like a contemporary cat walk model.Ford thinks he gives you high art here, but all he comes up with is curdled camp.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Handsome but thin and narcissistic Isherwood adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Falconer has a plan to finish his own life through grief for the loss of his lover. The film looks at his life past and present over the course of a day: the self-contradicting reasons why it's at once too good either to bear having lost or to forego.This seems like a fairly straightforward premise for a drama. The difference here though is that George's lover was a man. Given the 1960s period backdrop, which Tom Ford has meticulously re-created for the film, this is of the utmost significance, re-informing the nature of the relationships between the characters and re-aligning the bias of the film's purpose. It is the bittersweet nature of homosexuality, at the outset of the American Civil Rights movement, which subsumes the basic drama of grief and love: it is what the film's about.The film looks good. A handsome and well-dressed cast are nicely framed but dwelt upon to the point of being fetishised. Beyond this, Ford hasn't got the first idea how to create drama or even purpose. Bleeding from filtered semi-monochrome into (proto-Sirk) saturated technicolour at the introduction of people who provide him with stimulating distraction is cheap and not developed. Neither is his wistful script at all gripping, with limp gestures for ideas that simply provide text for the shot. There may be clues buried in literary references - Huxley, Kafka, Capote - but they're plastic symbols which do not bubble up into the dialogue.There has already been Oscar chat concerning Firth's fairly against-type turn as the grieving George but let's stop that right here. Firth is good - professional - but I wasn't at all convinced. His behaviour on screen lacks a personal conviction. He's committed to serving his director alright but it's awkward. There are moments of levity and joy during the film but Firth does not carry them whilst wrestling with his loss or his dreadful decision to end that struggle. The case for seeing Genova in which Firth's (straight) widower acts on his grief for the wonderful Michael Winterbottom is now pressing. Beside him, neither Nicholas Hoult (who needs lessons in transatlantic annunciation) nor Julianne Moore (who could give them) add much. Even the opening titles music of Abel Korzeniowski had paled to the unmemorable by the close.A tepid project all round then whose sensuous surface is pretty much the extent of its worth. 3/10</fullReview>
