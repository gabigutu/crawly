		<shortDescription>Perhaps the best B movie of all time?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a huge Charles McGraw fan. Every film he had a large part in, he excels and makes the film better.Having seen this film 4 or 5 times, my respect for it has grown over the years.The cinematography isn't perfect - the film probably could have benefited by staying dark and grainy as it seems to be in the early, night scenes.The taut train scenes seem too bright, but there's nothing wrong with it, simply my preference. A darker train would have made for a more sinister film. Even so, there's plenty of excitement.The crackling dialogue between Charles McGraw and Marie Windsor is consistently sharp. Seriously, you will have a hard time finding anything more bitter than those two. I'm not sure any other male-female could have made the dialogue (which in a 1950's way is almost corny) come off so terse, as they continuously bark at each other. Someone needs to count the number of times McGraw tells Windsor to "Shut up!".The film has some exciting twists and turns; you'll enjoy each one.Great story, solid performances all the way around. This is a FUN movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dark ride that's maybe the best passenger-train thriller of them all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Trains have it all over ships and planes when it comes to creating a microcosm. On an airplane, everybody's crammed together; nobody can sneak on or leave (except by parachute or defenestration). An ocean liner has its private staterooms and public spaces, but, again, is an island, entire onto itself. But trains stop regularly to take on and disgorge passengers, and they run along their fixed and earthbound course, with windows looking out on rivers and highways, at big cities at high noon and small towns in the dead of night. And so they've always been the preferred vehicle for suspense, with countless thrillers using the rails as their setting. One of the tautest and most toothsome, in its modest, low-budget way, is Richard Fleischer's The Narrow Margin. It opens in Chicago, where a pair of Los Angeles police detectives are to escort the widow (Marie Windsor) of a recently slain gang leader back to the coast to testify before a grand jury. She's a hard case (`a 60-cent special...poison under the gravy'), and guarding her is a dangerous job. Sure enough, one of the cops takes a fatal bullet in the stairway of her low-rent apartment house (she shows scant sympathy). Windsor's finally smuggled aboard the train, in a Pullman car's locked compartment adjoining that of her custodian Charles McGraw. Almost certainly, one or more mobsters followed her. It's up to McGraw to smoke them out before they kill Windsor, who knows too much. But he slowly learns that some vital information has been deliberately kept from him....Fleischer makes inventive use of the jostling in the cramped passageways ? and of the all but vanished rituals of club cars and dining cars. He packs the train with seasoned character actors, notable among them Jacqueline White, Paul (`Nobody loves a fat man') Maxie, and Don Beddoe. The closely worked script, by Earl Fenton (based on a novel by Martin Goldsmith, who also penned the original material for Detour), doesn't stint on gaudy patter for them to spout (it's a moveable feast of salty epigrams). Best of all, The Narrow Margin offers the addictive Marie Windsor her meatiest role, showcasing her tough-gal talents. Rolling her huge and extraordinary eyes, she aims her exhaled smoke like a stream of deadly gas and hard-boils her lines into hand grenades (to McGraw: `This train's headed straight for the cemetery. But there's another train coming along ? a gravy train. Let's get on it.'). It's one of Hollywood's more perplexing secrets why Windsor toiled exclusively, with the possible exception of her Sherry Peatty in Stanley Kubrick's The Killing, in the B-movie ghetto. But she helped make that ghetto the liveliest part of Tinsel Town.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fast, smart and tough. A real treat. Masterfully paced and scripted. Wow. Holds up very very well. This movie sucks you in from the opening credits and never lets go. It's also a bit of a mind game, with an interesting moral dilemma at its center and a beautiful plot twist towards the end. Nobody tells a hysterical dame to "shut up" quite like Charles McGraw and few femme fatales can blow cigarette smoke quite like Marie Windsor (who looks astonishingly like the present day actress Illeana Douglas). The two of them have great smoldering chemistry together. Richard Fleischer's direction is nearly flawless. A joy to watch. Can't wait to see it again. There's a lot going on in this one. By no means, a routine thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charles McGraw At His Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While director Richard Fleischer gets plenty of credit for his role in making the film noir classic "The Narrow Margin" on a shoestring budget, it is hard to imagine this picture without actor Charles McGraw in the lead role. As a tough cop escorting a witness to testify in Los Angeles, McGraw's performance is what holds the picture together. Try to think now of one actor around today who could portray a cop who is at times calculating, other times sarcastic and almost always menacing. In the Hollywood of the 1940s and 50s,Charles McGraw usually played secondary roles in A pictures. In "The Narrow Margin," McGraw shows that with a competent director, he could put on some performance as the star of a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Narrow Margin is excellent. It's too bad more of our new directors have forgotten how to make a great film with a minimal budget, using instead inventive camera angles, good characters and dialog, and some surprises along the way. I really loved Marie Windsor as the mobster's wife who's going to LA to sing to the Grand Jury. She's one of the toughest broads I've ever seen! Charles McGraw does his standard tough cop role and turns in a performance that sets the standard by which all others are judged.This is the original, and beats the heck out of the re-make.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Overlooked Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's an overlooked classic that more than holds its own over five decades after its release. Two-fisted detective Charles McGraw must protect a crucial witness (Marie Windsor) on a train trip from Chicago to Los Angeles. Since keeping a secret is hard, bad guys who aren't so keen on Windsor's testimony are also on board -- and will stop at nothing to silence her. Further complexities are added to an already tense situation when the hit men confuse another passenger as their target."The Narrow Margin" is known as a B movie, but you'd never know it from watching it. True, the film isn't flashy, but it does make the most out of everything it has. The story is original and full of twists, the suspense terrific and the acting memorable. With its creative take on what should be a simple story, and with its colorful characters and sharp direction, it's all more than a bit reminiscent of the master himself, Alfred Hitchcock. You won't regret picking this one up now that it's available on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"...Use Your Own Sink"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charles McGraw plays edgy cop Walter Brown. His job is to protect a dead racketeer's wife, Mrs Neil (Marie Windsor) from the mob. She's a key witness in a grand jury probe, and also has a payoff list linking gang members to the LAPD. Most of the film's action takes place on board the train taking Brown and Neil to Los Angeles, where she will testify.In Mrs. Neil, played to perfection by Windsor, the queen of B movies, the tough talking, wise-cracking Brown meets his match. On the way to meet her, he glibly tells his partner, Gus Forbes that "She's the sixty cent special. Cheap. Flashy. Sticky poison under the gravy." When he and Forbes, both from Los Angeles, first meet her, she says, "How nice. How Los Angeles." Then looking Brown up and down, she snarls, "Sunburn wear off on the way?" My favorite wisecrack occurs after Brown has finally had enough of her wise remarks and lashes out, "You make me sick to my stomach." Her retaliation is a gem: "Well, use your own sink." Unlike the banter between Nick and Noira Charles of The Thin Man series, there's nothing the least sophisticated about the way Brown and Neil talk each other. Director Richard Fleischer uses inventive camera work, the sounds of the train rather than a music score, and the train's claustrophobic atomsphere to create and sustain tension. An RKO picture, The Narrow Margin is an unpretentious, taut low-budget thriller, a minor classic far superior to the 1990 Gene Hackman-Anne Archer remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Windsor &amp; McGraw: 2 Film Noir Hall-Of-Famers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the "original" and, like its re-make "Narrow Margin" (the "The" is missing), it is excellent. This is one of those rare cases in which the old and the new versions both are top-notch.In fact, it's interesting to compare the two versions. In this film, there is a very unique twist as the end concerning the woman being brought to Los Angeles. It was clever.That woman in this 1952 version also is played by perhaps the First Lady Of Noir, Marie Windsor. She had the best lines in the film and is outstanding at playing the tough-talking moll of this genre. (See Stanley Kubrick's "The Killing" to fully appreciate more of Windsor's work.)The film noir tough-guy male equivalent of her also stars in this film: Charles McGraw. Few guys ever looked and sounded better in noirs than McGraw. He and Windor were born to play in 'B' crime movies!The short length of this film makes it a good one to watch anytime although, to be frank, if I could only own one of the two "Narrow Margin" films, I'd have to take the latter-day version with Gene Hackman and Anne Archer, but it would a tough decision. Both have a lot to offer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great camera work. Sensational Marie Windsor. Implausible story, though.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The narrow margin" is a remarkable film-noir with great merits, unfortunately marred by an implausible story. There is a policeman (Charles McGraw) committed to protect a key witness (Marie Windsor), in severe danger of life, along a train journey. The only reasonable and likely behavior for the cop is to take some sandwiches, lock in the cabin with the witness, and sit down with a machine-gun on his lap. Of course, that would be the end of the film. So, to get a story, McGraw goes everywhere and does everything on the train, but staying with and protecting the witness. There is also a big surprise at the end. That is really unexpected. But if we think back to the previous events, this big twist makes the behavior of some characters wholly illogical.Well, enough with the faults of the movie. The merits of this low-budgeted B-movie overcome its defects. The stylish cinematography is first-rate, and the camera-work is outstanding. The (few) action scenes are brilliant and filmed in a very original way. See, for instance the play of mirrors in the finale. Marie Windsor is sensational, and every scene with her is a treat. What a gangster moll, gutsy tough gal she is! In my opinion, she is even better here than in "The killing". Her lines are a perfect instance of cynical wisecracking. McGraw and the rest of the cast make a good job, as well. There is a good amount of suspense and no moments of bore.Let me conclude with a somehow daring comparison. Independently by the composers, classic music of the 18th century is always beautiful. In a similar way, I think that American movies of the 1940s and early 1950s are all good: that is just a question of style, and how I love this style!I recommend "The narrow margin", for its intrinsic merits, and to pay homage to a great season of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hardboiled, Intense &amp; Very Fast Moving</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Narrow Margin" is a hard-hitting crime thriller which grips its audience right from the start and never lets go. In a story which is full of intrigue, danger and mistaken identities, the pace is absolutely relentless and the characters are tough and uncompromising. The atmosphere is consistently tense and the blistering dialogue is sensational. Despite its short running time and its "low budget, B-movie" status, this is a remarkably entertaining film which is also directed with above-average skill and flair.Detective Sergeant Walter Brown (Charles McGraw) and Detective Sergeant Gus Forbes (Don Beddoe)are assigned to pick up a mobster's wife called Mrs Frankie Neale (Marie Windsor), from her apartment in Chicago and escort her to Los Angeles where she is due to testify before a grand jury. Mrs Neale is in possession of her husband's "pay-off list" and this makes her a target for the mob who are intent on ensuring that she doesn't reach L.A. alive.Brown has nothing but contempt for Mrs Neale, so when his friend Gus is shot and killed by a mob hit-man as they're leaving her apartment building, his hostility towards her becomes even deeper and he also becomes totally disgusted by her complete lack of concern about the incident. Despite his personal feelings and the obvious dangers involved, Brown decides to go ahead and complete his mission as planned.Detective Brown and Mrs Neale travel by train to L.A. and have adjoining compartments. During their journey, there is a continual sense that danger lurks everywhere, as both are fully aware that their lives are under threat and it's not always possible to identify which of the suspicious looking passengers are killers employed by the mob. A fat man and a little boy who are on the train are not who they first appear to be and Brown is very wary of a grim-looking character called Joseph Kemp (David Clarke). Another man attempts unsuccessfully to bribe him and Brown also gets to know an attractive blonde called Ann Sinclair (Jacqueline White) who turns out to be friendly and good-humoured. Further killings, surprises and twists then follow before the train eventually reaches its destination.Charles McGraw as the tough cop who's permanently on-edge and Marie Windsor as the feisty, self-centred star witness are brilliant as two people who despise each other with a passion and some of the verbal exchanges between them are great. For example, when he says to her "You make me sick to my stomach" she replies "Well use your own sink and let me know when the target practice starts".In common with many other stories where the action takes place on a train, the space within which the characters function seems to become increasingly cramped as the story proceeds and the tension grows accordingly. A variety of interesting camera angles are used to emphasise this feeling and the use of extreme close-ups and images on reflective surfaces are also used to good effect."The Narrow Margin" is a great piece of hardboiled entertainment which is incredibly intense, very fast-moving and definitely not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A near perfect little ensemble crime noir train thriller...yes!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Narrow Margin (1952)A compact, beautiful, thrilling little B-movie. Everyone involved is relatively unknown. The director, Richard Fleischer, is less famous than some of his films, however, including the cult favorite, "Soylent Green" and the courtroom drama with an ending where Orson Welles bursts on the scene, "Compulsion." So this early one is clearly Fleischer's baby, and he gets clear, believable performances from a small ensemble cast.Yes, it's a kind of ensemble film, where half a dozen people hold their own. Central is Charles McGraw as a detective guarding a witness en route from Chicago to L.A. McGraw has the benefit of being just a plain old detective, not an actor filled with character and presence, and he's great. The witness is played by Marie Windsor, and she's cutting and commanding, a terrific female lead that should have had a bigger career. The two or three bad guys are not quite caricatures, and the other cast--seemingly innocent passengers--are spot on perfect, too. All of this might be enough, but the cinematography is so virtuosic, without showing off, it lifts the whole experience higher. George Diskant never became one of Hollywood's big names, but he had just shot two legendary films for Nicholas Ray, and was clearly poetic and tactile with his camera and lights. You sometimes won't even notice--as when the detective and the blonde walk on the platform at a station stop, the camera following them and pivoting and keeping the moving, turning couple in perfect focus. Other times the shots are just sensational, as with the fistfight in the tight confines of a cabin. The railroad car scenes are shot with palpable claustrophobia, things getting in the way in the foreground, people having to nudge and move around each other.There are almost two parts to the movie. The first is a more classic night in the city with a noir feel, and this is the most gorgeous and vivid. You get sucked into the problem, and are surprised right away by a couple of twists. Eventually the main characters end up on the train, and another kind of movie, a cat and mouse, mixed-up identity kind of scenario, takes over. Equally interesting, and with more twists than you would think plausible.But they are plausible. and Fleischer pulls of a real gem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Detective Sergeant Walter Brown (Charles McGraw) and his longtime partner Detective Sergeant Gus Forbes (Don Beddoe) are assigned to travel to Chicago to bring the mobster's wife Mrs. Frankie Neal (Marie Windsor) to testify to the grand jury in Los Angeles against the mafia. They are ambushed at Mrs. Neal's building and Forbes is murdered by a mobster wearing a coat with fur.Brown and Neal travel by train to LA and soon the detective realizes that there are hit men hired by the mafia to kill Mrs. Neal. However, the assassins do not know how she looks like, and Brown hides Neal in Forbes' room. Brown meets Ann Sinclair (Jacqueline White) in the restaurant, who is traveling with her annoying son Tommy and his nanny, and the mobsters believe that she is Mrs. Neal. Now Brown has to protect not only the unpleasant Mrs. Neal, but also Ann from the mobsters."The Narrow Margin" is a great film-noir with a tense story developed in an adequate pace and an unexpected plot point in the end. The direction is perfect and the cast has solid performances. The dialogs between Brown and Mrs. Neal are tough and her character does not worth a penny. I saw the excellent remake of this movie in the early 90's ("Margin Call") with Gene Hackman and Anne Archer, but unfortunately I had never seen the original movie. Today I have had the chance and I recommend it. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Rumo ao Inferno" ("Bound to Hell")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charles McGraw never made a bad film. He was instantly recognizable with his gravel-voice and tough-looking demeanor. As the cop who takes in Marie Windsor to tell what she knows of the Mob to the FBI, he wastes not a scene.Every move and look from him is just right. Marie Windsor, his co-star, is a perfect foil. She has the looks and the toughness to take this B film to a high level. The story line and the editing are good and this film has a solid supporting cast. It was a surprise that Jacqueline White did not turn up in more films than she did. As the real 'grass' who the Mob are after, you just want Walter Brown (Charles McGraw) to lead her to safety, which he does.A good, solid early 1950's film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Claustrophobic, Suspenseful Noir Classic...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard Fleischer's 1952 "The Narrow Margin" takes classic "Film Noir" elements (unusual camera angles and lighting, deep shadows, ambiguous characters in jeopardy), and moves everything into the tight confines of a train, creating a cramped suspense classic that never 'lets up'. While the film is, unabashedly, a 'B' movie, few films could match it's unrelenting tension, visual style, and surprising plot-twists...in a feature only 71 minutes long! The basic plot is simple; L.A. cops Charles McGraw and Don Beddoe arrive in Chicago to escort crime boss widow Marie Windsor, holding essential evidence for a Grand Jury investigation, back to L.A. When Beddoe is shot and killed at her apartment building, McGraw must protect her, alone, against the contract killers on board their L.A.-bound train...But this is Noir, so nothing is necessarily as it seems! Director Fleischer made some brilliant choices in making the film, beginning with his decision not to use a musical score; by relying on the 'natural' sounds of trains and stations, he gives the film a sense of urgency, and forces the viewer to 'pay attention', without the crutch of musical climaxes to single out 'important' moments. Also, his decision to cast McGraw as the lead was inspired; the gravelly-voiced character actor was as familiar to audiences playing a villain as a hero, and his hard-boiled persona, in the 'traditional' Noir 'look' of a fedora and trench coat, with a cigarette in his mouth, offers an ambiguity that holds viewers' attention.The train is as important a character in the story as the heroes and villains; with narrow passageways, tiny compartments, large windows offering dramatic reflections, and it's isolation from outside communication, each moment on board increases the potential for disaster.Needless to say, "The Narrow Margin" is among my favorite films, one that I've watched dozens of times, and still get a kick out of! It has a legion of fans (and has influenced two generations of film directors), and if you've never seen it, you have a real treat ahead of you! This movie is a 'keeper'!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like train movies, and I've seen the Hyams/Hackman version a few times. Since I'm a fan of film noir it only made sense to check out this original 1952 version.Charles McGraw (looking like Kirk Douglas in a way) is the tough cop assigned to protecting a witness against the mob. He must take her from Chigaco to LA on board a train with the bad guys right behind them. They don't know what she looks like so there's lots of prowling about. So far so similar. But there are a few twists that Hyams erased in favor of making the 1990 version more unique.As long as the train rattles through the night the film is atmospheric, but bright daytime scenes seem a bit out of place in a film noir. And there are a couple of plot developments that I don't quite get (What happened to Yost? And why did Brown cross him off his telegram?).It's perfect late night viewing. But I prefer the 1990 version as it expands the plot and scope.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The stranger in the train</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>LAPD detectives Walter Brown and Gus Forbes are sent to Chicago to escort the widow of a racketeer, a Mrs. Neall, back to Los Angeles where she is to testify before a grand jury. The policemen have to take the night train, which poses a risk. There are a lot of people that are interested in not letting this happen. In fact, just as they are about to leave the building, a man in a fur collared coat is waiting for them, and he kills Forbes.Thus begins a film that packs so much in it seventy minutes running time with so little effort, something that speaks volumes for what director Richard Fleischer was able to create in "The Narrow Margin". Written by Earl Felton for the screen, this B type picture has so much going for it that one can heartedly recommend it for viewers of the genre whenever it shows on cable next. We once heard that William Friedkin was an admirer of Mr. Fleischer when he was a teenager.George Diskant, its cinematographer, deserves a lot of credit for the enjoyment of the film. He did wonders with the way he was able to shoot the movie in such close quarters, as in the train, to make the viewer feel cramped while watching it unfold. The scenes shot using the windows of the train with the car that is seen in the distance running at the same speed, are amazing. The camera is made to work intelligently by this great artist. The best thing in the picture is Charles McGraw, whose work as Det. Brown is amazing. Mr. McGraw epitomized the tough guys he always played with an economy of gestures, while projecting a virile image of those people he gave life to on the screen. Marie Windsor, who appears as Mrs. Neall, shows up as a hard woman hiding something that is a key element in the narrative. The scenes between Mr. McGraw and Ms. Windsor, in addition, are amazing because of the heat they generate. Also in supporting roles, Jacqueline White, Paul Maxey, Peter Brocco, David Clarke and Peter Virgo, doing an ensemble work for the director.Highly recommended for fans of Richard Fleischer's work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terror and intrigue on the Chicago to L.A rail-line.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>****SPOILERS**** Tightly directed and acted Film-Noir thriller with the only thing a bit off about it is it's somewhat unrealistically surprise ending.Up until the "suprise" was sprung on you the film "The Narrow Margin" had you sitting on the edge of your seat. The movie had you wondering if mob-protected witness Mrs. Frankie Neil, Marie Windsor,would make with her life to the safety of the L.A Hall of Justice to testify against her late husband's, Frankie, mob associates; the important and upstanding citizens, politicians police and clergy, in the community who they were paying off to do their bidding.In conjunction with the Chicago and L.A police departments L.A Det. Sgt. Walter Brown,Charles McGraw, together with local Chicago Poilce Sgt. Gus Forbes, Don Beddoe are assigned to take Mrs. Neil back to L.A to testify against the national crime syndicate.At the safe-house where Mrs. Neil is being held for her own protection there's a mob ambush of the two lawman as they were taking Mrs. Neil to the rail station with Forbes getting shot and killed. Feelng now that he has a very personal reason to get those who murdered his friend and partner Sgt.Forbes is even more determined then ever to get Mrs. Neil to L.A alive to bring down the syndicate with her explosive testimony.The train going to L.A ,and all stops in between, becomes a train of horrors for Sgt. Brown an Mrs. Neil as a group of mobsters enter it on different stops to find out just where Sgt. Brown is keeping his star witness with them having no idea who she is or even looks like. Sgt. Brown plays it close to his vest by keeping Mrs. Neil hidden in a double-cabin. Later he strikes up a relationship with passenger Ann Sinclair,Jacqueline White, whom he got to meet through her bratty little boy Tommy,Gordon Gebert., whom the mobsters mistake for Mrs. Neil;the person that their determined to knock off. The movie moves along at a brisk pace and it's not until the big surprise towards the end that we realize that there's been an uncanny twist played on both Sgt. Brown and the mobsters by the higher ups in the L.A police department. The twist ending has to do with getting Mrs. Neil back to L.A safely. It's that twist that ironically not only throws you off but takes away from the movie's believability that it had up until then. Still "A Narrow Margin" is more then worth watching with it's tense-filled build-up and with a fight scene between Sgt. Brown and hoodlum Joe Kemp, David Clarke,in a small and claustrophobic train cabin that has to rank as one of the most exciting in motion picture history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read several books and who knows how many articles about film noir and this title was never mentioned. I have no idea whatsoever why it hasn't been acknowledged as a film at the very top of its kind. The pacing is phenomenal with nothing extraneous or unnecessary and trimmed to the bone. I don't think there was even a musical score at all. It wouldn't have added anything that wasn't already there. The acting is uniformly excellent and the plot has some fascinating turns that gave me some pleasant surprises. The dialog is crisp, even ingenious at times, particularly between the policeman and he gangster's wife. This film should be studied at film schools around the world for its budget and its bang.

Additionally, McGraw makes a tactical decision that is ethically indefensible and annoying in the context of the film. But, still, it's a fun little movie and Marie Windsor is as entertaining as all get out. She's one of the great noir tough girls.It's true that there wouldn't be much of a plot if McGraw didn't keep leaving and putting the witness in peril. But this movie might have been even better if McGraw and Windsor had just stayed in the same room and jawed at each other for an hour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dangerous Train Ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those "B-feature" film gems that are frequently more lasting and popular than "A-features" that were overproduced. It is about a woman, a witness to the murder of her husband (a gangster), by several more important gangsters. She has been found in Chicago, and she has to be brought back to Los Angelas. Two Police Detectives are sent, but meet danger along the way (one of them is killed). The other manages to get the witness to the train, but it is two days before they reach Los Angeles, and anything can happen.It's unlike most of the other classic train mystery films. THE LADY VANISHES deals with proving that a woman who has disappeared on a train actually existed, and how it endangers a carload of British travelers. NIGHT TRAIN (a.k.a. NIGHT TRAIN TO MUNICH) deals with rescuing a kidnapped scientist back from Germany just before the start of World War II. SLEEPING CAR TO TRIESTE deals with two agents tracking down a double-crossing partner and the stolen diary they sought for their political cause. MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS deals with a great detective (Hercule Poirot) trying to figure out who among the passengers on the train murdered a singularly unpleasant man. Here it is just getting a government witness (an unpleasant one, by the way) past criminal agents.The cast of THE NARROW MARGIN has no major stars in it (Marie Windsor, as the witness, is probably the best known name, although Charles McGraw appeared in many B-features as either a cop or a hood). The variety of characters, in particular a young boy who may be too sharp for his own good, is interesting. But best is Paul Maxey. Mr. Maxey may have been the fattest looking man in movies. He normally was a businessman or a politico or anyone in the background of the films he appeared in. He is the producer of Dolores Grey's television show in IT'S ALWAYS FAIR WEATHER, who has to calm her down when she is reminded she can't have the huge meals she wants to eat because it will ruin her people-popular figure. "Well, why can you eat what you want to?!", she asks Maxey. "Well they don't want to watch me!", he explains. Here he actually had a .... err, "meaty" role. He is one of the film surprises. At first he is just a seemingly funny, fat guy, then he seems like a potential assistant for the criminals. It turns out quite differently at the end. In many ways, it was Paul Maxey's best role in movies.A good twisty plot, a top-notch cast and direction, and a decent set of production values. The original THE NARROW MARGIN is first rate entertainment which I recommend if you can see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High-strung thriller in romantic train setting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening of this film noir sets its high-strung tone. All of the action sequences are fast and coherent. Charles McGraw as the detective is the sole actor who chews the scenery, but I love his voice so his excesses never bothered me. Paul Maxey with his massive bulk provides both comic relief and intimidation. Two attractive women effectively establish the required good girl / bad girl dichotomy.Of course the dialogue often proves hard-boiled, but it is humorous as well, and even philosophical. I loved the romantic train setting, and some clever editing segues involve the rushing train. The plot possesses suspense ... and a neat twist. Only the patness of the climax disappointed me. Oh yes, there is also a terribly irritating kid, yet the movie benefits from his fractious presence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Skillful and entertaining ..... if you don't think about it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(The big spoiler is in the last paragraph.)My first reaction was that this was a really nice piece of film-making from the era when you could produce a 70-minute film. Imagine anyone trying to do that today! I suppose they put it on double bills with a big lobby intermission in the middle.Anyway, without much in the way of sets except a railroad car, and no special effects, they packed the 70 minutes with story and suspense and plot twists that caught me completely off guard, for one. Marie Windsor did a great job portraying a cynical brassy mob moll whom Charles McGraw is trying to keep from getting bumped off by a gang of crooks on the train from Chicago to L.A. Some of the frames with her in close-up are just works of art.There are a few old-time clichés, like the fearless little kid (lemme see your gun, mister!) who turned up in a lot of movies of the day, but there is a lot of good stuff, too, like heavy-duty character actor Paul Maxey, who starts off blocking a corridor in a comic bit but then does some other stuff.So when the disc finished up on the VCR I was pretty satisfied and ready to give this movie a 7, maybe even an 8. But when I started mentally planning this review, going over the plot in my mind when I had some leisure - and bear in mind that I had a lot more time to think about the plot afterward than I did during the movie - I started brooding about some of the big plot holes and so on. Not everyone will do this, of course.But to start off, just for example, five or ten minutes into the film, after one murder attempt, the cop reports that the killer saw his face but not Mrs. Neal, so they don't know what she looks like. And he turns out to be right. But how can that actually be true? She's the widow of a big mobster, but none of the other mob-connected people have seen her? They have limitless resources for bribery and interstate criminal teams that outnumber and outgun the police, but they can't manage to get a photograph of Mrs. Neal or even find out from any source even the most vague description of her? That was the beginning, and after that all I could do was ask myself why didn't this person do that, and why did those people do this, and why did the police act this way, etc., and eventually the whole story unraveled in my hand like a badly knitted sweater. But I didn't realize this at the time, because I had been just carried along by the action and the performances! So maybe I should stop complaining!But there is one other story point which left a bad taste in my mouth, which has to do with the big plot twist and the denouement. (Here's where the big spoiler is.)Brown is a good cop, who demands a lot of himself and blames himself when his partner gets killed five minutes in, even when it wasn't really his fault that I could see. But later on, after the woman he has been guarding gets killed, he doesn't seem to have a second to spend on remorse or regrets. He and the film dismiss it instantly. It's true that by the time he finds out she is dead he has already found out that she wasn't the real Mrs. Neal, but a Chicago policewoman. But so?? Is he (are we?) supposed to care only for mob widows, not for women on the force? And it's true that she dies because of her unaccountable stupidity - "Lady, you aren't REALLY an impulsive mob moll, and nobody is around, so why do you have to play the part and listen to that stupid phonograph? Are you that addicted to jazz music?" But Brown doesn't know that. If Brown were portrayed as a rotten misogynistic guy at least it would be in character for him to dismiss the faux Mrs. Neal from his mind completely while he squires the real one off the train at the end, but he hasn't been. So it's worse than bad behavior, it's out of character. And it's just to manipulate the audience, to make us think that "Oh, no! They killed Mrs. Neal!" and then tell us a few seconds later that Mrs. Neal is really still alive - "Whew!", so the train is still on the track. And maybe they could have thought it out better with more time or money for script production, but then it would be a better movie, but they didn't and it's not. Although it looks a lot like a better movie if you don't look too close.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No New York nor Los Angeles - just the claustrophobic halls of a train</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The milieus, landscapes and aesthetics of film-noir were often related to big cities and cold streets. In The Narrow Margin directed by Richard Fleischer the story is taken to train and the narrow halls of it, which perfectly furthers the compact feeling of the film. The film is very well directed and the exquisite cinematography of it reminded me of the classic The Lady Vanishes (1938) by Alfred Hitchcock, which also takes place in a train. This brief 75-minute long ride offers some really sharp noir-dialog and exciting twists till the last minute. When a mob boss dies, a police officer gets a job to escort the boss' wife from Chicago to LA to a trial. The task gets a little harder when a suspicious group of crooks join the train and are willing to do anything with regards to prevent the arrival of the woman to the trial.Los Angeles and New York were often the big cities of film-noir, but even if big cities had a lot to do with the aesthetics of film-noir it doesn't mean that anyone didn't have the guts to try something else. Many tried to transfer the pattern of film-noir to new milieus. Nicholas Ray tried a snowy small town village in On Dangerous Ground (1953) and Ida Lupino brought film-noir to the seats of a car and deserts of Mexico in The Hitch-Hicker (1953) just to mention a few. The claustrophobic space Richard Fleischer chose in The Narrow Margin works brilliantly and the thrilling scenes are directed with care.Many have realized what a great place a train is for excitement, murder and paranoia. As mentioned before Alfred Hitchcock made The Lady Vanishes, but he also used train as a place of suspense in Shadow of a Doubt (1943), North by Northwest (1959) and Strangers on a Train (1951). Of course when talking about trains and cinema one cannot forget the Buster Keaton masterpiece The General (1926). Train means both getting away and letting go, which is highlighted in the masterful melodrama Brief Encounter (1945) by David Lean where the motive is taken of a superior level when trains and railways turn into symbolism. The narrow margin of a train is of course quite metaphorical to the story in The Narrow Margin, but also in all the thrillers mentioned by Alfred Hitchcock. In The Narrow Margin the police officer faces challenges so tough that he is not sure can he make it through. His margin is getting more narrow and narrow, inch by inch.The name of Richard Fleischer might not ring a bell for all of the readers so I think it's quite alright to reminds you for some of his works. He started as a b-class director but with the help of The Narrow Margin he rose to the A-class and the film even got an Oscar nomination for best writing. Before it he had already made a few film-noir such as Bodyguard (1948) and Armored Car Robbery (1950), which unfortunately are part of his 'b-class era'. But on the other hand they're still quite interesting and excellent in their on league. Nowdays Fleischer is probably more known for directing the two fantasy action movies Red Sonja (1985) and Conan The Destroyer (1984).The Narrow Margin has its unintentional humor and clumsiness but overall it stands out as a fine piece of film-noir. It offers some excellent dialog and twists that will keep the interest of the audience till the last minute. I think the power of The Narrow Margin is in its story charged with compact emotion, the lack of film-noir clichés, the cinematography and the construction of state in the narrow halls of the train.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The witness protection programme just got hard boiled.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After finally waking herself up, a mobsters wife decides to testify against him and his organisation. As the trial draws closer she is constantly under threat of being murdered before she can spill the beans. Tough detective Walter Brown and his partner Gus Forbes are assigned to escort her safely across country via train from Chicago to Los Angeles, but nobody can be trusted, and the threat of death is around all on board this speeding train.Yes it may well be a B movie, but as B movies go this has to rank as one of the finest exponents of that particular arc. With the film taking place almost entirely on board the train, the tension sapping and claustrophobic feel is perfectly executed by director Richard Fleischer. The plot twists and turns and throws up genuine moments of surprise that thrill instead of hinder, whilst the ending doesn't cop out by pandering to the normal requisite of witness protection thrillers. Charles McGraw is great as Brown, putting the hard into hard boiled and Jacqueline White is very precious as Ann Sinclair. Truth is is that all the cast work well within the confines of this tightly produced picture. The Narrow Margin was a surprise hit for RKO, made on a small budget of under a quarter of a million dollars, it turned out to be a very profitable B movie for the company. It wowed audiences back in the 50s and it's testament to the film's worth that today, here in the modern age, it's still being sought out and praised by movie lovers of all ages. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As opposed to the trade mag reviewers who liked anything as long as the producers bought ads in their pages. So, skipping the Motion Picture Herald, Showman's Trade Review, Hollywood Reporter and Motion Picture Daily raves, it was left with:Irene Thirer in "The New York Post"- "Once in a while a low-budgeted film from Hollywood gives off an unmistakable aura of big-time talent. The screenplay is taut, direction swift and performances crisp and clever. Continuity is paceful and tense, with a touch of glib humor...we're talking about "The Narrow Margin," which just opened at the 60th St. Trans-Lux...What the production lacks in big names, it makes up for in such good trouping (aside note-this was written in the days when writers knew the difference between troupers and troopers)that folks like Charles McGraw, Marie Windsor, always a stunner and a slick actress, Jacquline White and Paul Maxey may well be bigger names in the future..." Kate Cameron in "The New York Daily News"- "Every once in a while a picture comes along unheralded by its Hollywood producer and turns out to be just the one we've been waiting for." "Time Magazine"- "...pungent performances and inventive direction; a gangster car pacing the train is menacingly mirrored in compartment windows as backdrop to the slam-band action; the cramped train settings are put to striking dramatic effect through expert camera work and cutting. Refreshingly, there are convincing sound effects and no hammering musical score..." Rose Pelswick in "The New York Journal-American" - "...here's a 71-mimute thriller that packs every one of those minutes with high excitement despite a complete lack of star 'names' or pretentious production trappings. Expert production by Stanley Rubin' vigorous direction by Richard Fleischer from a tightly-knit script by Earl Felton and a well-chosen cast...make it stand-out entertainment...Don't miss this one." Alton Cook in "The New York World Telegram" - "...Charles McGraw never relaxes his grim tension in a highly effective performance as a vigilant cop...Marie Windsor, a sultry beauty seething with vicious evil...The other girl is Jacqueline White, who cannot be described further without spoiling one of the surprises in the story..." "The New York Times" - "...by staging the incidents in a simple, chilling crescendo and by substituting an eagle camera eye for the usual musical background, Mr. Fleischer has projected a superbly menacing frame for the action. And just before the taut, ingenious finale, Earl Felton flapjacks the plot so cunningly that to elaborate here would be to ruin an ingratiating swindle...a trim sizzling little humdinger."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charles McGraw protects a witness on a train from assailants</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Narrow Margin" is an excellent film and an excellent film noir. At the time of this film (1952), the director, Richard Fleischer, had already made six other noirs: Bodyguard, The Clay Pigeon, Follow Me Quietly, Armored Car Robbery, Trapped and His Kind of Woman.The movie's makers include tons of experience in film and especially in film noir.The screenplay writer, Earl Felton, had been writing since 1936 and had worked with Fleischer on several of those noirs. The story had two writers. One, Martin Goldsmith, had written the classic Detour as well as Dangerous Intruder, Shakedown and Blind Spot. The other, Jack Leonard, had written His Kind of Woman and The Secret Fury. He would go on to write Man in the Dark, Hell's Island and Cry of the Hunted.George E. Diskant did the photography. His work had included the beautifully realized Sealed Cargo as well as Port of New York, Between Midnight and Dawn, On Dangerous Ground and The Racket.Right down the line, to film editing, sound, art direction and set direction, this was a highly experienced team. The lighting is a joy. The sound and sound effects are very skillful, from the very first second in which we hear a train.There are no guarantees in making a film that all that input produces a successful output, but when it does, watch out. Narrow Margin is a terrific film. The casting was excellent, and Charles McGraw ran with the role of the gruff incorruptible detective. Don Beddoe is perfect as his lax partner, two years from a retirement he won't see. Marie Windsor has seldom gotten a better role, although The Killing comes close. The contrast between her and Jacqueline White adds depth and interest. The heavies, three of them, all are well delineated characters.The continuity in this film is notable. One thing ties into the next, and sometimes into what happens later on a delayed basis. The suspense never flags. The challenge doesn't let up. The realism is pervasive.This is classic noir, a thing of beauty and excellence in story writing and telling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE NARROW MARGIN (Richard Fleischer, 1952) ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another milestone in the noir genre and undoubtedly among the best B-movies of all time, this masterpiece remains also director Richard Fleischer's finest work. He excelled in the genre in this early phase of his career and, in fact, I plan to watch three of his other noirs ? BODYGUARD (1948), THE CLAY PIGEON (1949) and FOLLOW ME QUIETLY (1949), all of which I own on VHS ? for the first time in the coming days. The film, set for the most part on a speeding train (but filmed entirely on the RKO backlot!) is a lean but mean 71 minutes of gripping drama and non-stop thrills; it is brimming with hard-boiled dialogue (my favorite has to be when ungrateful 'gangster's moll' Marie Windsor, in reply to obsessive L.A. cop Charles McGraw's disgusted remark "You make me sick to my stomach", nonchalantly quips: "Use your own sink!"), extremely well-defined characters (especially for such a low-budget film) and brilliant chiaroscuro lighting, which so defines this most durable of Hollywood genres.Director William Friedkin, who contributes an enthusiastic Audio Commentary to Warner's excellent DVD edition (interestingly, the theatrical trailer included on the disc contains a few brief snippets of dialogue which are not found in the main feature!), while freely admitting the film's ? and the genre's ? influence on his own work (particularly THE FRENCH CONNECTION [1971]), waxes lyrical on the qualities of these two actors (saying that there were none better in the B-movie stakes) and, watching their brilliant work here, I can't say that I disagree; actually, among the noir titles I have set up for first-time viewing is another notable McGraw vehicle, THE THREAT (1949). Furthermore, the film also features a memorable gallery of villains (albeit played by unfamiliar character actors), an incredible fist-fight sequence which anticipates the one in FROM Russia, WITH LOVE (1963) and ends with a marvelous, unexpected twist ? which demonstrates the care and talent which went into the making of even a second-feature during the Golden Age of American cinema! Needless to say, the innocuous 1990 remake of THE NARROW MARGIN (directed by Peter Hyams and starring Friedkin alumnus Gene Hackman) was an unnecessary update ? so much so that it's already faded out of everyone's memory (mine included) which certainly can't be said of the superb original!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All aboard the Noir train</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Narrow Margin is directed by Richard Fleischer and has a screenplay by Earl Felton. The film stars Charles McGraw, Marie Windsor, Paul Maxey, Jacqueline White and Don Beddoe.This film has more twists and turns than a roller-coaster, one of the best Noir films ever made I think. McGraw's character is one of the most cynical you'll ever see in a film. Marie Windsor steals every scene she is in as the tough dame who sprays quips around like bullets.Detectives Walter Brown (Charles McGraw)and Gus Forbes(Don Beddoe)are assigned to protect Mrs.Neall(Marie Windsor)and escort her to court. Neall is a mobsters wife who has agreed to testify in court. People are trying to kill her before she can talk. Brown is tough, cynical and hates the fact that he and his partner are risking their lives for somebody like Mrs. Neall. Even though she is testifying he doesn't think she's a good person.As they escort her to the train they've booked tickets on Forbes is killed. Brown manages to get Mrs.Neall on the train and locks her in the empty compartment next to his. The killers have boarded the train too and there's very few places to hide. Can Brown protect her? This is a tense film and the train setting gives it extra suspense. The antagonistic relationship between Mrs.Neall and Brown is very interesting to watch, they loath one another and their verbal sparring is a treat to listen to.There is a big twist concerning a main character and it makes you see them in a different light. When this twist is revealed we also realise there are two different investigations being run, each as important and dangerous as the other.McGraw gives one of his best performances as the Detective who hates his current assignment but will work hard to protect Mrs.Neall no matter what.It's a real shame that Marie Windsor didn't appear in more Noir films because she is one of the best Noir actresses. Tough, sexy and a natural with the dialogue. Paul Maxey is memorable as an overweight train passenger who gets in the way of Brown a few times.If there's a downside to this film it's that the murder of a main character later on in the film is only referred to once. When you realise the risk that person was taking and how brave they were it's a shame that more time isn't devoted to acknowledging their sacrifice. That issue aside though this is one of the best Noir films and is filled with superb performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charles McGraw with that raspy voice and rugged look was always cast as a tough guy on either side of the law. But only in The Narrow Margin was he a lead in a film.He and partner Don Beddoe draw a tough assignment, escort mob widow Marie Windsor to Los Angeles from Chicago to turn over a list of payoffs the mob has been making to law enforcement officials. Right from the start it goes bad as Beddoe is killed just taking Windsor out of her apartment.So McGraw has to keep an eye out on Windsor for the next few days as the train goes to Los Angeles. Strangely enough the hit men have no idea what their target looks like, but they know McGraw is now the only cop escorting so they focus on him.Now I have to say that throughout the whole film I kept thinking this was a truly stupid idea, sending out contract killers who have no knowledge of what their target looks like. But as it turns out this was a very clever plot gimmick and there's a good reason why.McGraw and Windsor are at their best here. Windsor is frightening as one coldhearted woman who has a secret that's the key to the whole story.The Narrow Margin got an Oscar nomination for the writing. Deservedly so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a taut, suspenseful film noir made just as that genre was entering its twilight years. It contains a daring plot twist that you may or may not see coming, but you will probably at least suspect that all the characters are not what they seem. The film stars the great Marie Windsor, one of the screen's most underrated actresses, who was born to play noir. The supporting players are well cast, and their roles are well acted. The one exception is the one-dimensional Charles McGraw, whose gruffness after a while becomes an irritant. I wanted to say to him, "all right, we get it, you're a hard-boiled homicide detective. Now how about showing a little more expressiveness or just plain humanity." I guess Mitchum wasn't available, because this would have been a perfect part for him. But an excellent film nevertheless. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Young Director Richard Fleisher, working closely with ace cinematographer George E. Diskant and fine film editor Robert Swinck, creates a nifty train thriller in 1952."The Narrow Margin" gets in there, does what it has to do, and gets out in just a little over an hour. A taut script, stark lighting, sharp photography, and no-nonsense editing elevate this to a high plane.The cast consists of otherwise support players taking on leading roles, and doing a great job. One of Fleisher's best works. Only slight drawback: its generic title, while seemingly "coinable" and appropriate, is also surprisingly forgettable; accordingly, one might be hard-pressed to recall its title later on.Chalk "THe Narrow Margin" up as a first-rate "sleeper" of a thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This train's headed straight for the cemetery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film with possibly some best hard boiled banter in Film Noir. If you haven't seen the film there are spoilers below.SPOILERSWhen Brown (McGraw) and Forbes (Beddoe) enter the tenement and climb the stairs they immediately hear the decadent jazz piece that becomes the sultry Mrs. Neal's leitmotif. Brown correctly portends that his hunch about Mrs. Neal is right and the initial meeting is a hoot. The whole sequence takes on a whole new subtext upon a second screening of the film once you know that Mrs. Neal is in actuality a decoy undercover (internal affairs) Chicago cop, Sarah Meggs (Windsor), playing the gangster moll, and more than tough as nails McGraw's equal. Windsor's turn as a hard boiled internal investigations cop playing a cheap, coarse, sightly seedy floozy is her tour de force. It's Chicago vs LA and Windsor steals the scene. Some people say there are plot holes i.e. Why keep Charles McGraw in the dark about the true nature of the journey? And if you are going to run a decoy, why would you put her on the same train with the real girl? I think the answers are all in the subtext, Meggs (Decoy Mrs Neal) is not only a decoy but more importantly an internal affairs cop, and she is looking for corruption in LAPD. The initial fact that the "safe house" is already compromised, indicates that the underworld has been tipped off by a mole in LAPD as to the whereabouts of Mrs. Neal and the two main LAPD suspects are Brown and Forbes. If you go with that angle the whole "Mrs. Neal and the list" plot point becomes irrelevant and the real plot is corruption investigation in LAPD and who is/are the informer(s). Like you say "Why keep Charles McGraw in the dark" or why not just mail the list to the LA DA.Now remember Forbes right at the get go tries to get Meggs (Decoy Mrs Neal) to give him the list. Once Forbes buys it, Meggs goes to work on Brown tempting him in the cab with sex and later on the train with money.My thoughts.... the real plot is LAPD corruption. One of the posters on IMDb says that he's read that in the original script that Forbes was definitely on the take. The curious actions of Brown on the train also make you wonder about him, if he was truly that stupid or if he was deliberately exposing Meggs to the gangsters. The film gets better every time I watch it. Its a 10/10 for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A taut, gritty thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A short, taut thriller - 71 minutes - but with a decent budget, it looks like. Or at least they do the moving train backdrop really well. The Narrow Margin's about a cop being assigned to escort a hostile witness - a mob boss's wife - safely to her trial. This was before they could afford plane tickets for valuable witness I suppose, and so they take the train.The movie's way gritty - the cop's partner is offed early and he won't be the only one - and the surviving cop isn't happy about his duties. The witness - played with relish by Marie Windsor - is venomous and sinks her teeth into him every chance she gets and he always gives it right back - this ain't no Bodyguard. There are naturally assassins aboard the train as well (or it'd be a boring movie), and the interactions between the cop and the baddies keep the suspense tight. The movie's already good but there is a doozy of a twist that brings it to a whole 'nother level. I had actually watched the 1990 remake previously, but that lame-o is really no comparison to this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Murder on the Chicago to L.A. Express</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The novelty of this Richard Fleischer-directed crime thriller rests on the fact that nearly the entire film takes place on board a train. Fleischer, who was adept at slicking up pulpy B material and giving it style to spare, treats the cramped shooting spaces as an advantage rather than a liability -- he uses extreme closeups, packed compositions and clever reflections (in train windows, mirrors, etc.) to enhance the story's claustrophobic appeal. No where is this more apparent than in a wild fist fight that takes place in a tiny mens' room.The story surrounds a hard-boiled detective's (Charles McGraw, who looks like he was born to play leading men in B noirs) efforts to escort a dead mobster's wife to L.A. so that she can testify in front of a grand jury. The bad guys want to bump her off before she gets there, but they don't know what she looks like. McGraw delivers the tough-guy patter with confidence, and Marie Windsor (who reminded me a bit of the contemporary actress Illeana Douglas) swaggers her way through the role of a gangster's moll with flair. When McGraw tells her at one point that her amorality makes him sick, she replies, "Use somebody else's sink." A plot twist toward the film's end caught me completely off guard.Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great "noir" movie compromised by a few improbable plot elements and even a bit of corniness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In case you didn't see the SPOILER warning, DON'T read this review if you plan to see the movie.Without belaboring the points made so well by others, this is an excellent and most suspenseful "film noir" showcasing the superior talent of Marie Windsor, one of Hollywood's greatest character actresses. The pithy scripting and gutslamming dialogue are just great. There is NO background music and the soundtrack alone would make a good radio drama.This film is also highly interesting in the technical sense, portraying a largely vanished era when sleeping cars and shelf-like berths were the standard mode of long distance travel, and manually delivered telegrams state of the art communication. Between stations, long distance trains were truly a world unto themselves, and those facing danger aboard these conveyances were on their own. However, for some reason, no one on this crowded train---even those stalked by professional killers---locks the doors to their compartments. Or hears gunshots!? And these 1952 era assassins don't have a snapshot or even a description of their quarry! There are some additional unrealistic tidbits. The designated target of the killers has a record player blasting music (that's about 15 years out of date) from a supposedly empty compartment. It's also highly doubtful that a reluctant organized crime witness wouldn't have been searched and/or allowed to pack a gun in her purse. Or that she, rather than her police escort, would have been carrying a "pay off" list that hadn't been previously disclosed to the authorities. There were no FAX machines in those days, but the teletype machines of the time could transmit the contents of documents (as well as rap sheets and fingerprints) in minutes.Without being too specific about the ending, Windsor---who often played a slut, gun moll or gold-digger---is the real hero of the movie, yet her sacrifice doesn't even get a passing mention from those who in some ways bungled the whole operation. I must admit that I've always had a soft spot for Marie Windsor, who, (so I've read) was nothing like her screen persona in real life. What a shame that this extremely attractive and gifted woman was never given major "A" movie roles that went to actresses with less sex appeal and far less talent. She would have made a great Cleopatra, and maybe even some money for those who invested in that flop. Despite the fact that she was about 10 years older than Elizabeth Taylor.I'm almost ashamed to admit that the ending of a movie about fictional events had the effect of making me deeply sorrowful. Marie was treated like dirt the whole time and like she never existed at the end. This is more than a boyhood crush talking. The sudden gear change in the final scenes from stark realism to a dance in the sunshine was quite insipid, and one of the loose ends that mars what is still a great classic.Nevertheless, this is a singularly unique work, one of the best of the genre, and definitely worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this noir is well-directed but the story is so dated and incredible that its hard to get interested in it. The story is about cops sent to transpost a mob's wife from Chicago to LA,using a train,so that she can testify against her husband.There are several things that are incredible in this story,one is that when one of the cops gets killed early-on,the other cop doesn't ask for any kind of back-up and sets to do the job alone.Then ,when he boards the train,even though he immediately realizes who the gangster is,he doesn't proceed to take any action,waiting for the man to try an attempt,he even seems afraid,when he can easily arrest the individual and disarm him any time he wants,or even order him off the train. This is the kind of plot ,and its kinda ridiculous.The gangsters are running all over the train and the cop is mostly trying to avoid them,which somehow one thinks it should be the other way round.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Narrow Margin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Confined spaces make good environments for suspenseful thrillers, as many filmmakers have noticed. Trains in particular have been featured in many memorable scenes in films like Alfred Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train (1951), Buster Keaton's silent comedy classic The General (1926) and, say, Ry?hei Kitamura's modern horror piece The Midnight Meat Train (2008). A noiry example of a movie set almost entirely on a train would be Richard Fleischer's crime tale The Narrow Margin from 1952.The film tells the story of a Detective Sergeant Walter Brown (Charles McGraw) who has been assigned to escort an important female witness, a mob boss's widow named Frankie Neal (Marie Windsor), to a courthouse in another town to testify against her late husband's criminal accomplices. The sprawling criminal organization has no plans of allowing her to reach the destination alive, something that Mrs. Neal is well aware of. As the train seems to be full of potential hit men and other suspicious figures, Sgt. Brown is put under heavy stress when trying to keep his target alive when the long journey on rails begins.The narrow corridors and compartments of the train automatically thicken the atmosphere and limit possible camera angles and movements dramatically, which of course fits in formidably with theme of increasing anxiety in Sgt. Brown's mind. Besides having to deal with the superficially tough but truly scared Mrs. Neal, Brown is also troubled by his intense feelings of guilt about the unfortunate fate of his colleague at the beginning of the movie and the constant uncertainty about other passengers' motives and identities. Is the annoyed fat man (Paul Maxey) a mere traveler? How to get rid of the nosy little boy and his attractive mother (Jacqueline White)? Maybe she could be used in a scheme to outwit the villains or would that be too immoral?The questions above, along with others, keep the audience guessing throughout the story until the big plot twist near the end. Brown's working methods obviously don't conform to highly realistic conventions of police work but a stylized movie naturally allows some artistic license regarding the antics of the characters. Charles McGraw delivers a perfectly adequate performance in the lead role but in my opinion many supporting actors come across as far more memorable than him. To name a few, at least Marie Windsor as the feisty Mrs. Neal, David Clarke as the hard-hitting bad guy Kemp and Peter Virgo as the ruthless lead schemer Densel can be mentioned. However, the young Gordon Gebert is very irritating as the little boy Tommy, although he is not the first or last kid actor to nearly ruin a movie with loud squeaking and overt enthusiasm.Besides the camera work, the lack of non-diegetic music also heightens the tension neatly by not distracting the audience from the overhanging stress in scenes like the rough fistfight in a closed train compartment. In addition, I liked the use of reflections on the train windows as a one more way for the filmmakers to work their way around the limitations of the narrow spaces on the set. However, the movie is not without its flaws, or shall we say 'things I would have liked another way'. Namely, I would have wanted to get to know the characters better, even if more fleshing out would have increased the runtime from the compact 71 minutes. Additionally, as in many noirs, the very ending feels a little too easily resolved and light considering the plot twists we have seen just before it ? such lackluster endings may have something to do with the strict film censorship of the era that always demanded a positive conclusion where crime never pays.Anyway, I think the good things ultimately outweigh the bad ones. The suspense and the sensation of stress are skilfully created and the characters are well portrayed, so the film easily belongs among the better noirs I have seen. Besides noir buffs, I can also recommend The Narrow Margin to train enthusiasts and thriller fans in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Taking You For A Ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Often cited as a classic of film noir, "The Narrow Margin" works more like part-pulp fiction, part-police procedural with all guts and no heart. Sentiment takes a holiday in this enjoyable, tough- nosed suspense story of a cop pursued by gangsters on a speeding train.When a dead mob boss's wife is ready to spill his secrets to the Los Angeles DA, it's up to Detective Sgt. Walter Brown (Charles McGraw) to make sure she testifies in one piece. Too bad for him the detail proves so unpleasant. Not only does his partner get killed 10 minutes in, but the woman he's assigned (Marie Windsor) is about as low as he figured."Some protection they sent me," she huffs. "An old man who walks right into it, and a weeper.""Sister, I've known some pretty hard cases in my time," Brown tells her. "You make them all look like putty.""Narrow Margin" is a pretty hard case, too. I'd categorize it as a pioneering WTFer, what with all the twists and turns it takes. Like the best-in-class WTFer, "Vertigo," it's a movie that plays fast and loose with logic, and leaves you scratching your head when it's over, but it also leaves you thinking about it a while. That counts for something.The dialogue, which got this low-budget B-picture an Oscar nomination, is as good as they come. Maybe only Neil Simon employed such jewel- cut wisecracks. Even the smallest lines crackle with wit and authority. Brown tells a taxi-cab driver: "Back where you came from, only faster." His quick take on her is a keeper: "A sixty-cent special, cheap, flashy, strictly poison under the gravy."The acting is terrific down the line. I even liked the little brat other reviewers here complain about. Because every other character seems to have a second identity, you need them to be on point the way they are here. David Clarke as the main torpedo, Kemp; and Paul Maxey as an ominous fat man are special standouts for me. Windsor does a lot to set the nasty tone, but her testy interactions with McGraw also establish the humor which undergirds this film. There's even some ambiguity here about Brown's mission. One of the mobsters, who makes a point of not carrying a gun, tries to bribe him with the logic "the world's better off without her," and even suggests Brown's payoff could help the widow of his murdered partner. You can see the wheels turning in McGraw's square countenance as this registers, a wonderful moment.The film really makes less sense the more you think about it. Why the train ride in the first place, when an armored car makes more sense? How come none of the mobsters know what this mob boss's wife looks like? How does any car keep pace with a speeding train for hours?The answer to these and other questions is that it's pure cinema, with the only rule being to keep the viewer in his/her seat. That said, there's that ending, which I won't even hint at but which you know if you've seen it. What's the deal with the too-casual wrap-up there?I have to come back to the basic idea that this is a WTFer, and that maybe director Richard Fleischer wanted to be sure viewers were asking exactly that question when the credits rolled. Mission accomplished, but what a ride!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Taut, train-set thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw the remake of this movie, 1990's NARROW MARGIN starring Gene Hackman and Anne Archer. I enjoyed it, although found it a little dull in places; the good news is that the original is a superior movie and deserving of its status as a mini classic. The format is a simple one which sees tough cop Charles McGraw leading a mobster's wife to trial so she can testify against him; unfortunately, his hoods will attempt to stop them at any cost.The train setting for this film is what makes it a distinctive movie compared to the rest of the film noir genre. That, and the tough dialogue is spot on; the interplay between McGraw and Marie Windsor really zings. I have to say also that Windsor is one of the most alluring femme fatales I've seen up on screen and perhaps the epitome of her genre.Elsewhere, THE NARROW MARGIN benefits from Richard Fleischer's expert direction, using moving cameras to prowl through the claustrophobic corridors of the train to help make the film feel fast paced and never static. The acting is of a high standard and there are some twists and turns in here which are truly shocking. I think that THE NARROW MARGIN is ahead of its game when it comes to its genre, feeling tough and modern compared to most of its contemporaries.</fullReview>

A couple of cops have to escort an important witness who is being hunted by the mob on a train journey. When one of the cops gets killed, the other one is up against it. Not only does he have to keep the bad guys at bay, but he also has to face down the feisty witness.The film is a bit unrealistic at times. but there is hardly a dull moment with the cop and the mob playing a cat and mouse game inside a single compartment of a train. The director does manage to create this claustrophobic environment with narrow corridors and naughty kids and fat men. The film has some great one liners and the revelations at the end point to some ingenious plotting.I was not convinced by any of the actors, but apparently CHARLES MCGRAW and MARY WINDSOR are b-movie legends.(7/10)</fullReview>

White, who plays a woman that McGraw meets on the train, ended what had been a busy acting career, retiring to married life after this film. The plot does not make much sense, particularly a twist that is supposed to be clever but is illogical. However, the film is so entertaining that this deficiency can be overlooked.</fullReview>

McGraw's character talks tough, but is such an inept &amp; pathetic dolt, that in the real world he would, at least, get fired.I was curious about McGraw after thinking he had a perfect face for a thug in the similarly low-budget, but superior, noir 'T-Men', and after being impressed with his performance in a supporting role in 'In Cold Blood', but 'The Narrow Margin' is definitely not on a par with those two films.</fullReview>

The cleverly crafted one-liners between these two circling sharks fairly drips with shredded flesh. Not noir in classic sense of "Detour", it's still an unstable world with few certainties and a cynical subtext where cops can be bribed in a manner that debunks law and order 1950's. Sharp, imaginative direction: fat guy Paul Maxie clogs passageways like a heaving dump truck; wash-day clotheslines pop-up like a nightmare gauntlet; plus, great close-in camera work that creates subtle sense of no escape. Two diverse points: watch for errant palm tree in high-prairie town of La Junta, Colorado, and miscasting of a Beaver Cleaver mom (Jaqueline White) in pivotal role that left me unconvinced. Still, this modest little black-and-white manages to lift its pot-boiler origins to near perfection, showing once again what was lost in the mindless stampede to Technicolor extravagance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoy it when I see that opening...RKO Radio Pictures. NARROW MARGIN is directed by Richard Fleischer, very aptly. This piece of Film-Noir was filmed in 1950 and released in 1952, when Howard Hughes remembered where the film was put. Gruff Charles McGraw plays hard-boiled copper Walter Brown, who gets the job of escorting a mobster's widow to a grand jury hearing. Brown is to get Mrs. Frankie Neal(Marie Windsor)from Chicago to Los Angeles by train. The mob is wanting to keep her from testifying and want an important list they believe she has possession of. The goons from the syndicate have no idea what Mrs. Neal looks like, but will create danger on a fast moving passenger train in search for her. Suspense sustains this black &amp; white gem. Some clever camera angles and a fair amount of banter between McGraw and Windsor is down right humorous. There will be an unexpected twist that proves interesting. McGraw of course is a staple of flicks like this and is flawless. Windsor is fantastic in this role; giving as good as she gets. A supporting cast includes: Jacquline White, David Clarke, Don Haggerty, Harry Harvey, Paul Maxey and Don Beddoe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Narrow Margin, while a great representative of it genre, is amazingly similar to a film made 11 years before: "Sleepers West" starring Lloyd Nolan, Mary Beth Hughes, Lynn Bari and a fine cast of supporting actors. Sleepers West is one of several Mike Shayne entries with Nolan as the wise-cracking private eye. Both films feature lawmen protecting female witnesses to murders and both films are set on trains moving to the West Coast of the U.S. While Marie Windsor is a lady cop playing decoy witness in The Narrow Margin, Mary Beth Hughes is the actual witness being guarded by gumshoe Shane in Sleepers West. Sleepers is slightly lighter than Narrow Margin and may not qualify as film noir. At any rate, both films represent a time when train travel was in vogue and could be exciting and even deadly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unchallenging But Earnest Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This slight 70-minute noir may seem too slight, but indeed it's not an exercise. The story tells a cat-and-mouse race aboard a California-bound train. Sand-papery Charles McGraw gives a natural performance as the protagonist, a tough and ethically bound detective assigned to safeguard a murdered gangster's widow until she can testify before a Los Angeles grand jury. Keeping her alive keeps him busy, which is good because it keeps us entertained by Marie Windsor's widowed gun moll, an acerbic, insensitive, greedy survivalist, no dummy about her situation or what our wholesomely good cop thinks of her and simply doesn't care as long as it gets her out alive. She's willing to make his job harder, purposely endanger people she never even sees, and can hardly even live with the boredom and restlessness of being hidden in McGraw's dual compartment.Richard Fleischer's adequate little diversion is the simplest tale of good vs. evil. McGraw's hard-boiled lawman is, from the opening minutes, like a martyr whose flaws only ennoble him. The film ends way too abruptly. Nevertheless, Fleischer is not quite going through the motions. The acting might be more effective here than even in some superior noir from the era because, well, to put it simply, there are no transatlantic accents. McGraw himself is as down-to-earth as they come, Windsor is fire on his plain.Aside from the quality performances of the two leads, there are some very creative moments of suspense, most memorably the climax. The movie also fools us well enough with its skeletal plot to completely throw us for a loop, showing its true chiaroscuro view of an uneasy and deceptive moral reality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to watch this movie because it starred Charles McGraw. McGraw, the granite jawed, raspy voiced actor who starred and co-starred in crime dramas in the forties and fifties. It was McGraw's star vehicle but the real star was the script, cast and direction in one of the best film noires ever made. The movie might have been cheap to make but the script won't betray the economy of making the movie. The audience is taken through a roller-coaster ride of plot twists, betrayals, and murder, within the first fifteen minutes of the show, McGraw's sidekick, Forbes', is shot to death. The storyline is basically, two LA detectives are sent east to Chicago, to escort a witness for the prosecution. The witness, a dead crime lords wife, the woman played by Marie Windsor, is a hard boiled dame that is scared for her life. With partner killed, McGraw gets the dame on-board a train to LA. The gist of the movie takes place upon this train, as the gang of criminals are trying to kill the woman before she can testify. What was really cool about this movie was the black and white film and the various camera angles and shadows that give film noire it's name. If Marie Windsor is not on your all-time list of Film Noire Queen's she had better be soon. Not only does she fit the requirements when it comes to a figure and face, but the little gal can act too! If you want to see a perfect example of what a smallish budget, clever direction and topflight script can do, run do not walk to the nearest DVD stand and watch: The Narrow Margin!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The twist is hard to believe...but his is one hell of a ride...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thanks to some taut direction by Richard Fleischer, some incredibly tense performances from CHARLES McGRAW and MARIE WINDSOR and some very atmospheric shots of narrow passageways, dining cars and Pullman berths aboard a speeding express, NARROW MARGIN emerges as a swiftly moving melodrama sure to capture your attention from beginning to end.The story has police officer McGraw and his buddy on the force assigned to bring Windsor from L.A. to Chicago to testify against mobsters who rubbed out her husband. She's a bitter, whining, vindictive woman with a sharp tongue who never fails to give McGraw a hard time, even after his buddy is shot and she shows no remorse.Aboard the train, it becomes a cat and mouse game to keep her away from the assassins aboard who are intent on killing her. The plot is a tricky one and it's the twist that I find hard to believe. It rather startled me and comes so late in the story that I was nevertheless hooked until the final scene.The cast is uniformly good, all giving completely credible performances and making this one of the most enjoyable and dangerous train rides you're ever likely to take. Charles McGraw is impressive in his tough, street-wise way and Marie Windsor is at her most femme fatale in this tightly knit story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A dead mobsters wife (Marie Windsor) is going to testify against the mob. Detective Sergeant Water Brown (Charles McGraw) is hired to take her from Chicago to Los Angeles by train and protect her. There are bad guys on the train--but they don't know what she looks like. Can Brown keep her a secret all the way? Fast (70 minutes), tight B film. A perfect example of how to shot an exciting movie in a small setting--95% of the film takes place in small train compartments. Director Richard Fleischer deserves a lot of credit for this. The script moves quickly and there's a great twist at the end (I'm almost ashamed to admit I didn't see it coming). Also a very violent fight in a compartment is a highlight. Windsor and McGraw are fine in their roles--no Academy Award performances here but they are as good in their roles as is possible.A classic B film noir. Well worth catching. Avoid the terrible 1990 remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise of this noir caught my eye when I was reading the weekly films reviews in the paper. Most of the action takes place on a train, but it really doesn't at all. It is best known for the revolutionary use of a hand-held camera to simulate the rocking motion of the train. This was a cost-saving device employed by the cash-strapped RKO Studio to save money on an already low-budget production. This is OK, because noir's work best when they are grimy not glossy, and 'The Narrow Margin' certainly has that hard-boiled feel to it.Charles McGraw and Marie Windsor play opposite each other. He's the cop Walter Brown assigned to the task of escorting mobster wife Windsor across the country via train in order to testify. She must stay hidden at the risk of being killed. This is a short noir, clocking in at just 71 minutes, but it packs a lot of action into that short running time.McGraw is gruff and tough as the cop who is constantly battling with the nagging dame Windsor. She's tough as nails like him, and their interaction provides the highlight of this piece. McGraw meets a more suitable lady on the train whilst Windsor is holed up in her compartment, a young mother (Jacqueline White) with a son, Tommy. As with most noirs, things are not as they seem so prepare for major twist near the end.7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The tight dynamic of this short movie causes one to know instinctively not to bat an eye or you'll miss something. Not only miss something but regret missing it. Watch for the first appearance of the little bratty Tommy and if you need to slip away for a quick second that's your time to do it. Even the bright light scenes have that just right hint of darkness needed to sustain the noir effect. This type of movie with it's array of pungent character actors makes you long for some vague resemblance to the genre today. The sweet tension between the leading man and his 2 leading ladies constantly begs for resolution, this while making you wonder will this be one of those where the bad guys get it or will all the good guys be rubbed out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although a B movie, "The Narrow Margin" is considered one of the best of the film noir genre ever made. It's fast moving, like the train that Charles McGraw, Marie Windsor, Jacqueline White, and some thugs are taking to Los Angeles. The thugs seek to stop a mobster's widow from handing over his "pay list" and talking to the Grand Jury.The tension really never lets up in this film, as the widow is in constant danger and McGraw keeps running into the criminal element, who have already killed his partner. They try to bribe him for the pay list. You really experience the narrowness of the train (especially when Paul Maxey tries to get down a corridor) and its movement. It's absolutely wonderful.Charles McGraw looks just like a stereotypical, tough guy detective, and he had the most marvelous voice. Marie Windsor is at her best as McGraw's charge. She's cheap and uncaring with her sultry hairdo, her trampy negligee, her blaring radio, and a cigarette hanging out of her mouth. Had this not been a B film, Windsor would have gotten more mileage out of it in Hollywood.There are some great bits in this - one at the very beginning with pearls, and at the very end, using Maxey to great advantage.This film was remade, with some changes, as "Narrow Margin" with Gene Hackman and Anne Archer. Though it had some fine moments and beautiful scenery (don't bother looking for scenery in the '52 version), this version is superior for its hard-bitten dialogue and atmosphere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "Film Noire" In a Class By Itself!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Narrow Margin" is one of the best examples of the "film noire" genre popular during the 1940s and 1950s. To be sure, it's a "B" level picture with no major stars and was filmed in glorious black and white on a modest budget.Director Richard Fleischer gives us a compelling story with all of the usual characteristics of "film noire". First there is the crisp B &amp; W photography and the excellent lighting effects which produce dark shadows and create the illusion of a moving train. Then there are the usual "film noire" stereo types: the hard boiled detective, the "femme fatale" and in this case a claustrophobic setting. And there is always the mystery of who these characters really are.Det. Sgt. Walter Brown (Charles McGraw) and his partner Det. Sgt. Gus Fields (Don Beddoe) are assigned to escort mob boss widow, Mrs. Frankie Neil (Marie Windsor) from Chicago to Los Angeles to testify against the mob. Naturally, the mob will try to prevent her reaching her destination.As they are leaving for the train station, Forbes is shot down by an unknown assailant. This leaves Brown the task of completing his assignment alone. Two mob gangsters, Kemp (David Clarke) and Yost (Peter Brocco) board the same train and use various means to find the Mrs. Neil. Brown and Neil take an immediate dislike for each other which makes Brown's task all the more difficult.One night while hiding from the villains, Brown enters the compartment of little Tommy (Gordon Gebert) and his guardian Mrs. Troll (Queenie Leonard). The boy thinks Brown is a robber and tries to raise the alarm at their subsequent meetings.A sinister fat man (Paul Massey) keeps appearing and Brown suspects him as being one of the gangsters. While watching Kemp in the dining car, Brown sits down at the table of Ann Sinclair (Jacqueline Scott) and the two become attracted to each other. Because of these meetings, the gangsters, who now include Denzel (Peter Virgo) begin to suspect that Sinclair may be the one that they are looking for. Meanwhile Mrs. Neil remains hidden in Brown's compartment and she and Brown continue to snipe at each other until...................The claustrophobic setting aboard a train heightens the suspense within the movie. Excellent performances from the veteran character actors in the cast make this a really riveting story. And be sure to stay around for the ending.The gravel voiced McGraw is outstanding as the detective and Windsor, often referred to as the "Queen of the "Bs", makes an excellent "femme fatale". White as the opposite number to Neil is good also. Gebert as the little boy is irritating enough that you'd like to wring his neck. Others in the cast are Harry Harvey as the Connductor and Don Haggerty as Det. Wilson.There is an excellent DVD commentary from William Friedkin with taped inserts from Director Fleischer about the "film noire" genre in general and how it applies to this film in particular.If there is a better little "B" picture around, I'm not aware of it.This film is in a class by itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful B Movie Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Narrow Margin is a great little B Film Noir Thriller. One of my favorites. Made on a shoestring budget and filmed in a few weeks, it's not that very well known, but is well worth seeing for anyone who loves crime dramas from the old days. Fast paced and barely over 70 mins long, it never lags and you will find yourself getting more out of it in repeat viewings. I never get tired of watching it. Set mostly aboard a speeding train, a tough guy detective is hired to escort a mob wife who's going to spill the beans about informants to the LA DA. (why exactly she's in Chicago and the LA DA is even involved is never explained). Right from the first scene, you know you're in for a wild ride and there are plenty of twists and turns in the plot as mobster hit men on the train try to eliminate the wife or bribe the detective to look the other way. Wonderfully shot and edited with NO musical soundtrack, just the sound of the train in the background. Great cast headed by Noir veterans Charles McGraw as the hard boiled detective and the wonderful Marie Windsor has the hard boiled dame he's trying to protect. Their put downs and insulting repartee are some of the high points of the movie. There's a great plot twist near the end that will leave you wanting to watch the film again to appreciate its ironies and double meanings. No One Loves A Fat Man, but I guarantee you'll love this little gem!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tense, Cheap Train/Crime Drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's something about Charles McGraw that is in its own quiet way unspeakable. The guy seems hardly human. Of medium height, blocky, with a voice that sounds like a subwoofer on acid, and a face that is made not of flesh but some sort of igneous rock, maybe quartz. Punching him in the nose would only break your fingers. Pounding him on the skull with a sledgehammer would make him crack and splinter instead of frown and slump. Maybe his best role was the small part of Robert Blake's grizzled father in "In Cold Blood." Age seems to have slowed him down. His eyes have grown almost gentle. He seems less ready to pop.He's all that and more in "Narrow Margin." As Detective Brown he's assigned to escort the widow of a top gangster who recently died of natural causes after being shot several times. She's Marie Windsor and is supposed to sing before a grand jury in Los Angeles. They take a long train ride together, from Chicago to L.A. as the song goes. She's pretty nasty actually. She insults him and complains constantly and urges him to sell out and join her on "the gravy train" or something. (It's a little confusing at times.) Meanwhile McGraw has nothing but contempt for her. There is on the other hand a nice, clean, well-spoken middle-class blond lady with a young boy who catches his eye. I mean -- the blond catches his eye, not the young boy. They keep bumping into one another as the train lurches from side to side. There's this really fat guy too, Sam Jennings, who plays his weight for laughs. Then there are a couple of creepy underworld types who know that McGraw is escorting the widow to L.A. They know what he looks like but they don't know what SHE looks like, and -- well. Discretion forbids further revelation. I won't sell out any more than McGraw would.Not badly done. Train movies are almost always more interesting for being set aboard a train. There's constant motion. Images fly past the windows. Shadows and lights from outside zip over a character's face. And there are always stops where the characters can get off for a few minutes and make phone calls, send telegrams, smoke cigarettes nervously, have assignations, or play table tennis. Cars can speed alongside trains and draw suspicious stares.Marie Windsor wasn't the greatest actress in the world but she was dependable and pretty, what with her big eyes and fluffy black hair, a little like Ileana Douglas. The open-faced innocent blond passenger is dull. Her little boy, Tommy, is a noisy pain in the neck and should have been flung off the train while it was traversing a bridge.There isn't anything outstanding about the film -- no tag lines or spectacular scenes or anything. And not all that much action. Two shootings and one fist fight. Yet the story moves along at a pretty fast clip and keeps you occupied. Once you get into it, you don't really want to get out of it without seeing the ending. It's a nice, professional piece of craftsmanship with no special effects extravaganzas and not much of a budget.Worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Absolutely brilliant thriller by the perpetually underrated Richard Fleischer. Charles McGraw stars as a cop tasked with guarding a gangster's moll (Marie Windsor) set to testify in court. The two of them take a train and are being stalked by some thugs. McGraw is able to hide Windsor effectively, but the thugs start to focus in on another woman (Jacqueline White) whom McGraw keeps running into. This is a tight little movie, running only 71 minutes. Fleischer's direction is clever without ever feeling overdone, and the Oscar nominated screenplay is really smart. There are a lot of unexpected twists and turns. If you look back on it, there are a couple of things that don't make a lot of sense, but it's all too entertaining to dwell on the minor flaws. I wouldn't hesitate to call this a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing little Noir sleeper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this is NOT one of the most famous Film Noir pictures, it is among the very best due to expert writing, excellent acting and a sense of tension that is hard to beat. Charles McGraw, who often portrayed gangsters in Noir flicks due to his gravely voice, ugly scowling face and tough-guy persona, is the hero. He's a detective responsible for bringing a gangster's wife to Los Angeles to testify before a grand jury investigating corruption. The problem is that many people want to see the woman dead and her list of mob accomplices destroyed. As a result, McGraw's partner is killed by an assassin in just the first few minutes of the film and it's up to McGraw to escort the woman alone on a train from Chicago to LA. So, during this long ride, McGraw's job is to both protect the lady AND figure out who on the train is out to get her. And, while this may sound like an overly simplistic plot, there are so many excellent twists and turns that the movie will both leave you guessing and fatigued from the ultra-high level of tension. Pluses for the film--excellent acting, GREAT snappy Noir-like dialog, great pacing and action.Negatives for the film--none--it was THAT good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>McCarthy era abyss Film Noir hidden gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PLOT SPOILERSWow, what an incredible film experience--especially as we are about to enter a war.I only caught the ending of this on Turner Classic, but the direction, story-telling, acting was professional and impressive.But for me "(1952)" says so much more about what film noir was about.In 1952, nobody knew how the Cold War was going to turn out, how McCarthyism was going to turn out, and it was two years into the Korean War with no clear end in sight. Most would have thought WW3 was likely with hydrogen bombs being used as well.When war protesters today or during Vietnam talk about the horrors of war, I think most of them think that previous generations were naive about such issues. Film noir &amp; 1930's films show that cynicism was previously known as a guiding principle of human behavior.The phoniness of the ending if anything is a transparent cynical comment on the "realities" of the world in 1952. Anyone sophisticated enough to watch a House Un-Americans Activies or Senator Joseph McCarthy hearing, knew what the score was. You were supposed to pay lip service to proper values in the final 10 minutes, even if the rest of the movie showed the randomness of death due to betrayal and confused loyalties ("who can I trust?")Of course this works as a movie on its own. However, for me it resonates on deeper levels because of the symbolism of being on a hurtling train, trying to get by each other in tight mazelike spaces, trying to avoid detection in a closed environment, hiding in plain sight, etc.The movie itself has hidden in plain sight under the radar. Again, simply a joy to find a lost B-movie treasure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Narrow Margin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lean, mean, taut, tightly photographed, excitingly developed due to its tense story (gangster's moll has a list that could implicate criminals and so her life is in jeopardy as a hard-boiled (but truly soft-hearted, particularly for the partner who gets shot in the line of duty) cop must keep her safe on board a train heading from Chicago to Los Angeles), with some especially memorable heated exchanges between the unforgettable (and extremely sexy) Marie Windsor (who should have been a star) and Charles McGraw (as the cop assigned to protect her). Consigned almost exclusively on board a train (with the crew, led by sufficient, fast-paced direction from Richard Fleischer, expressively devoting emphasis on how closed-in and bottle-necked the space is for the characters), with the developing plot revealing twists regarding hidden identities (who is actually the moll? Is the fat guy a paid thug or perhaps a member of a type of enforcement authority? Is the killer winged by McGraw, with the fur coat returning to finish what he started?), "The Narrow Margin" is a sterling example of noir-on-a-train, but all because it might have that bit of uniqueness in location doesn't mean it isn't worthy to be included in the conversations with "The Maltese Falcon", "The Big Heat", or "The Big Sleep". If anything, placed on board a train, all that confinement in such tight spaces, gives "The Narrow Margin" an extra bit of pip. The story is still perfectly noir with fists punching, macho-talking (Windsor holds her own, that's for sure), stark view of human nature (one of the criminals, who doesn't carry a gun, offers McGraw a pay-off so he can give some money to the family of his dead partner; McGraw must brush aside his disgust for Windsor and follow the morality of the shield; a child is brought into the mix in order to get the dead gangster's widow to conform to a type of surrender), victims caught in the crossfire (one is shot in the back while another is shot while coming down the stairs; the clear heavy is the man with the fur coat), and that obviously righteous black &amp; white photography (the darkness of the situation needs the right kind of lighting at times). Shooting action in the train is the film's significant asset while the plot might not hold up to close scrutiny. To me McGraw is the right kind of hero for a film like this. He is gruff, but a good cop; his nervousness is palpable, while trying to contend with Windsor's (intended?) feisty, complaining, always-negative moll isn't easy for him. Jacqueline White is precious and pretty, kind of enforcing herself into the plot. You might know her kid from the Robert Mitchum/Janet Leigh Christmas film, "Holiday Affair".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was mentioned in David Mamet's book, Bambi vs. Godzilla, as an excellent example of Film Noir or "Poverty Row" film. Like all good stories, this screenplay (by Felton) starts with a question. The question is then answered in ways that are surprising yet inevitable. I love this film in that it does what most modern gangster/crime dramas cannot. Without profanity, graphic sex or computer-generated-imagery it tell a very straight-forward, coherent tale that is excited, witty and sexy. The cast is awesome. Jacueline White, Marie Windsor, Peter Brocco, Peter Virgo and David Clarke are actors with a small 'A'. They do the job that needs to be done with just enough emotion and action to move the story along. There is none of the preachy, political correctness or ham-fisted, so-called style of recent crime drama. The heroes and villains of this well told tale are people doing 'business'. There is no justice just 'the deal'. The crooks make honest and reasonable propositions and the cops must decide how the be righteous in a world that is corrupt on many levels. There is violence present (one of the best fight scenes ever filmed is contained in this movie)but it's devoid of the splatter of the Sopranos or the dizzying camera movement of the Bourne/Bond ilk. The director(Fleischer) of this film makes good use of the narrow aisles of the train as well as the tight space of the sleeping compartments. I also love the use of black and white of that era in film because it forces the director to use light and shadow to show depth and have a dramatic on the viewer. Why is it that the filmmakers of this era are unable or unwilling to make films like these? I'm not proposing that these films be copied. Copying them would only result in a kind of amateurish parody. What I'm proposing is that today's filmmakers adapt the simple, unvarnished storytelling of the movies made before all of the so-called realism and technological innovation overwhelm the audiences of our generation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Holy Grail of Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a huge Noir fan, this film had eluded me for years. I seemed to miss it every time it was on. On the other hand, I still had it to look forward to. Truly my own personal Holy Grail of Film Noir. I finally just watched it on my DVR. Every bit as great as I've always hoped. It stars non other than Charles McGraw, legend of Film Noir. Sometimes a bad guy, sometimes a good guy and sometimes even both. (See "Roadblock"). As with any great entry to the Noir genre, the photography is first rate. It's by George E. Diskant and the hand held camera work is quite innovative for 1950 when the movie was originally produced. Director Richard Fleischer wanted to move fluidly around the train while keeping the claustrophobic feeling, no mean feat for sixty years ago. In fact, the filming is so contemporary you have to be a classic movie fan to notice. Fleischer also uses only the train and surrounding natural sound instead of a traditional music score. It works so well that you'll never even notice unless it's pointed out. At least I needed someone to clue ME in. At less than 75 minutes, it seems over before it's even started, but that's the mark of any good film. Chances are that if you're reading this, you're a big Noir fan already. If that's the case, you can't be disappointed. It's one of those great little "B" pictures that will keep calling you back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable tense bit of b-movie pulp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Police officers Brown and Forbes are assigned to escort a gangster's moll to LA to testify in front of the grand jury. Minutes after collecting Mrs Neall, Forbes is murdered in an attempted hit on her, leaving Brown to take her the rest of the way on train. Knowing that the hit men know what he looks like but not her, Brown keeps Neall out of the way and attempts to make the journey but, with the hit men searching the train, it is a race against time for both parties with LA getting closer and the stakes getting higher.It was a wonderful day outside when this film was shown on television the other day and, as much as we need to make the most of any sun we get in the UK, I figured that I'd rather take a break from the garden than miss this little classic. The plot is the stuff of pure pulp crime novels and the situation is perfect for upping the tension. It does this very well with a real sense of urgency throughout and a very gritty feel that sits well with the plot. Brown is not a guy who keeps cool in the situation as one would imagine a slicker film making him but instead he is sweaty and tense throughout, upping the already tense material. The direction makes good use of the confined location without overdoing the style ? the train is moody and dark and the director uses it well.The cast match the material well. McGraw is wonderfully gritty and better and it is only towards the end that he lightens in the obligatory romance towards the end. Windsor is a great moll and sets up the later twists really well off the back of her performance. The various gangsters are suitably creepy and sinister and the supporting cast of passengers are all pretty good, filling out the film.Overall this is a very short film but it is one that delivers a really good b-movie punch. Gritty, tough, tense and enjoyable, the film is enjoyable for what it is and the lead actors, writer and director all combine to deliver a classic bit of crime pulp that is worth coming out of the sun for 70 minutes for!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Skilled formality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The narrow margin" (1952) directed by Richard Fleischer was surely at the time a fictional landmark located mainly inside a night train, when beside neon itself helped the photography to be with much more dramatic value for the circumstance of the story itself. Also within abstract cogitation as artifact, from a punished democratic society at stake by inquisitorial quest. Fleischer was by this way introduced in art of dealing with consumption from a genre of movie, that finished with a convinced rhythm and skilled formality, that perturbed with innovation this creative photography of that movie as a mission for a trial. A closed space during a long night track inside a train, it was uncommon at the time, but this trend for the preservation of the unity of the dramatic structure was won by Fleischer on the aisle. It seems that Fleischer was there on the spot, for confusing the mind of the viewers about a story mingled with reality of that time. Where suspicion, mystery, fear, brutality and willingness to save appearance, facing a civil trial, indeed it were all ingredients of a thriller like others. But with much more dramatic concentration of space for displaying a few characters, at the brink of foolish anguish, intriguing themselves and each other, against shadows concealed before lights. As well exposing these dualities in abstract way, as small it was this same world of darkness for a while, to survive at any guise of right to exist as everybody else. Almost as a metaphysics of femininity, in contrast with armed men, without boundary for shooting, if necessary for the prosecution. Meanwhile, revealing the night train as sub-genre of the beginning of atomic age, near the countdown of a smashed integrity, contaminating the shadowy closure as did such a pressing of events, no smoking or smoking. Opening his career by this typical way, for the concentration of attention sometimes in almost an abstract way and quite surreal between reality, nightmare, reactive mentality and the criminal subject of this story from Chicago inspiration, at the time of the underworld judgments, but here inexplicably the train goes to Los Angeles, as though the trial itself was there and the woman the figure of artificial attention. Why did not understanding that these attributes were too much in a dry style for the immediate success of the thriller ? A closed space during a long night track inside a train, it is a kind of formalist match that took the viewer for the common anguish of the characters and it seems that only the director was happy for this inhibited trend, foreseen the story for details and surprises, enduring those who are waiting for much more than close-up's and counter shots upon the ceiling to the ground or across the aisle in between. Notwithstanding, for the timing as ago, creating suspense by fashion amalgam, where it was more easy to put a terminus before the train arrives, with someone still alive without sleeping during the dawn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent film-noir wonderfully paced with a memorable performance by Marie Windsor as the widow of a mobster called to testify in Los Angeles and she must get there by train from Chicago. The surprise is who Windsor really is as well as Jacqueline White, an unassuming mom on the train who is mistaken as the mobster's wife. Are they really mistaken?There is plenty of action in this rather short 75 minute film. Usual grade B actor Charles McGraw gets the lead role of the cop ordered to escort Windsor to L.A. It turns out that he is being tested as well.Well done film filled with irony. Highly recommended for those into film-noir.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've just watched this on DVD exactly sixty years after it was released - it was actually shot in 1950 but Howard Hughes was the head honcho at RKO at the same, nuff said. Probably a key element is the length, a mere seventy-one minutes, any longer and we may begin to wonder how come none of the would-be assassins has ever seen the wife of a leading gangster, surely she would be well known in his milieu; we may also wonder where the wife had been prior to boarding the train and why she would be so carefree knowing her days are theoretically numbered. But at seventy-one minutes none of that matters and all we need do is revel in low-budget professionalism. Sadly Jacqueline White retired after shooting wrapped in 1950 and although she was brought back from Wyoming to shoot extra footage in 1951 she never acted again. Our loss, Caspar's gain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Found this 1952 film quite interesting, where a detective has to protect a very tough gal from the hoods that want to wipe her out. The poor detective has to travel from Chicago to Los Angeles with this gal and runs into all kinds of problems on the train. If you like trains, and seeing the dinning car in action,the Pullman compartments with their bunks on top, this will bring you back in the past, when train travel was a joy for many people and inexpensive. There are many strange characters on the train, one is a very large man who seems to block the passageways, a sexy blonde with a brat of a son, and mean looking mobsters from the City of Chicago. Very interesting, you just might like it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BOR- ING; What DO people see in this film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fortunately, it was only a library loan; no funds exchanged. This is one of the few times I have disagreed so strongly with IMDb users/voters. From the get-go, all i could think was "who cares?". None of the characters made me feel ANYthing for them, not in the beginning, not in the end.For the lead male ,I could just SEE the suits saying, "Get me a cheap Kirk Douglas". The opening sequence had some really fun snappy repartee between the 2 detective partners, but the screenplay just got routine and Boring pretty quickly.Perhaps because of this, the performances were what I would refer to as "call it in" jobs. Oh well, back to my Hitchcock retrospective......</fullReview>
