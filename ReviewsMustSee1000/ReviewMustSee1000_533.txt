		<shortDescription>As Good As The Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some people see this as an inferior sequel to the first movie "Grumpy Old Men". I don't agree, i love the first one but i think this one is every bit as good and in some ways..even better than the original. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are my favorite comedy team. The Fortune Cookie is a classic and i also love "Buddy Buddy" and "The Odd Couple Parts 1 and 2 but the Grumpies hold a special place in my heart. I was personally hoping for another Grumpy movie but sadly we've lost both of these wonderful stars so that will never happen. At least we will always have these fine films to enjoy and treasure. I have them on Dvd and watch them regularly..they never fail to touch my heart and make me smile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Our Second Visit to Wabasha, Minnesota</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sequels are rarely half as good as the original film. Matthau and Lennon would prove this at the tale end of their film partnership with THE ODD COUPLE PART II. But it has happened. ANOTHER THIN MAN is as good a film as THE THIN MAN. Vincent Minelli's follow up to FATHER OF THE BRIDE may lack the satire of weddings the original had, but FATHER'S LITTLE DIVIDEND is well made and entertaining in it's own right. And then there is this film. Of the first movie, GRUMPY OLD MEN, I have made a comment elsewhere. GRUMPIER OLD MEN is a neat follow-up, as we find how Max Goldman (Matthau) finds his new mate, Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren). It also settles the future of Max's son Mayor Jacob Goldman (Kevin Pollak) and John Gustafson's (Lemmon's) daughter Melanie (Darryl Hannah), and gives a bitter-sweet farewell to John's father (Burgess Meredith).I think the reason the sequel works is that there is a sense of time and continuity here that is not usually found. In GRUMPY OLD MEN, the reactions of Lemmon and Matthau to the death of their close friend Chuck (Ossie Davis), who had only recently been their rival for Ariel (Ann-Margaret) showed them to be human beings - not just two good comic actors trading insults for yucks. Here, it is watching the final scenes of Grandpa Gustafson (ironically Burgess Meredith's final role - and a fittingly good one for that fine actor). In the first film Meredith was always acting like a wild authority figure: over ninety years old, but threatening to tan the hides of the middle aged Matthau and Lennon like they were still kids when he stops them fighting. Here we see him in several guises. He is a loving grandpa - he is seen telling Allie (Katie Sagona) the story of Goldilock and the Three Bears (with his own modern interpolations), and then singing "Dream a Little Dream of Me" to put her to sleep. He is vulgar, but in a loving, sensible way. When Allie swallows a quarter, he suggests that it is normal - all kids swallow or try to swallow coins - and one only should worry if the kid excretes two dimes and nickel. He loves sexual encounters (in the first film he suggests that if Lemmon and Matthau can't get Arial he can!). Here he meets somebody to romance (Anne Gilbert), and they have a nice time together. But it is a brief one. Having reached 95, God finally comes for Grandpa, and his death manages to bring the other characters from cross purpose quarrels to sanity. It also brings the sweet image of Gilbert depositing a rose over the spot that Grandpa's ashes are scattered.The continuity theme is also in the portion about "Catfish Hunter" the local lake legendary catfish. Grandpa tells John, at one point, that the catfish was old when he was a boy (which begs the question, why did they name the catfish after a major Yankee baseball player of the 1970 teams? - long after Grandpa's youth). The locals all hope to catch the fish and mount it on their walls. We see it at one point jumping late at night, alone, into the air and back into the late in the glorious moonlight - the monarch of the lake. But at the end, when the catfish is caught by Matthau and Lemmon together, Lemmon (probably influenced by Ann-Margaret, who did the same thing in the first film) gets Matthau to agree to return the catfish to the lake, where it can join Grandpa's ashes. So the legend is returned to it's base.Even in the final moments of the film, with another marriage and a joke reminiscent of the first film's conclusion, suggests continuity. So there is a type of structural vigor in the two films, that strengthens their stories and increases the viewers pleasure watching them. Yes indeed, this is one sequel that works very well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Grumpier Old Men" is the equally funny sequel to "Grumpy Old Men". Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau return as John and Max, the longtime neighbors who in this movie have reconciled their friendship. Ann-Margret is back as Ariel, John's new wife. So is Burgess Meredith as Lemmon's horny dad, and also returning are Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak as Lemmon's daughter and Matthau's son who are now engaged to each other and their fathers help them out to plan their wedding with some bizarre ideas. But the real scene stealer in "Grumpier Old Men" is the wonderful Sophia Loren as the new Italian woman in Wabasha, Minnesota. Loren plans to turn the grumpy old men's beloved bait shop into a 'ristorante' as she puts it. The grumps don't like that one bit and try to drive her out of town, but ends up falling for Matthau. It's great to see Loren get an opportunity to do comedy, and she gets her share of big laughs throughout the film. This film and it's predecessor once again will remind you of what a great team Lemmon and Matthau made. ***1/2 (out of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is downright hilarious with tons of good one-liners. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon (may they both rest in peace) are two of the funniest actors in history. No one else could have played Max &amp; John. Sophia Loren is still one of the most beautiful women in movie history! One of the funniest scenes is when she says "Holy moly" after being kissed by Max. Watch this movie. You will enjoy it, if you have a sense of humor!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the first one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While "Grumpy" was enjoyable, I think "Grumpier" is the better overall movie. More attention is given to the supporting characters, the plot is slightly more complex, the lines are better, the jokes are better, and Lemmon and Matthau once again give excellent performances. Granted, this still isn't as good as it could be, but I think it's a noticeable step up from the original. I really don't get all the negativity toward it... come on, people, it's just a silly comedy. Lighten up.Speaking of negativity, another reviewer, whom I won't name here (oh all right, it's John Ulmer), seems to think this movie is nothing more than a "shouting match," and is concerned about the age difference between the Old Men and their lady friends. I disagree on both points. The dialogue doesn't have as much shouting this time around, and Matthau's girl is most certainly NOT "fortysomething." Believe it or not, she was 61 at the time, and I must say it's quite amazing how good she looks for a woman her age (Matthau was 75--a pretty big age difference, true, but I can't imagine there's a lot of men to choose from when you're single and in your 60s!). I hate to chastise another reviewer like this, but I thought it was worth mentioning.So in conclusion... it's a good movie. Doesn't deserve its bad rap.7/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "Grumpier" the funnier!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie just happens to be yet another installment of an endearingly hilarious story. The chemistry between Messrs Matthau and Lemmon has been obvious since their earlier days in "The Odd Couple" and seems to have gotten even better as the years ensued. The acting is superb, the direction impeccable, the entire cast is phenomenal and with the addition of "Maria" and her mom it simply completes the entire storyline to make for one whale of a good time. The innate beauty of both Ms. Margret and Ms. Loren is timeless. Burgess Meredith's role has been stepped-up from his previous one, as the cynical, openly opinionated, Lothario wannabe, lol, a resounding achievement for a gentleman of his longevity, yet he pulls it off famously. There is some really hilarious banter between him and Maria's mother "Mama Ragetti", I laughed out loud. I must confess, I laughed out loud at so many of the scenes in this film, I can't even begin count them. There is a real synergy to this movie, a compilation of comedic moments. I can't imagine how anyone wouldn't enjoy this movie. I'm "hooked"...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Grumpier Old Men is one of the cutest movies I have ever seen. It is a fitting follow - up to Grumpy Old Men. Matthau and Lemmon shine in this great film. My favorite performance in this film would have to go to the wonderful actress Sophia Loren who plays a feisty newcomer in town. Burgess Meredith is marvelous in his role, and he had me rolling! This film is excellent, and I am proud to own it. I suggest that anyone looking for a lots of laughs, and a cute romance story see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Snoozing sequel with the leads in need of some No-Doz</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woeful, disappointing sequel to 1993's hit "Grumpy Old Men" is more retread than follow-up. The two crotchety neighbors--Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon--bicker over their children (who will soon be making the sparring oldsters in-laws!) and, of course, who has the better fishing skills. They stop trading insults long enough for Matthau to begin irritating a new woman in town, a fiery Italian who has just opened her own restaurant. Sitcom humor with a sometimes-raunchy twist that is no longer fresh. Almost worth-seeing for Sophia Loren's funny, lively performance, but everyone else looks a little sleepy. Ann-Margret (who married Lemmon's character at the end of the original) must've dropped in for a day and a half to complete her work. As the youthful couple, Kevin Pollack and Daryl Hannah are also under-used. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a 50++ female who married again only 2 years ago, the romance between senior cits hit home with me. It IS possible for us older folks to find companionship, friendship, and fantastic SEX. This movie was absolutely hilarious! I know what it is like to have a child (college age) driving me insane, plus family pets underfoot, while also falling head over heels in love. I also know the pain of a parent dying with me right there. Jack Lemmon and Walter Mattau hit it all right on the mark. Grief, laughter, and love. It is hard to beat this combination.This movie made me laugh harder than I have in years, and that at 7 AM!!! Enjoy it folks!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sequel that's equal to the original comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first go round was such a hit, that Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau got together for this sequel to the 1993 smash hit, "Grumpy Old Men." And "Grumpier Old Men" is every bit as good as the first film. It has some new characters and the scene changes from winter to summer, then winter and spring. Most reviewers don't talk about the surprise of the wedding in the first film. And I won't do that for that film or this one. John (Lemmon) and Max (Matthau) team up for a time in the movie to plan the wedding of their daughter and son, Melanie and Jacob (played by Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak). And, later, to try to thwart the conversion of their bait shop into an Italian restaurant. Sophia Loren is the added ingredient for much humor as Maria Sophia Coletta Ragetti. She's a cousin of "Spaghetti" Ragetti, whom John and Max know. Her mother is in the picture, Mama Ragetti, played by Ann Morgan Guilbert. And, grandpa Gustafson is back, with Burgess Meredith now a couple years older. He tells son, John, as they sit by the lake drinking beer, that he sometimes thinks God has forgotten about him. The hijinks and capers in this film include some hilarious pranks the two friendly enemies pull on the Ragettis. As with the original film, this one supposedly takes place in Wabasha, Minnesota. While it is a real town on the Mississippi River border with Wisconsin, the filming for this and the earlier movie was done in a number of places around that area of southeastern Minnesota. So, anyone going to Wabasha won't find the fishing lake, the town overlook or some other scenes shown in these films. With the 10 films they made together ? especially the nine comedies, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau have delighted audiences for decades. May they outlive Catfish Hunter and continue amuse people for decades to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A sequel to the thoroughly enjoyable Grumpy Old Men, 'Grumpier Old Men' is A Sweet Film, with Lively Performances. The sequel has the spirit of its prequel &amp; the amazing cast, led by the impeccable talents of the Late/Great Jack Lemmon &amp; the Late/Great Walter Matthau, are in full form! 'Grumpier Old Men' Synopsis: John and Max resolve to save their beloved bait shop from turning into an Italian restaurant, just as its new female owner catches Max's attention.'Grumpier Old Men' works well as a romantic-comedy, as it has moments of humour &amp; subtle romance. I loved the prequel &amp; I must say, the sequel doesn't fail to deliver. The film has sustained its energy &amp; wit, that one would expect from it.Mark Steven Johnson's Screenplay is entertaining, although initially the pace is slightly slow. Howard Deutch's Direction is top-class. Tak Fujimoto's Cinematography is good. Editing also is ably done. Performance-Wise: Lemmon &amp; Matthau shine all through. Its their sheer on-screen chemistry, that alone is worth watching the entire film. Sophia Loren is top-notch. Ann-Margret is impressive. Kevin Pollak &amp; Daryl Hannah leave a mark. Late/Great Burgess Meredith is memorable in his part.On the whole, 'Grumpier Old Men' is a smooth, relaxing watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not As Good As The First</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the success of "Grumpy Old Men" a sequel was inevitable. The fact that it's also inferior to the hilarious first movie was also inevitable. Plot In A Paragraph: John and Max are still on good terms following the events at the end of last movie. They still greet each other in the same way, but now with affection. They join forces to save their beloveds bait shop from being turned into an Italian restaurant by its new owner (Sophia Loren) who has just took over.Almost all of the cast from the first movie return, Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are their usual brilliant self, with their usual awesome charisma. Ann Margaret isn't given much to do this time around. Sophia Loren is certainly still a sex bomb. Burgess Meredith is back, and is as smutty if not smithies than the first time around. Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollack both return too, and are both as reliable as you'd expect.Sadly, Grumpier Old Men was Burgess Meredith's final film. He looks in bad shape here, but still puts in a good fun, full of life performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Geezers Are Back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you watched Grumpy Old Men and know the ending there, you can't imagine how these two curmudgeonly old geezers could get a feud going again, especially after what Walter Matthau did for Jack Lemmon when Lemmon was really down. And in point of fact the boys seem to lose a step or two from the first film.Still Grumpier Old Men finds Lemmon and Matthau in their superbly timed best just fighting for sillier reasons. In the first film the rivalry heated up a bit because the two were panting hot and heavy for Ann-Margret and Lemmon got her. Now it's Matthau pursuing and what an object of pursuit he has in Sophia Loren. In the first film Ossie Davis owned a bait shop where everyone bought bait, but also liked to hang around, just like a barbershop. Davis dies during that film and now we find out that Sophia and her aunt Ann Morgan-Guilbert have taken it over and want to make it an Italian restaurant on the lake. Well when the senior citizens of this small Minnesota town hear about this they're up in arms. Fishing is close to a religion there and Matthau is leading the charge. That interferes more with romance than anything else.And the Holy Grail of that religion is none other than the largest catfish known to humankind, the legendary Catfish Hunter. Returning as Lemmon's father is Burgess Meredith who has been on the quest for most of his 95 years. When Lemmon's daughter Darryl Hannah finally ties the knot with Matthau's son you won't believe what's going on with our two leads on the wedding day of their kids.Grumpier Old Men was the farewell performance of Burgess Meredith ending a career that spanned six decades. The man was close to perfection in his performance as the oldest of the old geezers in Grumpier Old Men. This is man who has lived so long he really doesn't feel the need to be subtle and discreet. His courtship of Ann Morgan- Guilbert is a combination of geezer and caveman.Grumpier Old Men, keeping the Lemmon-Matthau standard of comedy high.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) and John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) are still combative while maintaining their truce. John is married to Ariel (Ann-Margret) now and his father (Burgess Meredith) is still spry. Everybody is chasing after the big fish Catfish Hunter. Meanwhile, their children Melanie (Daryl Hannah) and Jacob (Kevin Pollak) are planning to get married. Newcomer Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) arrives in Wabasha to buy the bait shop and turn it into an Italian restaurant. It's a continuation that's missing much of the fun. It is contrived.

		<fullReview>For the most part, "Grumpier Old Men" is pretty silly. Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) and John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) are still at each other's throats when Italian immigrant Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) arrives in town and throws everything into flux. What actually struck me most about the movie was how different the town looked in this one from the original. Obviously, it was a different time of year, but maybe the different look was meant to show how everything might be changing in the town.Other than that, Ann-Margret returns as Ariel, and she's still as free-spirited and vivacious as she was in the original. Burgess Meredith - in his final role - is still the grandfather who can exercise absolute authority over the youngsters, although he now has the hots for Maria's mother (Ann Morgan Guilbert, aka Millie on "The Dick Van Dyke Show"). Kevin Pollak and Daryl Hannah also reprise their roles from the original...ah, and there's that fish.All in all, a fairly interesting movie. Not any kind of masterpiece, but it showed that Lemmon and Matthau still had it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>GRUMPY OLD MEN (3 outta 5 stars)GRUMPIER OLD MEN (2 outta 5 stars)I dunno why I even bothered to watch the second one. Oh, I guess because it was on cable TV shown as a double bill with the original "Grumpy Old Men". I liked the original when I first saw it. It was not the best work by the Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau team... but it had its moments... these two actors could probably read pages from the phone book to each other and still make it funny. Unfortunately, the sequel has even FEWER of those moments. Still, I maintain that no movie with either Lemmon OR Matthau in it can be *totally* worthless. This is probably as close as they ever got, though. (Bear in mind that I have not yet seen their last movie together, "The Odd Couple II".) Practically the same plot as the first movie... Lemmon and Matthau play lifelong acquaintances and next door neighbors who are constantly bickering about fish and/or women. Burgess Meredith plays Lemmon's FATHER... and if you find old people talking dirty hilarious then you'll probably love his scenes (especially in the closing credits outtakes). Ann Margaret and Sophia Loren play the women in the grumpy guys' lives... hard to imagine that women as attractive as they still are would want anything to do with these two old dorks but, hey... I guess pickings are slim after 65.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies of 1995!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed this outing, but I can readily understand all the negative reviews. Let's face it: The appeal of any movie depends almost entirely on the age of the person watching it, and there is absolutely nothing in this movie that would appeal to teenagers and people in their twenties, thirties, forties and possibly fifties. In fact, not only does the movie have no appeal to these groups, the vast majority would actually hate it. But I found this film most entertaining. And it was good to see Sophia Loren looking so alluring. I'll admit Ann-Margret wasn't quite so startlingly sexy, but she was still looking quite attractive. I wouldn't mind a date with her myself! I'd also admit that Walter Matthau tended to way over-act, but that's Walter Matthau. He always over-acts. That's his shtick! Director Howard Deutch did a pretty good job, though he tended to use far too many close-ups and was way, way over-fond of unflattering shots of Walter Matthau. I might be wrong, but at a guess, I would say his training was in TV. As a general rule, TV directors seem unable to shake off their training when they move over to the big screen.</fullReview>

This time, Max finds romance when he meets Maria Ragetti (Loren), an Italian widow who moves into town and opens a restaurant. Jacob (Pollack) and Melanie (Hannah) are also engaged and things starts a bit difficult for them that makes their dads feud with each other, but only temporarily. The late, Meredith also returns as John's father and this was his final film. This is a good sequel and like the first film, it provides laughs and bit of heartfelt moments as well.

		<fullReview>Fun story of two older men who never quite outgrew boyhood, and the ladies they love.What a treat to see two master actors, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, working with silly material and enjoying every minute of it.The lady loves, Ann Margret and the ever-sexy and dazzling Sophia Loren, do equally well with a lightweight, sometimes over-the-top script. The principals are aided by a uniformly fine supporting cast, including Burgess Meredith as the Lemmon character's outrageously lecherous dad, and Ann Morgan Guilbert as Sophia's feisty mama. The older players' interaction is a delight.My only quibble with this film is the fact that Meredith's character dies without getting married like everyone else. Why? I wondered whether Meredith had perhaps expired during filming, but, according to Wikipedia, the actor lived a whole two years following this movie's release! The original film, "Grumpy Old Men," takes place during a picturesque Minnesota winter, with snow used to charming effect. The follow-up capitalizes on a Midwestern summer. Like apples and oranges, both productions satisfy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>charming and funny light romantic comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It may be just me but I found Grumpier Old Men way way better than Grumpy Old Men. I laughed more and got involved in the plot much more. That it is totally 100% predictable every step of the way is only one of its charms... its how you get there where the fun is. And these actors turn in surprisingly memorable performances for such a slight film. I thought Sophia Loren turned in one of her most charming and funny performances, as did everyone else. The story was just more interesting and three dimensional than the first film and flowed more organically.The story line is simple ancient classic romantic comedy that these veterans had done so many times, it seemed for them like doing a well-known dance. The fun is not in surprises but in going through the old steps with joy. The actors move through their paces with simplicity and enthusiasm and the film actually captures very well the effects of love.The whole film hangs together and works in a way that, for me, the first one didn't. It gets airborne. It deserves a higher ranking than my seven except the story is a little too well-worn. It also allows the two protagonists to get a little more real with each other.Even the three charismatic animal actors get caught up in the spirit of fun.One thing about the film that gave me trouble was that all four women being courted in the film are talented, accomplished, strong and magnificent while all four of the men are hamstrung. I found it mysterious that these women, dropped by some miracle into this tiny town, would be so strongly attracted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's just possible that the intention was to shoot four Grumpy Old Men titles featuring the four seasons because after the Winter setting of the first one we are now in Summer though theoretically such a cycle should have begun with Spring and ended with Winter so maybe the cyclical thing was an afterthought. Whatever we have virtually the same cast doing virtually the same thing with one absentee and two replacements one of which, Anna Guilbert is actually a native of Minneapolis adding a touch of authenticity. If it was unrealistic that Ann Margaret - who, after all, was teaching English at university and would by definition have access to dozens of eligible males - would marry Jack Lemmon in the first film it is equally unrealistic that Sophia Loren would wed Walter Mattheau here other than for feelgood reasons. On the other hand it's probably churlish to nitpick in this way when the film is only intended to entertain. Which it does.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a rare sequel. Wait a minute, sequels aren't rare. Well, that's true, but a *good* sequel is rare. Most of the time, sequels aren't even in the same league as the originals. However, due to excellent writing, a superb cast and great direction, this film is every bit as enjoyable as Grumpy Old Men. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau made several films together and they worked together extremely well. The gorgeous Ann Margaret reprises her role from the first film and is now Lemmon's wife. A new lady hits town and Matthau is very interested. This lovely creature is played by Sophia Loren, who is still stunningly beautiful. Burgess Meredith is great as Grandpa. The stellar cast ensures great acting. However, this film is also written such that there is literally a laugh nearly every minute. I found the film to be highly enjoyable and I recommend it to anyone who needs a laugh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At my age, I had not seen most of Walter &amp; Jack's previous films together.It was this film &amp; the original were great.Great fun seeing the Max &amp; John characters going after each other.Daryl, who I am NOT a fan of, dull in the character.The down point to the film was this side track story on getting the 2 adult children to marry.Scenes you can replay is always a plus to me in a film."Catfish hunter".Sophia's character was good, at least smart, but the OVER marriage story line too much.The death of the "Grandpa" character was sad. His character was funny in both films.Like seeing the bloopers at the end of the film.Those were very good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are still the grumpy old men in this lovely sequel.John Gustafson (Lemmon) is still happily married to Ariel(Ann-Margret).But Max Goldman's (Matthau) only joy in his life is fishing with no woman.But things start chancing to Goldman with the new comer in town.Sophia Loren plays an Italian waitress called Maria Ragetti.Loren is hot in her role.Too bad she's too old for me. The late Burgess Meredith can still be seen as Grandpa Gustafson.And he's not leaving without romance either.He finds the romance with Mama Ragetti (Ann Morgan Guilbert).Kevin Pollak and Daryl Hannah are also replacing their roles.Grumpier Old Men from 1995 is a lovely romantic comedy with the brilliant comedy couple Mr Lemmon and the late Mr Matthau.These two know how to make you laugh.And who could forget Burgess Meredith as the grumpiest old man.This movie offers you lots of great moments.Many moments of laughs.Grumpier Old Men is a must see for the fans of Lemmon and Matthau.They won't let you down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented both Grumpy Old Men and Grumpier Old Men back to back, so I could see both instead of my normal rent one sequel at a time ordeal. I just finished Grumpier Old Men this morning and was expecting a modest sequel, but it turned into a great sequel, pretty much to the point where I enjoyed Grumpier Old Men to Grumpy Old Men. Despite the fact that they use some old jokes, this was a fun plot and I thought the guys have gotten even funnier, including John's father, he's a little dirty, but so much fun to laugh at.John and Max are now best friends again and couldn't be happier with each other, their son and daughter are about to get hitched, and they are overwhelming with the wedding plans. Max is starting to get lonely though, since Chuck has passed on, the bait shop is given to two older Italian women, one lady, Maria, starts a little feud with Max wanting to turn the bait shop into a restaurant. But their anger turns into a hidden passion and they end up falling head over heals for each other, but Maria has some hidden skeletons in her closet.Grumpier Old Men is proof that you are never too old to fall in love or have your heart broken again. It was so sweet seeing Max fall in love with Maria, I loved their passion for each other, it was so fun to watch. John's father and Maria's mother were just so awesome and funny, they had such great chemistry! I would highly recommend Grumpier Old Men, it's a great comedy that once again touches your heart and tickles your funny bone.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A vibrant sequel that's still underwhelming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always loved Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. They seem to work perfectly together, and with a better script, this movie could be gold. We are taken back to Minnesota to re-visit the old grumps who now have to plan a wedding for their very plain and very boring children. There's a reason Kevin Pollack and Darryl Hannah have never had substantial film careers- they're very uninteresting actors. But I digress.If "Grumpy Old Men" built up it's laughs, "Grumpier Old Men" topples them down. The best moments of both films are when Lemmon and Matthau trade vicious insults at one another, and also play pranks on each other. But when this is taken away, we're suffering every old cliché in the book, including Walter's tiresome 'Wholey Moley' line which is used so much, it could be taken into context for a Shot Party (take a shot every time Matthau 'Wholey Moley''s himself).The other problem with this series is the fact that gorgeous women fall for these two farts. Roger Ebert made a very valid point in his review for this film- first Ann-Margaret moves into the neighborhood and marries Jack Lemmon. Now the even more gorgeous Sophia Loren has set her sights on the incredibly unattractive Matthau. And why? For concepts in the plot. There's no reason a woman as beautiful and intelligent as Loren would fall for the dull and disgusting figure Matthau is. I know this is a comedy, but come on now! All in all this sequel is peppier and a little more fun then the original, but both movies suffer from overblown dramatic passages that are not needed. We want to see the old guys go at it, not Kevin Pollack and Darryl Hannah. I laughed a lot at this movie- mostly at the incredibly underrated Bergis Meredith as the foul-mouthed Grandpa. Since all three main actors have passed, we'll never see them again. At least Margaret and Loren are still alive and kicking. I'd love to see their movie: "Grumpy Old Widows".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loren is still hot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Grumpy old men was an OK comedy with a nice performance by Ann-Margret, but otherwise forgettable.This film, on the other hand, has some real comic touches that actually also have something to say about the aging process - and life really doesn't end until it ends.But first the bad news: Daryl Hannah. I've liked her in other films, but she is so flat in this, she's a distraction. She doesn't have the feel for these characters, not even her own, and so doesn't quite fit. She's not even credible as the mother of the young girl who is so important in her relationship to great=grand-dad Burgess Meredith. There must have been some plot device they could have come up with to leave her out of the picture altogether; oh, well.Now the really good news: Sophia Loren. I admit I have always had a crush on her since I saw Houseboat as a kid; and when I saw the shower scene in Arabesque, i couldn't sleep for a week.Her performance here is splendid (romantic comedy is one of her strengths, after all), but the really really good news is that she was past sixty when she made this film, and she looks hot enough to burn a young man's fingers! Really - if I'd been Walter Matthau in that bar scene, I'd have gone out with a heart-attack right there - and smiling.With an adequate script, and such superb actors, Deutsch wisely lets the formula roll on without interference. Consequently, whatever the short-comings there's plenty to remember fondly from this film.Oh, and don't miss the blooper-reel that runs under the final credits - Matthau and Meredith are having a grand old time.Oh, and Sophia Loren is still hot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic sequel, better than 1st-Farewell to Burgess Meredith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I am most amazed about viewing this site are the ridiculous comments bashing really good movies. This movie is really funny with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthew in prime form. Ann Margaret is back playing Jack's wife and Sophia Loren is sexy and funny playing Maria Righetti who wants to open a restaurante in place of the beloved bait shop that has been there for years. The boys use every trick in the book to try to stop this restaurante from opening and Walter Matthew falls in love with her in spite of himself. Burgess Meredith is hilarious as usual playing horny Grandpa Gustafson (Lemmon's dad)and the scene at the grocery store where he is comparing cucumber sizes with Maria's mom is classic. Also, where he is sitting at the restaurant, getting loaded with Mama Rigetti and "putting the make" on her is also funny stuff. For those of you who were bored stiff with this movie I say you are definitely a hard audience to please because I thought this movie was very funny and better than the 1st --8.5 out of 10 for a comedy. I think this was Burgess Meredith's final movie made prior to his death and if so, this was a fine way to finish a great career!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a bad sign when the credits of a film are funnier than the film itself (especially when said film is billed as a comedy). Grumpier Old Men suffers from this condition. If you sit through the film, be sure to treat yourself to the credits, which contains some of the funniest outtakes I have ever heard. The film itself isn't perticularly bad or good. More of the same from the first. The relationships aren't really explored, it's just more kooky hijinks from some old guys.</fullReview>

A reviewer in the SF Chronicle wrote later that she said she had had no "touch- ups", and if so then "her genes need investigating."I remember her many films where her beauty was so natural that it was a wonder any man could concentrate on his lines. She never traded on it, but on her talent as an actress.Carlo Ponti was a lucky man: beauty without guile, talent without pretense.Italian pizza were like street food. When she heard we had so many pizza parlors, she thought we must be a poor country. Then she visited, and dined on American pizza. She reconsidered, gracefully and graciously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this bright sequel to "Grumpy Old Men" we find John (Jack Lemmon) and Max (Walter Matthau) at it again. The rivalry never stops. This time, they are bickering over their children's nuptials, almost causing a wedding not to occur.Sophia Loren co-stars as Maria in this foray into the land of 10,000 lakes as the new girl in town that Max has an eye for. At first, they both hate one another because she is turning his beloved tackle shop into a restaurant. Comedy ensues as Max and John both try to get the restaurant shut down and condemned.Eventually, as in the first film, love finds a way. However, sadness veils over as well when Burgess Meredith's character dies. Other than that, the film is very enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has some of the funniest lines and it's a great comedy. One would probably think, even I, thought that this would probably happen between two older men who fight about the obvious: women, fish and each other. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are a perfect pair. Even though it's a comedy, the romance in it is on the clean side. Nothing too distasteful and the comic relief is still included into the romance, which gives it a continuous comic flow. Even though there is a serious part of the film where John's father passes away, after that scene the film is back to the comic feel, which is nice because there's no dwelling on the sad/serious scene. Nonetheless, this movie is guaranteed to make you laugh hard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This sequel to Grumpy Old Men is as funny as the original. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, and the rest of the cast from the original movie reprise their roles. John and Max are still feuding, but the tension between them has softened. There are, however, some changes: Ariel and John are married and there's a new girl in town named Maria Ragetti. She's moved to Wabasha to open up an Italian restaurant at the former Chuck's Bait place. When the boys discover what Maria's intentions are, they hatch a scheme to ruin the grand opening of the restaurant and try to keep Chuck's business going, even though the inventory of the former business has been cleared out and the interior remodeled to look like an Italian restaurant. Max and Sophia meet, but there's a disagreement about what the place should be. Maria goes to the neighborhood bar to try and reason with Max, but to no avail. It seems as though Max and John have trouble saying goodbye to what is no longer there. The humor between Lemmon and Matthau's characters is still spiced up and is still able to put viewers in stitches. Then, Max and Maria get married, and the restaurant starts selling bait, as well. Great movie, great cast, great fun!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Grumpier Old Men (1995) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Sequel to Grumpy Old Men have Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau returning with more fights and foul language. This time out Lemmon is still happily married but Matthau is on the move and takes a special interest in an Italian woman (Sophia Loren) who has just moved to town. I think the most remarkable thing about this film is how well Loren looked. Even at 61 she's still a head turner and her comic timing isn't too bad either. I'm sure this film was only made because the first one made money but it doesn't really matter as no one should take this too serious as it's just a silly comedy meant to make you laugh. There are plenty of nice laughs here but I don't think it's as good as the original. This certainly isn't in the league as The Odd Couple but we do get a pretty good throwback to that film here as there's a scene where Lemmon has to spend the night with Matthau but can't put up with his dirty house. Ann-Margret returns but is pretty much wasted as is Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak. The perverted Burgess Meredith is back and steals the scene every time he's in it. Both Matthau and Lemmon are naturally very good and they easily slip back into their roles. It's priceless watching the two men work together even when the material isn't as strong as one would hope. Lemmon gets a special notice here due to a very touching scene with Meredith. Another problem is the direction, which has one of those "made for TV" feels to it. In the end this film could have and should have been a lot better but the cast make it worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Howard Deutch decided he wanted to cash in on the success of Grumpy Old Men and it worked. The only problem to the sequel is that some of the cast seem to be a bit bored by the proceedings. The one liners are enough to make you drop your popcorn.Walter Mathau and Jack Lemmon are a joy to watch as they continue to find ways to drive each other over the edge into insanity. And yet Deutch calms that insanity by giving us a quick glimpse into just how much these two men mean to each other when Jack's dad played by Burgess Meredith dies. Lemmon and Mathau are still at the top of their game in this film. In this film the Ann Margaret character is suppose to be the rock, the sound of reason, the calm in the midst of the storm. You believe she is until she has the insanity thrust upon her and is forced to react. For the most part Ann Margaret as well as Daryl Hannah seem bored throughout the entire film. Kevin Pollack is just as good in this sequel as in the original. Burgess Meredith is the scene stealer, he manages with dead pan accuracy to deliver some of the best one liners in the film. Ann Morgan Guilbert manages to match Burgess with her ability to respond to his one liners with shock and outrage befitting her character. And then you come to Sophia. Sophia is in her comfort zone here. Sophia is comfortable with the slapstick comedy and relishes it, she's in the movie, she's not walking through it. She's absolutely stunning to watch but at the same time she adds to the moment. She's as glamorous as ever but it doesn't get in the way.All in all a good follow up to the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>[CONTAINS SPOILERS] John Gustafson and Max Goldman are back in their first adventure since their last. It's six months later and they're still fishing. All the snow has melted and the neighborhood looks very different. The boys are out to catch a giant legendary fish they've heard tell about. These men would soon discover big changes happening. Like, their friend Chuck, who died in the last adventure, had operated the baitshop. Ever since his demise, it's been empty, but some people have come with plans to turn it into a ristorante (restaurant). They are: Mama Regetti and daughter Maria. John and Max don't want that to happen so they pull numerous pranks on the Regettis but they still won't leave. Jacob Goldman and Melanie Gustafson contemplate matrimony.But have their doubts when their fathers insist on planning the event. But when the kids decide the wedding is off, John and Max are back at it. Pulling all sorts of foolish pranks on one another. Max steals John's outboard motor, John wrecks Max's fish net and has his cat scratch up Max's car seats, but Max sends a big dog through John's house. Ariel decides to leave for a while. John was in a real pickle. He tried asking his father for advice, but he had passed away; Max goes on a date with Maria and they decide they like one another. Pretty soon, it's a wedding day. En route to the church, Max and John decide to fish for the giant musket they're so fond of. They catch it, but John says they must leave it in the lake out of respect for his father, so they do and rush to church. It looks like the wedding of Jacob and Melanie, but it isn't. They eloped. It's the wedding of Max and Maria. John planted Max's dog in the limo as they drive off. Was this as good as the first? Sure. I'm sorry to say that the three main stars, Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon and Burgess Meredith are no longer with us. Meredith died in 1998, Matthau in 2000 and Lemmon in 2001, which is real sad. So it's guarenteed there will never be an Even Grumpier Old Men or The Odd Couple III. They were really funny men. Why do the good ones always gotta die? But anyway, if you're a fan of these men and you enjoyed the first one, then I recommend Grumpier Old Men!-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the fun of watching Lemmon and Matthau act like kids for less than 2 hours (i.e. from the first movie) I was satisfied, but then due to the success of the first movie the producers decided to give it another twirl, this time the story had the two starting off as friends thanks to the incidents that happened in the ending of the first film, but then some really really idiotic stupid reason, they were at it again.The movie was not funny as it was like a replay of the first, same pranks, similar plot and screenplay made this movie a waste of time. After getting a mate for John, they (the producers) decided to get a mate for Max, with nothing to write home about but a lame script that just showed no finesse or true plan, just the producers hoping to bank on the success of the previous movie.The main disappointment in the movie for me was Sophia Loren; her acting was just too weak for me to understand that she is a star. Everybody else in the movie even Burgess Meredith (who had Alzheimer's disease and this was his last motion picture appearance) was impressive, at least that I can give them. The movie is directed this time by Howard Deutch, who later worked with the duo in 1998 for Odd Couple II, Deutch other movies also have not been well received like Getting Even with Dad (1994) and The Whole Ten Yards (2004), which are basically the reason why I will not bother seeing My Best Friend's Girl.The movie plot carries on 6 months after the incidents of the first, where both John (Lemmon) and Max (Matthau) were getting prepared for the wedding of their children. Then a new arrival in town a beautiful lady by the name of Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) came in to change things by turning the towns bait shop to a restaurant.John and Max join forces to try and run the new lady out of town, but the issues between John and Max's children marriage plan caused both to reignite their feud as both refused to believe that their child was at fault.Only the ladies are alive till today (February 2013), as both Lemmon and Matthau died like half a decade after this movie release. Grumpier Old Men was a box office success in its own part, but a huge critical disappointment, as the movie cost 10 million dollars less than its predecessor and made like a million more in the box office.After you have seen the first there is basically no point why you should bother seeing this one, because it will stand in my mind as one movie I credit as a waste of time and talent.www.lagsreviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Performances In A Disappointingly Unoriginal Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To make a good sequel requires a very delicate balancing act that few film-makers seem able to pull off. On the one hand, because it is a sequel, there has to be enough connection with the previous movie to give the viewer a sense of familiarity with what's happening. On the other hand, there has to be enough originality to the story to make the sequel worth watching. Unfortunately, "Grumpier Old Men" seems to fail the originality test. Having said that, this isn't a bad movie. Filled with a galaxy of old pros, it couldn't be. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, Sophia Loren, Burgess Meredith ? these actors know what they're doing and they know how to hold a movie together. They do that here. The performances are excellent, and the movie's worth watching just to see the teamwork among them. It's in the story where things fall down.You can only watch a couple of old men insult each other for so long before it becomes tiresome. John (Lemmon) and Max (Matthau) already spent the entire first movie doing that. "Grumpy Old Men" was a very funny movie, but listening to them call each other "Putz" and "Moron" has lost its appeal, quite frankly. Like the previous movie, the men of Wabasha are fixated on fishing, and they're still intent on catching "Catfish Hunter" ? a giant catfish who lives in the lake. Like the original, a beautiful woman (Loren) shows up in town and distracts everyone from the fishing business at hand. It all seems too familiar. Then, where there does seem to be promising originality, it ends up not being sufficiently developed.I thought that the budding romance between John's dad (Meredith) and Maria's mother (Ann Guilbert) had comedic potential, but the two ended up only having 2 or 3 scenes together, and the "stop the restaurant" campaign could have been (and seemed for a moment as if it was going to be) the comedic centrepoint of the movie, but in the end, all we got was about 10 minutes of what were essentially vignettes of the various things John and Max tried to do to stop Maria. The romance between Max and Maria was not as interesting as the competition for Ariel (Ann-Margret) in the first movie, because there wasn't any competition for Max, and the other highlighted story was the romance between Jacob (Kevin Pollak) and Melanie (Darryl Hannah), and, to be honest, I just didn't care much about them.I give the movie credit for the wedding twist at the end which I have to confess I didn't see coming, and the cast did a great job. Unfortunately they can only work with the story they're given, but on the strength of the good performances, I'll rate this as 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grumpier Old Men (1995) **1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More of the same for those who enjoyed the first film, nothing great but a decent time killer. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau return in their twilight years as the ever-battling duo, but this time with the added attraction of Sophia Loren who still looks gorgeous at age 60. She winds up posing a threat to their favorite bait and tackle shop when she decides to take it over and turn it into an Italian restaurant. Since Lemmon's already got sexy Ann-Margret as his hot girlfriend, Sophia hits it off with old man Matthau (ah, the magic of movies), who does not look as good for his age (75). Burgess Meredith is better used in this one in his role as Lemmon's naughty old pop. **1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grumpy, but not funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What, I wonder, does the legendary Billy Wilder think of this film starring Lemmon and Matthau, the great team he so memorably paired in 1966's "The Fortune Cookie"? Wilder's film is a dark, cynical satire, and was the first of what is now seven films starring the pair. Seven films, but only two of them--"The Fortune Cookie" and "The Odd Couple"--are genuinely funny efforts showcasing these actors' combined talents. "Grumpy Old Men" was mildly amusing due less to the script than to the welcome return of Lemmon and Matthau who hadn't been on screen together in 12 years. The unexpected box-office bonanza naturally inspired a sequel, but all this equally lucrative outing has in its favor is a brief monologue by Burgess Meredith who, as Lemmon's 95-year-old father, boasts of eating bacon and smoking Camels while the "experts" who warned against such vices are taking a "dirt nap." Not even Lemmon and Matthau can enliven the script by Mark Steven Johnson this time around. The curmudgeonly Matthau admitted he didn't lke the script for the first film but did it to work with Lemmon, and that the only reason he did the sequel is because the first film was a hit. No doubt, "Grumpiest Old Men," the inevitable sequel, will be just as dreary. If these pictures make big bucks, why tamper with the formula? Why hire Billy Wilder to punch up the quality when the public seems content merely to see Lemmon and Matthau rather than see them at their best?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The good, the bad, and the just plain miserable...again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not uncommon for a movie sequel to do little to the formula that made its predecessor so financially (and hopefully critically) successful. The old "if it ain't broke don't fix it" method of filmmaking has been used in the Hangover, Home Alone, and Taken franchise to only modest success in terms of quality. However, in Grumpier Old Men, the sequel to the fine comedy Grumpy Old Men, handles the rehashed formula better than many film sequels do.While I'm getting to sound repetitive and out of descriptive words, this is largely because of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau's chemistry together on-screen. From the moment they appear, it's almost impossible to believe the men's friendship in real life wasn't lifelong and consisted largely of playful torment, vulgarity, and several boys nights out. Had the film been a sequel with few returning cast members (say Lemmon and Matthau were substituted by two other actors), this sequel would've likely been a somber affair to view.In a way, I'm thankful the town of Wabasha Minnesota hasn't really changed much since our last outing, with the exception of John Gustafson (Jack Lemon) marrying Ariel (Ann-Margret) from the original film. In the meantime, John's dad still lives off a diet of beer, cigarettes, and bacon and Max Goldman (Walter Matthau), John's cantankerous neighbor, still finds himself engaging in petty neighborhood battles with John about outwitting the other man. However, the big ordeal this time is not competing for a new neighbor's love but trying to save a local bait shop from becoming a "restaurante" for Italian cuisine. The restaurant is managed by Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren), a gorgeous but uncompromisingly strict woman who catches the eye of Max even as him and Jack plan to foil the restaurant's forthcoming prosperity.Other events (aka subplots) occurring in Wabasha are the wedding between Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollak) John's daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah), a plot which would later be used by the same director Howard Deutch in The Odd Couple II, also starring Lemmon and Matthau, along with John trying to get his father (Burgess Meredith in his final role, which was burdened by spouts with Alzheimer's and difficultly remembering lines, some female company as he gets older. One of Grumpier Old Men's immediate issues is that there is simply too much going on between plot-strands that involve marriage/romance troubles (I counted four including John's brief trouble with Ariel later in the movie) ad others that involve trying to sabotage the bait-shop-turned-restaurant.Grumpier Old Men may have too many new ideas for cutesy subplots, but it keeps the tone and feel of its predecessor alive and well. It still feels like Wabasha is the location of a sitcom with its oddball situations that seem to consistently bear hefty consequences for its residents, but its characters still feel like real people we've come to known and care about.Unsurprisingly, Lemmon and Matthau share unbelievable conversational beauty in the way they engage in simple discussions that seem to constantly end in uproariously funny bickering. Once you minimize your focus on that aspect in the film, you have just an average comedy that, while charming and pleasantly safe (a good and bad quality for this particular kind of picture), is just grateful to be buoyed by two very talented leading men.Starring: Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, Kevin Pollak, Daryl Hannah, Sophia Loren, and Burgess Meredith. Directed by: Howard Deutch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>" --- a welcomed gift of laughter --- "</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the trailing credits rolled for "Grumpier Old Men," I remember exiting the theater in 1995, noticeably dismayed and thinking, "wow --- a whole movie devoted to recitation of colorful metaphors for the male reproductive organ --- by winners of real Academy Awards - FOR ACTING! The pricey cast includes paired couples, Ann-Margaret and Jack Lemmon, Ann Guilbert and Burgess Meredith, Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollack, and Sophia Loren and Walter Matthau.Although I did not see "Grumpy Old Men," the core of the cast and original storyline continue in "Grumpier Old Men," which is upbeat, outrageous, and a bit smug in never having to say, "prostate." It does have a plot (more than collecting social security benefits), with three principal areas of contention:A. Lemmon (John Gustafson) and Matthau (Max Goldman) are retired neighbors and fishing cronies, A(1) vying for fabled and elusive "Catfish Hunter" (not the Oakland As pitcher) -- a well-traveled fishing story to establish the basic plot. And, A(2) there is an inter-family wedding (Hannah and Pollack), as a sidebar.B. Sophia Loren (Maria Ragetti) and her mother, Ann Guilbert ("Mama"), have purchased Chuck's Bait Shop, located on one of Minnesota's 10,000 lakes (home of Catfish Hunter), to convert it into an Italian restaurant. Lemmon and Matthau try to stop the change. In the process B(1), Loren and Matthau feud personally, with predictable results; and B(2), a defiant Guilbert is courted by Meredith (John's father, "Grandpa") -- with surprising and entertaining results.C. But the film's major conflict is -- will the on-camera crew (Lemmon, Matthau, Meredith, et al.) or the off-camera crew (the director, writers, etc.) gain control of the script and film?My very recent initiation to videos is the outcome of assuming the task of finding tasteful, G-rated, family entertainment for my 88-year old mother. In addition to ordering DVDs via the internet, I also rummage the bargain bins at Walmart -- "Grumpier Old Men" came home with me by mistake. Much to my chagrin, Mom loves the film (it must be due to her hearing loss), and replays it often. BOTTOM LINE: "Grumpier Old Men," with PG-13 rating, questionable taste, and pricey cast, rallies from the bargain bin for decisive, popular victory -- well intentioned, fuddy-duddy son seeks refuge deep in the bargain bin.Buy this video for your mothers and fathers -- it will be a welcomed gift of laughter for aging parents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Poor Sequel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All the key players return in this thin sequel to the box office winner from 1993. The two titled characters (Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau) once again cause trouble for each other and once again their lives are turned upside down when a cold Italian beauty (Sophia Loren) moves to their Minnesota town. A silly little film whose plot is never too interesting. Lemmon's and Matthau's talents seem wasted in this disappointment. 2 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is it better than original?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is this movie better than the original? Perhaps. It's probably funnier than the original. Walter Matthau's pick-up line is one of the funniest things of the movie. But is it better than the original? The original had more of the emotions of Lemmon and Matthau as they fought. This one has less feuding (but still has some of the old pranks) and more focus on the family / dating relationships of the old men.This movie is funny and definitely worth watching. You'll have to decide on your own if it's better than the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grumpier than the First = Worse than the First.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Grumpy Old Men" didn't work for two reasons. One, it was an unfortunate shouting match cashing in on the film's stars' earlier coupling, "The Odd Couple," and without witty material like their original pairing, the film sank low. Two, it was boring.Now we have a sequel, even worse than the original. It is all about Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon arguing, still, after the mutal agreement at the end of the original. But this time they are arguing because Lemmon's daughter (Daryl Hannah) and Matthau's son (Kevin Pollack) are gettin' hitched. This is bad for the two men, because that means they will be loosely related, I suppose. Anywho, they bicker some more, and we see Jack Lemmon posing nude in one scene (carefully covered by the camera), which I could live for the rest of my life without seeing.They are also arguing because Matthau is in love with a new Italian woman (Sophia Loren) who has just moved in, opening up a restaurant taking place of "Chuck's Bait Shop." The inhabitants of Grump Land don't like this, because the customers will scare away the fish, so they start pulling mean tricks and pranks on poor Sophia."Grumpier Old Men" is the name of this film, as if you didn't already know, and it truly is grumpier. It's worse than the first (hey, that ryhmes) and as I snored I was bored at the sight of this tripe that has scarred my brain for the rest of my life. If you didn't pick up on that sentence, this is what I'm saying: this film is an utter bore from beginning to end, with basically no laughs. At all.And something else worth noting: Isn't it funny how out of all the eligible bachelors out there, the women in the "Grumpy Old Men" films seem to go straight for the oldest men in town? Walter Matthau is in his seventies here, and the woman he's dating is about forty-something. It's even worse than Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones' relationship--Grump relationships are an outrage! Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are a good comic pairing, but as I said in my review of "Grumpy Old Men," film executives seem to see "The Odd Couple" as a shouting match, when it was so much more. So now studio execs seem to think that if they get these two actors to shout on screen, the film will be good. Wrong! The charm of their "Odd Couple" pairing was due to deep, three-dimensional characters, witty dialogue and tons of laughs. Here we just get shouting, and that's the film's major flaw.2/5 stars -John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the old men are back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this sequel life goes on much as it usually does in Wabasha County, Minnesota, with the only notable differences being that John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) and Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) are getting along all right, and that John's marriage to free-spirited Ariel (Ann-Margret) is working out quite nicely. John and Max's great obsession in life remains fishing, and both are vying to reel in a trophy fish that local anglers have been trying to catch for ages. Max is outraged when Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) and her mother Francesca (Ann Morgan Guilbert) arrive in town and take over the local bait and tackle shop, only to announce that they're going to close it down and open an Italian restaurant in its place. Max goes to remarkable lengths to foil Maria's plans, but John thinks that his friend needs a wife, and that Max and Maria might make a good match. Grandpa Gustafson (Burgess Meredith) seems to think he'd be a good mate for Francesca, but then again he's not known for being very fussy about women. John's daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah) and Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollak) are trying to work out their own plans to get married, and they might just make it to the altar if John and Max can stop interfering. Grumpier Old Men wouldn't be nothing without the two legends Jack Lemon and Walter Matthau they are classic as the two old grumps, I will sure will miss their works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OLDER, HORNIER AND STILL FRUSTRATED IN MINNESOTA</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Grumpier Old Men' is a film that is a sequel to `Grumpy Old Men.' Reprising their original roles are Jack Lemmon as John Gustafson, Walter Matthau as Max Goldman, Ann Margaret as Ariel, Burgess Meredith as John's father, Kevin Pollock and Darryl Hannah as the children of Max and John. They are still next-door neighbors, only now the feud has subsided. Their children are living across the street in Ariel's house. The marriage of their children is on the horizon. The setting for this film is summer and fall in Minnesota. Fishing is still the main sport where `Catfish Hunter' is still the elusive prize. The bait shop on the lake has been closed since Chuck passed away. It is now under new management. John and Max are anxiously waiting the reopening. To their surprise, it is not being reopened as a bait shop, but a ristorante (restaurant). Here enters Sophia Loren as the new proprietress Maria Sophia Calotti Ragetti. Ann Guilbert who plays her mother joins her. When Max and John find out the new plans for their favorite bait shop, they set out to undermine her plans for a grand opening. A series of misunderstandings set off a domino effect that touches everyone's lives. New loves are found and an old feud is rekindled. All of the same emotions that were in the previous film are in this film. There is laughter, sadness, anger and happiness. Catfish Hunter makes his film debut, which, in essence, puts a `face' with a name. His film appearance pays credence to the fact that he is a `real' fish and not just a myth. The acting in this film is superb both by human and non-human.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grumpier Old Men Too Sedate *</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau were an excellent team, they bombed in this film but good.What's so grumpy about Lemmon in this film? The prequel was much better.Ann Guilbert, as Sophia Loren's mother, is given little to do. Remember her as the grandmother to "The Nanny?" Sophia Loren, other than marrying Matthau, is also give nothing to do. Ditto for Ann-Margret, Darryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak, all of whom were so good in the original but are reduced to practically nothing here.I also resent Matthau, who shows off his part-Jewish heritage marrying in a church at the end. I found this to be offensive. Sorry, but that's the way I am-old fashioned. To all those criticize me for the last statement, how would you have felt if the Matthau-Loren nuptials had taken place in a synagogue? While I realize that this was a comedy, this still left me with a bad taste in my mouth. A non-religious setting would have been the only solution to this.</fullReview>
