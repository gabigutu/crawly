		<shortDescription>Very underrated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not often writing critics on IMDb, but when i checked the page of this movie I was really surprised that there were so few reviews.I must confess that I haven't heard anything about this movie before I read that there will be free theater screenings of "Kill the Irishman" in my hometown. As far as i know, the film also had a very limited theater release in the USA, which is a sad thing because this movie was surprisingly good and well-crafted and was one of the best films I've seen in the last months.The film tells the true story of Danny Greene, a tough irish gangster - and let me tell you, it is definitely a story worth telling.I guess many of you are informed about the story of Danny Greene, so i won't go further into the story.The movie features an impressive cast including Ray Stevenson, Val Kilmer, Christopher Walken and many other familiar faces known from other mob movies. Ray Stevenson gives an incredibly good performance as Danny Greene and manages to keep his character really violent, but also likable. This movie could give him a career boost for bigger roles.The direction and the cinematography are very nice and i'm hoping this movie will enable Jonathan Hensleigh more work soon, because he's definitely a talented craftsman.In some reviews i read that other people complained that this movie is just a ripoff of Goodfellas. That isn't true. The movie stands well on his own, despite featuring some actors known from Goodfellas, and wasn't that also the case in Shows like The Sopranos? Why complain about that? And last but not least, it IS a true story and who grows sick of seeing good mobster movies? Definitely not me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An exciting ride!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review by Ruby: If you are reading this, you have probably read the background info about The Irishman Danny Greene and his Italian buddy John Nardi who worked and broke the law many times over in the streets of Cleveland throughout the 1970s. In addition to Greene and Nardi, many of the cast members were familiar "mob types," and testosterone was practically flying off the screen in the midst of bravado, fistfights, gunfire, and countless explosions. But there was an actual story to follow also, so it offered more substance than much of the drivel that manages to run in the theatres today.Even though they were gangsters, Greene and Nardi were surprisingly likable characters?for killers, that is?mostly because of the charismatic acting of the two leads, Ray Stevenson and Vincent D'Onofrio. The supporting characters were interesting also, including the talents of Christopher Walken, Val Kilmer, Steve Schirripa, Paul Sorvino, Tony Lo Bianco, and Mike Starr.Interspersed with the actors' scenes were actual clips of film footage from local newscasts of the day, which added authenticity and a touchstone to the amazing story that unfolded in Cleveland some 30-40 years ago.I highly recommend "Kill the Irishman" as an action-packed, escapist, period piece, featuring superior acting and excellent film editing. It was a thoroughly enjoyable 100+ minutes!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kill an Irishman- Based on a true story but even that is a half-truth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The author of the book in which the movie is based has a unique insight, he's a cop, his family was part of the old "mustache pete" mafia. the book and the movie, demonstrate in realistic detail just how far the Mafia has declined in the post golden era of the 50s and 60's. One Irishman, with the help of an old Mafia associate, showed the world just how incompetent the mob had become in Cleveland and elsewhere. The movie deftly shows that level of incompetence.Ray Stevenson does a credible job as Irish Danny Green and Vincent D'Onforio is even better as the conflicted John Nardi. Christopher Walken is barely visible as Shonder Burns. Tony Lo Bianco does a great job of a weak, indecisive mob boss who just can't get it right.The movie is burdened with low production value, but the story is true. And the life they highlight deserves low production value. Anyone who compares this to Goodfellows or the Soprano's is out of touch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deserved a bigger budget</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kill the Irishman tells the story of Danny Greene and his rise from rags to riches through the mob and their many attempts at killing him. Being of Irish decent, the aspect of this one Irish guy who kept getting on the Italian mob's nerves, it peaked my interest. The film has a great story to tell and I can only imagine how amazing the film would have been if they had a director like Martin Scorsese behind the camera. That's what I kept feeling while I watched this film, that it was a Scorsese wannabe. That's not exactly a bad thing, because I did enjoy the film, but I wanted to enjoy it so much more. There are aspects of the film that are great and if a masterful craftsman were behind the camera than I can honestly see this film being one of the best of the year. The film feels short on a lot of things, mainly the small things that would have made this film great. The relationship between him and his wife was nonexistent. The smaller characters played by Christopher Walken, Val Kilmer and Vinnie Jones deserved more screen time. There was a relationship between Stevenson and Kilmer that was interesting, as one was a cop and the other a known mobster, but the film decided not to dive any further than two scenes. I hate to throw Goodfellas into the mix, but had the story been crafted more like that film, then this could have been great. The story is based on true events, with some liberties of course. Some of the special effects, like the car bombings are incredibly poor. A story like this deserves a bit more attention to detail from the writer and director. It felt like they loved the story, but didn't know exactly how to tell it. Again, if they had proper backing in the budget department, then this film would have been really great. The car bombing scenes are really poorly done and this is such an integral part of the film. Some of them are actual explosions, others aren't. It's poor production values, stick with the real thing. Kill the Irishman is a good movie when it should be a great movie. In terms of gangster flicks, it's one of the better ones. It's nowhere near the calibre of Goodfellas or Donnie Brasco. It feels like the odd film that wants to be apart of the family. It just falls short of admittance. A good film is good film though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great biography. A must watch for those who savor true drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow..... Wow..... Wow............. I DID NOT EXPECT THAT! I AM STUNNED!The Hunter becomes the Hunted in KILL THE IRISHMAN. In the year 1976 in Cleveland 36 bombs went off but could they get Danny Greene?Based on the life events of Irish American gangster Danny Greene KILL THE IRISHMAN is by far one the most involved movies I have watched of its kind. Danny Greene a gangster from Cleveland in 1970s is a man with pride and honor. Quite unusual traits for a gangster don't you think? Exactly what I did think as well until I completed the whole movie! Danny Greene's story brings to light the hardships that certain people go through to meet their ends in life. Although not most of them are legal methods, sometimes these seem to be the only way out for some of them. Most learned folk at this point would think I am a few screws lose upstairs to agree with an illegal approach to life. I sincerely believe that all humans will tread paths they never would if they too are pushed to extreme limits. This is just me, however I am sure some may feel that to die with hunger is better than steal, try it and let me know! Please note I am not promoting criminals since Danny Greene's revelation is entirely different. Danny Greene earned his bread and butter until the associations abused them and ill-treated them. Danny stood up to them and took over the associations and became a self-found businessman. However when authorities came for him few years later, he did not run, he had the courage to stand up to his faults. Ray Stevenson, Christopher Walken, Vincent D'Onofrio and Val Kilmer bring to life the dark early 1970s of Cleveland. I am impressed of the precision performances. Especially Ray Stevenson, he is amazing and its wise choice by the casting directors to go with an unfamiliar face (although Ray Stevenson has appeared in a fair number of movies) since it's a biography of an actual person. I believe Ray Stevenson fits into the character with ease rather than to have a Hollywood regular play the protagonist. I need not speak about Christopher Walken, you put him in front of a camera and wonders emerge. Val Kilmer's weight does not stop him from slamming a great performance either. Unison is what it is with these men pulling the movie through.A very appropriate and touching soundtrack evokes a great emotion within me. Much like BRAVE HEART or ROBIN HOOD PRINCE OF THIEVES she captures and wraps me with a strange enchantment. It's like a spell, I need to admit there were moments in the early parts of the movie where I did consider switching it off. The interest did not seem to be consistent. In my terms the attention span of the viewer is violated with Jonathan Hensleighs directorial approach. It lost me a few times, however it did not LOSE me. I am having difficulty expressing what I felt, let me try to elaborate. It's like water, tasteless, however after a long night when you wake up dehydrated after one too many drinks, and that one glass of water you have at that point of time is the perfect drink. This is the only way I can bring myself to explain the feeling of this movie.A definite skip for those who look out for action and cleverly choreographed fight sequences. A good one for the mature audience who savor biographies and slow paced dramas.This is how I see it, nothing more nothing less!Title: Kill the Irishman Directed by: Jonathan Hensleigh Starring: Ray Stevenson, Vincent D'Onofrio, Val Kilmer, Robert Davi, Vinnie Jones &amp; Christopher Walken Rated: R for strong violence and some sexual content/nudity Rating: 07/10 106 Minutes</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>B Movie bad-ass Ray Stevenson finally given a chance to shine and show his range!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'KILL THE IRISHMAN': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Another organized crime biopic, this one focuses on the infamous 70's union rep turned gangster Danny Greene. The film stars B movie tough guy (and notable character thug) Ray Stevenson as Greene. It was written (with co-writer Jeremy Walters) and directed by Jonathan Hensleigh and adapted from the book 'To Kill The Irishman' by Rick Porrello. Hensleigh is most well known for writing and co-writing such blockbuster action films as 'DIE HARD: WITH A VENGEANCE' and 'ARMAGEDON'. He also directed the films 'WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE' and 'THE PUNISHER' (which it's sequel, 'PUNISHER: WAR ZONE', starred Stevenson). The film co-stars the likes of Vincent D'Onofrio, Val Kilmer, Christopher Walken, Linda Cardellini, Vinnie Jones, Robert Davi, Paul Sorvino and other well known character actors. It's a little clichéd and by the numbers (it's certainly nothing we haven't seen before in the gangster crime genre) but it is entertaining and interesting to a certain extent, more so than a lot of others in my opinion.Danny Greene was a well known Irish gangster in Cleveland in the 1970's. He started his career in organized crime working as a longshoreman labor union representative until he was busted. He was released in an arrangement that he would turn over any information and evidence he uncovered, in his future crime dealings, to the police (which he did very little of). He was eventually loved and admired by the public (as sort of a modern day Robin Hood) and hated by his criminal rivals. He became famously hard to kill as he continued to miraculously survive many attempts on his life. The film focuses on his relationships with fellow criminal businessmen, including John Nardi (D'Onofrio) and Shondor Birns (Walken), as well as his family, other love interests (Laura Ramsey) and a local cop (Kilmer) he knew since he was a kid.I'm not a big fan of biopics or mobster films like this. I admire the film craftsmanship of popular crime films like 'THE GODFATHER' and 'GOODFELLAS' but they're far from my favorite films. I don't especially like the element that the viewer is left with no one to root for and all of the lead characters are pretty morally despicable (although organized criminals probably have a lot higher standards and respectable moral qualities than most other successful businessman). With that said the film is more fascinating and entertaining than most others of it's type. The actors are all good and well cast, especially Stevenson. He's always been a cool action bad ass in films before but here he's really given a chance to show off his acting abilities and range. His performance combined with Hensleigh's better than average directing make the film one definitely worth checking out. Probably especially if you're a fan of the genre.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHU1MR5VpzY</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Failed Potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It doesn't take much research into the real story of Danny Greene and the Cleveland mob war to recognize that there was potentially a great Mobster movie waiting to be made. This film misses the mark, which is sad, because the players were there to craft something special.The downfall of this film is the script and the way it rushes through time and space without ever focusing enough on the characters and their relationship with each other (and in the case of Greene with society) to really get us connected into the world they inhabit. We see scene after scene that remind us gangster movie staples. Greene beaten by Italian kids as a boy, Greene standing up to the crooked Union leadership, Greene making deals with the mafia, Greene gets a girl and they wind up married, Greene beats up bikers, Greene gets a partner out of hot water and tells him never to gamble again...and duh..he gambles again. Unfortunately, we always stay on the surface of people's motivations as these scenes fly by, we never stop and get a sense of why with the characters. And we never connect with them.The acting is fine, Ray Stevenson's Greene is tough and smart and world-worn, everyone else is fine but they just stay on the periphery and play stock characters who come and go for the most part.If the script had made a choice to either be the story through the eyes of Val Kilmer's Cleveland police detective, or the story through the eyes of Irish Danny Greene, instead of just a linear montage of standard gangster film clichés, we all could have been treated to a top-notch tale.The movie just proves you need a great script to make a great movie, and it didn't have one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great cast, great acting, and an absolute must-see for mafia-philes. Ray Stevenson and Linda Cardellini give exceptional performances as Danny and Joan Greene in this hard hitting story based on his life. Unlike many bio-dramas, this one moves along at a rocket pace, leaving the audience on the edge of their seats. D'Onofrio is exceptional in this role, as is Christopher Walken, and you have to wonder how Stevenson keeps up with such powerful performers, but he does. Lots of favorite character actors dress up this larger than life scenario, including the lovely and always enticing Fionnula Flanagan as the neighbor, Mike Starr as one of Tony Lo Biano's enforcers, and Bob Gunton as the Union President who can't stand on his own. Paul Sorvino gives us the perfect NYC mob boss image and, while his role is brief, it's a performance worth watching. Val Kilmer's role as the police officer who grew up with Greene is subdued, but he carries it off with the right tone and balance to the film. Since a great film always comes down to the director, we have to give Jonathon Hensleigh a resounding round of applause for this fascinating and entertaining portrait of the under-workings of the mob. Rated R for violence, language and sexual situations, if you like films like the Godfather, Goodfellas, Casino, etc, you are going to love this one. And if you are a fan of those, this needs to be added to your collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True story about the man the mob couldn't kill. Very entertaining and good mafia movie, great cast and acting. I say B</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"If any of these maggots from the so-called mafia want to come after me, I'm not a hard man to find." This is the true story of Danny Greene (Stevenson), the man the mob couldn't kill. After an encounter with loan shark Shondor Birns (Walken) ends badly, a $25,000 price is put on his head. The mafia tries everything they can think of, but Danny will not go down without a fight. Being a huge fan of mafia movies, I was really looking forward to this one. While the movie is very good and entertaining, I was a little disappointed. The movie seemed to never keep up a steady pace. Some parts moved very quick and were fun to watch, then the next scene slowed it way down and didn't seem to have any impact. The cast however, makes this movie. There are too many stars to list here but there are about ten known actors that really make this movie as good as it is. If the cast was not what it was this would have been a really bad B movie, but as it stands it is a very entertaining movie to watch. On a side note Val Kilmer is not embarrassing to watch in this (unlike is last 4 or 5 movies). Overall a very good movie, but a tad disappointing. I give it a B.Would I watch again? - I think I would.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Irish mobster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ray Stevenson is Danny Greene, an Irish mobster, active in the Cleveland underworld during the 1970s. Greene started as a union organizer and within a short time, won election to the presidency of the longshoreman's guild, which he ruled with an iron fist. He was eventually an FBI informant and was a Mafia enforcer at the same time.Greene became entangled with the traditional Italian-American La Cosa Nostra with his own crew of criminals who ran gambling operations in competition with the already established gangsters. A series of bomb explosions made Cleveland one of the most violent American cities of the era.The movie is brutal but also has great wit and Stevenson is as charming as can be as Danny Greene. The supporting cast includes Vincent D'Onofrio, Val Kilmer and Christopher Walken, and all are as good as expected. This may very well be the best unknown and unseen crime drama ever released.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True story of famous '70's Cleveland based Irish mobster Danny Greene</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been pretty excited about getting my hands on this film for some time now without knowing very much about it. But watch the trailer and if you're a fan of your 'Goodfellas,' 'Donnie Brasco's and 'Casino's then you'll probably relate.'Kill The Irishman' has been called the best film since 'Goodfellas' as was stated on the DVD box that came in the mail today. Now all that tells a man to begin with is that the film is the best imitation of 'Goodfellas' there's been since 'Goodfellas' was introduced to cinemas and VHS tapes. Fear not, it is actually good enough to compare to the many times already aforementioned gangster classic and what comes as a surprise is pretty much everything about the film.Firstly, a synopsis. Danny Greene's story - narrated by Val Kilmer (who lends some heavy support throughout the film) - tells of a tough Irishman working the grain silos at the Cleveland Docks whose rise to infamy begins when he goes to work for the mafia after a jail term for larceny makes headlines due to his muscling in on his former factory boss's business.Greene is an old fashioned street fighting man who will stand up to anybody and although readily willing to commit crimes to make money, he is an honest and caring man by nature and this quickly endears us to the complex character so easily portrayed by Irish-born up and coming actor Ray Stevenson. I say up and coming but if you're British you'll already know him for television and minor film roles. If you're American you may know him for 'King Arthur', 'Outpost', 'Book of Eli' and 'Punisher: War Zone'.As events unfold and just as Greene became unhappy with his factory boss, he sees the mafia acting unfairly, abusively and little involved. He declares that he will go into business for himself, meaning that he will inevitably have to declare war on the Italian mafia. Naturally, what follows is the titular plot; the mafia attempting and failing over the duration of many years to hit the unflappable Irishman as he goes to great lengths to rub it in their faces and get revenge where necessary.The film, based mostly in Cleveland throughout post-war '70's America, looks and feels authentic but it is the strong, earthy Irish charm that sets it apart from all those old classic I-tallian-American gangster films and a style of film-making that sometimes takes you back even as far as the forties for its occasionally rich film-noir texture.What I find amazing because this is actually no huge Hollywood film is that 'Kill The Irishman' boasts a hugely classic cast including Val Kilmer (Heat), Christopher Walken (explanation???), Vincent D'Onofrio (Law &amp; Order), Paul Sorvino (Goodfellas) and Robert Davi (Die Hard and The Goonies) to name a few. They're all very admirably cast in familiar roles, some unfamiliar which works in favour of plot tiwsts, and help to endear us towards a film that is actually very down to earth and sometimes even hilarious for a such a darkly toned crime drama.What surprised me the most is the link I made earlier on as I looked over the cast and crew of the film. Ray Stevenson (the last man to portray killer ex-military vigilante Frank Castle AKA The Punisher) being directed as the film's lead by Jonathan Hensleigh, director of the 2004 Thomas Jane version of The Punisher. And the team works brilliantly. Hensleigh who I associated with slow and simplistic storytelling since the latter has really thrown a curveball with this one and I can't help but wonder; what if Hensleigh had directed Stevenson as the Punisher instead, what kind of comic crime caper would we have gotten then? Kill The Irishman boasts some hilariously offensive dialogue that cannot be mistaken for anything but Irish, the film to me at first glance was authentic and quite realistic and I recommend it to everyone with a fully functioning brain and heart. 'Kill The Irishman' is one of the best dramas on offer at this moment!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Irishman is iconic tour de force</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was surprised at how this was a really well told story.It was made in 2011, but took place in the mid 70s. It is the story of Danny Greene an Irish mobster who would not sell out to the Italian mafia as they fought over turf in Cleveland.And the Director, Jonathan Hensleigh did a great job on the direction and script. Too many who knew him, Danny had a 'good' side and a bad side and it was represented in the movie. Danny served Turkeys at holidays, saved an old lady from an explosion, yet easily planted a bomb to eliminate adversaries. Jonathan told the story in 70's film language which has a lot of natural lighting, some hand held camera, realistic scenes, and sort of a cinema-verite feel to the movie. This made the film seem like a documentary but without the ponderous narrator and constant talking heads. Hensleigh told the story with action and character. The lighting, film stock, and camera work was reminiscent of The French Connection, a gritty 70's film.Ray Stevenson was almost a look alike for the real Danny Greene and added to the realism of the story.Even the fights were very realistic. There was no whack, thwack of a bamboo rod on leather as is typically overdone in movies. Those fights are a realism unmatched in cinema. a) they did not go on forever, with high kicks and constant up and down moments for the hero. b) sound of fist heating a chin was very real. Fights aren't an array of sound effects. c) most real fights end pretty quickly as in the movie, a few punches and the guy is down and you beat him up, he doesn't keep popping up like a whack a mole after being knocked out. Thank goodness the fights didn't go on forever with 'artsy' camera angles.The feel of this movie was gritty, and matched the grittiness of the story and labor (garbage and longshoreman activities) and you didn't feel the supporting cast was acting but that you were watching a mafia spy cam on their activities. See the extra features and the movie is pretty much the real story. The supporting cast of name actors had them nicely blended into the background and not upstaging the main character. Nicely done.I liked the incorporated newsreel footage, and forgot about all those explosions in the 70s in Cleveland. Funny how bombs are the "weapon"of choice for criminal types.Thank goodness Scorsese did not direct this movie as it would have been over lit and much more hyped up and with those whack fist effects and other posed scenes.And people died in these explosions, they didn't run ahead of them like Tom Cruise and Harrison Ford to "beat" the blast.If want to learn about the historic story of mobster vs. mobster in the 70s and an icon of resistance...this is the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Authentic setting spoilt by schoolboy errors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Designed to be an authentic gangster flick in the vein of Scorcese classics we all know and love, 'Kill The Irishman' aimed high but missed by a distance due to some poor choices in fundamental areas.I wont recite the plot for you, you can read that above if you want to. The aim of this review is to highlight 3 reasons why lovers of gangster films like myself, will find this one lacking: 1. The main character, Danny Greene aka The Irishman. The central character pulls the audience in and holds the story together. Why cast someone incapable and completely devoid of any emotion? Every single scene Ray Stevenson appears to have turned up to read some lines, then left with his paycheck.If I'm not emotionally invested in the character the movie centres around, every scene, not matter how well it's shot, will only ever be eye candy at best. There was clearly budget for some real talent, since the supporting roles made this watchable. Why not invest it in the right place? 2. The hook. (spoiler alert) The scene which pulls the audience in is a car bomb which Greene survives. This is a key scene right at the beginning, why cut corners and super impose fire on a car that clearly isn't burning? It cheapens the scene and insults the audience. This was repeated on other scenes later in the movie although there were some well done genuine explosions towards the end so it defies logic why the key scene was so poorly handled.3. The script. It wasn't awful but everyone pretty much just said what they were expected to say at any given time. There were no quirky characters, everyone was either a generic gangster or a generic civilian. Great characters in a gangster movies; Joe Pesci's characters in both Goodfellas and Casino, Ray Liotta's character in Goodfellas. Every gangster in this movie could just as easily been listed as 'Gangster no. X'. Cookie cutter. This extends to how the story unfolds too. When a key character is uncharacteristically happy and the background music is the same, it's blatantly obvious he/she is about to meet their end. Cookie cutter, meets but does not exceed expectation.The sets, wardrobe and cinematography were great so if sight is the only sense available to you, you'll rate this flick highly (the only explanation I can give for the current 7.1 stars it has on IMDb).Overall this flick could've been great had the fundamentals been right. As it stands, it's a swing and a miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very well done gangster flick...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Danny Greene was an Irish-American mobster and associate of Cleveland mobster John Nardi during the gang war for the city's criminal operations during the 1970s. Competing gangsters set off more than 35 bombs, most attached to cars in murder attempts, many successful. Greene had gained power first in a local chapter of the International Longshoreman's Association, where he was elected president in the early 1960s. Greene pushed into Cleveland rackets and began competing with local families of the Italian Mafia. He set up his own group called the Celtic Club, complete with enforcers.That's the "Irishman" the title of the movie refers to. Joe Manditski (Val Kilmer) narrates the story and tells us how he grew up with Danny Greene (Ray Stevenson) but how their lives took different paths. Danny's into a life of crime and his as a lawman. I thought this movie was going to be about Danny and Joe, but I was mistaken. Instead, we see how Danny got started in organized crime and the methods he used to muscle his way in.The story zips along at a very nice pace, never lagging or slowing down enough for us to lose interest. Many aspects of his life are shown on screen, from Union President to his relationship with John Nardi (D'Onofrio), his first marriage to Joan Madigan (Cardellini) and the many numerous attempts on his life. Even though we see many nasty sides of Danny Greene, he is a very likable character. We see this through his extreme generosity and his love for the women in his life.Excellent supporting cast and engaging story are what kept this film afloat. It's just a shame that it wasn't higher on the studio's radar because had it been given a more wide release, this one could have pulled in some bigger box office.

		<fullReview>I had high hopes for this movie, considering its strong casting. But sadly, it fails to deliver.I don't know if the movie got slashed in post production, or it was simply poorly written, but the end result is a film which feels very rushed, with numerous scenes missing. It seems like Hensleigh is so terrified of the movie feeling slow, that he goes to the extreme in the opposite direction.In what seems like the first 20 minutes of the movie, the main character goes from a struggling longshoreman, to being the head of the union, to getting married to some random waitress, to being locked up, to suddenly being an informant, and ending up as a low level gangster again. Oh, and somewhere in all of this he saves someone - I suppose a friend - from some loan shark, but it's not entirely clear why or how, although it for some reason becomes a big plot point later on. It's probably due to sloppy writing.Everything is portrayed in very short scenes in a pattern of "and then this happened, and then this happened, and then this happened". The problem with this technique is that we never really get to know the main character, his motivations, his relations to the supporting characters (his crew and antagonists) and not to mention his first wife.This isn't "Transformers" where the audience might be content with seeing some massive explosions and robots beating the crud out of each other. For this movie to be enjoyable, and actually make sense, we have to at least know and care a little bit for our characters.Compare "Kill the Irishman" to "Goodfellas", a movie which obviously have been a strong influence on this film (not to mention the opening car explosion, which is taken almost beat by beat from "Casino")."Goodfellas" is a full 40 minutes longer than "Kill the Irishman", but never gets dull. On the other hand, it rather feels faster paced than "Kill the Irishman". But we need those extra 40 minutes, because it gives us time to get explore the points listed above."Kill the Irishman" feels like wasted opportunity.It could have been a "Heat" style film, exploring the relationship between Ray Stevenson and Val Kilmer's characters. But no.It could have explored the tension between being a snitch and having the life of crime as the only realistic way of life. But no.It could have been a rise-and-fall mafia style movie like "Goodfellas" or "Scarface" or even "American Gangster". But no.It could have been a gritty look at the life of crime, kind of like a reverse "Narc". But no.This movie can't decide what type of film it is, so it tries to be all of them at once, which is a recipe for failure.It's a shame considering the talented cast, which has very little to work with in this garbled mess of a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What this movie needs are more cars blowing up.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went in really wanting to like this flick and boy was I utterly disappointed. Not like angry, I got ripped off, wasted my time kind of disappointment but more of a why did they even bother going through the trouble of making this movie to begin with kind of disappointment.It is so full of unbelievable film and story clichés it's astounding (And at some points kinda embarrassing). There is no attempt in any way to take something that on paper would appear to anyone as being a pretty typical mob/gangster story and create a film narrative that can come across as something other than a typical mob/gangster story.I think the worse thing the production does is start a story that is so obviously taking a page from Goodfellas and then proceed to deliberately hire half the cast from the same movie. Painfully obvious. Did it even occur to anyone during pre-production that there were more than a few sequences that seem rather... similar? (Which, speaking of Goodfellas cast members, note to Tony Darrow: The worst thing a character actor can do is get plastic surgery. On his face. See Dan Hedaya.) The other thing is the movie. It's supposed to be a MOVIE, as in, you know, moving motion pictures. This thing has such a glacial pace I wanted to start clubbing baby seals to relieve the boredom..And what was up with Ray Stevenson's hair? It's like a mutant grafting of Gene Wilder on a six day coke binge and John Belushi with six days of sobriety. Almost all the actors in this either looked like older impersonators of themselves or bloated, inflatable pool toys. And I kept waiting for the alien to pop out of Vincent D'Onofrio's host carcass but then I remembered that was another movie back when he wasn't simply working to support his restaurant tabs. Which, apparently, are extensive.And poor Robert Davi-- we don't even get that good a glimpse of him in the whole movie. And he was a Bond villain for heaven's sake! It's not right. I'm just sayin'. And yeah, yeah, I know, it was supposed to be a device to make his character seem 'mysterious' and 'dangerously ubiquitous' but it just came off as if the actor wasn't showing up on time and they had his stand-in complete all his scenes in a pinch.Then at some point, some wiseguy editor managed to sneak in an extra reel of people sitting in their cars and then blowing them up over and over again on a loop that seemed to last for about 45 minutes. Then more things blew up. And then somebody said something or did something which all inevitably lead to a huge cue we all expected anyway that came lumbering up main street like the mother of all Godzillas... and then some kids came and more people blew up again.Next time I think I'll just watch Goodfellas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie About My Family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No I'm not Irish and no my last name is not Green. I'm Italian and my last name is Liberatore. Its been documented for years the association my family has had with the mob. The murder of Danny Green would ultimately put my Uncle Anthony "Tony" Liberatore behind bars for the rest of his life, which also made headlines throughout the country for putting the "Don" of the Cleveland Mafia behind bars. Although this story tells the life of Danny Green, it also intertwines the lives of many high ranking members of the Mafia into the spotlight. The movie itself does in certain parts hold a lot of truth with his dealings with the Cleveland Mafia but what the movie does not show is the paranoia and public solitary confinement he lived the last years of his life in. Although not told through the eyes I would have loved to see the simple fact of being consulted for references about friends and family members who were attached to this story was nothing less than fantastic. I hope everyone likes the movie and be on the lookout for the other side of this story soon!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The cast of players would be worth the time and whatever the fare. The story would be worth the time without the cast. The seamless direction, perfect flow, and consistent energy of the work is in itself sufficient for study and pure cinematic enjoyment. This work represents the best effort a team of professionals can give us. Great effects, visceral, brutal violence, great period design, brilliant direction and editing, and a very well made screenplay. The actors are so well cast, maybe a teeny bit stereotyped, but done so with those faces we love to see as characters from gang!and. Type casting aside, the actors were superb, with hardly a miss in timing and delivery. Cinematic art is not an individual effort. There are so many different crafts and talents necessary to create the whole piece, and evoke in the audience a sense of having been actually a part of the work. This film does that. It is the highest honor one can give a film, that for a couple of hours, you were there, with them, a spectator, but involved a bit in the story. So simple,really, to know a great film. This film, Kill The Irishman, is one of those. Is this ten lines? Thanks again for the opportunity to write, and having read thousands of words about this film, please accept this sincere, simple accolade for a great work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kill the Irishman tells the story of mobster Danny Greene (Ray Stevenson) and his rise to power in 1970s Cleveland. Green rose to be a local Union boss became a police informer when the heat got too much and then got into conflict with the mafia.The film is told from the viewpoint of cop, Val Kilmer who is too fat to be a cop is in conflict with Greene and actually wasted in the role.This is really low rent version of Goodfellas with less charismatic characters, B list cast, dodgy wigs and bad cgi. The plot goes at a breakneck speed, Greene has no education, works as a docker and a few punches later deposed the crooked union boss, got married to the local bar girl who subsequently leaves him and takes their children and you never hear from her again.Greene teams up with a local mafia hoodlum and together they take on the mafia chiefs which resulted in numerous car bombings in Cleveland which terrorised the citizens.The film is interesting enough because it is pacey, Stevenson tries to infuse his character with charisma and make him out to be a anti hero but is ultimately defeated by the script.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible! Don't waste your time... Like i did.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a truly awful film from 2011 that you would think was made for TV in 1990. Such bad acting and dumb looks from the lead roll, you wonder how he ever got the gig. This film throws well know actors from many much better classic gangster films in extremely typecast rolls, to the point of you start to wonder who else the director has dug out from the woodwork to pop up during the film. But even they can not save this disaster of a movie. It reminded me of the Comic Strip film 'Strike' ... But for the wrong reasons.How on earth this film has the rating it does on here makes me think long and hard about how the reviews are put together on here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another IMDb highly rated flop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simply dreadful. Opening scene sets the tone so at least you know the level of crap that's left watch.... Don't bother unless u find it ironically funny. From terrible cg, awful dialog, cheesy jokes, bad acting and the rising terror star reminding you more of king pins Amish. At one point I thought I was watching a musical without the signing... There is however, plenty of Irish jig music and potato talk. Green seems to have bitch slapped his way to being Union president... That's right, he's so tough he slapped everyone minus the leather glove. Green is also old, ugly, weak, hence completely unbelievable as any heart throb or rising gangster. He is very clever tho having dropped out of school so in each scene they can Hes clutching a book. It's a bit like joey from friends delivering a line.. Only everyone is joey, the acting and dialog gets worse while val Kilmer gets fatter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting story but a mediocre movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Danny Greene's life story seems tailor-made for Hollywood. But ultimately the movie proves less compelling than the man. Kill the Irishman brings Greene's story to the screen but does so in rather mundane fashion. Chock-full of mob movie clichés there's not enough here to make this movie stand out from the pack. The movie is overflowing with violence, shootings and bombings galore, yet still seems to lack in energy. An explosive start promises great things but things soon fizzle out. Danny Greene leads a very interesting life but the movie really doesn't capture that. The story as presented here is actually somewhat dull and clearly disappointing.Danny Greene may be the hero of the film but make no mistake he's not a good guy. He's mixed up in all sorts of nefarious activity as he rises from lowly Cleveland dock worker to union president to full-fledged mobster. Cleveland's Italian mafia kingpins have no patience for this Irishman who thumbs his nose at them at every opportunity. So eventually they decide they want Danny Greene dead. Easier said than done as he escapes one attempt on his life after another. Cleveland becomes the car-bombing capital of the world as mob war rages. Seems like there should be a lot of excitement here, this should be a movie absolutely crackling with energy. But it's actually a bit of a dud.Ray Stevenson does a decent enough job playing Danny Greene but is not quite charismatic enough. For this movie to work Danny has to be absolutely irresistible, you have to be mesmerized by him. And you're really not. It's Danny's movie, none of the other characters rise above sideshow status. All the clichéd roles are there. There's a wife, a girlfriend, a cop and a bunch of mostly anonymous tough guys. There's also Christopher Walken playing a typical Christopher Walken role. At least his character stands out a bit. The rest of the supposed big-time mobsters disappoint. The Italian bosses actually come across as somewhat pathetic, acting like big-shots as they run their little Cleveland family but needing to call in some real mafia guys from New York to try to clean up their Danny Greene mess. And make no mistake, Danny Greene revels in making a mess. There's seemingly a lot of very good material here but the movie falls flat. It's an interesting story. And there's a nice 1970s period feel to it, the movie looks good. But the movie never really grabs you. This should be edge-of-the-seat stuff. And it is not. The story of Danny Greene is one worth telling. You just wish it was told in better fashion than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I type, Kill the Irishman has a rating of 7.1 on IMDb.com - making it technically possibly the 'best' movie I've ever rented.I like a good gangster movie, so why did this one leave me cold? First of all I found its lead, Ray Stevenson, a little bland an uncharacteristic. This isn't always a fault, especially if the film is made up of a variety of colourful characters to entertain. However, Kill the Irishman has Val Kilmer in it (and he still hasn't lost weight). Christopher Walken shows his face too - a plus perhaps, only he's not in it enough to make much of a difference.Ray Stephenson plays Danny Greene, an Irish gangster in America. Normally, I find myself rooting for the gangster - they're portrayed as crooks, but lovable rogues. Not here. I just wanted him to get what was coming to him. And all the rest. I couldn't really name any character I felt sympathy for (especially Vinnie Jones, but that was to do with his attempted Irish accent).It seemed long too. It wasn't (just over an hour and a half). But, with 7.2 on 'Earth's largest movie database' who am I to argue?http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent action packed mob movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ray Stevenson really delivers a powerful performance as Irish mobster Danny Greene. Few actors can pull off dramatic stuff such as this while being so damn tough . Based on the life of real Irish crimelord Danny Greene this is very similar in style to Goodfellas and also shares some of the support cast of aforementioned mob classic . This also reminds me of the Sly Stallone crime classic FIST. Of which is a tough film in its own right , but also a well made , story, character driven drama like this film. Kill The Irishman has one of the best supporting casts around which includes Vincent D'Onofrio, Christopher Walken, Vinny Jones and Val Kilmer(plus half of the cast of Goodfellas ). Ray Stevenson holds his own among all of these great actors by playing Greene smart, tough , charismatic and ruthless . Dialogue is delivered just as well as brutal beatings.Danny Greene is truly a tragic figure and Kill The Irishman exhibits some humanity as well as making him sympathetic and likable . Excellent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Danny Greene Danny Greene. Through a series union tussles and Polish beat downs Danny Greene lets us know this Irish lug ain't nothing to f wit. Early on he sends the wife and kids packing and as the audience we couldn't be happier. He lets the red hair get wispy and brandishes a full fledged mustache that commands respect. This based on a true story set in Cleveland of Danny Greene takes us through the life of a career thug whose pride wont let him lay down for the mob. Stevenson went light on the accent which was great for the film and the interweaving of Celtic warrior lore was perfect. Vincent D'Onofrio kills it as the number two wise guy in town. Chris Walken operates as the slick polished shine. If you like being Irish or pretending you'll definitely dig this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great B movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frankly, I liked it almost as much as Good Fellas". The fact it's based on a true story is amazing. It's a good idea to read Danny Greene's bio on Wikipedia. Those were very violent times in the city of Cleveland. Danny Greene is a seriously tough guy, one you wouldn't want to mess with. The movie has an excellent cast. Ray Stevenson from HBO's Rome is really excellent here. Unexpectedly, Christopher Walken and Val Kilmer round out a familiar crew and give solid performances. Detroit is where the movie was made. It's seriously as depressing as Cleveland ever was. Too bad this didn't get a good theatrical run. I caught it on cable and it grabbed me within the first few minutes of watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The author of the book in which the movie is based has a unique insight, he's a cop, his family was part of the old "mustache pete" mafia. the book and the movie, demonstrate in realistic detail just how far the Mafia has declined in the post golden era of the 50s and 60's. One Irishman, with the help of an old Mafia associate, showed the world just how incompetent the mob had become in Cleveland and elsewhere. The movie deftly shows that level of incompetence.Ray Stevenson does a credible job as Irish Danny Green and Vincent D'Onforio is even better as the conflicted John Nardi. Christopher Walken is barely visible as Shonder Burns. Tony Lo Bianco does a great job of a weak, indecisive mob boss who just can't get it right.The movie is burdened with low production value, but the story is true. And the life they highlight deserves low production value. Anyone who compares this to Goodfellows or the Soprano's is out of touch.</fullReview>

Still at the end you end up liking Danny played effortlessly by Ray Stevenson.At times it even reminds you of Robinhood like baddies, a classic as modern fanatics go; this movie resembles.The Mafia and crime syndicates are back with this flick, enjoy the chase to kill the Irishman......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Serious turf war in Cleveland. More than Irish luck.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on true events during the 1970's. At least thirty-six bombs rocked the city of Cleveland, Ohio in the summer of 1976. The mother of turf wars raged between the Mafia and Irish mobsters led by Danny Greene(Ray Stevenson), who went from Irish neighborhood thug to president of the longshoreman's local. Val Kilmer plays Joe Manditski, the good guy that survived Greene's childhood stomping grounds. Joe, an astute cop, sat back and watched his old friend unlikely team up with gangster John Nardi(Vincent D'Onofrio); then would turn the tables on the notorious loan shark and night spot owner Shondor Birns(Christopher Walken). The Irishman was fearless and hard as nails on his way to power in Cleveland's underworld. Defying Mafia bosses raged his own war surviving numerous assassination attempts and did enough damage to jeopardize the very foundation of the Italian mafia syndicates coast to coast. Greene earned the nickname "Mobster Robin Hood" and the man the mob could not kill. Hard action with heavy violence. Acting is powerful and convincing; cinematography is super. Also in the cast: Tony Lo Bianco, Robert Davi, Vinnie Jones, Fionnula Flanagan, Paul Sorvino and Tony Darrow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Kill the Irishman" DVD Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My friend recommended the recently released DVD, "Kill the Irishman." So with some extra time in my afternoon, I sat down to watch the picture. The story follows the popular movie industry formula but I found something unique about this film. The movie is based on the life of Danny Greene, an Irish blue collar worker turned gangster, who always seemed to have the luck of the Irish on his side because of his ability to escape unparalleled danger.The grittiness in the story gives it a surreal feel. You can feel the tension of the characters and I found myself in a way rooting for the mobster with a soul. The cast is played by recognizable actors such as Ray Stevenson (Danny Greene), Vincent D'Onofrio (John Nardi), Val Kilmer (Joe Manditski), and Christopher Walken (Shondor Birns). The cast performances aren't phenomenal but nobody's acting leaves you grimacing with displeasure either. The director and writer of the film, Jonathan Hensleigh, did a solid job with the script. His filmography includes "Armageddon", "The Punisher," and "Jumanji" just to name a few. Is this movie going to be nominated for an academy award? No, but you won't find yourself wishing you had done something else with your two hours. In fact if you're like me, you might sit down another time and give the movie another viewing.I give the movie a rating of B-, the film is two hours of mindless entertainment. What more can you ask for during the summer? It's definitely not a chick flick but doesn't have the needless gore that's rampant in certain action flicks nowadays. Sit back for a couple of hours and take the film in with a friend, I promise you won't regret your decision.Check out my new released blog at: www.logansmovieblog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reality is wilder than fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was not aware of Danny Greene's life story till I saw this movie; this is a recurring comment in most reviews and critics. The events as depicted in this movie are surprising and this is surely a key reason for the positive reviews, rating and critiques. His violent death came as no surprise but what was, is the length of time Greene managed to dodge and escape the mafia wrath. Ray Stevenson delivers a very solid performance as Danny Greene.The director's choice to insert actual TV news video clips was remarkably effective; the editing was up to the challenge. Stevenson's build and look was no doubt a big plus as he sufficiently resembles the real character. Playing an Irishman was in no way a stretch, no more than Robert De Niro playing a New Yorker. The movie can boast a cast of pros and this adds to Stevenson's acting portfolio; I'm glad for him. I've been a fan since the HBO series "Rome". Jonathan Hensleigh, the director has the credential as screen writer and with this movie, he may start getting some traction as director. Oddly, he directed the movie "The Punisher (2004)" starring Thomas Jane, and not the 2008 sequel in which Stevenson played the starring role; the 2004 edition was the better feature. I'm imagining a 'Scott-Crowe' or 'Scorsese-DiCaprio' like partnership, but who am I kidding, Ridley Scott has five of his thirty directed movies with Russell Crowe, which is five times more than Hensleigh has with Stevenson while Martin Scorsese has four of his fifty one directed movies with DiCaprio and besides, one should not compare any director to Ridley Scott, one of the best and my favourite, nor compare to Scorsese. As bad as I may be in conveying that Jonathan Hensleigh demonstrates excellent directorial potential, I trust you get that anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated mob film only worthy of viewing because of the special features.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie opens with a car bomb..it's a tense scene and it makes the movie seem pretty awesome, until the car actually explodes...it's a fake explosion...cgi...and done horribly...you can actually tell with ease that there's no flames, smoke, etc.Because of this I thought "what did I get myself into?"...the budget looked like crap...but I gave it a shot. 1.5 hours later I thought the film was good but the same problems that plagued the opening minutes are standard in the film, but some explosions are real and amazing, which makes no sense.Overall the acting was decent but the pace moves so rapidly that it winds up actually being a little boring, only because we aren't allowed to enjoy the moments. It also bordered on ridiculous...there was no way this guy could survive everything, go on TV, mock the mob, and stay in a trailer when they could easily kill him...it was just too crazy.Then I watched the special features...the main feature is an hour long documentary featuring real news programs, the real people involved, interviews, and film of the shootings, crime scenes, and bombings...it shows that the film was about 90% accurate save for a few small details and some exaggerated parts in the beginning...this made me really appreciate the character and the story a lot more.Bottom line, this is HIGHLY recommended viewing provided that you watch the special features (yes even on the redbox it's included)...I agree with other reviewers, if this had been given a bigger budget and shot with a more seasoned director it would go down as one of the greatest stories I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really One of the Better Mob Movies Out There</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The true story of Danny Greene (Ray Stevenson), a tough Irish thug working for mobsters in Cleveland during the 1970s.Despite my love for Cleveland, and a moderate interest in the Mafia, I had never heard of Danny Greene. I wish I had. This film was amazing, and about 99% true. What a strange thing when you can balance entertainment and accuracy, and this film nails it. And if you like car bombs, this movie has plenty (maybe over 30).The cast is strong. Ray Stevenson is a fantastic actor and actually looks like the Irishman. Vincent D'Onofrio (Law and Order) is a quirky rising star in the mafia. Linda Cardellini (Freaks and Geeks) plays the Irishman's wife. And even Christopher Walken shows up.Walken is probably the weakest actor in the film, playing Christopher Walken rather than Shondor Birns. But it is Walken, so you cannot complain. The best is probably Stephenson, who carries the film and makes a murderer seem like a hero. Val Kilmer should not be ruled out, though. We can scoff at him for packing on the pounds, but this was a great role for him, allowing himself the ability to blend into the role and be the cop and not Kilmer.Is this the best mob movie since "Goodfellas", as Stuart Lee claims on the DVD cover? Perhaps. That is a bold claim, but this is a bold film. And the DVD comes with an hour-long documentary on the real Danny Greene that is not to be missed. Plenty of great interviews with cops, mobsters and family members who lived the tale.Omar Moore goes so far as to say this is "one of the year's best films". This claim is not uncommon -- almost any film can find someone who says this about it. And who is Omar Moore? But he may be right. As of now (June 2011) this is possibly the best film I have seen so far this year. The tense plot mixed with the sheer reality and mythic stature of the hero? Amazing.I spoke with D'Onofrio about the moral issues of the film -- Greene is portrayed as something of a hero (in one scene he gives a necklace to a young admirer) while at the same time he is blowing people up. It is an odd juxtaposition. When we watch "Scarface", we may root for Pacino, but we know he is a bad guy. With Greene, the evil nature of his methods is concealed... we know its there, but it is somehow excusable. What are we to think of him? (D'Onofrio, for the record, thinks this goes back to the foundation of man's fascination with crime stories, but I think the angle here is actually quite different and more in-your-face.)Anyway, see this film. Informative, fun, exciting. One of the year's best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bulletproof gangster!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This quirky little film is a robust contribution to the popular and well established '**** me the Irish are a bunch of bastards, let's kick the crap out of them' genre. A young Irishman with a talent for corruption, violence, and gangland killings sets about carving a place for himself in the seedy filth of the Cleveland underworld. When captured by the FBI he sells out his friends and colleagues to become an informant, and exploits this position to advance his criminal career.Set in the 1970s at the height of the infamous 'Mafia versus pretty much anyone who's not Italian' wars, this action packed film based on real life events has a star studded cast, including Ray Stevenson, Val Kilmer, Christopher Walken, Fionnula Flanagan, and Michael Finn Seamus McDonnell O'Flahahaherty.I rate Kill the Irishman at 26.64 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as an impressive 8/10 on IMDb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good mob movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a flashforward to 1975, Danny Greene (Ray Stevenson) survives a car bomb attempt in Cleveland. In 1960, he and friends Billy McComber and Art Sneperger are longshoremen. He takes on corrupt union boss Jerry Merke who doesn't care about the working members. Sneperger is in gambling debt to Cleveland Mafia John Nardi (Vincent D'Onofrio) and Danny offers to help him steal from the docks. Danny takes over the union and marries Joan (Linda Cardellini). Police Detective Joe Manditski (Val Kilmer) takes him down and he's banned from unions. He gets work from loan shark Shondor Birns (Christopher Walken). After a dispute over money, he gets into a car bombing war with New York mobsters. He gains notoriety as the "Robin Hood of Collinwood" surviving multiple murder attempts.This is very much a Goodfellas wannabe including a "Based on a True Story" moniker. There isn't anything wrong with aspiring to be one of the best films of all times. It's got plenty of solid actors in the many supporting roles. D'Onofrio is a standout although it may be trying to fit in too many characters. As for Ray Stevenson, he has a really powerful presence. He's a hulking man. The movie has minor flaws here and there that keeps it from being a truly great mobster movie. Some of the side characters need to step up. The wife and mistress are bland. The movie doesn't always flow well but it's a good watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Titus Pullo Takes On The Mob! (It's The Gangster Equivalent of Terror At Red Wolf Inn)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely loved Ray Stevenson in the HBO Series ROME, where he played a Roman soldier named Titus Pullo. Pullo was the original tough guy with a heart of gold, a guy who could be breaking skulls one minute and playing with children the next, and never be anything less than real and sympathetic.So when I watched KILL THE IRISHMAN, I was expecting Ray Stevenson to really shine. Yet I was disappointed, because Danny Greene is really not a lovable tough guy. He's more like a driven psycho who kills over and over, not because he's cornered, or even because he wants a bigger piece of the pie, but just because he has some messianic delusion that only he can "save" the city of Cleveland from the Italian mob. This is all very interesting, (the Irish tendency not so much towards violence itself, but suicidal religious fanaticism) yet the character is so cold and almost fanatical that Ray Stevenson can't really get a grip. And yes, this is the only movie I've ever seen where the leading man's hair is so stringy, lifeless and weird looking that it's fall down laughing funny.Meanwhile, the movie hits you over the head with comic stupidity at every turn, so what should be a tense mob thriller becomes almost like a dark comedy. The characters all live in the Seventies, drive Fifties cars and have Sixties haircuts. The soundtrack see-saws back and forth in a zany sort of way between comically upbeat Irish jigs (when someone's getting beaten to death or blown up) and generic Philadelphia-style Soul Music (whenever someone's driving in his car.)There are so many things that make no sense. Danny Greene is supposed to be tough, okay. Smart, okay. But everyone else is just plain dumb. Early in the picture, a big goon wearing glasses pulls a gun on him, and Danny just says, "hey now. Put it down." So the guy does. Then Danny beats him up and kills him! Good thing he thought of telling the bad guy to put the gun down, huh? Is that all it takes in Cleveland? A guy with a genuinely crazy persona, like Mel Gibson, might have made you believe this guy is nuts and even tough guys are afraid of him. It's funny, everyone says this movie is a bad version GOODFELLAS, but it reminded me much more of PAYBACK starring Mel Gibson. And TERROR AT RED WOLF INN, because it's so bad it's funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the popularity and success of mafia films, lesser known, true stories have to come to light, and I tend to enjoy them the most. Everybody knows about Gotti, Capone, and Bulger, but how many people know about Danny Greene? Greene was a simple factory worker in Cleveland, Ohio, who was upset by how mob corruption had taken over every major industry in the city. Greene wanted to fight back, but no one successfully takes on the mob, so Greene decided to hit them where it hurt. Greene started his own crew and slowly started to take over their businesses. For nearly a decade, the mob tried and failed to assassinate Greene, making him a modern day Bravehart in the hearts and minds of the citizens of Cleveland. Ray Stevenson, always "that other guy", stars in this film, and he was truly outstanding. People who knew Greene say Stevenson's performance was spot on and that really adds to the excitement surrounding this film. Kill The Irishman isn't without it's problems however, as with most mafia related films, it moves incredibly fast. It's hard to keep track of the timeline and as always, people come and go so quickly, that it's hard to keep track of who is who. Beyond that, this film focuses on the violence and assassination attempts surrounding Greene, rather than simply telling his story. The bottom line, Kill The Irishman is certainly not Goodfellas, but it was still extremely entertaining, and offers viewers a story about the mafia, that most wise guys would prefer to forget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid entry into the crime genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is about Danny Greene, The Irishman from the title. It's a guilty pleasure as I like crime films especially those involving the mafia. I tend to rate those kinds of movies slightly higher than others, so take that into account when you read this. This is the story of the rise of a dockworker, among Cleveland's seedy dockside underbelly. Greene, predictably attracts the ire of the local mafia, and, with consummate ease starts to dispatch them one by one. It stretches credibility a bit, but as I wrote earlier, its a guilty pleasure. Its an old fashion film too in the way that bullets fly, bodies crumple and cars blow up. The lead actor does a great job lending menace to his role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It's gonna take more than a few firecrackers to kill Danny Greene!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I hadn't checked, I would have thought this film was made over a decade ago, certainly not as recently as 2011. It has a definite feel for the era it represents, Cleveland in the mid Seventies, and the use of news and film clips of the time lend a degree of authenticity to the the story of mobster Danny Greene. I guess I'm behind the curve by a few years as I haven't seen Ray Stevenson before, so I was unsure why he was heading a cast that included Vincent D'Onofrio, Val Kilmer and Christopher Walken. Fortunately he acquits himself well enough as Irishman Danny Greene, who rises from the Cleveland docks to become president of the longshoremen's union, and insinuates his way into the local Mafia by virtue of a business loan that goes sour and an arrangement as an informant for the FBI. As far as gangster films go, I wouldn't put this one in the same league as say "Goodfellas" or "Miller's Crossing", but it does offer an interesting look at how the Cleveland mob operated during the Seventies and it's association with the Gambino crime family in New York. Walken's character Shondor Birns is entertaining as the provider of financial services to men who like to gamble, and if I had to guess, might be the only actor to ever use the term 'vigorish' in a movie; I haven't see enough episodes of 'The Sopranos' to know otherwise. But if you're familiar with the Mafia and how their hierarchy operates, you know it's only a matter of time until Danny gets the kind of justice that made headlines throughout the era, a front page mob hit that takes out another crime kingpin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Biography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't like long reviews so I'll get right to the point.A movie based on the real life story of Danny Green,an Irish thug played by Ray Stevenson who did a great job to his role.You know how it goes,if you want an Irish character,pick an Irish actor to play it.Unfortunately the movie is underrated,God knows why...I like how Danny was a "good person in a bad person" and sticked to his pride no matter what happened.It was nice to see that the producers gave the actors hairstyles and whiskers just like the ones back then.I really recommend this film,mostly because it's a biography that has complied exactly what happened and it focused on Danny's emotions and ego.One more thing that I loved about this film was that the director used actual footage from 1970 between frames.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fictional Realism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a coldness to the warm heart of this "Robin Hood" as portrayed here and that seems to be the only attempt to capture the real brutal side of this Schizophrenic Mobster. It is a one note Performance about a two tiered Thug. The Movie's Film Stock (most likely post production that made it look that way) has a very 1970's sheen to it that is amazingly authentic as are most of the Sets, Wardrobe, and Hairstyles.Fictional Realism seems to be the buzz here and most of it works really well. Incorporating real TV New footage with a seamless effect is another cu-do worth mentioning. The Bio part of the Movie is rather rushed and all surface and mostly cheats its way to an imbalance and manipulation to make our Anti-Hero more Hero than Anti.Overall it is well done if not at all Stylish and it is rather shallow in a lot of respects, but the "Truth" of the Story does come through and we are more informed than not about a really bizarre and very unusual situation about Tribal Warfare in and on the Streets of the Melting Pot. If you ever wondered why no one ever took on the Mafia at their own Game, well, here it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kill the Irishman!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Young kid : Hey Mister are you really the Irishman? Danny Greene: What about it? Young Kid: My cousin says you have more balls than anyone else, he wants to be just like you! Wonderful piece of Cinema, starring Ray Stevenson best known for his role as Titus Poulo in the legendary T.V series Rome. Stevenson stars in and as Danny Greene, a tough Irish thug working for mobsters in Cleveland during the 1970's. Greene who looks to turn over a new leaf in the second half of the movie by going legitimate faces the wrath of the Mafia.The Mafia are after him he don't care! The Cops are after him, he don't care! Calls himself a descendant of the Celtic Warriors in short " one tough son-of-a-gun!" The movie follows Greene's rise to power, although his practices were corrupt he maintained a certain amount of dignity and a code to how he went about doing his work.Great performance by Stevenson, but poor supporting performances makes the viewer lose the flow of the movie, Director Jonathan Hensleigh fails to use actors like Christopher Walken and Val Kilmer effectively, definite shades of the Scorsese classic Goodfellas in the narrative perspective, in fact the knife stabbing scene behind the car boot is directly lifted from there, Alas Jonathan did not have Joe Pesci to liven up the screen! All-in-all an entertaining watch, witty dialogue, powerful scenes, fast narrative and one of the few movies these days with a great background score. The U.S.P of the film is Stevenson's performance, the guy has tremendous screen presence and he carries the movie alone. I would give it a 7/10.Anshuman Bagri for MuvieMadlyDeeply.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the whole a well cast and directed movie, although I do have my reservations (if it be only one) concerning the cast. From the start, a riveting film until we get the entrance of Vinnie Jones - from the minute he moved his lips and gave the worst Irish accent I have ever heard, my heart started sinking. Fortunately he had few lines so I managed get through it. Come on Vinnie you must have heard the expression 'don't give up your day job'. As the movie is based on a true story, it is not only enjoyable watch, but also interesting. With this in mind there is obviously some dramatisation, but the news footage (especially that shown at the end of the film) gives it the feel of raw reality. Overall one of the best gangster films I have seen recently - a big fat 8 from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gangster as good guy? Didn't that go out of fashion with Goodfellas?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In real life, Danny Greene was a tough and colorful Irish-American criminal who went to war against the Mafia for control of his native Cleveland during the 1970s. This movie gets the "tough and colorful Irish-American" and the "war against the Mafia" stuff right, but kind of skimps on the whole "criminal" thing. Gangsters can be charismatic and impressive and have admirable qualities, but gangsters are also fundamentally bad men. What defines them is they don't have a problem with hurting or killing other people for their own greed. Kill The Irishman goes so far overboard with making Danny Greene a folk hero that it loses any sense of perspective and any chance at being a really good mob movie. This film sugarcoats and soft peddles the darker elements of the man and his story, coming off more like propaganda than cinema.I'm not saying this movie is terrible. It's relatively entertaining but keeps bumping into its superficial dishonesty about the nature of Danny Greene. There have been too many movies and TV shows and books and news reports about the ugly truth of America's underworld to buy the tale of a charming rouge that co-writer Jeremy Walters and co-writer/director Jonathan Hensleigh are trying to sell. I mean, when they show Danny and his crew beating the crap out of innocent garbage men in order to try and take over the business for the mob, it's presented like it was all fun and games. When one of Danny's friends objects to the squeeze being put on his garbage hauling firm, the movie portrays this hard working businessman like he's being the unreasonable and dangerous one. It all feels so fake that you can't fully appreciate the unique qualities of the real Danny Greene and the ultimate significance of his story.It's too bad because the movie has a good rhythm and pace and a strong, though perhaps overly large, cast of characters. Ray Stevenson as Danny Greene continues to demonstrate here that he is the big time leading man Hollywood has been seeking for years to take over for those stars who hit in big in the 80s and are now getting stuff in the mail from AARP. He has that old school aura where it feels like he had a real life before taking up this acting stuff. It's a natural depth of character that most actors, especially pretty boys who get started in the industry before they're old enough to legally drink, simply aren't good enough to fake.Vincent D'Onofrio also continues to build his legacy as one of the best and most entertaining actors of his time. He gives mobster John Nardi his own distinct speech pattern and tone of voice without it every sounding like an affectation. If you'd never seen him before, you'd come away from this film thinking that's just the way D'Onfrio talks. I think you could give this guy the same role 50 times and he could come up with 50 different ways of doing it and they'd all be completely believable. And with Mike Starr, Paul Sorvino, Robert Davi, Steve Schirripa and the great Christopher Walken rounding things out, along with good work from Linda Cardellini and Laura Ramsey in the typically thankless wife/girlfriend roles, there are no complaints to be had with the acting in Kill The Irishman.If you're a fan of the mob genre and are looking for an okay flick to fill up an evening, Kill the Irishman isn't a bad choice. Aside from some phony-looking CGI flames for some explosion scenes, this is a competent and modestly engaging little effort. If you watch it too soon after seeing Goodfellas, however, you'll be rolling your eyes so hard and so often that they'll probably pop clean out of your head.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expected better and received garbage. Crappy story and mostly crappy acting, minus Walken and D'Onofrio. When there were "dramatic" scenes, such as when the Irishman gives a young Irish boy a medallion, it made the movie worse. Why? Because when there's a crappy story combined with crappy acting, dramatic scenes that are supposed to be tear jerks wind up comical. The movie fails on so many levels, I hardly know where to begin and end. Kill the Irishman had potential to be something big, something memorable, something reminiscent of old time gangster movies; instead, it came up short and disappeared like a fart in the wind. Save your time and money. Don't bother with this film.</fullReview>

If you like stupid people dying in car bomb "accidents" then I would watch it. Seriously how many people have to die from a car bomb before you just hire someone to watch your car. If this is what actually happened then why even make a movie from that story. It is so dumb, stupid, dissolved, and what ever else means "I wish I would not have watched it." I am guessing that all Irish people from the Midwest gave it a good review to get it to a 7. really really bad, but not as bad as "The Strangeness". I don't know how that movie even got a 5.5 it is literally the worst movie ever made. 0.0 on "the strangeness" 0.1 on "Kill the Irishman".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They've got to stop throwing in former A-list actors as holding "starring" roles to get you to watch these movies. Granted there were a few Soprano alums to make in this flick too. Walken and Kilmer were on screen 10% of the time, combined. But you don't watch it for that. True story coupled with typical Holly-imation plotting makes you sit through it. Compassion is not forced, you do start to care about Mr. Greene. Throw in a bunch of explosions and a glimpse into the last days of the Cincinnati crime with 70's news footage and you've got a low grossing, mobster movie buff drama that will humbly sit below the greats of the genre forever more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first thing that struck me was the absolute expressionlessness in the faces of all the actors. The acting consists of stonefaced men past their middle age delivering lines unconvincingly. Normally, the director will try to enhance the visuals, add effectful sounds, and cut it in such a way as to cover up bad acting. But here, Nick Love seems to be completely uninterested in doing anything else than taking the footage as is and telling the story from beginning to end in the most plain and dull way imaginable.Every scene is dull and unconvincing. And despite a cast that looks good on paper, no scene has any nerve or energy. Even the violence/action scenes are dull and unconvincing. Usually, directors going crazy in this department can at least appeal to that part of the audience.If you're a fan of these actors, you might be let down. I would go get one of the many good movies they've starred in instead. This movie is dead dull.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I sat through 40 minutes of this film and was still waiting for it to start.Before that I had watched a series of disjointed scenes that were seemingly thrown together in any order. The direction was all over the place and the acting dull.Val Kilmer walks around as if he was half asleep. And Ray Stevenson who plays Danny Greene just didn't seem 'hard' enough for me to take him seriously. Much worse is a scene where Danny's sitting in a bar and a very attractive girl, young enough to be his daughter, starts flirting with him. That I found totally unrealistic. I have never found Christopher Walken very exciting so his presence didn't help the film.And as another reviewer pointed out, the camera often panned away when the violence started. So it beats me why it has an 'R' rating.Quite frankly I was bored by this film. It's so dull, I often wondered how I managed to sit through to the end.1/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Because they could not film the movie in Cleveland, the only recognizable landmark in the film is Berkowitz-Kumin funeral home, which is seen for the burial of Alex (Shondor) Birns.The film gives credit to Paul Sciria, who used to be a radio newsman, and "Cleveland's 'Plain Dealer.' " But since the paper has long had no historical memory, I cannot figure out what the movie could have learned at 1801 Superior. In the movie, the PD reporter who investigated Danny Greens and the Longshoremen's Union is called Steve Marshak, and I can't figure out why it couldn't say Sam Marshall.When plans are made to kill Mike Frato, Greene voices his objection by saying, "He's got 10 kids." No mention in the film of Frato's three wives. (Full disclosure: I lived two doors down from Beverly Frato and her five children for many years.)You never get to see the inside of the PD's city room. You never see any PD people. And you are never shown Mairy Jayn Woge's turf, the Cleveland Mafia. You only see one after another of them get killed.The film ends with a clear indication that Greene was killed at 2000 Brainard Rd. in Lyndhurst, a building I always referred to as the Daniel Greene Memorial Building because it took months to scrape the last of Greene's body from the modern skyscraper. It's an entertaining movie, but it's not something you need to see to learn about Cleveland history. -- Stephen G. Esrati (Plain Dealer retiree)Dayton, OH 45410</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Routine biopic on the life of a vicious brute, with no insights, and nothing interesting to say or show.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The charmless lead actor does nothing to lift this by-the-numbers mob movie out of its predictable rut, nor does the script/direction offer anything more than bits out of other similar films. Occasionally Val Kilmer manages to make his character seem like a a real person; otherwise, it's strictly caricature from everybody else. But you can't blame 'em. The writer and the director clearly wanted to make several old films they'd already seen, with all the interesting bits cut out. There's no character development, so we never get to know much about our leading thug, (real-life Philladelphian, Danny Greene) except that, for a while, he regrets some of his more appalling behaviour. Basically though, he wants to be top dog, and there's always someone else who wants that job. There's a little bit of plot development, but basically one power struggle leads to another in a series of punch-ups, detonations, shootings, Mafiosi gesticulations, insults and more explosions. Our hero's wife - after she's scowled for 6 scenes, at her husband brutalising half the neighbourhood, she's packed all the suitcases, put the kids in the car, and is leaving - says: "it's over." Can you imagine the wave of surprise that swept over the audience? One standout in this picture is the hair and makeup, it's bizarre. Stevenson (who reminds me of old Warner Brothers stock actor, Alan Hale) must have the worse hairdo of any leading man after Nicholas Cage.Christopher Walken, plays a Jewish mobster, who neither washes, nor combs his hair, nor has it cut over a timespan of a decade. Vincent D'Onofrio looks like the most unkempt wiseguy in the history of the Cosa Nostra, and..I'd better stop here. Suffice it to say, if you're happy with fisticuffs, explosions, and clichés, enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth seeing, but it's NOT going to be a Mob Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had a chance to catch this at the Sunshine Theater on East Houston in NYC. I was looking forward to seeing this movie after reading about it a few months ago, and luckily found a theater that was actually screening it. I initially heard of Danny Green from the Mobsters series on BIO Channel, so I already knew the background story, and overall this movie keeps things pretty real in that regard(with some dramatics added here and there for the sake of entertainment). Overall I was slightly disappointed as parts of the movie and the dialog was too "Hollywoody". Casting Christopher Walken for example, he's become such a fixture of humor because of the way he talks, so when he talks in this movie about serious subjects, its still funny. Plus the meetings and interactions(especially amongst the Italian characters) was so typical it seemed like a 18 year old wrote the script after watching a few episodes of the Sopranos. The special effects seemed very low budget on the car bombing sequences, you can totally see a green screen poorly camouflaged into the some of the shots. That being said it is a good movie, just not a classic like Goodfellas, The Godfather, or even something one tier lower like Casino or The Departed. Ray Stevenson is awesome and is able to carry the movie past some of the shortcomings I mentioned, but with the talented names in the cast and the storyline they had to work with, it could have been so much better.</fullReview>

If they could have shot the film better ( the grain or type of film they used looked like itnwas a after school movie), if the director could have captured the character by holding some longer moments to show the character and what there thoughts were, and if the producer could have cut the picture to also show the depth of the moment and character, it would have been a movie you would never forget. This could have been a movie that would be talked about and always remembered. It could have had the same impact as " godfather" . I hope the crew of this movie take this as constructive feedback....

This is no way how a gangster movie should be made. it is awfully slow and story is almost non existent. I am giving it 6 only because of some decent acting, otherwise it would have been somewhere 3 in my dictionary. Not recommended unless you don't have any other movie to watch.Maybe my expectations were too high but you can't blame me considering I had just seen TAKEN one day before and that was a pure treat. I guess the story could have been portrayed in a much better way. the ending is so anti-climax that I was just waiting for the movie to get over and thankfully it got over soon. I am also surprised how people here have given high scores, maybe because the film is based on a true story. However that does not take away the fact that movie is boring and nowhere near the cool gangster movies of which I am really fond of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good fun, intelligent, higher than just mid-level!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great gangster movie. Unlike those "cinema-history-making" movies like God Father, Donnie Brasco,etc., this one is not that pompous, not that depressingly gloomy and dark, while directed and played on the very same top level. And the story is not less interesting. Good speed of action, witty dialogs and all characters portrayed psychologically truthfully. Makes you obviously take the side of Danny Greene and his buddies though they're real mobsters (but very likable and sexy) ! For Ray Stevenson ? the best his role ever. He had first time such a big opportunity to show a bit of depth of his acting and used it well. Christopher Walken and Vincent D'Onofrio ? in their own class! Vinnie Jones could have been exploited more, but! ? if he or Val Kilmer had been given more of space, the movie could have become more of a show. The sort of sparsity, lack of exaggerated effects and the friendship and loyalty and drama painted in everyday-life terms without overly high Shakespearian tones, gives room for the story to be absorbed and emotions to grow. I give it 8..5-9. To Ray Stevenson ? 9! I also like it that the actors apparently had a real fun working on this movie and that the director did not cut those seconds when they can hardly suppress laugh!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Kill the Irishman" The Ballad of Danny Greene</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>America loves the tough guy. The guy who faces the impossible odds and beats them to a bloody pulp. Examples - Rocky, Dirty Harry or Dalton ("Road House"). America also loves the bad guy. The guy that we really shouldn't support but we do anyhow. Examples - The Godfather, Scarface and Henry Hill ("Goodfellas"). In "Kill the Irishman" we are now given a new underdog, bad guy to cheer for, Danny Greene (played by Ray Stevenson). All-American tough guy.In Jonathan Hensleigh's latest movie based on Danny Greene's life in the 1970s, we see the tough guy who works his way up from the docks in Cleveland, Ohio. Greene has it rough from the beginning, an orphan raised on Cleveland's mean streets. He takes a job on the docks shoveling grain and is soon given the opportunity to become a union leader because he is one of the only guys that reads books. So, he is also a tough guy with some intellect. He literally fights his way into his position of Union Boss. From there he leads a corrupt life assisting the local Italian mafia in robbing the docks where he works.Does this sound like any kind of movie hero? Why are we intrigued to continue watching? Maybe it's because some of us (mainly us guys) secretly want to be Greene. The guy that doesn't take nonsense from anyone. If someone gets in your way, break his jaw, beat him down and don't worry about consequences.Things are going well for Greene until his arrest; his bad deeds finally catch up to him. He cuts a deal with the FBI to become an informant and is back home with his wife and kids. He now needs to find work. He soon becomes a debt collector for Shondor Birns (played by Christopher Walken). Although Greene is Irish and Birns is Italian they don't let that stand in the way of their friendship, especially since there is money to be made.Again things are going well for Greene, he patrols Cleveland with his crew collecting past due balances for the mafia. Being a tough guy he usually lets his fist or hand gun do the talking. Things soon go south for Greene and Birns due to a lost $70,000. Immediately there is a price on Greene's head.In 1976 there were 36 explosions that rocked Cleveland therefore dubbing it as Bomb City, USA. This is all due in part to the Italian mob trying to kill the Irishman, Greene. He dodges bullets like Superman and survives explosions like John McClain ("Die Hard") then walks away with an indifferent attitude.How does he survive all of these assassination attempts? He is an Irish Catholic with the grace of God. Greene doesn't show fear; he keeps himself believing his intent is to be a modern day Robin Hood for the community. Even after losing his children and wife, he sticks it out because tough guys never give up. Especially Irish Catholic tough guys.Should you see this movie? Sure, if you like tough guys and if you like cheering for the bad guy. Greene's take-no-guff attitude kept his character interesting when the story seemed to lag or when there weren't any cars blowing up. He is supported by a cast of strong veterans, Val Kilmer, Vincent D'Onofrio and Paul Sorvino. The film also has an authentic documentary feel to it since Hensleigh incorporates actual footage from newscasts covering Greene's life as a local legend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underwhelming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am very surprised at the good reviews this movie is receiving here. I was very excited to watch this but was very disappointed. The acting was brutal and that is being kind. Vincent D'Onofrio does not belong in another movie or TV show ever. Just terrible. And Ray Stevenson reminded me of Jeff Daniels in Dumb and Dumber. What a terrible decision for the lead role in this movie. I couldn't believe anything he did due to the goofy nature of his acting. The story itself is intriguing but it is tough to get over the acting. Danny Greene's rise to fame was not done well. It was done too quickly and made it seem thrown together. Don't expect much from this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know who has done visual effects for this film but as a professional in this field I can say that its not done well. The very first explosion scene screams CG and I could not help but notice more and more faults with this film and not just with effects. The shot in the end when he gives the boy the cross is so predictable that I laughed to myself. The overall acting is mediocre, I lost interest somewhere in the middle but forced myself watch it till the end. And I don't think budget has anything to do with the quality, the one who should take the fall for this failure is the director. To produce something this uninteresting with such cast is a crime. I don't recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst "Gangster" movie I've ever seen!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What the Hell were Chris Walken and Vincent D'onofrio thinking when they agreed to do this??? Dreadful acting mixed with unpromised plot make for a truly hideous film. Says it's rated R for violence etc, what a laugh! Every time you're about to get into some "Goodfellas" style face smashing, the camera pans away....unbelievable! Lead actor Ray Stevenson is shocking, trying to re-live Danny Greene's real-life trials. Biggest flop I have ever seen and it was painful watching from start to finish. Even Val Kilmer couldn't deliver a semi-decent scene. It amazes me how this movie managed to get some of the "old guard" mafia actors involved in such an awful score. Perhaps the script was appealing, but the production was none more authentic than watching a children's daytime show. AVOID!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could Have Been A Contender...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Borrowing (not enough) stylistically from Goodfellas and thematically from Casino (though also not enough), this is a fascinating story about an pivotal time in American history and the collision of old and new in the world of crime. It has all the elements of an epic tragedy and, in the hands of a good director, could have been nothing short of a masterpiece. All the parts were on the table.Unfortunately, despite an amazing, nationally covered, true story as a starting point, a fantastic soundtrack, excellent work by the DP and masterful supporting cast, who turn in great performances throughout, Jonathan Hensleigh has managed to squander all that and come up with something resembling a mediocre network TV movie, trying desperately hard and failing to capture the essence of the Irish gangster...(Danny)"Clean up this yard...and then repaint these steps". (Man Below) "What color do ya want them?" (Danny after hesitation) "Green!"(Walks in the door)CUT.) Ray Stevenson, reprising his performances in Rome, manages to resemble nothing so much as a Gallic Cigar Store Indian. Having said that, I don't fault Stevenson as much as Hensleigh, (after all not only did he agree to the casting, but with similar material, look at the performance Scorsese coached out of Ray Liotta) for an intolerably poor script. There is no development of character (except his wife leaving him for reasons neither we nor he ever understand), no interactions of any remembrance with a brilliant supporting cast, a general lack of anything resembling an ear for dialog and the use 1 dimensional character devices in lieu of said dialog or character development (The handed down of a cross from one, and then latter on to another character, both introduced just to imply Danny had a secret respect for the Church, "strong Irish women", small children and one presumes, dogs) . In fact, the whole film begs the question of what idiots gave Hensleigh (whose career is speckled by connection with some not bad films, but only after massive rewrites-Jumanji-seven writers, The Saint-four, the 2 and a half bucks he spent to make a mess of this otherwise perfect story.In fact, the even title (and I'm assuming it was all, contractually, that was left that the studio could touch) apparently got a rewrite... Is it Bullet Proof Gangster as the beginning and ending title credits say or is Kill The Irishman as it's been marketed.All in all, is it worth 2 hours? Well, it's a great story in the way Casino is a great story. Regardless of an appalling script, a tin ear for the spoken word, a less than comic book vision of the Irish soul and main characters who are at best uncompellingly portrayed, the facts alone still shine. So, if you don't mind saying that this could have been a really great film, if only not directed by a hack, then invest your 2 bucks and two hours and just don't go see another Hensleigh film and give away your dinner theater tickets for Stephenson in Othello.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well above-average mobster film , with a great cast.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a TV news producer in Cleveland in those days and remember very well the day Danny Greene died. I was bothered a bit by setting that scene in an urban area rather than a suburb. And the writer and/or director took a lot of dramatic license by having the kids in the parking lot at the time. But I liked his giving the boy his cross...almost as if he knew his time was up. I knew both of the local news reporters who were featured, including Brian Ross, now head of ABC TV' investigative unit. They producers did a good job in rounding up old news film and tape of Cleveland police cars and ambulances of that era. But I was bothered by the fact that when trash cans were needed, all they had were bright and shiny ones...they should have been painted a dirty gray, since that's the color they become in a couple of months. All in all, I give it a strong 7!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blown away by the mediocrity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My expectations were a little too high after seeing the trailer, Ray Stevenson did a great job you can't argue against that but overall there were too many clichés the supporting cast was terrible, familiar faces such as Val Kilmer, Vinnie Jones, Christopher Walken and Steve Schirripa were more distracting than anything. I felt like I was watching a bad mash-up of The Sopranos and The Wire. The mediocre supporting actor performances, script, story, characters. There are just too many good movies out there to recommend this one. If you were looking for the next Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch, Goodfellas, or Casino type mobster flick, go elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My 403rd Review: Surprisingly weaker than the cast and plot would suggest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This works a small-budget, but off-kilter gangster biography based in Cleveland in the 1970s. Kill The Irishman, spends an hour building up to a good last thirty minutes, but it certainly is not Goodfellas.The problems lies partially in a script that lacks imagination and chooses instead to deliver a linear plot that is frankly good at first but dulls after the first twenty minutes until it picks up again after the first hour; and secondly, and perhaps more seriously, the leads are only competent - what we get is exactly what another review had said - a made for TV film feeling on this - but nothing akin to big film.Given the cast and story perhaps more could have been done; all in all if crime is your favorite genre then you're going to enjoy this anyway - I was left bored by the first hour, and while the last half-hour is good the film never raises above a very simple and simplistic story. we never really get inside the mind or world of Danny Green - and it all feels very much as though we're just skimming the surface all the time.Good beer and pizza movie, but certainly no classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kill the Irishman: Clearly trying to be the next Goodfellas.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's based on a true story, which immediately notifies the audience that creative liberties will be generously taken. A rather impressive collaboration of regular gangster actors show up for Kill the Irishman, including Christopher Walken, Robert Davi, Vinnie Jones, Paul Sorvino, Mike Starr, and Steve Schirripa. Many of them give the movie a decidedly authentic feel, paired with a believable assortment of props and costumes. The problem with having so many convincing mobsters is that when actors unaccustomed to playing a hood step on screen, they're painfully obvious.In Cleveland in the 1960s, Danny Greene (Ray Stevenson, delivering a largely expressionless, monotonic performance) is on the rise to become a powerful man amidst organized crime. He's a workingman, and gains the respect of his comrades of the longshoreman's union, enabling him to oust the previous boss Jerry Merke (Bob Gunton), governed by the mafia, to become the president himself. He does this with very little effort, throwing around a few insults and slapping or fist fighting those in his way. Oddly, few put up a struggle ? when he battles Merke's hulking bodyguard, the man goes down without delivering a single punch. Some of the major problems with the film involve the great lengths traveled to make Greene seem tough, warrior-like or godly ? he's shown as a "Godfather" character who can rack up favors and connections, but also physically beat his opponents. In addition, he's a gangster with a heart."I never do this," implausibly whispers Greene's new girlfriend Joan Madigan (Linda Cardellini), a bartender, as they make love in the back of a car the first night they meet. Soon they're married, have two children, and the towering Irishman is arrested for extortion, racketeering and other methods of corruption. He's released when he agrees to give information regularly to Joe Manditski (Val Kilmer, looking as bloated and heavy as Orson Welles), a docks detective who keeps popping up just to narrate the tale. Kilmer rarely interacts in a crucial way with Greene, instead just offering up bits of voice-over narration to fill in gaps in details.Eventually, Greene is forced to look for work with Shondor Birns (Christopher Walken), a loan shark in need of new debt collectors. Throughout the 1970s, Greene regains his standing as a man not to be messed with, while also battling his morals and his desire to break free from the shady business he's immersed in. When a large loan set up by Shondor is seized by the cops, Greene upsets the mob and becomes the target of a $25,000 cash hit. Eight or so attempts are made on his life, but he's seemingly invincible, and fights back with a gang war that sees 36 bomb detonations in Cleveland in 1976 alone, continually leveling the playing field and the thugs working for each faction of crime.While Kill the Irishman is clearly trying to be the next Goodfellas, what with its subtle humor, use of violence to mend all situations, light narration, catchy music at all the right spots, plenty of montages and initial glamorization of the mafia, it fails with the storytelling and the cast. More supporting actors are believable over the leads, (the most offensive overacting and underacting comes from Vincent D'Onofrio, Tony Lo Bianco and Laura Ramsey) and the action, suspense and tone of the movie are as flat as Stevenson's inflectionless dialogue.- GoneWithTheTwins.com</fullReview>
