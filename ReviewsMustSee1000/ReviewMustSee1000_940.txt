		<shortDescription>Black and White and Gray All Over</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Bob Thornton has the perfect face for film noir. His craggy, drawn features lead up to sunken but large and staring eyes, and cheeks that look to be made out of plaster. Particularly when shot in black and white, his face becomes a landscape of shifting shadows, while he doesn't move a muscle. He is able to give the impression of a man at war with himself even while sitting perfectly still and staring ahead. He's Jeremy Irons, only without that unsettling accent. The Coen brothers take great advantage of their stars' granite physiognomy throughout "The Man That Wasn't There," constructing several shots around Thornton staring into a point just slightly away from the camera, impassive as an Easter Island head, moving only to smoke an ever-present cigarette while the obligatory noir voice-over narration runs. His voice is perfect, too: a kind of calm, measured rumbling, which describes incredible events but never seems amazed by them. Thornton says "I don't talk much," and it's true: he doesn't do much either, but he is still fascinating, and commands our attention.The Coens take great relish in the noir conventions, even beyond the 1940s setting and the black and white photography (let's face it, we're so used to '40s movies in black and white that color would look a little weird). The story follows classic lines (with a few wild divergences): Thornton's character is a barber in one of those small postwar California towns that Hitchcock was so enamored of. He comes up with a scheme to raise some money, which naturally spins a little beyond what he anticipated. That's all I can say in good conscience, and the plot goes pretty far afield (I mean REALLY far afield, catering to fans both of Dashiell Hammett and "Earth vs. the Flying Saucers"). But really, you know what to expect, if you've ever seen one of these movies before: greed, dark secrets, and murder, in a world of fedoras, cigarette smoke, snapping lighters, and deep moral turpitude. A world where nothing or no one is what they seem, and the only sure thing is that, in the end, some sap is gonna get it.As good as Thornton is, he can't carry the movie alone. Fortunately, he is surrounded by a top-notch cast, including a lot of familiar Coen veterans, and it is this that really makes this movie work. Michael Badalucco puts in a hilarious turn as Thornton's gabby brother-in-law, Frances McDormand is effective in her relatively few scenes as his brittle wife, and James Gandolfini plays yet another boorish tough guy to a turn. Practically shoplifting the movie is Tony Shalhoub, playing a fast-talking Sacramento lawyer who doesn't so much speak as summate. His discussion of Heisenberg is almost worth the ticket price alone. Christopher Kriesa and Brian Haley get a lot of mileage out of their brief appearances as a pair of slightly dim cops (aren't they all in these movies?)Joel Coen, who directed, makes sure that the movie is consistently interesting to watch, too. Black and white photography being mostly about shades of gray, noir is perhaps the only genre that benefits from the relative primitiveness of its visual technology. Coen, therefore, sticks with it, unlike the colors he used in the '30s themed "O Brother Where Art Thou?" which managed to be both more fanciful and less surreal than this movie. He uses the light-and-shadow character of black and white to great effect here, carefully crafting his images to make best use of it. In fact, if the movie has a fault, it's that the images are a little TOO carefully crafted. The purest noir was cleverly filmed, but it allowed its cleverness to seep into the background. You have to watch a few times to pick up on how sharp the filmmaking is. Coen is unable to hide his arty cleverness, and so in the end, fun as it is to watch, the movie is a bit too pretty to truly capture the essence of its forbears. Perhaps realizing this, the Coens tweak the conventions mercilessly, and inject a streak of humor that is funnier for being played so straight (there are lots of funny lines, but don't be surprised if you are the only one in the theater laughing. Actually, don't be surprised if you are the only one in the theater, period.) The movie does require a bit of patience; the pacing is intense but quite slow, and the story wanders like a drunk driver. In the end, it is somewhat debatable whether the twisty plot is fully resolved, or whether that even matters. "The Man That Wasn't There" is best viewed as a wicked cinematic joke, and in that regard, it succeeds, in (Sam) spades.But what do I know? I'm just some sap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is beautifully and refreshingly unpretentious. It is acted and filmed with grace and delicacy. This is the kind if movie we hope to find while sitting through most of the glitz and superficiality that gets made. Without question worth eight bucks, and two hours of your evening. Score another one for the Coen brothers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an interesting contribution to the Coen's ouvre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this to be a pretty interesting film by the Coens'. I was well aware of the ability to do noir, as evidenced by 'Blood Simple', as well as many-layered, dialogue-driven narratives as in 'Miller's Crossing.' But what I found intriging about this movie was that it was about inconsequence. Billy Bob Thornton's character, Ed Crane, is similar to William H. Macy's in 'Fargo.' Both have unsatisfying positions in lowly lives. Both had received their jobs by "marrying" into them- Ed at the Barber Shop, and William's at the car dealership. The difference is, whereas the kidnapping plot is sought out in "Fargo", the blackmailing plot falls into Ed's lap by sheer choice (luck? fate?) Ed's just a guy who wants to improve his lot in life- nothing too different then you or me. His wife's affair simply gives him the opportunity to do so. He didn't mind the infidelity, it is after all " a free country." But, of course, if she was faithful, there would be no noirish plot to pursue, correct? Quiet ambition drives Ed. After the dry-cleaning attempt goes sour, he sets his sights of Scarlett Johansenn's (who is quite remarkable) character's piano playing ability, in hopes of becoming her manager and "making enough to get by." Thornton's "Ed Crane" really is the man who wasn't there. He sits- nearly brooding- quietly, observing life laconically. I actually found this movie quite sad. In the end, the only one who cares about his story is a men's magazine. And that's another big difference from 'Fargo" in which the pregnant Frances McDormand curls up with her husband, and you feel as if everything is just right in the world. That feeling is definitely lacking from "The Man Who Wasn't There." Some viewers in the theater I saw it at said it was "the funniest movie they've seen all year." Sadly, I think they're missing it. Most of the humor is typical Coen's deadpan, but it is mostly generated from a tone of unease and tension. It's clever, but you waon't be slapping your knees like in "Raising Arizona" or "The Big Lewboski." Instead, you'll just be intrigued by the wonderful story that the Coens- who have become quite the master of their craft- have weaved in this beautifully textured, perfectly cast, and incredibly nuanced film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the Coen brothers best, a film that becomes a masterpiece after a while.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joel and Ethan Coens' The Man Who Wasn't There doesn't (how could it) top their first film-noir classic Blood Simple, but it is still an incredibly stylish and acted with pizazz type of film which should definitely get better with multiple viewings. Billy Bob Thornton turns in another top shelve job (geniusly subtle, even for him) as a quiet and observant barber named Ed, who gets drawn into an unfortunate string of events with his wife (Frances McDormand) who has cheated on him with Big Dave (James Gandolfini who in his scattered minutes on the screen shows his ability for Oscar nomination-type work) and with the usual line of events that would come from a noir comes compelling characters and set-pieces that show's Ed in a downfall though it is from a life the never wanted to lead in the first place. If Sartre decided to throw out the politics and religion and stick to the being and nothingness and write a hard-boiled novel, this might be it.In short, the Coen Brothers have once again struck a little gem in the rough, shot in black and white and stylized to a T. I feel like picking up a Cain book after watching this. And, on top of this, on repeat viewings I can say that it becomes even more engrossing, and just a bit more entertaining if really ready to dig into the atmosphere. It may be thick enough to kill a few stray kittens, but it's got a genuine pathos to it too. And just when you think there isn't enough Coen strangeness, wait till the aliens arrive. A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant Billy Bob Thornton</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a difference a good director makes! Billy Bob Thornton, who was sadly misused in Bandits, gets to recover himself in his brilliant characterization of Ed Crane in this film directed by Joel Coen. His performance is so detailed and subtle that he uses his face to great advantage in the close-ups while the narration goes on in the background. The use of black and white heightens the atmosphere of this 40s-style film noir. The brilliant cinematography is incredible in the use of shadows and dark tones that enhances the story to such an extent. Frances McDormand is incredible in the film as well. And what could one say about James Gandolfini? He gets better and better all the time. The atmosphere of the era is captured even in the small details. It's very refreshing to see the Coen brothers get over their last disaster of "State and Main" with such panache, aided of course by their star, Billy Bob Thornton and the ensemble cast and a great and ironic story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great pastiche of the noir genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ed Crane is a barber who quietly wants more from his life. When he meets a man with a business proposition he decides to go for it. He suspects his wife is having an affair with her boss and anonymously blackmails him ? however things in noir are never straightforward and blackmail leads to murder and a series of events are sparked off around Ed.I must say I'm surprised this is as high up the imdb charts as it is, but I'm not surprised by the lukewarm reception it had from multiplex audiences. This is a slow, moody homage where things just happen, rather than a neat `start-middle-tidy finish-bad guy dies' type thing. The Cohen brothers have a reputation for the old quirks and here is no different ? mixing the steady noir narration with talk of haircuts and bingo makes for a strange if humorous mix. The plot is good but the noir feel mixed with weird going-ons may alienate many audiences.Thornton is a perfect choice ? his features fit well in the black and white shadows and his voice suits the noir narration. McDormand is good and Gandolfini gets another good role and does well. The support is very good ? Badalucco, Shalhoub, Polito are all very good. Some elements of it are like a spot the TV face ? we have Benrubi from ER, Higgins from Ally McBeal and Abundas from Six Feet Under all in small roles. It's even nice to see a cameo from McDonald.Overall this isn't as funny as it was billed, simply because it is a noir. As such the Cohens mix the familiar themes of that genre with all new subjects and create a great effect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A living, breathing specimen of a species we thought had been extinct for decades</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sorry, but I like my black and white black and white - ESPECIALLY in a film that sets out to be the most pure film noir of all. The shadows should be, simply, black, not black tinted with dark green. The greys should be, simply, grey, not pearl grey or slate grey or any of the other shades of paint-catalogue grey that are the result (I presume) of trying to make a black and white film without using any actual black and white film. I don't know the precise technological explanation; I do know that the film would be at least twice as good if the Coens would simply take the master print and transfer it to whatever material they use when they screen, say, "Double Indemnity". This is not hyperbole.Not that it's not good already. Joel Coen, who in "O Brother, Where Art Thou" showed himself to be one of the few living directors capable of fully exploiting colour, shows himself here to be one of the few living directors capable of fully exploiting light and shade. I particularly liked the scene where the defence lawyer explains why if we look at something too closely, we fail to see it, while his face (and only his face) is bathed in JUST enough too much light to prevent us from seeing it properly. It sounds academic, but it works: the Coens never use an idea if they can't make it breathe.As a rule, first-person narration breathes life into books but kills films - with the exception of one genre: film noir. And the Coens understand why it works, when it does, in this rare exception. Like most noir protagonists, Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thornton) is almost perfectly uncommunicative: neither his conversation nor his actions tell us anything about him. We need direct access to his very thoughts, put into words, to be able to understand what's going on and to appreciate his story. And it's only fitting that we're allowed to listen to him as HE takes stock of his own story, for the very first time, now that it's all over. -And maybe the Coens don't even need this justification. Ethan has written what may be the most delicious, perceptive and apt first-person voice-over the genre has seen."The Man Who Wasn't There" is not as magnificent an achievement as "Barton Fink" or "O Brother, Where Art Thou" - but then, no noir film is. (It's really a constricting genre; Billy Wilder's finest works aren't noir, either.) The fact that there are so many good noir films should be regarded as a miracle. Here is another miracle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Inexorable Hand of Fate.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Noir has always been about people caught in circumstances where there seems to be no way out and one bad decision may spawn a series of events that eventually catch up with the people involved.In this story, Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thornton, channeling Humphrey Bogart through his looks and Fred MacMurray through his voice-overs) is the victim of his own life. Caught in a dysfunctional marriage of apparent convenience to Doris (Frances McDormand), working a dead-end job as a barber with her brother, going through life like a shadow (people have a tendency to forget his name), he also suspects Doris may be having an affair with her boss Big Dave (played by James Gandolfini). When a deal comes by which could make him some big money, he thinks he will carry this through and get some revenge towards his wife. Things go wrong -- the man with whom he has jumped into a shady business has disappeared -- and Crane accidentally (or out of rage) commits a murder which lands Doris in jail.To say more of the story would be to reveal twists and turns of the plot as it advances towards its full-circle and those must be experienced instead of told in a "review." But suffice to say, every action generates a consequence, and even plot threads which had been apparently been dropped eventually re-surface with tremendous, almost painful irony and remind us that noir is an unforgiving genre, unkind to its characters, cruel to the extreme. If at times the story seems a tad long it's in the subplot involving Scarlett Johansson who coats the movie with a Lolita-esquire persona as her character essays a tentative affair with Crane; however, even that storyline feeds into Crane's retribution at the end.Gorgeous black and white, textured use of deep-focus, this is a movie Gregg Toland would have loved to have his hands on had this been 1941 instead of 2001. THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE could be called stylistic in its frank depiction of textbook noir (James Cain comes to mind), but the Coen brothers make it work all the way through with smart direction, scenes that smolder, and a touch of their own unique humor interspersed here and there. Not their best but very, very close.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great neo-noir film by the Coen brothers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen too many films by the Coen brothers(Ethan and Joel Coen)... in fact, this and Intolerable Cruelty are the only ones I've seen. I decided to see this after hearing many positive things about it, and finding out that it's a tribute to the old 'noir' films of the 40's and 50's. I love noir films, and neo-noir films are often great as well. So I decided to see this film, and I'm am very happy that I did. The plot is great... something that we all can relate to, and yet very recognizable for noir... which is quite impressive, since many noir films suffer from the plot being of limited appeal(the P.I./detective who gets *the* case, etc.). The pacing is excellent. I wasn't bored for a second. The atmosphere of the film is great... very dark and moody, even in the humor. The acting is great... Thornton, McDormand, Gandolfini, Johansson, Shalhoub... everyone is great. Billy Bob Thornton's character is easy to relate to(who hasn't felt that their life wasn't going anywhere, at one point?) and his narration as well as flawless performance is part of what makes the film noir... his character talks very little, but the voice-over and his subtle acting(which includes very little dialog) is great and he carries the movie perfectly. The characters are all well-written... there was only a short period where I didn't entirely understand a characters actions, but this was more because I hadn't thought that much about this particular character than a lack of credibility, character-wise. The story is great... it has some very interesting twists, and it holds your interest and entertains you for the entire run-time of about 1 hour and 45 minutes. The humor is good, but there is fairly little of it in the film(considering that this is what the Coen's are well-known for... well, part of it, anyway) but all of it fits perfectly. Much of it is dark, like the rest of the film. I watched this on a DVD which I borrowed from the library, and when I was about to start the film, I noticed that there were two disks... one in black/white, and one in color. I thought for a while, considered which would be better, but then I remembered that this is a homage to noir films... and, possibly more importantly, the directors intention is to make something that looks as if it could have come from that period where those films were at the peak of popularity... and why would I want to go against the directors intention on a film? That would negate the very point of watching it. All in all, if you're a fan of the Coen brothers directorial style or neo-noir/film noir, you'll most likely love it as much as I did. If not, maybe you can just enjoy the great acting and atmosphere. And if not that, the film probably just isn't for you. I recommend it to any fan of the Coen brothers and of film noir/neo-noir. Fans of any of the actors might also like it. Just be prepared; it is quite dark, and many will not like it simply for that. If you believe you can sit through this film, you definitely should consider it. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Besides being great stuff for film maniacs who like to debate the technical aspects, the cinematography or the artistic ideas and influences in it, 'The Man Who Wasn't There' is also a great film. One of my all-time favorites. The sort of film where the best possible choice of cast plays even the most insignificant walk-on role. The Coens' signature in there: being visually very conscious, especially for their film noir venture, they must have spent a huge amount of time to find the best possible faces for every single shot. Not necessary to waste words on how well they did in their choices for the lead roles. Fortunately these 'faces' they collected can also act, everyone does incredibly well here.'The Man Who Wasn't There' has a slowly developing story, that at first viewing may require your patience a little bit. But the second and third viewings and so on will be a lot smoother... I have seen the film about five or six times already. There's this weird TV channel that screens it just about every other week and I seem to always happen to be in front of the screen at the time, by mere chance. And I never zap away, I enjoy all the details more and more, and I feel the gloating that's there in the very cold, cruel humor of the film, as well as the saddening feeling it accumulates into, as you continue watching people acting as mere unidentified flying objects in the others' life, just as strongly as the first time.</fullReview>

Beethoven was and is the greatest composer ever. and the songs of carter burwell are awesome, not only in this movie, in every movie of the coen-brothers.i recently read in a comment on this movie, that someone could not imagine that somebody around the age of 25 votes high for this movie. I'm 21 and there was nothing that disturbed me.without doubt the man who wasn't there is one of my favorite movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh the Coen Brothers, how we cant live without you...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This newest film by the Coen brothers is a masterpiece by all standards in my opinion. Once again the Coens have succeeded in doing what they have done in all 8 of their previous movies, making a simple story more interesting than you could ever imagine possible!Billy Bob Thornton adds to the noir atmosphere with his superb emotionless portrayal of the barber (of the title) Ed Crane. Essays could be written just on the way he smokes his cigarette! Of course the Coens have recalled other faces from their little black book of actors-we'll-use-again-in-some-small-part. Jon Polito is truly very annoying (in a good way) in his role as someone trying to sell a dry cleaning idea to Thornton (and you never thought dry cleaning could be interesting?). Whereas Tony Shalhoub is a humorous addition as the ridiculously confusing attorney. How can we also forget Mrs Joel Coen, aka Frances McDormand. As Thorntons wife she excels and towards the end shows real emotion and acting prowess as seen previously in Fargo and Blood Simple.The fact that this film was shot in black and white is a first for the Coens and adds a 1940's atmosphere that no color film could do. The denouement is an excellent study of Crane's life with his emotionless voice over accompanying it.Overall, this film is an example of what film should be. With the crew and cast an example of what a film cast and crew should be. How This film was nominated for no Oscars is criminal, especially Thornton. However the Coens had their usual Cannes reception to fall back on (Cannes is the only one that counts for REAL movies anyway!). Winning the directors prize (shared) for Joel Coen, although as always with the Coens, where Joel goes, Ethan follows, so the credit is really to both of them.10/10 In my opinion the Coens best work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chic Nihilism: Woody Allen with Style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The task of art today is to bring chaos into order." - Theodor AdornoThe Coens start by selecting genres, and then colliding them. So while a film like "The Big Lebowski" merges film noir with stoner comedies, and "Burn After Reading" merges the 1970s conspiracy thriller with 1930's screwball, "The Man Who Wasn't There" instead takes the tropes of 1940/50's noir and mingles them with 1950's UFO flicks and early science fiction B movies.Billy Wilder's noirs are homaged here, but the chief influence is Hitchcock, the film taking place in the same town as that of Hitchcock's "Shadow of a Doubt", the film's lead character sporting the name Edward Crane ("Psycho") and the film's title seemingly alluding to "The Wrong Man".Their genres selected, the Coens typically cook up some reoccurring visual motif which links the genres being homaged. Here, saucers, wheels and smoke replace the bowling pins and tumbleweeds of "Lebowski", the hats of "Miller's Crossing" and the circles and hoops of "Hudsucker".Though their films are played with a straight face, the Coens' films are all postmodern comedies or pranks on the audience. For example, though treated as being "serious genre works", "Fargo" was farce pretending to be fact, the Coens seeing how "far" they can "go" with the audience, and the supposedly "serious" "True Grit" is a parody of Charles Portis' parody, both intentionally with no "true grit". Even a more outlandish film like "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" is an elaborate prank, the film a meta-parody of both the film within "Sullivan's Travels" and Homer's Odyssey. Ironically, most people take these films dead seriously and as "deep art".But regardless of the genres being homaged, at their core every Coen film alternates between noir and screwball comedy, the chaotic nature of the screwball genre meshing with the tragic, indeterministic nature of noir. Noir being screwball without the comedy. Think Woody Allen's "Melinda and Melinda", in which the same plot is told twice, once as comedy and once as tragedy, the point being that life is itself an absurd, pointless, comic tragedy.The feeling of "pointlessness" which permeates every Coen flick is itself the chief tenet of postmodernism, which denies absolute truth, revels in nihilism, relativism, surface re-arrangement, sarcasm, homage, pastiche, irony and adheres to French philosopher's Jacques Derrida's understanding of language, in which words and images have no meaning and are viciously self-limited. If you believe theorists, who predict that postmodern art, before it is fully supplanted by the era of cyber interactivity, is destined to reach the point at which it mirrors the universe it believes in - total randomness, utter nihilism (ie the universe of noir) and an aesthetic of schizophrenia (in which cinema degenerates to a string of references, not only increasingly divorced from a reality which is itself lost, but repeatedly digested by amnesic consumers) - then surely cinema has already reached this point. Indeed, the Coens, like Woody Allen, Charlie Kaufman and Todd Solondz, now exclusively make films about the world being "about" nothing other than cold, cosmic causality. I list these directors, though, not because their oeuvres are almost entirely about "the meaningless of all things", but because they all play formalist games about this "nothingness". Trapped in an intellectual dead end, they are unable to do anything other than serve up delightfully inventive ways to tell stories about...the pointlessness of telling stories.In any case, "The Man Who Wasn't There" marks the point at which the subtext of all Coen films starts being brought to the forefront. From here on we would get "The Ladykillers", "No Country", "Burn After Reading" and "A Serious Man", all films in which the Coens turn away from the world and soliloquise over the vacuity of existence and the cruel hilarity of the universe.Like the Coens' best films, though, "Man" is helmed by an actor who refuses to allow his character to be turned into a mere victim or buffoon. Here, Billy Bob Thornton plays Edward Crane, a stoic small town barber who gets embroiled in a noir plot which, like most noirs, is designed to highlight his utter uselessness as a man.More than a noir victim, though, Crane embodies the Superfluous Man, living life without purpose or direction and moaning about the way hair always grows back no matter how much he cuts. Where does it come from, he asks us. Why doesn't it stop? The ubiquitous hair, of course, embodies Crane's impotency. By the film's end he thus becomes dejected ("The facts have no meaning," Crane mopes), realises that he makes no difference in the world and becomes resigned to the fact that he may as well be invisible, or even dead, as hair ultimately grows on without him.Like "A Serious Man", much of the film is spent mentioning things like "Schrodinger's Cat" and "The Uncertainty Principle", the point being that things change when observed, that free agency is an illusion, that everything Crane does is nullified by an opposite circumstance and that we're all better off just "abiding" with the flow. The Coens even throw in a long monologue in a prison cell, in which a rambling character sums up the very point of Heisenberg and Schrodinger for us. It's outdated existentialism, everything directly spelt out.Aesthetically the film is great, filled with moody blacks and whites, stark "pop-art" images and beautifully lit smoke. Thornton comes across as a morose Bogart, his character endearing next to the Coens' usual cocktail of motor mouthed oddballs and dangerous fat men. The film's use of black and white and UFOs is also very clever. It was shot in colour and then had its colours removed, suggesting Crane's own disappearance or existential fade out, whilst the UFOs and the constant threat of alien abduction foreshadow Crane's fated vanishing.8/10 ? Stylish, but heavy-handed and thin. Watch Ray's "In A Lonely Place" to see pessimism done right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Looking at Things Changes Them</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.It has long been an accepted film studies proverb that films are seldom about life, but about other films. The Coens are the leading champions of this in their art. Every film is about the filmmaking process, the whole process that includes how we tuck it away and use it in our lives.So all their films are about this process. They apparently only let the actors see the miniscule part of that process that they need to know. Billy Bob, for instance clearly believes that the film is a story about him, and the material on the DVD confirms this fiction. But the brothers laugh at Bob's insignificance just as they laugh at Ed's. (Last time around, they jerked Clooney's chain in just the same way as events in the story jerk his character.)This is all metafilm, and part of the game is to tease out threads and images and characters and names. The joke is all on the reuse of this stuff. We base our life on these images, and we can only do so because we do not know that we do. The more we examine it the less natural they seem, so that guy Fritz or Werner tells us. The real narrator is the lawyer.I'm darn glad these guys were around. But at a certain level of exposure, they've made their point. But they are young men yet and someday they might turn all this oneiric mastery to actually change us. Change us, that is, in a more profound way than simply showing us what slaves to the filmed image we are.The Black and White is not. Rather it is shot on color stock, then printed as B/W on color stock. I believe it is done this way as a matter of keeping with economies of scale, but a serendipitous effect occurs -- on the screen but not the DVD which just turns everything to dark green. But on the screen the result is rather like the whites and greys of snow. These appear white from far away, but in fact are millions of points of color. A big white movie screen will do this anyway as a result of the refractive physics of the silica. But the effect is greatly enhanced using black on color stock. Subliminally hypnotizing, and -- some theorize -- the phenomenon behind many UFO encounters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though frequently advertised so, this film is not about a plan that goes wrong.This film is about pictures. It is in black and white to let you focus on the different shades of gray. Don't think of old, low quality films from the beginning of the movies. This is high-quality pictures, exploring the full range of contrasts. Think of black and white photographs showing close-ups of faces, where you can see so many details of the skin. In fact, all the scenes are so carefully composed you might have the impression of looking at an artistic photographer album.(From a technical point of view, you may use the film for optimum adjustment of contrast and brightness of your TV set.)Speaking of composition, quite a few scenes reminded me of Sin City. I wonder how much Robert Rodriguez was inspired by this film.Apart from the great pictures, this film is from the perspective of its main actor, a stupid, cowardish, selfish and lonely barber. Even so, you'll like him.I'll stop here. Watch this movie and be impressed. The Coen's rule!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Small gem of a film.......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Coen Brothers are arguably the best film makers working today and this film proves it once again. Shot in black &amp; white the film follows seamlessly in the tradition of the classic film noirs that came before it and adds its own Coensian twist. The performances are top notch with a stand out by lead Billy Bob Thorton. The movie should have been nominated for Best Picture! What's wrong with these Academy Members anyway???? Instead A Beautiful Mind (HUGELY overrated) grabbed its spot. As for the noms for Best Actor in a lead role that year, overrated performances by Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe robbed Thorton of his nomination. The Man Who Wasn't There is stylish and beautifully paced, wrapping it's timing around a bit of classical music from Bethoven that's played throughout the movie. Also a nice chance to see an early performance by up and coming Scarlett Johansson in a small but important part. Could quite possibly top my list of favorite Coen Brothers Movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautifully shot "Film Noir" in black and white but with colorful characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 2002 Cohen brothers film is a delight. "The Man Who Wasn't There" combines everything I like in the Coen brother's unique way of telling a story. From the comic of the situation witnessed in the famous "O Brother Where Art Though" (2000) to the originality of the scenario seen in "Barton Fink" (1991), not to mention the singularity of the characters and their lack of control over the situation in the excellent "Fargo" (1996), all those "hints" have been gathered to built this well thought story. Joel and Ethan directed and wrote this picture about a bored and boring chain-smoking barber admirably played by Billy Bob Thornton (best role for this under-rated actor)who blackmails his wife's boss and lover for money to invest in dry cleaning. As you sense the plan goes terribly wrong. I believe this story is a pretext to show us how little is our grip on the reality of our lives. And to demonstrate how justice easily becomes a comico-pathetic masquarade when given by men. On the contrary true Justice eventually lies in the wrinkles of men's destiny. As a conclusion you are better off expecting a landing of an alien spaceship than a fair and clear trial in a court of law. Whether we agree or not to this demonstration, it does not take away the pleasure of watching these terrific actors putting into play the original and dark scenario of the two brothers. Billy Bob Thornton is a master portraying to perfection Ed Crane (the laconic barber). Since Dead Man (1995) I don't recall a lot of movies where directors have capitalized on his enormous talent. Frances McDormand (Doris Crane) is as usual fantastic. We remember her in Wonder Boys (2000) and of course as the sheriff in Fargo (1996). Here she plays wonderfully the barber's wife going from bitterness to sorrow. Some characters can be seen as "cliche" like Freddy Riedenschneider the lawyer played by the good Tony Shalhoub, however they are all enjoyable to watch: James Gandolfini is terrific as "Big Dave" and Jon Polito very colorful as Creighton Tolliver, not to forget the very talkative and sincere Michael Badalucco as Franck Raffo or the great job done by Scarlett Johansson in the role of Rachael 'Birdy' Abundas the not very straight and quiet adolescent you would expect. The Black and White picture is more an artistic exploration from the Coen brothers and I don't think has anything to do with the chosen period (late 40's). However the black and white picture is very well shot by Roger Deakins and impose tremendously well Billy Bob Thornton's character and therefore never becomes a burden for the audience. "The Man Who Wasn't There" does not belong to any genre in particular. The Movie is made of a myriads of genres and characters that the Coen brothers have managed to master throughout their career of story tellers. The movie is a "film Noir" but not only, it is a dark comedy but not only, it is a light thriller but not only, it is shot in black and white but still have colorful characters, it tells a simple story of a laconic barber but there is more to it, eventually Justice will prevail but not the way we think it will. In the end it is a unique movie and in times where everything seems to look the same this movie becomes a true jewel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Film That Wasn't There - (contains spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The closer you look, the less you know. This is the favorite parable of the nihilist attorney, Freddy Riedenschneider, in The Man Who Wasn't There. It almost doubles as the theme; you just have to tweak the last part. The closer you look, the less there is. The Coen Brothers' latest offering plays like a David Lynch piece that never made it off the shelf. At face value is a film with some of the most talented actors around today, with the smallest yet most dynamic role going to James Gandolfini. Upon closer inspection, however, is a film that isn't there. It is tediously long, bogged down in narration, has no redeeming characters, and fumbles through excessive, uninteresting subplots. It is as if there were four different editors, all in conflict about where and when to end the movie. Billy Bob Thornton's main character has all the enthusiasm of a dying Eeyore. Something seemingly haunts his character but we never find out his interests in life or anything about his past and, thus, have little interest in his future. So he falls into some extreme bad luck and is finally convicted and killed, not to mention everyone else. His bad luck is over the top, however, and we, as an audience, cannot relate to it in a context other than a weird Coen Brothers film. Further, we have little sympathy for him when he dies because he was never alive. The other characters, which are virtually all killed off, have the same lack of a lust for life. Why Thornton's character is the main focus remains a mystery, because he is actually the most boring of them all. You can always count on great, quirky performances in a Coen Brothers movie, but unfortunately there is little more than confusion and uninspired surrealism beneath the black and white surface of this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 21st Century Classic Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aficionados of classic film noir will find this 21st century evocation of the style absolutely captivating right from the start as stunning cinematography, an uneasy atmosphere and a plot in which adultery, blackmail and murder are featured, all provide early indications of how meticulously the look and content of the piece have been created. Its story about a man who makes an error of judgement that sends his life into a downward spiral will, of course, be familiar to noir fans but in this case, the adverse consequences are so far-reaching that they also go on to devastate the lives of a number of other key characters as well.Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thornton) is the laconic, chain-smoking, barber with a blank stare who mans the second chair at his brother-in-law's hairdressing business in Santa Rosa, California in 1949. His reticence and apparent lack of enthusiasm also spill over into his personal life where he seems to derive no joy from the parties or bingo sessions that he attends with his wife Doris (Frances McDormand) who's a heavy drinker and works as a bookkeeper at the town's largest department store (Nirdlinger's). She and her boss, Big Dave (James Gandolfini) who married into the business and claims to have been a war hero, have been having an affair for some time.One day, at the barber's shop, near closing time, a stranger called Creighton Tolliver (Jon Polito) calls by for a haircut and after removing his toupee, tells Ed that he's trying to set up a dry-cleaning business which is guaranteed to be profitable but he needs a silent partner and $10,000 capital to go ahead with the project. After giving the matter some thought, Ed successfully raises the money by blackmailing his wife's lover and immediately passes the cash on to Tolliver.From that point on, things go from bad to worse as Ed realises he's been scammed, kills Big Dave in self defence and sees Doris arrested for murder and cooking the books at Nirdlinger's. The numerous developments that follow are full of wonderful twists, black humour and tragedy and lead inexorably to the story's deeply ironic conclusion.In typical Coen Brothers' style, the movie's characters are full of interesting eccentricities, the dialogue is smart and succinct and there are also a couple of entertaining subplots involving UFOs and Ed's fascination with a teenage piano player called Birdy (Scarlett Johansson). Billy Bob Thornton's portrayal of Ed Crane is flawless as he manages to make his difficult character very real and convincing. The supporting players are also terrific, especially Frances McDormand, James Gandolfini and Tony Shalhoub who plays a high-powered defence lawyer whose considerable talent in only surpassed in magnitude by his incredible arrogance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another great achievement by the Coens.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another step on me realizing that the Coens have got to be insanely high among my favorite directors. Their work is so diverse and completely original, from the mainstream and even from their other films. They have a particular style to them that always works so well, yet each of their films is a completely different experience from their last. The Man Who Wasn't There is a late-40s, black and white, noir character study of a dull barber named Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thornton) who is much more complex than we are led to believe. Living his day-by-day life is dull and pointless to him. He's at a job that he never wanted to have, alienates himself in his own little world of quiet vacancy while everyone around him talks at a thousand miles an hour about things that have absolutely no interest to him. When a charismatic businessman comes to town and tells him about the new craze of dry cleaning that he needs a partner to go into business with.Crane sees this as his big opportunity to escape his meaningless life and uses his wife's (Frances McDormand) affair with her boss (James Gandolfini) to exploit him for $10,000. But it's this relatively simple act that sets the entire story aflame and ends in tragedy for every single character involved. I won't spoil anything, but each character seems to have karma working against them and in the end they all get what's coming to them. The Coens usual brand of very dark humor is abundant here and I got a huge kick out of it, namely through the utter plainness of Ed. The courtroom scenes drew me out of the experience a bit and while the subplots with UFOs and a young pianist named Birdy (Scarlett Johannson) add a great deal to the story they felt a bit misplaced for a noir of this nature. That being said they do add a lot of complexity to the character of Ed Crane; the dull barber who's so much more than he seems. I'd also like to mention that, as always, Roger Deakins' cinematography is completely top-notch and further proves that he is in a league far superior to anyone else in his field of work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>monochrome masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What an interesting film. I picked this up at my local supermarket to-day. Ninety-nine pence, less than one pound from the bargain bin. As soon as I saw Billy-Bob was in it (I'm a fan after Monster's Ball &amp; A Simple Plan) I thought it would be a good idea. The fact that the Coen Brothers were behind the film sold it to me - last of the big spenders eh?It was a VHS cassette, in black &amp; white monochrome. The atmosphere was set from the start. The narrative from Thornton was delivered in such gravelly , gravitas laden tones it just made you sit up and take notice. How evocative were the props in the way of old barber shop fittings and the drop dead gorgeous cars - big old American gas guzzlers ,as aerodynamic as refrigerators some of 'em but boy did they look good. I have no idea where this movie would have been set. I would guess probably the mid-west somewhere but I could be hopelessly wrong.It was a splendidly interwoven plot with great contributions from all the cast. I was surprised to see a young Scarlett Johannsen in this film, I don't know much about her and have only seen one of her other roles (Lost in Translation) but she had something about her here. The feeling I had reminded me of first seeing Jack Nicholson in Easy Rider , three decades after its first release. It was obvious Nicholson would go on to stardom. This was Scarlett's 'Easy Rider' in my opinion. Her actions in causing the accident was a little bit out of character for me but maybe I'm just naive. Fifty-five years old, but still happily naive !The sombre, austere lighting and spartan sets created an air of simplicity and this film was just made for the black &amp; white medium.Holding my attention from start to finish this unusual piece of work will not be enjoyed by everyone, but if you have some depth, do not always need crash, bang and wallop to enjoy your cinema then I recommend it highly.</fullReview>

Shot totally in black and white it follows the downward spiral of a barber who blackmails his cheating wife's partner in order to raise money for an investment. He could not have foreseen how things would pan out. There are no special effect shoot out scenes, no stupid car chases ? this is a movie for people who can think and follow a plot as it twists and turns. Every character is completely absorbing and believable ? in fact the entire film held me riveted. Beethoven sonatas are sensitively played here and there in the background ? these were obviously carefully chosen as they add to the atmosphere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a departure for the Coen Brothers! I didn't quite know what to expect of this movie, but I got something even better. What I got was as well-made black-and-white drama, which contains a brilliant performance from Billy Bob Thornton who plays a barber with no lust for murder. But, after accidentally killing someone, he's tried for it. But he denies that he ever deliberately murdered anyone. No one really believes him, and therefore, he's executed in the end.Now, don't think that there's no humor in this. There are funny scenes in this movie, such as a guy taking off his wig before getting a haircut. A very contradicting scene, but still funny regardless. Anyway, see this movie.

		<fullReview>..but that was not what I thought when I saw this movie the first time.-Minor spoilers-The first time I saw this movie, was january this year. I couldn't sit the whole movie through. Being a Coen-bros fan, I couldn't stand that I so much disliked this movie, so I rented it again and saw it a couple of times and now I think it is one of the best movies I know, ever.What I like so much about the movie? (a) The story; Some people say that this movie is boring, but I think it's supposed to be boring. Because the main character (Crane, Ed Crane) is a very gray man, who doesn't talk that much. Underneath that he seems to have dark but also bright thoughts about certain important things in life. The story is like Ed Crane: boring but very interesting. (b) The characters; Like in most of the Coen-bros films (I haven't seen them all yet because some are very hard to get in the Netherlands) this movie contains very well written characters. Sometimes you see something, what you first think is an unnecessary detail, but later on you figure out the reason why the filmmakers pointed that out. I always like the Coen bros films because of the wealthy character-profiles. (c) The humour; Also you have to view this movie a couple of times to get (and find) all the jokes. Some of them are very enjoyable but mostly it contains dark and subtle humor. (d) The acting; B.B Thornton's performance of the chain-smoking Crane is unbelievable. When I saw Bandits after this movie, where B.B. Thornton plays a different character then in this movie, I found it hard to believe that it was the same actor. The other actors are also pretty impressive.I can go on with this for hours, but I think when you at least like one of the other Coen films, there's possibility that you'll also think this one is a masterpiece. But, like me, you have to give it some time and a couple of viewings.(CB-movies that I've seen: Fargo, the Big Lebowski, the Man who wasn't there, O brother where are thou, Raising Arizona)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie. I made some inquiries</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this 2001 offering from the enigmatic Coen brothers, Billy Bob Thornton gives the performance of a lifetime as Ed Crane, a barber in 1940's California. Ed is perpetually emotionless, hardly ever speaks and smokes cigarettes constantly. Billy Bob Thornton completely disappears into this role. The subtlety of his performance mixed with the brilliant cinematography of Roger Deakins makes every shot seem somehow a little bit creepy. Watching Ed brood and sulk in black and white, shot after shot, cigarette between his lips, is like watching someone commit a slow suicide, but in a fascinating way. You could almost call this a horror movie, about a man's journey into a strange, silent madness. This is a masterpiece of a character study."Hey Frank. This hair. You ever wonder about it? It keeps on growing. It's part of us. And we cut it off and throw it away."Throughout the film his life slowly unravels due to a botched blackmail scheme that goes horribly wrong, and Ed can only sit by and watch it all fall apart and wonder why. Ed's wife Doris, played by Frances McDormand, ends up being arrested and Ed hires an expensive lawyer to help her, while avoiding real opportunities to confess the truth. This film features a stellar supporting cast, including Tony Shalhoub as a fast-talking, greedy scumbag of a lawyer that concocts wild and elaborate existential theories to prove Doris innocent while ignoring actual facts about the case. However these theories also provide interesting thematic clues to Ed's internal struggle. There are deep ideas connected to Ed's character in almost every scene in the movie. The Coens clearly put a lot of work into writing subtext and little grains of ideas that get stuck in your head and connect to other parts of the film. Watch closely..."What kind of man are you?"This is the central question posed by this film. What kind of a man is Ed Crane? I believe that Ed Crane is a very sad and depressed man who can't see his life for what it truly is. He seems lost in his own head, often staring blankly outward, sometimes seeming to almost disappear into the background. He knows he makes mistakes in life but he can't see what they are. His wife loves him, he has a decent job, but has no kids oddly enough. "My wife and I have not performed the sex act in many years," he says at one point. Ed constantly smokes cigarettes and stares outwardly as if he's a bit suicidal, but is it his fault for being depressed all the time? What's eating Ed Crane? His relationship with his wife? Something in his past? As you watch the film, like the jury you're compelled to pass judgement on him and condemn him for mistakes of inaction. But you can you judge him for who he is? For his stoicism? At one point the lawyer brings up Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. Maybe the more you study Ed, the less you really know about him. He's impenetrable. You never know truly what is inside a man's heart. Perhaps you can only judge their actions in life. Are Ed's actions damnable?"Music comes from within. I cannot teach 'the soul'."His problem isn't lack of a soul. If the medium was right and his wife's soul is still connected to his, then this proves that he has one. He also shows sympathy to Dave's wife and Birdy. No, his crime is that he doesn't believe that he has a soul. He doesn't really believe in much of anything. He and his wife only go to church to play bingo? he lives a godless life. Like Birdy, he plays the right notes but has no passion. His problem is fear. He's afraid of making mistakes in life. He's afraid to be anything. He seems like the type to overanalyze everything, and in doing so he misses a lot of opportunities to simply enjoy himself. Look at Frank riding that pig around the farm and then winning the pie-eating contest. He may have made a fool of himself and wound up with a stomachache, but at least he had a good time. Ed never seems to have a good time at anything. When Ed himself winds up on trial, the lawyer pleads with the jury to "Look closely at him. For he is modern man." Is that what the Coens were going for, an analogy of modern man himself? Is modern man a creature without a discernible identity, trapped in a cycle of fear, inaction and delusion?"The more you look the less you know."It all comes back to the Uncertainty Principle. In the end we find out Ed is looking back at his life from death row. He knows the day he's going to die, and he describes this as "being outside the maze." But does he ever really see his life for what it is? Is he just too much of an observer in his own life, and has always looking at it changed it for the worse? One shot shows him lying in bed at home, in his prison jumpsuit. Maybe he's always been 'outside the maze,' simply watching himself, waiting for death. In the end he sees a UFO in his dreams and nods as if it explains everything. He blames everything that happened on aliens and then he says he has no regrets. He becomes completely detached from reality. He's fatalist, simply accepting the "cards he's dealt". The truth is he could have told the truth at any time and saved his wife, the barbershop and his house. But he didn't because he is incapable of making that kind of self sacrifice, or taking any responsibility for his own actions. He's selfish, and I believe he deserved his fate."A rather lurid description of a truly despicable man..."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Coen brothers tribute to noir goes way past a tribute, and in my mind stands alone as the mosy memorable Coen film ever. Fargo is regarded as their best, and while it is certainly brilliant, TMWWT ultimately has better acting and more engaging characters than even that film. There are so many brilliant characters and scenes that the film is difficult to describe and almost impossible to explain to someone that hasn't seen it. The dry cleaning patsy, the crazed wife of the Gandolfini character who believes he was abducted by a spaceship, the piano playing girl who is befriended by Thornton to the point that she ends up causing a car crash while attempting to "please him", the Tony Shalhoub lawyer character, and of course Ed Crane, played to perfection by Billy Bob Thornton are all alternately hilarious and touching. It's beyond comprehension how Thornton's performances in both Monster's Ball and this film were ignored by the academy. As Crane, Thornton is perfectly subdued and the restraint of a performance such as this certainly requires as much acting talent as any role in which an actor is required to act like an on-the-edge crazy (Denzel in Training Day, for instance). The B&amp;W cinematography is absolutely flawless and the black shadows that are used pervasively prove that color film has caused this element of film to become extinct, which is unfortunate indeed. Ultimately, as a viewer, I suspended my critical eye and just came to the realization that the Coens know more about making movies than I do and here have crafted a masterpiece that will long be remembered as a hallmark of every element of film making. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sublime, enriching melancholia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Brothers Coen have made many very fine, droll and unabashedly enjoyable films thus far, but I feel this one to surpass them all and to be a bona fide "masterpiece"; in my book, a rare 10/10. "The Man Who Wasn't There" is a markedly more serious film in intent and tone than virtually all of the brothers' other efforts, apart, perhaps, from "Miller's Crossing". However, there is a typically Coenesque sense of humour that perfectly balances the film.The plot is a typically clever, well-thought-out one from the Coens; with all manner of consequences set in motion by Ed Crane's taking a risk for a rare time in his life. Crane is a deftly drawn (witness the peerless cinematography and lighting) and dircted "nonentity"; a man ever in the background, never saying very much; a composed, calm, emotionally-dry figure. The film effectively puts his life under the spotlight, as it was, and as it becomes, when his actions deviate from normal. Billy Bob Thornton's performance is, truly, understated and deft; doing the job perfectly of conveying nothingness, and also, occasionally, suppressed, very slight, but tangible emotions.All of the other characters work, all add something to the film. McDormand is fine as the flawed, amusing, tragic wife and Crane's loveable, rotund brother is perfectly played by Michael Badalucco. Jon Polito is deliciously and appropriately hammy as the wonderfully-named Creighton Tolliver, the mysterious, transigent businessman. The very talented young actress (see also, "Ghost World"), Scarlett Johansson, is delectable and beguiling as one Birdy Abundas, the piano-playing teenager who struggles to live up to Crane's idealized view of her. Tony Shalhoub is truly amusing as the lawyer, Freddy Reidenschneider, a character who is palpably many things; lazy, a fine showman, a freelance-charlatan and a semi-philosopher. The scene where he uses all sorts of wonderful, out-of-place techniques and metaphors - "he practically *is* modern man..." - to try and acquit Crane is wonderfully, wonderfully funny...! To labour the point further, it can be said that James Gandolfini, Richard Jenkins, who is used very well here; his character a fine example of how to make a minor character compelling, and Katherine Borowitz, are all perfect as well, in smaller parts, rounding off an absolutely top-drawer cast.The melancholy of the film's outlook is tangible and pervasive; the dream sequence is a wonderful, tellingly underplayed scene between Crane and his wife that mirrors reality depressingly. There are many sublime little moments, often established during Thornton's voice-overs - the sad reflections on the "pansy" while showing him underwater a la "Night of the Hunter", the way well-loved (if only tacitly so) people seem to deteriorate and pass away as the film passes, the voice-over concerning Mr Abundas' hobby, the wedding party and the ride home in the car, the... sad, poetic grace of the ending... The shots of the gumshoe in the rain... so majestic. You could indeed add the way that Reidenschneider is missed, for all his greed and flaws, when the case is turned over to the advocate who "plays by the book"... the voice-over is so movingly understated and suggestive that such moments and thoughts linger long in the mind.The use of lighting, music and photography, as so many have rightly said, is utterly beautiful, creating precisely the right atmosphere of melancholy. Beethoven's piano pieces and Burwell's other selections and recordings are astonishingly "right" for each part of the film. Anyone doubting the effectiveness of monochrome film will be taken aback by this. There have been many brilliantly shot films, but few quite as affectingly shot films as this. The style of film noir is used and refined to an even more suggestive, ambiguous degree than in the many fine film noirs of the forties. It would be a crying shame if its audience were to be depleted because it is in black and white. Films like Fargo and O Brother... have been crossover-mainstream hits, but this one has clearly been advertised for the "art" market, which sadly seems to be limiting its appeal. The film so perfectly beguiled and moved me, and the four people in two cinema visits, whom I saw it with, that it would be a shame if people missed it.To encapsulate a film I loved, I will say that it is close to the finest film I have yet seen, and that is saying quite a lot. The voice-over I shall single out as another wonderfully rendered aspect of the film that gives us an insight we otherwise wouldn't have had into Crane's thoughts, character and emotions. This is a film of the fibre in which dreams are forged.Rating:- *****/*****</fullReview>

I was impressed once again by the fluid noir style they employed in this film and I really enjoyed every bit of it. All the materials, from performances to the music and the photography were directed in a very subtle manner that succeeded in making this, one of the most entertaining `bitter' films I have ever seen...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What kind of a man are you?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It starts as another Coenian postmod pastichey picaresque: Noir Guy (Billy Bob Thornton), a barber, has a souse of a wife (Frances McDormand, floridly cast "against type") who loves bingo and her boss at work, a scheming fat man named Big Dave (James Gandolfini). When a comically inept con man (Jon Polito) comes to town, wanting to find a partner in a new business called "dry cleaning," we can see the signs a block away: Blackmail, best-laid-plans, murder ahead. The emphasis in this extremely academic take--more academic even than the Ph.Dish MILLER'S CROSSING--is on the sociological and political roots of noir. The postwarness, the cold-warness, the sunshine-boomtownness of the movie's mythical Santa Rosa (the location of SHADOW OF A DOUBT--but really, it's just early-Ellroy L.A.) are all underlined and double-underlined. So far, so cool--and the movie is far easier to enjoy as a series of Abstracted Noir Components than the similarly suspension-of-disbelief-free LOST HIGHWAY. But then Noir Guy starts contemplating hair. He is the Sisyphus of Noirtown, performing a perfectly stupid task that never ceases to repeat itself, without gathering the slightest meaning. He even, in his blank way, waxes philosophical, like a Marine-town Woyzeck: "I want...I wanna put hair with...dirt, regular house dirt." "Ed, what the heck are ya talkin' about?" "I...Skip it." And soon the movie metamorphs into a fedoras-and-Pall-Malls riff on Camus' THE STRANGER. Why does the Man Who Wasn't There kick off the chain of events that brings down all manner of ruination? Jealousy? Boredom? No ordinary human motives will do. And the Coens slyly insert a shyster lawyer (Tony Shalhoub) who's full of dime-store variants on post-structuralist touchstones: he uses the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle as a sort of Twinkie Defense, and claims that his client is "Modern Man himself!...Indict him, and you are indicting yourself!" All of which, the Coens make clear, is so much malarkey--a way of kidding oneself, substituting entropy for dogma, avoiding the scary unknowableness of being alive. Ethan Coen described THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE as "the movie Martin Heidegger would have made if he had come to Hollywood"--unusually forthright for two guys who are just, aw shucks, entertainers. Like Spielberg's A.I., it uses a perfectedness of technique to render the world as an arrangement of totemic abstractions--pixilated dots that don't add up to a coherent object. The movie gets you, terrifyingly and melancholically, inside the head of a guy for whom the simplest, table-and-chairs stuff is ceasing to make sense. And the brothers use Carter Burwell's variant on Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata" in a way that's as crazily persistent, and ceaselessly effective, as the insanely repetitive romantic theme from Godard's CONTEMPT. (Not even Godard has used late Beethoven so aptly.) Like BARRY LYNDON, another movie whose central question is "What kind of a man are you?," THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE has an elusive, smokelike plangency. It's a picture you'll puzzle over, and sigh achingly at its images, for many years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Faithful Omage To Film Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fine salute to post WWII film noir. It's definitely done "Coen-Style" and it's hard to fault. Though minimalistic it's rich in detail with every scene...Many being "so right" they seem iconic. The mood is, however, not just dark, but quite mysterious providing a great undercurrent in the Hitchcockian vein. The cinematography is so good I must say I've never seen black and white with so many shades of gray giving it the mood for sure, but yet great detail. You need to see this on a good plasma TV like the Pioneer Kuro for some of the most amazing blacks ever. I also appreciate the way the DVD uses the entire 16:9 screen, without the black bars. It's an intimate film and it simply doesn't need a wider palate.Billy Bob Thornton is excellent as the conflicted man "sleepwalking" through life yet waiting for something that just might wake him up. He's just as disaffected as his "Bad Santa" character but with some sort of discipline that won't allow him to show any anger. That would make him "The Man That Wasn't There" and so he is. The supporting cast is uniformly excellent and besides Thornton there's a standout role played by the guy who plays Monk.I recommend this movie for any fan of forties film noir. It's really able to stand with some of the best of that rich era. The Dialogue is so good it seems to get better with the next viewing, and the next. It is about as good as a simple film can be, albeit one where every frame must have taken a week or so to compose! Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The main character of the movie, Ed Crane, let's himself in the arms of fate, accepting everything that happens to him without even asking himself why. He kills his wife's boss and secret lover by mistake and then watches her convicted for a crime she didn't do. He doesn't show any emotion when he finds out that his wife, who has committed suicide in prison, was actually pregnant with her dead lover's child. By the end of the film, as he declares in the last minutes, he has no regrets what so ever. It's all about existentialism, the absurd of fighting back your own destiny and accepting it as it's given. The movie is very well played and being black and white makes it more believable. You might say it's quite static, so enjoy this movie if you are feeling calm and meditative.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply excellent!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Words cannot describe my love of this film. The Coen Brothers have made a sensational film noir, the best of all their movie efforts (and, with the excellent "Barton Fink" under their belt, that's saying a mouthful). The cast alone could carry the worst of scripts. The script alone could spear a lame cast into a great performance. The cinematography alone could carry people to this film. But the excellent period set design could fill seats also. This film is an example of what filmakking should be. This is a love-it-or-hate it film. But even the detractors will find something to laud here, be it the direction of Joel Coen,or the classical soundtrack.Billy Bo Thornton stars in an Oscar-worthy performance as Ed Crane, a quiet barber locked in a loveless marriage with an accountant (a superb Frances Mcdormand). Ed wants to make some extra dough by investing in dry cleaning. Needing the money to invest, he blackmails a war veteran (James Gandolfini). And that's when things get complicated. Through multiple murders, suicides, and imprisonments, Crane does little but nod, smoke, and sit. The script presents a challenge (Crane rarely speaks in the film, and when he does, it's mostly "okay" or "sure"), that Thornton lives up to channeling this mans lonely, sometimes violent feelings in his eyes. The cinematography is igenious, and don't forget Tony Shaloub (as an an airheaded lawyer), in one of my favorite performances ever captured on film. Rent it, and be amazed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Coens are among the finest filmmakers working today because of their economical use of characters and language, and this film is a prime example. Nothing is wasted, and nothing extraneous clogs the film. You can never tell what is going to happen next in this movie, and when it does, it seems like it couldn't have happened any other way. The Coen's extraordinary writing and direction are complemented by stunning but unobtrusive cinematography and flawless acting, especially by Thornton in his best work since Slingblade. Forgive the superlatives, but i believe this to be one of the most underrated films in recent American cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Coen Brothers have their place in the cinematic lexicon. They're the clever jokesters of the movies and have given us many great movies. However, I really wish they would evolve. Sure, their films are a lot of fun, but they generally end up as nothing more than an entertaining joke. Only two of their films, in my opinion, achieve anything more, Barton Fink and Fargo, but even they only walk a few steps past that line.The Man Who Wasn't There for a long time suggests that it might end up being the best Coen Brothers movie. It seems to have depth past the cynical parodies and absurdities. Unfortunately, after about one third of the film has past, it loses focus and runs towards easy jokes and cutesy quirks as if it were a burly man who almost revealed something about himself after a night of heavy drinking. In particular, the UFO subplot really should have been cut. And they didn't need the young pianist's seduction near the end. It felt forced. Sure, what results in the film is very entertaining, but it felt like something profound was about to be revealed.The film is a quality product, as you would expect. Billy Bob Thornton is great. He gave two of the best performances of 2001, the second in Monster's Ball. His character is interesting, but that is one of the major areas that the script pulled back on before it could say enough to make it fascinating. Francis MacDormand is great, but she has far too little screentime. The Brothers obviously wanted to focus on Thornton, but it should have centered less on him than his relationship with his wife. A flashback nearer the end of the film hinted at that depth once again, but it was not pursued.I haven't said too much good about the film, though I've already scored it in my summary. Truth be told, The Man Who Wasn't There is an enormously entertaining and funny film. It contains some of the Coen Brothers' subtlest humor. It helps to be a classic Hollywood lover, especially of film noirs. The name of the store, for instance, Nirdlinger's, is a reference to Double Indemnity. It's also worth seeing for some excellent black and white cinematography. It's always been obvious that the Brothers have wanted to make a film in B&amp;W, and here it is. It is a glorious achievement in that particular aspect of the art of filmmaking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man Who Wasn't There is lost out of the gate. It's much clearer the second time you view it. It flits between 10 different incompatible story lines, and can't figure out a way to develop any of them. It goes nowhere. Many viewers were tricked into thinking this movie matters due to its cinematography (It looks nice) and by the authors (The Coens continue to receive unearned accolades). It's a bunch of Noir posturing/noodling with scenes designed to kill time, not add up. It drifts and drifts and drifts. It's a catalog of half-hearted, half-developed ideas, so it begins to feel like it's running long after only 20 minutes. Who can tell what they set out to explore? A viewer will never figure out why it was brought into existence because the Coens have not imbued it with any sense of purpose. Long before Burn After Reading, and O Brother, the Coens were making movies that lacked a reason for being.It's not detestable. It's just all over the place. It's a completely shapeless movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Man Who Wasn't There (2001): Dir: Ethan Coen, Joel Coen / Cast: Billy Bob Thornton, Frances McDormand, James Gandolfini, Tony Shalhoub, Scarlett Johansson: Film about accepting what happens yet drifting into a state of mind where we feel imperishable. Billy Bob Thornton plays a barber who suspects his wife of an affair with her boss. When a travelling salesman passes through he devises a blackmail scheme that goes wrong resulting in his wife going to prison for a murder she did not commit. Directors Joel and Ethan Coen reflect upon film noir shooting it in black and white, and apply the same wit they stylized in Blood Simple and The Big Lebowski. Thornton is excellent as a man who lives life without expecting much change. His fate isn't exactly uplifting but his torn conscience and barber's eye for hair make for an interesting performance. Frances McDormand plays his wife caught in adultery and pays double the consequence. Tony Shalhoub is hilarious as a lawyer who doesn't believe Thornton when he confesses, and becomes too expensive to hire again. James Gandolfini is featured as McDormand's boss whose fate matches his consequence and his broken trust. Scarlett Johansson has a quiet role as a young piano player whom Thornton admires. It regards the mind as Thornton spaces himself from reality, responsibility and eventually consequence. Score: 8 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Coens' film which isn't a tad soulless - relish it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I might be in a minority here, but as a rule Coen brothers' films tend only to get two cheers from me. They are undoubtedly well-made, well-directed, well-scripted, well-acted, imaginative and often funny, but all-too-often there seems to be something lacking. They are invariably clever, but it's a kind of knowing cleverness, and I can't get rid of the sensation that behind it all are Joel and Ethan Coen patting themselves on their backs at how clever they are. Miller's Crossing struck me as not so much a film but an exercise in filmmaking.Fargo was funny, but curiously heartless and cruel. Even Blood Simple, the film with which, as far as I know, they first made their names and which blew me over the first time I saw it, struck me at the second viewing as a tad mechanical: the Coens know all the moves and then some, but something crucial is lacking. So I'm pleased to say The Man Who Wasn't There, as far as I'm concerned, proves to be an exception and a very welcome one at that.Central to its success is Billy Bob Thornton as that man, a curiously inert figure, one almost without personality, and that Thornton is able not just to bring him to life but make him likable and sympathetic is a real achievement. He conveys so much about Ed Crane, the man who wasn't there, by hardly acting. We don't get to know what makes Crane tick or why he is so inert, but we accept him as he is just as we accept the quirks of our family and friends in real life.The Man Who Wasn't There is ? rather trendily ? billed as neo-noir and it does stay true to the principles of what the French dubbed film noir: the tragic inevitability of the hero's demise, the way it is shot (supposedly in monochrome, but the copy I saw last night was in washed out colour), the hard-boiled dialogue, the various characters ? from the 'pansy' shyster to the detectives who come to give Crane bad news, to his wife's boss and lover who is killed and with whose murder Crane's innocent wife is charged.All performances are great but I particularly enjoyed Tony Shalhoub as the expensive hotshot lawyer hired to get Crane's wife off the hook and who comes up with a particularly imaginative defence. And in all of this the Coens', for once, keep their undoubted cleverness in check.So if you like their work without reserve, watch this one. If, like me, you are a tad wary of the brothers and their 'look what bright things we are' schtick, relax, and watch it, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coens Noir is Pure Black Magic (and White too)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Man Who Wasn't there is one of the Coen brothers very best. Set in 1949 in the small northern Californian town of Santa Rossa, its made brilliantly in black and white. (Color would have ruined this). Billy Bob Thornton narrates this....which is just as well....because for an actor in a leading role, he would win ANY Academy Award for having the least to say. Although it may seem that this is a slow moving film.....its not.....things are actually happening fast. Frances McDormand and James Gandolfini are great as the pair having an affair...which eventually leads to dire consequences. Tony Shalhoub is truly funny and masterful as the hot shot lawyer. This is the Coens noir movie, and they come up with the goods. The humour is there, but its hidden deeply within the webs of deceit, dishonesty...and finally murder. Billy Bob Thornton (arguably) wasn't there, but he sure comes up with a great performance ..and an unforgettable character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Through it all we cut the hair"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Are there times in your life when things seem completely out of control? When unintended consequences become the order of the day rather than the neat little plan we had in mind when first starting out. "The Man Who Wasn't There" takes that theme and relentlessly pursues it from beginning to end. Through it all, Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thornton) rides that wave, seemingly detached but mercilessly buffeted by a series of events he set in motion with his very first thought that maybe dry cleaning is an idea whose time has come.Thornton and the camera perfectly complement each other under the direction of the Coen Brothers and cinematographer Roger Deakins. The picture evokes the best of the genre it attempts to emulate, classic film noir, but it goes beyond that definition with scenes and dialog that are downright hilarious at times. As in the courtroom scene with Freddy Riedenschneider (Tony Shalhoub) asking the jury to look not at the facts, but the meaning of the facts, even though the facts have no meaning. It's the uncertainty principle at work, where looking at something changes it, calling to mind a former President's request that we must consider what the definition if 'is' is. Personally, my favorite little gem was Ed Crane's summary description of Tolliver's (Jon Polito) disappearance - 'vaporized like the Nips at Nagasaki". Who came up with that line? Then there's the UFO conspiracy sub-text thrown in by Ann Nirdlinger Brewster (Katherine Borowitz) in that disturbing scene at Ed's door after Big Dave (James Gandolfini) died. Wasn't that just perfectly creepy? I have to admit, I dig this quirky stuff, and I don't know if there's anyone better at it than the Coen's. There's "Barton Fink", "Fargo" and "The Big Lebowski", but in those films, the parody was more overt and grabs you at gut level. Here you have to work at finding it a bit more, but the search is well worth it. The Coens go to a well established talent pool to cast their characters with the likes of Frances McDormand, Jon Polito and Tony Shalhoub, all repeat Coen performers here who fit their personas like a glove.Look, I know this is not the type of film to appeal to everyone, but to those of us it does, it's a blast. It's that uncertainty principle at work upon first viewing that amuses and entertains, with repeat viewings revealing further nuance that make the enjoyment even greater. As a fan of the Coen's, I could go for this stuff all day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a general rule, I have liked the Coen Brothers comedies, like The Hudsucker Proxy, and disliked their more serious works. While I like this movie a good deal, I'm not sure it's quite an exception, because it may be that it isn't the funny I like so much as the weird. And while The Man Who Wasn't There isn't quite a comedy, it sure is odd.The film is beautifully shot in impeccable black and white. The camera rarely moves, offering instead a series of framed shots that must be admired. The pacing is deliberate in a way that mesmerizes rather than bores you. Thornton gives a terrific performance as the low-key protagonist.The story is very true to classic film noir, at least at first. Like many noir masterpieces, this is as much about alienation and despair as about crime.At the same time, the movie has a weirdness that is not a part of those old movies. Characters say some very odd things. Often there is a comedic quality to the look of people and to the way they act, and yet the movie is never a comedy, instead just seeming a bit off kilter.It's hard to describe what I mean, but it's a really interesting movie.</fullReview>

Billy Bob Thornton gives a flawless and criminally overlooked performance as an ordinary man who plans a scheme that goes awry -- a popular subject for the Coens.Frances McDormand stars as Thornton's wife, and James Gandolfini delivers an effective performance as the victim of Thornton's scheme. There was much Academy Award buzz around Thornton the year of this movie -- he appeared in both "Monster's Ball" and "Bandits" in addition to this. Then the nominations were announced, and he wasn't nominated for anything. The film itself only scored a deserved nomination for its cinematography, but it should have been a contender in many other categories as well.Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The More One Looks at Something, the More Uncertain One Becomes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am hesitant to say that the Coens pulled a Tarantino by making a film essentially as an homage to a beloved and influential film genre, but that would trivialize the impact of The Man Who Wasn't There. It is one of the most entrancingly atmospheric films I can remember, and it's merely about a suburban barber who takes a few liberties in an effort for money to invest in dry cleaning, and life doesn't seem to get much better. We follow him at his pace through this abstruse composite of film noir of the 1940s and '50s.Film noir seldom concerns gallants or exemplars, but about people of minuscule consequence, who are seduced out of their humble patterns by reveries of fortunes or lusty intrigue. Their transgression is gall: These imperceptible mites dare to think of themselves as affluent or satisfied. As the title hints, The Man Who Wasn't There pushes this one step further, into the dimension of a man who only just breathes apart from his transgressions. Billy Bob Thornton has no problem with the low, laconic voice and the dazed look with a slow-burning cigarette from which he smokes none but two or three hits. And he doesn't even do harm how, or to whom, or when the world gathers he does. This is a crime drama on such a realistic, everyday level, an intimate noir involving all the quiet mundanities of 1949.Everyone looks so antiquated and true to the embodiments of the era, from Frances McDormand's bored wife with a drinking problem to James Gandolfini's loud, boisterous boss, who constantly brags about his combat adventures in the Pacific Theatre during World War II where he claims to have served as a crack infantry trooper, from Michael Badalucco's motormouth sidekick of sorts to Tony Shalhoub's expensive D.A. who arrives and takes up residence in the best and most expensive hotel in town, from Jon Polito's almost always persuasive barbershop customer and Richard Jenkins' father to Scarlett Johansson, who is overwhelmingly virginal and magnetic as a 17-year-old piano student.Roger Deakins' entrancing cinematography is simple and classical. Most shots are at eye level, with normal lensing, standard lighting and a long depth of field. The cinematography, combined with the steady, detailed niceties of its period props and sets, could make even a painstaking observer feel that the film was made 50 years ago. When Ed appears, he is pretty much invariably seen smoking an unfiltered Chesterfield, another fine point authentic to 1949. And the soundtrack's weaving together of Beethoven piano sonatas makes these images mesmerizing and ethereal.Joel and Ethan Coen are classicists before all else. This neo-noir, almost so genuinely antiquated that one could legitimately refer to it formally without the "neo" prefix, is so clear-cut and sensitive in its style, so affectionate, so deeply becoming, that if you can endure that rhythm, the film is like a sensual refreshment. Yes, it might of course have been shorter. But then it would not have been this film, or automatically a superior one: It's such a clear idea to make a black and white film in which the black and white doubles as both spectacle and mundanity. Looking at the images seems to almost change them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amazing cast- Frances McDormand, Billy Bob and James Gandolfini, and of course taking into the account this is the Coen's movie - it comes as no surprise I really enjoyed it. But I admit I was worried if I would like it when I read the rather basic description summary about some barber (Billy Bob) who gets in some sticky situation with his wife (McDormand) and wife's boss when some dude with dry-cleaning business comes looking for a business partner. Sounds as a pretty lame plot but this is a perfect example that it doesn't really matter what the movie is about if the cast is talented and if the movie takes time to show us lives and personalities in a different light- and adds some creativity to it. True it is quite reminiscent of Fargo with McDormand in it including black humor and murder mystery complication, but it's not like they'r exactly identical. If anything I wish more movies would be similar to it.In addition, the fact that movie is shot in black and white fits it perfectly adding shades and wonderful light contrasts and fits into the sombre mood of the character in depth analysis which is what makes it such an enjoyable and memorable movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Billy Bob At His Best!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Bob Thornton is quite simply a force to be reckoned with. He has not actually received his due since "Sling Blade" but his performances since then have been nuanced as well as a key element of the project he happened to be a part of at the time;(Okay, so I have fallen in love with Billy Bob!!) this was never more evident than the spine-tingling performances of his and Halle's in "Monster's Ball." In this project, another Coen Brothers classic, he is so low-key, he is scary, so much so that he becomes the ultimate personification of the phrase "Still waters run deep." The movie is a murder mystery shot in black and white with enough twists and turns to keep you totally interested. Frances McDormand, another artist who is sorely under-appreciated, is fabulous as usual as the unfaithful wife who is mistakenly accused of Billy Bob's own indiscretion. Without giving away too much of the plot, this is another gem from the Coen Brothers that is worth viewing over and over again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Coen Brothers are clearly the frontrunners in laying claim to the title of being the most prolific, yet least profitable, film-making duo around. Their names are synonymous with an indie chic that's comparable only to Kevin Smith, yet none of their films (not even their award-winning Fargo) have managed to leave an impression at the box office. It's all for the best, perhaps; as their films are often tinged with a dark sense of humor that's probably best appreciated by a select group of filmgoers -- any attempt to commercialize and the results would be lacklustre (see Intolerable Cruelty &amp; The Ladykillers). And when it comes to being dark, none of their films probably fit the bill better than their 2001 neo-noir offering 'The Man Who Wasn't There'. Starring Billy Bob Thornton as a taciturn barber caught in the middle of a botched blackmail, the movie is exceptional at presenting us a character we simply don't care about. Thornton's stoic performance makes him at once unsympathetic and attractive - the perfect anti-hero. Filmed in glorious black and white, the movie looks resplendent in its stark contrasts of shadows and light. And with exceptional performances by a standout cast that includes James Gandolfini, Frances McDormand, Scarlett Johansson (who already starts looking like the sultry seductress she plays in most of her later movies) and especially Tony Shalhoub as a calculating, self-assured lawyer, 'The Man Who Wasn't There' becomes a film that's truly unforgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THIS time it's the Visuals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Man Who Wasn't There" (2001): Written and directed by the Coen brothers. Billy Bob Thornton, Scarlett Johansson, Frances McDormand, James Gandolfini, Michael Badalucco, Tony Shalhoub? and the superb, perfect, artful, intelligent photography of Roger Deakins. As always, we find interesting characters and a story that takes awhile to unfold and explain itself ? or appears to explain itself. This would be enough for me with the Coen brothers, but I must say, THIS time it's the visuals. It is one of THE MOST beautifully crafted films in all of history. I mean it. I'm partial to b/w anyhow, but for all the "right" reasons, and this film is an Icon of The Right Reasons. It's up there with "Anchoress", "Manhattan", "Sansho the Bailiff", "The Burmese Harp", "Eraserhead", "Schindler's List", "Made for Each Other", "Hud", "Village of the Damned", "Good Night and Good Luck", "Stranger than Paradise", "The Elephant Man", "Casablanca", and "Onibaba" in its visual artistry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Coen brothers go Noir.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest the movie was not as good as I had hoped and expected. Of course whenever you're watching a Coen movie, expectations are high. This movie however really was not a successful experiment of using old movie style and mixing them with trademark Coen brothers humor and characters. It's too Noir for a comedy and not serious enough for a Neo Noir. So for most part the movie is an unbalanced mix of different movie styles that don't really blend in well together. Still its the subtle touch from the Coen brothers that save this movie from being weird and failed cinematic film-making experiment. It keeps the movie always fun, pleasant and light to follow. This compensates a lot.The ending (the last ten minutes or so) also saved a lot for me. It took some nice typical Noir twists and made it obvious that the Coen brothers know their classics and how to handle the genre.The movie is well written and takes some typical Noir twists and turns. It features some of the classic ingredients which should make this movie a delight to watch for the genre fans. It's a real solid and interesting story, in which lots of things remain unpredictable, like you should expect from a genre movie like this one. Lots is happening in this movie and sure it's not always realistic or likely but it suits the Coen brothers style well and make this a perfectly good movie to watch. Not sure about its re-playability though. I'm not interested in re-watching it any time soon. The biggest strength of the movie is its story and I'll bet that the second time the story might not come across as powerful and interesting- and certainly not as surprising all anymore.Also nothing wrong with the style of the movie. The movie is using some atmospheric cinematography that is really fitting for the genre. Cinematographer Roger Deakins and the Coen brothers always make beautiful things together. Also the sets and costumes help to set up the right mood of the movie- and the time period the story is set in.The movie features lots of great and well developed characters, that mostly work out because they are being played by good and well known actors. I was not too fond of the main character (played by Billy Bob Thornton) of the movie that in my opinion never really was interesting enough. But still, I always like Billy Bob in any movie in any role. Not every characters is used to its potential such as the Frances McDormand one but than on the other hand there also were some characters played by actors that worked out quite surprising, namely Tony Shalhoub who was great. James Gandolfini always was great (as always) in his role and also Scarlett Johansson impressed in a small and early role for her.I still missed some of the subtle, yet hilarious, Coen brothers humor in this movie. It of course was present but in this case not prominent enough, at least not to my taste. It's the reason why I still see this movie as a bit of a disappointing one from the Coen brothers. This is obviously not their best work but this in no way means that this movie is a totally bad one. Not at all. "The Man Who Wasn't There" is a perfectly pleasant to watch, light, fun and cleverly written movie with some impressive actors, that also truly uplift the movie.Not the Coen brother's best and most successful experiment but certainly interesting and good enough to watch nevertheless.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Observation in psychopathic behavior</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, this show was an observation in psychopathic behavior and how well they blend into their surroundings. I used it to pick out the psychopaths and found 5 people who had one thing in common, or one thing they lacked in common with the rest of society. It would be interesting to see if others caught it, or have an observation to add.The black and white was appealing and helped prevent any distraction from what I considered to be the focus of the film. Just looking at it from a pure entertainment view, I would have found it very mundane, boring and nothing I would recommend. It was all about the subtleties of human behavior.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The labyrinth of life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Life is indeed a labyrinth like the main character says in the end. A simple life led by a simple man can become hell when things begin to turn out wrong. This movie portrays here another anti-hero which seems to be a character so dear to the Coen brothers: the barber who by definition is no more than an insignificant type but gets here into a whirlwind of unexpected events unchained by a wrong move of his. It's his mind that is being filmed since from the beginning till the end his voice off is present with comments, stories, explanations and recollections. He talks very little but thinks a lot. The movie's pace is slow but has plenty of images full of meaning. The subplot composed by the story of the barber's relationship the young girl who plays the piano and the Beethoven music that underlines it introduce a poetic dimension in the movie. The court scenes although short show us once more that real truth has nothing to do with judiciary truth, making trials a mockery of justice. After seeing this movie we get the sensation that a story like this could happen to any of us. One last note to say that of course this movie is a black and white one and as a matter of fact we couldn't imagine this gloomy but well told story shown in coloured images.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A highly original film shot in black and white, this film is one that will make you think. The story is told from a barber, and it is a story of an average man who thinks that he will become rich, but he ends up getting blackmailed and trying to sort his life out together, but bad things keep on happening to him. The story is original and highly engaging, and there is a real sense of emotion for the characters. Set design is also done exceptionally well. In short, I can not fault this film in any way. It's a good story, and it contains what it needs in order to create something different and deep. Highly enjoyable and entertaining and worth more than one viewing: 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another twisted tale from the Coen brothers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Bob Thornton plays Ed Crane, a barber in post-war Santa Rosa, who decides one day to take up a customer's offer and become partners in a dry cleaning business. But instead of taking a step down the road to success, his decision leads to a trail of murder.Placed in the hands of the Coen brothers, Ed Crane's saga becomes an existential look at the meaning of life. All done with a healthy dose of humor and irony, of course.The pacing of this movie is a bit slow, sort of mirroring the way the lead character plods through the events in his life. The black and white treatment adds to the bleak atmosphere. Ed Crane's life is pretty dismal. His wife talked him into marrying her, they don't have children, they've stopped having sexual relations, and she's having an affair with the store manager where she works. The dry cleaning entrepreneur is a flim flam artist who comes onto Ed after he's agreed to go into business with him. Big Dave, his wife's boss, is always bragging about his war record, but it turns out he was a clerk in a shipyard stateside. He's stealing money from the store that his wife owns. She's a woman with a frozen look on her face who believes in flying saucers.Ed hires a lawyer after his wife is accused of Big Dave's murder. He's supposed to be the best, but Freddy Reidenschneider is just a fast talker who doesn't listen to his clients. He winds up with the money from the barber shop and Ed's wife hangs herself.Ed shows an interest in a family friend's daughter - her musical career that is. He thinks she's talented. He arranges an audition with a piano teacher in San Francisco, who tells him that the girl will make a splendid typist some day. She shows her gratitude towards him by trying to perform oral sex on him during the drive home. He crashes the car.He comes to and the police are there to arrest him for the dry cleaning guy's murder, which he didn't do. Reidenschneider shows up again and stays around long enough to bag Ed's house. Ed goes to the chair.Who is the man who wasn't there? Well, it's Ed Crane, and it's Big Dave, and it's the dry cleaner, and it's everyone. We're all part of this delusion we call reality, where nothing works out the way it's supposed to. We're all just bumping along the road of life.Not quite as sly as the Coen brother's "Fargo", but still a very humorous look at the human condition.</fullReview>

The dry cleaning business interests Ed and he decides to blackmail Big Dave to raise the money he needs for the venture.Big Dave later tracks down Creighton and beats the truth about him. He confronts Ed about what he has done, forcing Ed to take control of events instead of existing in the background as if he wasn't even there.As expected for the Coen brothers, to describe the story on paper is not to do them justice. The story is brilliantly constructed and continues to unfold in unexpected ways. They introduce a number of elements that make Ed Crane their most complex male character so far, much more interesting and intense than Ray from Blood Simple and colder, more sinister than Jerry Lundegaard (Fargo).Billy Bob Thornton's performance at the centre is superb, capturing the observant nature of Ed Crane and making some of his colder actions seem sympathetic and understanding. His tender scenes with Scarett Johansson are highlights as he admires her from a distance, not for her beauty, but for her talent. It's just an example of the complexities of his character and the nature of the film.The movie looks fantastic. It's finely shot by Coen regular DoP Roger Deakins, whose work here is gleaming and polished without being intrusive or showy.This film succeeds where othe efforts, notably Blood Simple, have faltered. The Coens make time to explore the troubled relationship between husband and wife, tracing the unhappiness that leads to further misery and turmoil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What can go wrong, will go wrong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of this Coen Brothers film resembles that of 'Fargo': man in need of cash schemes plot; plot fails; man ends up being arrested. In this case he is executed in the electric chair. That serves him right, for people died thanks to his wrong doing. But is he a criminal? By definition, yes. Though to the viewer he is more like a decent civilian who was tempted to take the wrong path and can't go back. Even when he tells the truth -- while his wife is serving in jail for the murder he more or less accidentally committed -- he is not believed by the classy lawyer he has hired. His wife hangs herself, so the case is dismissed. After he is linked to another death, he lands in jail and in afore mentioned chair. He is to die for something he is not guilty of, but accepts the verdict to pay his debts. The film is in black and white which adds to the 'film noir'-character. Note that 'The man who wasn't there' is not the first Coen Brothers film in which hair or hair treatment plays a major role. In 'O Brother, where art thou' there is this crook who is more concerned about his hair than about his general well being (and that of his confr?res). Here the man is a barber in a small town barber shop. Before the execution one of his legs is shaved, a scene that in a macabre way mirrors the bath tub scene in which as a loving husband he shaves his wife's legs. A typical Coen Brothers film with great playing by Billy Bob Thornton. And what a smoker he is! Do the Coen Brothers know the 'sadistic universe' of Dutch literary writer Willem Frederik Hermans? Same as in their films, in his books anything that can go wrong, will go wrong. It is Murphy's Law, as well as Coen's and Hermans'. It would be great to see a Coen Brothers adaption of Hermans' 1966 novel 'Never sleep again'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't underestimate this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The use of light and the black and white cinematography in this movie is cool. The cast of this movie is spectacular ant the acting is top notch. The noir homage and period production is dead on.The real genius, though, is the story.....SPOILERSWhy is the name of the movie titled "The Man who wasn't there"? Some would argue that Crane was a typical noir louse, constantly run over by others, who melted into the woodwork, hence the title. I would argue that most of the Crane we see in this movie is made up by Crane the narrator, the Pulp Writer. He really wasn't there.The first time I thought this was in thinking about the name Freddy Riedenschneider and the way Crane was introduced to it by a drunk Mr. Abdubus. Doesn't the name Freddy Riedenschneider sound awfully like "Fred, Ried &amp; Schneider", a more lawyerish name? Perhaps Freddy Riedenschndider was made up by Crane the Pulp Writer. The cool Heisenberg speech sounds awfully like something "written" for the lawyer. I think Freddy was entirely a figment of Crane's imagination. Note the way the switch of lawyers is handled in the editing at Crane's trial.Why did Freddy recommend a guilty plea to the wife to prevent a death sentence and then later Crane receive the death sentence after pleading guilty? Perhaps this "discrepancy" points to one or both of the engagements with the legal system being fiction.Why is the UFO thread in there? The late forties, early fifties were the UFO heyday. Dreams and stories are often filled with random ideas culled from daily life. Notice the sequence of stories in the magazine articles he was reading, first Dry Cleaning then Roswell UFOs. Crane added the UFO thread to the pulp magazine story for some spice but left them subdued or had his character reject abduction because he was contracted to tell his "story", which had to end with execution. As others here have suggested as a mistake could be more proof, CA doesn't use the electric chair. Perhaps Crane was executed with lethal injection or otherwise but told the story with an electric chair to make it more "Sci-fi". Why is the electric chair sequence so white and dreamlike? Along with the implied oral advances by Birdy and Mr. Abdubus's lax approach to Crane being with his daughter, these are examples of Crane's implausible "written" fiction.Another moment in the film that indicates fiction over reality is in the hotel room with Tolliver. The homosexual advance by Tolliver seems forced, subdued, hard to grasp by the viewer. I can't explain it. It took me three times watching it to even notice Tolliver's tongue. Perhaps this is the first attempt by Crane at adding fictitious elements of the story?At first I thought Crane was executed for the death of Big Dave. The complete transition from truth to fiction could be somewhere around the killing of Dave. Crane made the fiction up for the pulp magazine sensabilities. Notice the covers of the magazine he is writing for. Certainly something to consider based on the use of noir "narration".After awhile thinking this was the intent, I revisted the choking scene. Perhaps Crane dies at this point in the movie. You could interpret the entire narration and magazine writing as bogus, just part of Crane's death dream while Big Dave is killing him. The name of the movie would be even more applicable in this interpretation.This movie gives me that "Usual Suspects" or "Mulholland Dr." feeling. What part of the "story" is real? Maybe it was entirely made up.END OF SPOILERSEither way, the Coen Brothers are unparalleled in their lush originality and movie craft.</fullReview>

I found myself completely immersed in the story, the acting, and the look and feel of this film, and had to stay up quite late to finish watching it!The film has a "David Lynch" feel to it, but is much more comprehensible than, for example, Mulholland Drive. There are some amazing twists and turns throughout, but none of them felt forced or artificial (except maybe for the U.F.O!) I also appreciated the ending.

		<fullReview>watching this film was a very boring experience. with established actors such as thornton and mcdormand and the presumption that the film would be an engaging noir experience ie involving gloomy but engaging questions on identity, morality, and destiny, it was approached with definite positivity - this in light of the fact i don't think the big lebowski and, especially, fargo (two of the cohen brothers best known films)deserve the glowing reputations that they widley received.similar to fargo, the coens decide to focus on a particular, and moreover, peculiar environment, in which disenfranchised or disillusioned people are the barometers. thornton plays the mundane barber, whilst mcdormand plays his distant wife in the placated society of 1950s America. The coens capture this mood with the effective use of black and white screening. However the film does little more. the plot is uninteresting, and most of all, the pace of the film is snail-like. whilst this is not a problem in itself, the lack of any other stimulants makes the film seem moribund rather than captivating. this is coupled with drawn out pieces of dialogue that are just simply boring. i ended up trying to grind some sort of result from watching this film, something which i was incapable of doing due to a constant effort to battle with the boredom that the film effortlessly delivers.overall i'd give this a 4 out of ten, not because of poor acting or directing but more so due to the films morose and stilted style.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Man Who Wasn't There was a nice film to WATCH, but it wasn't a great film. The Coen brothers did a good job assembling a "classic" film noir. The cinematography was breathtaking -- real eye candy. Often times I found myself pondering about the visual clues left by the Coens, rather than focusing on the story.The story was held together by the flimsiest of band-aids. The motivation by Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thorton) was never explored. PLOT SPOILER... After the killing scene, I thought, 'He'll be able to explain his way out of this. It was obviously self defense.' But the movie never explained why he wouldn't (or couldn't) fess up. There was no lurid past hanging over his head or was there -- its just never explored.With that said, I did enjoy the film. You'll want to know what happens next, it'll keep you wanting -- unfortunately long past the end credits. And that's where the movie fails. While no one gets off scott free -- classic noir and I loved it-- the Coens just never explain why. Why does Ed Crane let this happen and do nothing. I suppose we are supposed to connect the dots from the title, but give us more to work with IN the film.All the actors were really good in this film. Thorton was perfect in his turn as quiet barber Ed Crane. Frances McDormand was good in her role as Ed's distant wife. I know the Coen's always use her (she's Joel's wife or Ethan's...I can't remember), but she almost always delivers for them. James Gandolfini was excellent as the wife's boss at the department store. But the real standout was Tony Shaloub as a high-price, win-at-all costs attorney. His role was a real gem and he sparkled.The film was never really heavy-handed like film noir can be. The Coens kept it light by throwing some gags in from time to time. And it was a fun movie to watch, but it wasn't a great film. To close, as I said before I found myself wondering about the film's imagery. So what was the meaning of the shadow from the bars cast on Tony Shaloub's character during one of the interview scenes in the interrogation room?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why did this film slip through the cracks? The Coens are getting better and better. More personally commited to their stories than ever before. Maybe the timing was off. Maybe the sorrowful human message is too much for people right now. Who knows. My guess is that this little masterwork will hold up as their most personal and underrated film. The Coens' Eyes Wide Shut. Awesome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This great film was very rewarding. I'm not sure if anyone else picked up on it, but there is an obvious connection between this film and the albert camus novel "The Stranger." I wouldn't be surprised if this latest of the coen brothers growing body of work wasn't inspired by Camus' magnificent novel.There is some magnificent performances here by Tony Shalhoub and Thornton, and Roger Deakens' superb cinematography brought it all together.I can't wait for the next of (the very prolific) coen brothers film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`The man who wasn't there', hmmm, more like `the film that wasn't there.' A triumph of style over content.I was disappointed, maybe I was expecting too much. The acting was impeccable, BB Thornton was fantastic, the cinematography was superb, the music was great. But it was lacking something, an engaging plot. There were the usual twist and turns etc but to a seasoned Coen fan, it was pretty predictable and I really didn't care what happened to any of the characters.Who knows, maybe I'll watch it again and love it, I might have missed something.Saying that, it's still pretty good, a real work of art, but I was hoping for a film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love everything the Coen Brothers do. Fargo is one of my toppicks any day of the week, and O Brother Where Art Thou? was inmy 10 Best of 2000 list. Although I love everything the C-Bros do, I don't always love it rightaway. I remember being disappointed by The Big Lebowski whenit first hit theatres. I don't know what I was expecting, but whatever itwas, The Big Lebowski wasn't it. After some time went by, I caughtit again on cable -- and loved it! I've seen it several times now, andown it on video (still working on the DVD collection...).While I can't say I dislike The Man Who Wasn't There, I'm notinstantly loving it, either. It's a good movie; well-acted, well-written,well-directed, well-photographed... but, well, a bit dull. While themovie played, I found myself fidgeting, wondering what time it was,thinking about tomorrow's plans, and so on. That's never a goodsign. But you might catch me six months from now, I'll have seen itagain and wonder what the heck was I thinking when I gave it thismarginal review.Presented entirely in black and white, The Man Who Wasn't Thereis Joel and Ethan's homage to film noir. Set in the mid-1940s, theplot focuses on a morose barber, Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thornton,"Bandits"), and his upwardly mobile, fashion-conscious wife, Doris(Frances McDormand, "Almost Famous"). When he discovers thathis wife has been unfaithful to him with her boss (JamesGandolfini, "The Mexican"), Ed concocts a blackmailing scheme toteach her a lesson, and make a few bucks in the process. Butwhen his plan backfires, Ed Crane becomes embroiled in amurderous plot and faces terrible consequences. (And yes, it's acomedy.)As is always the case in Coen films, The Man Who Wasn't Therefeatures fantastic acting from the top stars (Gandolfini ismarvelous, as is Thornton -- I admire these two actors more andmore every time I see them) to the supporting cast (Coen mainstayMichael Badalucco is excellent as Ed's brother-in-law andco-worker, and Tony Schaloub as cocky attorney Freddy Riedenschneider is brilliant), right down to the unknown bitplayers.There is a strange sub-plot in The Man Who Wasn't There whichdoesn't quite tie together -- once you've seen this movie, you mightthink of it as I did: a cross between Double Indemnity and TheX-Files. I like both story elements, but not necessarily together.However, if you are a Coen Brothers fan I recommend you see thismovie and decide for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As good as Fargo...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Coen brothers love to jump from genre to genre and put their own unique style into it. For The Man Who Wasn't There, they have chosen film noir. The story is Postman Rings Twice-ish with the usual sexual liaisons and double crosses that inhabit almost every movie from the genre. Billy Bob Thorntan, Francis McDormand, and James Gandolfini are the main stars with strong support from Michael Badalucco as the brother. It's intricate and engrossing but the reason to watch this movie is the stunning cinematography. Black and white has never looked so good (even the actors look like they are from the 40's). When this comes out on DVD I will be the first in line. The movie is slow at times. Not really to its detriment, but if you're looking for slam bam action, look elsewhere.I would rank this as a tie for Fargo as the best Coen movie made yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A philosopher's dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is staggering. The only reason why I'm not giving it a 10 is that I never give out 10s upon first viewing.If you like movies that challenge your understanding of life, existence and the universe (such as "2001: A Space Odyssey" or "Rashmon" or "Wings of Desire"), you need to check out this film immediately. Don't even finish reading this review. Just watch the movie already.In much the same way the Coen kids did "O Brother Where Art Thou" based on Homer's "The Odyssey", now we have "The Man Who Wasn't There" which--though unconfirmed--has very strong similarities to Albert Camus' "The Stranger". If you haven't read the latter, it's a landmark novel published in 1942, practically defining the Existentialist philosophy. It tells a story of a misfit character who gets wrapped up in a crime and the ordeal that ensues. The bizarre chain of events and, more importantly, the character's response provide a challenging philosophical trip.In "The Man Who Wasn't There", we have an identical setup. Thornton does a fantastic job portraying the stoic protagonist in a perfect film noir setting (the best justification for film noir I've ever seen) where emotions are meaningless, morals are arbitrary at best, and cause does not necessarily have effect. But what really makes this film original &amp; compelling is that Thornton, despite his seeming callousness, does not play a predictable "tough guy" but instead carries a childlike quality. In that respect, he is truly a stranger struggling to grasp the rules of society, morality and existence. He is struggling to evolve, constantly collecting knowledge, wisdom and insights throughout his adventure.At one point we realize that this may be a metaphor for the moral evolution of the human race, just as "2001: A Space Odyssey" was a metaphor for the intellectual evolution of the human race. At one point Thornton's character says he feels like he knows some great secret that allows him to rise above the din of normal society. This, I believe, implies that Thornton's character is on some philosophical plane of existence above what we know, and that is what makes this such a provocative tale.Even if you don't choose to take it on a deep philosophical level, the story is riveting, the cinematography is top notch, and the music...! Beethoven piano sonatas throughout. I'd say this film comes as close to setting the perfect mood as any film I've seen in recent years. If you have a chance to see this film, it's worthwhile on so many levels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Luckless Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Man Who Wasn't There is the Coen Brothers homage to that great novel by James M. Cain and the film made from it, The Postman Always Rings Twice. A homage mind you with a considerable influence from their Oscar winning Fargo. I loved the cinematography in black and white done deliberately I think to show the drabness in these rather ordinary people's lives. With one exception these are most ordinary folks.Billy Bob Thornton is the most ordinary of the lot. He's a barber, a guy you probably don't think too much about when you're not getting a haircut. For a barber he's a quiet sort of guy, not at all like the one he shares the barbershop with, Michael Badalucco, who's like most barbers I've ever come across, can make with a non-stop stream of small talk just to make your's and his time pass.Thornton's not talking because he's got a lot on his mind. His wife, Frances McDormand, is having an affair with her boss, James Gandolfini who is married to the heiress of the town's department store, Katherine Borwitz. McDormand does the books for the department store.Into the barbershop one day comes Jon Polito who's obviously a con man, obvious to everyone, but Thornton. Polito is trying to interest someone, anyone in some get rich quick scheme. In fact he tried to interest Gandolfini who wouldn't give him the time of day.Like Fargo's luckless Bill Macy, Thornton hatches a wild scheme to get $10,000.00 to invest with Polito by blackmailing Gandolfini and making him think it was Polito doing the blackmail. And like Fargo it ends with a few people dying before the film is over.The Man Who Wasn't There got one Oscar nomination for cinematography, I think it should have gotten some more. The Coen brothers expanded considerably on some of the themes raised in Fargo and Joel Coen as director got pluperfect performances from his cast.I said before that there was one non-ordinary character brought into this film. That would be criminal defense attorney Tony Shalhoub who's hired to defend one cast member here. For those of you who know him primarily for Monk, this is quite a different Shalhoub. Give him credit for not wanting to be typecast as Adrian Monk. Jon Polito's character is gay and he's by no means is he any kind of a good human being. He's a stereotypically gay person as would have been seen by most people in the homophobic world of 1949 when this film is set. He is one of the characters who dies in this film and the authorities don't get it right. Polito more than likely died due to homophobia back then, than for the reason they think he was killed.This is film is a worthy followup to Fargo, in some ways better than Fargo. As for how it all turns out, that's where the Coen brothers homage to The Postman Always Rings Twice comes in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is so much that I like about this movie, and I've watched it several times. First of all, the Ethan brothers are masters at the art of film-making, and they show their artistry to the fullest in The Man Who Wasn't There. The movie rotates around Thornton, whose deadpan performance is, paradoxically, so moving. It gives me the impression of someone who wants to feel, but is unable to. But the other performers are equally great. Having grown up in the 1960s, I could really relate to the movie, since it reminded me of all the B-movies we would watch on TV. Having said that, I also think it is the most authentic modern film-noir ever made. If there ever was a movie you should have in your private DVD collection, The Man Who Wasn't There is definitely one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish neo-noir with great performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coen brothers+noir+Billy-Bob Thornton = Hard to fail. This holds very true for this film. BASIC PLOT FOLLOWS: The taciturn and chain-smoking barber Ed Crane agrees to put some money into a project a complete stranger offers him. The way he gains the money quickly develops into a complex mess that seems hard to come out on top of.Thornton always risks being type-casted, with his Texas dialect and his appearance, Hollywood likes to see him in the same role. This is really far away from those roles. Ed Crane doesn't speak much, he's introverted but not really grumpy or sullen, his life confuses him yet he doesn't really care that much. He wants to be a cog in the machine, but at the same time it bores him. It's amazing how much we can learn about Ed while he speaks so little. That's good directing and writing, I tell you.Shalhoub pays the movie a visit as well as the sleazy lawyer, a role that's very gratuitous for any actor to play. Thank's to the Coen script, he feels more real than the other clich lawyers, and that's also good. Frances McDormand is Crane's wife, a character I would have liked to see more of, and she also delivers. Then there's Scarlett Johanssen, very young at the time, at least young enough for me not to recognize her. She reminds me a lot of Lolita in the movie of the same name. Nothing to complain about there.The black and white style and the noir pacing is really nice to watch, shadows and lights are used much more efficiently than most black and white movies I've seen, and overall the movie works well on the "art" level.Since it's Coen, it's also quirky, funny and unpredictable. The plot deviates so much from movies of that time so at times it's hard to feel it takes place in the 50's, but that's just a psychological thing. The settings, clothes, manners, etc, are very 50's.Compared to other Coen works, it's a bit slower, a bit deeper, and just as good as their other films.</fullReview>

The plot development wasn't really my cup of tea, and what started out as a really promising Coen-piece turned out to be a kind of 'OK' Coen-experience, but nothing special at all I'm afraid.

		<shortDescription>The Plot That Wasn't There</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS AHEAD:Though responsible for a body of work that exceeds the quality of cinema wunderkind like M. Night Shyamalan (Sixth Sense), the Coen Brothers look ever more likely to be heading the same way. Nothing Shyamalan has done after Sixth Sense has been of remotely comparable stature, and whilst nothing the Coens touch could ever be as execrable as Signs or Unbreakable, the yesteryear magic of Blood Simple, Barton Fink, and Miller's Crossing is becoming an increasingly distant memory. The rot set in with Fargo, a superb piece of film-making marred by the inexplicable pretence that the movie was a true story. Neither funny nor clever, the conceit served only to destroy the context within which the movie was apprehended. With The Man Who Wasn't There, the brothers are at it again, though this time their preoccupation with context is a great deal more obsessive.The context, of course, is 1949, yet it could equally as well have been 1999: the drama that unfolds is not unique to time or place. Drama, however, seems not to have been at the forefront of the Coens' collective mind, for the meticulous narrative engineering of, say, Blood Simple is notable here only for its almost complete absence.As a result, a neat plot twist early on, via which Gandolfini's character discovers that Thornton's character is blackmailing him, is followed by nothing of similar consequence; indeed, the plot thereafter becomes so desperate that it has to reach for intervention by UFOs, an element so ludicrously irrelevant that a less self-important film maker would've had the good grace to leave it with the rest of the rubbish on the editing suite floor.Of course, it's true that the visuals are, as ever, impressive, yet the aspic of time within which the movie is locked also swallows everything else: stasis is so complete that Thornton's character is numb, dumb and troubled to begin with and numb, dumb and troubled at the end.He isn't there, as the title accurately flags up, so in the absence of a functioning human being with whom an audience can sympathise, the core of the movie is wilfully empty.And that's why The Man Who Wasn't There fails so embarrassingly: in preparing this latest offering, the Coens spent so much time on the design and quality of the wrapping that they forgot to put anything inside the box.Not worth opening: 3/10.</fullReview>

Kind of sets you wondering whether the murder took place at all for a while.The twists and turns in the plot are meant to send your mind off in all directions and then bring it back on the track that the Coen brothers set.Some commented here, why did the part of her being pregnant have to surface after she killed herself? That little detail explained why she killed herself to begin with. She didn't commit suicide as an innocent killer, she committed suicide out of being the adulterous wife. It would have not made sense for her to kill herself if she wasn't pregnant.Given the unpredictable twists and the incredible length of the movie, I thought that it was turning into a `Lolita' at some point but the Coen brothers decided not to go there, but merely suggest it through the car scene, leaving you wondering what could have been.It was painful to watch ED smoke so much, no wonder he didn't have the energy to do anything at all.What's with the UFOs?

While I found this movie outstanding in almost every aspect, like everything the Coens have done since Miller's crossing, I didn't care much for the story, and was actually slightly bored. Yep. Isn't it strange?I don't know... maybe this time it's TOO stylish and classy. The whole movie runs so smoothly, it's so polished, nothing in the narrative is really challenging, so I found myself admiring the technical work instead of being involved in the narrative. Would I dare say that this movie is.. aehem... slightly too intellectual?I'm wondering where these terrific filmmakers are heading to, as their production seems to be actually more and more intellectual/classy. "Barton Fink" is in my top-10 list, and with the exception of "Blood simple", all of their 80's and 90's movies have a cherished place in my collection. I found "Big Lebowsky" their last perfect balance between involving narrative and more challenging film-making aspects. I started to have problems with "O brother", which I already found a little too artificial and gratuitous (while still being fantastic film-making, of course, these guys are simply unable to produce less than outstanding movies).I had to give "The man who wasn't there" a high rate because if its sheer brilliance, yet I don't think I'll look at it again, because I simply don't enjoy it. Maybe this will change in a couple of years, though. Meanwhile, I'm waiting for their next opus, hoping I'll enjoy it more than this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Man Who Wasn't There: 10/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening of The Man Who Wasn't There is a simple barber pole, which is symbolic, for the main character's life that keeps on going on. The people who work in the place marked by the pole are Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thorton) and Frank (Michael Badalucco), who are brothers-in-laws. The time is 1949. Ed, our protagonist, is unhappily married to Doris (Frances McDormand). According to the frequent voice-overs, they married after knowing each other for three weeks. One day, he believes that Doris' boss, David `Big Dave' Brewster (James Gandolfini), is having an affair with Doris. So, Ed blackmails him for $10,000, not just for that, but also to pay Creighton Tolliver (Jon Polito) for helping in investing a new-fangled `dry cleaning' service. Well, things spin out of control from there. This is one of those movies where the less you learn about it, the more you'll enjoy it.My one word for The Man Who Wasn't There: wow! I'm not exactly sure how to put it into words, but it has a haunting beauty. It's a film-noir, but also a drama, thriller, and a little part comedy, and maybe a pinch of romance. Its monochromatic cinematography is vibrant, wonderful and transfixing, as is the rest of the movie. It's compelling and thoughtful, without one dull moment. I felt, well, I guess you could say I felt euphoric while I was watching this movie. Not in a happy way, but I felt one with Ed and not many movies can make me feel totally at peace with everything. It's a somber experience, but it's one I would like to take over and over.Thorton was excellent. I'm not one of his largest fans, but I felt hopelessly sad for him, and the chain-smoking barber seems to be like second nature to him. In fact, it seemed even more like a noir because everyone smoked. Just an observation. Anyway, McDormand was good, but she didn't really get the screen time she got in Fargo, which made everybody see how good of an actress she could be. Gandolfini was also excellent, and so was everyone else. Well, I thought Tony Shalhoub, as a fast-talking lawyer, wasn't as good as he could have been. But everyone else was Grade-A.The music, however scarce, was perfect for the movie, the mood, the surroundings. My one complaint? It meanders a bit in the second half, but that's not really much. Thorton's voice overs will probably make people not like this movie as much, but I thought it worked well with the movie. It wasn't the same caliber as the narration in Fight Club or Forrest Gump, but it was still predomint, and I love it. All narration, I'm a sucker for, but this was truly great narration.At the end, it got a little weird, what with UFOs and all, but reminds me of the ending of Memento with the main character realizing something. Overall, what I walked out with is the feeling that I will never look at hair in the same way again.My rating: 10/10Rated R for a scene of violence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but not great. Being a Coen brothers movie that means a slight disappointment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never seen a Coen brothers movie that I didn't like, but for me 'The Man Who Wasn't There' is their most disappointing picture since 'The Hudsucker Proxy'. Some have criticized the slow deliberate pacing of this film noir homage, that I didn't have a problem with. I just thought the movie, while entertaining enough, added very little to the genre. Anyone who has read some James M. Cain will pretty much be able to see where this one is headed within the first half hour, but being the Coens, I expected some wildly original twist or subversion of the style, but it never came. After all, this is not exactly fresh territory for them. Their brilliant debut back in the 80s 'Blood Simple' was a modern version of classic noir, and more recently their best known movie 'Fargo' covered similar themes and situations as this one. Both those movies were more engrossing than 'The Man Who Wasn't There' for me. Billy Bob Thornton is by far the best thing about this movie. Yet another brilliant performance from him. The rest of the supporting cast are all good, especially Jon Polito, a Coen regular since 'Miller's Crossing', who plays a very shifty salesman. But while I enjoyed much about this movie, it really didn't hit the heights I was hoping for. A good movie, but not a great one, and as the Coens are capable of making such original and eclectic movies as 'Barton Fink' and 'The Big Lebowski', that makes it a bit of a disappointment for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will the Coen Brothers ever make a straight movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tight, funny and sad story of a self-described "barber" who blackmails and then kills his wife's lover to support a dry-cleaning business he wants to start. Beautifully photographed by Roger Deakins. The final shot which shows us that his gaze is on the very top of the heads of those who've come to see his execution is funny and revealing (as to the film's running theme of loss of identity/individuality). The writing is pretty loose though (showing more signs of brother Ethan than brother Joel), and perhaps the extraneous UFO subplot hurts more than it helps illustrate the "uncertainty principle." It's moves like this that make me wonder if the Coen Bros. will ever try to make a "straight" movie: every time they almost make it, they throw something surreal in the audience's headlights, as if afraid that their tricks will show through the medium otherwise (and I'm not knocking them, everybody's got tricks). B.B. Thornton is a joy to watch; one of his best roles yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coen Film So Forgettable It Leaves No Impression - Can't remember its name!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was unable to find a theater to show The Man Who Wasn't There film in 2001 when it came out. So I had to be satisfied with watching a VHS copy of it some six months after it appeared in theaters.I should point out how fitting it is that the film has disappeared even from Video store shelves where I live. Fitting, because this is a story about the Man Who Wasn't There. For many Coen Brothers fans, The Big Lebowski and Raising Arizona are the great films. For them, the Man Who Never Was doesn't exist.This overlooked gem IS one of the great Coen Brothers films. I had to put it in my Netflix queue to get a copy. There wasn't one available locally just a year after the video came out.Lately I've been making DVD copies of favorite films. The Coens' distributors at USA films actually took the trouble to encrypt this one with Macrovision. Not that macrovision stops one. There are free programs on the net like DVD Decrypt and DVD Shrink to dispense with copying problems. It costs money to encrypt a tape or DVD, though, makes it difficult to make back your costs. Since this film is quietly disappearing anyway, distributors might just as well have skipped coding.After making the copy I sat down and watched it with the sound off and the captioning on and realized how much detail I missed four years ago when I first looked at the film. I 'read' the film this time. Billy Bob is a local barber. He is overshadowed by everyone., his wife, the local department store manager played by James Ghandofini, even by the chatterbox lead barber he works for at the shop. Crane, our hero's name, explains his story mostly in Noir voice over. Crane's wife married him because he keeps his mouth shut. The result is the two know little about one another. Man Who Wasn't There is peopled by some very forgettable folk. There's a sense of small town failure here. Everyone knows everyone in Santa Rosa, but who'd want to know any of them? A con man comes to town setting the plot in motion. Behind the small town verities, there is a Noir story dripping with deceit and personal despair. In a scene near the end, Crane is driving down a country road with a young girl. The scene reminds one of a similar scene in Cain's Postman and also of Bogey talking to the girl whose gimp leg he is trying to get fixed in Raoul Walsh's High Sierra. This film really rattles a filmophile's memory.I noticed all the references: A Place in the Sun, James M. Cain's The Postman Always Rings Twice, assorted Twilight Zone images from the Rod Serling teleplays that took place at night in suburban neighborhoods. Santa Rosa reminded me of the fictional Santa Mara of Don Siegel's Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Hitchcock and Rod Serling both put their marks on the Coens. I understand Shadow of A Doubt was also set in the bland small town of Santa Rosa, outside Sacramento. Shadows is a great metaphor. There were always waving tree shadows flitting over Billy Bob Thornton's Wan Face in the night air. Looking at the film in closed caption, I was struck by how misled I was mostly just watching the images and listening to the dialog when I first saw the film. The devil was in the details. I now know the whole story as I did not before when I took in the film, consumer style.Anyway, its a bit of a disappearing act, isn't it, this film? I keep forgetting its correct name. The Public never noticed in the first place. McDormand, Ghandofini, Billy Bob, the Coens are all part of the disappearing Man Who Never Was. Maybe that was the point.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film on 10/15/01 at the Denver International Film Festivale and found to be very dissapointing. I'm still trying to understand why the Coen Brothers let me down. The characters were flat, the plot was dull and if this was an ode to Film Noir the Coen Brothers didn't do a very good job. Several people who left the screening behind me commeted the same way. I almost fell asleep in the middle of this mess. The Coen Brothers best films were: "O Brother Where Art Thou", Blood Simple" "Fargo" and "The Hudsucker Proxy". I was all hyped to see there new film in advance and what I came away with was a headache, James Gandofini didn't make his character worthwhile and France McDormand seemed to sleep walk through her role along with Billy Bob Thorton at her side sleep walking too. Billy Bob seemed bored and his line reading reading came aross like cardboard, very flat and lifeless. It seemed Billy Bob was trying to be redo his Sling Blade role the way he walked and talked. A very Zzzzzzzzz movie. Very forgettable. No Oscars in sight for this film or its actors, mabey some more ating classes and that is about all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fresh film noir by the Coens.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The year is 1949. Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thornton) is a barber with a generally uneventful life. He suspects his wife Doris Crane (Frances McDormand) is having an affair with her boss Dave Brewster (James Gandolfini), and he has little connection with her. So when a customer at the barber shop Creighton Tolliver (Jon Polito) tells Ed about putting up $10,000 in the new technology of dry cleaning, Ed decides to blackmail Brewster anonymously to get the money. The plan goes awry and the movie turns into a suspense based drama. The movie is great. The classic black and white cinematography, along with the acting cement the laconic late 40s tone. I always enjoy the Coen brothers, and although The Man who Wasn't There is one of the less known works it should not be overlooked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Billy Bob Thorton's best performance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in the late 1940's, low key barber Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thorton) inadvertently blackmails his wife's boss, which leads to him killing him to cover it up. This triggers a complicated police involvement with Ed, as well as a psychological breakdown, all while he narrates the events in his mind.Billy Bob Thorton is not only greatly cast, but he is top notch in this film, you feel what he feels, and what he's going through not just through the narration, but through his facial expressions. The Coens captured the psychological feeling through the excellent cinematography, eerie music, and classy set pieces. The events in the film are fairly simple and play out like a pretty standard neo- noir drama, but his narration is what makes it so deep and unforgettable, and what makes it stand out. This is a rare instance where it isn't style over substance, both are very strong in this film. We get the classy black and white cinematography, along with some strong character reading.I had a couple issues. Like I said, it is a standard neo noir film, and the narration kind of over escalates the film itself, and doesn't play out on its own at any point. It also takes a bit of time to set up the plot, and even though it has great payoff, it's still rough to get through. Overall, it's a super solid Coen film that stands out as one of their more psychological films, as well as one of their most stylistic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>another great Coen brothers movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another excellent film in the canon of the brothers Coen. The only film of theirs I wasn't terribly fond of was "Inside Llewyn Davis," though I have not seen all of their work. Good understated performance by Billy Bob Thornton as the central character. Great casting all around (the late James Gandolfini comes to mind). Terrific script with pleasing surprises. This is not, in my opinion, a Coen bros. masterpiece; however, it is clearly the work of masters of movie-making in peak form. Thornton's nonentity character--never without a cigarette--is sad, tragically human, memorable. He is the kind of guy who just lets life happen around him. This movie is basically as good as neo-noir gets. Black and white was a great, an important, choice. Of those I've seen the only Coen brothers films that were made after this I thought were superior are "A Serious Man" and "No Country for Old Men." I expect this film will continue to age well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am rather astonished by the rating on this movie, but I shouldn't be. I find too many movies given ratings that they do not deserve. This movie has several good things going for it, but in the end, it did not come together for me, and could not hold my interest. I have to admit, in the beginning, I was pretty interested in Billy Bob Thorton's character, and I was interested to see what would happen. As the plot became more bizarre, however, simply stopped caring. Oddly enough, I liked Francis McDormand, who I really do not always enjoy. A few of the plot twists were unexpected. I liked some of the questions it raised, and what it was trying to do with Film Noir as a genre. But mostly, the characters didn't fit each other for me in a way that is needed to make the movie's universe coherent to me. Sometimes the quirks and turns of a film, while being unbelievable, still make sense within the film, and one can suspend disbelief. That was not the case for me in this film. I found it convoluted and contrived. The atmosphere, the characters, the pace... lost my interest.</fullReview>

I found out that are the same directors and writers of these movies after watching No Country For Old Men and i just assumed that maybe are the same directors and i get it. They have the same feeling, emotions and very good psychological side of the story. In both of the movies characters don't say too much words, but in The Man Who Wasn't There, Ed Crane had too many internal monologues, which i think it's good. I love that. Billy Bob Thornton was brilliant in this movie. His voice has that dramatic feeling and destroys any other atmosphere. In that moments you are focused only to his voice.Movie is black and white, which is wonderful because the story takes in the older times. That's another factor who give us mysterious and dramatic atmosphere.I like the cinematography and actors very much. The cinematographer is Roger Deakins who rules this job in every movie he doing. Of other actors, i love Tony Shalhoub. He surprise me in every role he played. He could be also very good for character like Ed Crane. He discover that to us in TV Series Monk. Other actors are great also, except Scarlett Johansson. I don't like her. She didn't surprise me in any movie where she played. She is just very attractive, and that's all.Story is a little simply. There's missing something. Something that people will not expected. You expecting the death of Ed Crane far from the end. And it's like in No Country For Old Men, just happens something you expected, and that's the end. But, all others stuffs which adorn the whole movie are great and if you have time, don't miss that chance to watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Karma always strikes back!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's always a pleasure to watch a beautifully crafted neo noir thriller. And what adds greater to the pleasure is the fact that in spite having a radical approach, the movie stays true to its plot. The same happens with Director Joel Coen's latest. The story mainly deals with a succinct barber who is disappointed with his life and gets entangled in a web of murders and misfortunes which seem to be the part of something much bigger. Billy Bob Thornton is refreshingly addictive as Ed Crane, the laconic antihero supported with a petite but powerful performance from James Gandolfini.Special mention goes to Roger Deakins who does a tremendous job with the camera. He gives a certain charismatic aura to the monochrome effect with brilliant use of light. That being said, the movie could have been a little stronger towards the end.What started out as a nail biting thriller starts veering towards the emotional.The ending is a one to cherish. Taking away the concept of a happy ending, the film delivers the message it was intended to- "Karma always strikes back. Sometimes in a really creepy way!"Watch it!</fullReview>

The barber shop belongs to his brother-in-law Frank (Michael Badalucco). Customer Creighton Tolliver (Jon Polito) has an 'investment' opportunity for him and he blackmails Doris' boss Big Dave Brewster (James Gandolfini) who's having an affair with her. He also has flirtations with young pianist Birdy Abundas (Scarlett Johansson). When Doris gets in trouble, they hire the expensive defense lawyer Freddy Riedenschneider (Tony Shalhoub).The Coen brothers have made a beautiful movie. The black and white is wonderfully bright. It's technically superior filmmaking. Billy Bob Thornton delivers another great performance with his quiet intensity. It's probably not for everybody since it's not a compelling character to root for. There is a distant that the style keeps from the audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kafka: Revisited</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:What is the essence of this movie: existential vacancy. It is a redoing of Kafka's THE STRANGER. Ed is not there existentially; he has gone way beyond Luke or Harry the antiheroes of the counterculture in their respective films. Ed's vacancy is so profound; like the stranger things happen to him, even life and death struggles and he experiences nothing. The profundity of the emptiness gives the film such an eerie quality. Yet, when we enter his life can we blame him for running away? How would you like to stand all day listening to Frank drone on his inanities for the entire day? When he comes home, Doris continues the droning. He is consumed with escape; he has left but his body remains. Thornton was always a great actor. Like Russell, in SOLDIER, imagine trying to act with this limited dialogue using only non verbal communication? Thornton pulls it off. I see some people thought that Ed would never have fallen for such a ridiculous scheme that Creighton sells him on.The answer is he is consumed with escape; he has retreated as far as he can, the prospect of great wealth and the final ability to leave his Stygian life. The delusion consumes him. He sets in motion the deadly concatenation of events that will ultimately kill Doris, Big Dave and himself. Thornton conveys his doubts about Creighton; I never got the feeling that he really believed him. He was so sick cutting peoples' hair and listening to Frank drone on eternally. When Doris starts an affair with Big Dave it really is the trigger. Doris is such a cold, cruel angry person that it is impossible to feel the least bit of empathy for her. Attacking the salesman, she never misses the opportunity to be mean to people. Her cruelty to Ed, flirting with Dave and subtly ridiculing Ed right in front of Dave, is why the film did not do well. It also is quite esoteric and odd even for a Coen film. When you add a heroine who is a cruel, heartless, immoral sleaze it is hard for people to care about her.It was all needed philosophically to convey the horrible life Ed has; this is why he has taken such existential flight that even when Big Dave is about to kill him, Ed still is not there. His defensive reaction is depicted as reflexive; the body saves itself automatically without any effort on Ed's part. This is quintessential Kafka. The stranger suffers these events as if he were a spectator in the stands. This is zero affective content to any action that happens to him. Even with Big Dave bleeding out and choking, Ed has no panic nor emotional content. It is the same as any other action. He simply resumes his routine. We see some of the emotional reasons Doris is cruel, cold and shut off. Yet, it is an existential flight so much further than COOL HAND Luke or DIRTY HARRY. These two antiheroes are still in the world interacting with it experiencing it. Ed is a walking corpse. He welcomes death, though, again it is surreal and someone else's experience to him. I must tell you even if all this bores the crap out of you watch the movie for Tony Shalhoub's Freddie Riedenschneider; he steals every scene he is in. His love for himself and his very flexible ethics are drop dead hilarious. Babbling anything, like the Hawthorne Effect, that he thinks will win the case for him. The entire universe has been boiled down to this: WHAT WILL WIN THE CASE? He is as empty as Ed is but for this one axion: the universe must be manipulated so I can win my case. It is a hidden gem in the Coen library far superior to the ugly, overrated FARGO. It will interest you; you will never see another film like it.</fullReview>

I didn't understand who killed who, and the reason for that. And what about the aliens? What do they have to do with the whole story? Also, I got confused with Frank and Big Daver; in my opinion, they were portrayed by too similar actors, with caused some mess in a black and white picture. I understand that there is some great acting-- with exception of Scarlett Johansson , who looked shallow in this, which is unusual for her--, but the movie as a whole is just too boring, slow and twisted to be enjoyable.

Ed the Barber utters few words throughout the entire film yet he steals every scene with his 50s style film star stares and constant smoking. The smoke is one of the best actors in the whole thing, adding layers of movement to every black and white frame.The plot does get a little predictable at times, but this doesn't detract from a solid interesting piece of cinema, and the whole thing is peppered with Coen Brother traits which make it a must see for any fan of their work, and maybe even a good place to start for any Coen virgins.This is one that does improve with subsequent viewings, but might be a little slow paced for someone looking for more popcorn drama, there are some tense moments, but overall this is a character study through a 50s noir pallet.Worth a watch</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cautionary Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thornton) is a barber working at his in laws' barber shop. He's relatively unhappy with his life and suspects that his wife Doris Crane (Frances McDormand) is having an affair with her boss Big Dave Brewster (James Gandolfini). Ed gets talking to one of his customers who offers him a stake in his dry cleaning business if Ed stumps up $10,000. Ed doesn't have the money, but hatches a plan to get the money. However, Ed quickly learns that his simple and seemingly flawless plan ends up having far reaching consequences.I know that the Coen Brothers have a die hard cult following of fans, but I've never really been one of them. In fact, I've actually disliked nearly all of their films that I've seen. However, this film is different - this film really impressed me.This film is basically a Cautionary Tale - the Coen Brothers have actually made their audience consider the devastating consequences resulting in being greedy. They also make the audience consider the devastating consequences that one poorly judged action can have on many different people.The Coen Brothers have also created many characters that are not only well developed, but that we can also identify with. Ed Crane is probably the best example; for me he's an idealist, someone who wants to be recognised and remembered, someone who wants to be somebody. This becomes more apparent when he meets Birdy Abunbdas (Scarlett Johansson). Birdy becomes his project or possibly even his redemption. What I liked about Ed is that he was a flawed person rather than a bad person which meant that it was easier to relate to and care for his character. Birdy was an interesting character and it was a shame that her character wasn't developed quite as much as I hoped for - there was a lot of potential with her character which the Coen brothers didn't explore for some reason.I'll admit that in the early stages of this film that I thought the narrative was a bit shaky and found it a bit nonsensical, but as the film progressed I found myself more and more engrossed and thought that everything ended up being tied together nicely. As mentioned. it's a Cautionary Tale and is a film that will certainly make you think.The film is well-shot and the 1940's era has been captured well. Acting was roundly good across the board with Gandolfini and Coen brothers favourite McDormand arguably putting in the best performances.Overall then this is a very good film (and that's coming from someone who isn't a big Coen brothers fan). I thought that the writing was sharp, the acting was good, the plot was interesting (after a bit of a plodding first half). This is a good piece of noir and a very good film in general. Highly recommended for fans of noir or fans of the Coen brothers.</fullReview>

Matthew Wilder finds comparisons to Camus ("What kind of a man are you?", matthew wilder from los angeles, 2 November 2001). Evanston_dad also mentions Billy Bob Thornton's lack of Oscar recognition despite worthy achievements ("An Excellent Film Noir, Coen Brothers Style", evanston_dad from United States, 27 July 2010)."The Man Who Wasn't There" is worth seeing, even if the viewer (such as myself) doesn't particularly like the Coen brothers. It is a slow-paced film noir with very dark plot twists. One could say it is a meditation not on the noir genre, but on the futility of life itself.Visually, while the technique of shooting in color and printing it in Black &amp; White does look great, Joel Coen's overall direction is really boring. There are stock characters who are disturbingly repulsive. There are seemingly pointless scenes and dialog. With the creepy foray into the Roswell incident, the Coen brothers have made yet another film that serves the interests of the CIA.The performances of Billy Bob Thornton as barber Ed Crane, Frances McDormand as his wife, Doris Crane and James Gandolfini as Big Dave inject some life. Thornton's Crane smokes like Humphrey Bogart used to and reacts to even tense situations with unruffled calm. Gandolfini is convincingly menacing. McDormand is convincing as an unfaithful drunk. Having a lawyer mention Quantum Physics to a jury (in a capital murder case), using not only Schrdinger's cat but also the Uncertainty Principle is a really absurd idea. It has to be the worst possible defense strategy, since you are telling the jury that the accused might or might not be guilty depending on when the measurement is taken.Since the taciturn Ed Crane is clearly referenced by the eponymous title, it is interesting how many men "are not there." For example, family friend Walter (Richard Jenkins) doesn't mind Ed Crane hanging around his high-school aged daughter (Scarlett Johansson, very sexy here) as she plays piano every night. I've mentioned the lawyer (Tony Shalhoub's) curious defense strategy. The two cops hardly appear sufficiently inquisitive when they are first introduced. Big Dave Brewster (Gandolfini) appears to be telling Ed Crane his secret but fails to, etc."The Man Who Wasn't There" is worth a look, but there is much better film noir elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is definitive film noir; the best I've ever seen. The cinematography, the acting, the dialogue epitomize what that genre was meant to convey: man's lonely place in the universe. Even the whole paranoid fascination with extra-terrestrials in Roswell, New Mexico at the time the film is set (1949 - coincidentally the year I was born) emphasizes the existential dread peculiar to post-war America.Billy Bob Thornton is remarkable as Ed Crane, the anti-hero, a barber who ends up committing murder when all he wanted from life was to open a dry-cleaning store since that seemed like his manifest destiny, his 'niche' in the world. The self-effacing discontent that marks his performance makes Mitchum and Bogart seem flat and dated in comparison. There's a soft pain in his deadpan voice and brow that illuminate each chain-smoking puff as a deathwish.The dialogue is funny, astute and even beautiful. My own favorite line is when Ed describes his courtship with his wife. "It was only a couple weeks later she suggested getting married. I said, "Don't you want to get to know me more?" She said, "Why? Does it get better?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Coen Brothers' brilliance shines in "The Man Who Wasn't There," a 2001 neo-noir starring Billy Bob Thornton, Frances McDormand, Tony Shalhoub, Michael Badalucco, James Gandolfini, and Scarlett Johansson.Filmed meticulously in black and white, the film is about a barber in Santa Rosa in 1949, Ed Crane, a man who doesn't say much and in fact seems to be sleep-walking through life. He tries to tune out his chatty brother-in-law (Badalucco) and he and his wife Doris really don't communicate, nor do they seem to be in love. In fact, they're not.Ed may be quiet, but he seems to be always thinking. He's also observant. When he hears his wife's boss (Gandolfini) talking about an opportunity in the dry-cleaning business, he thinks he might like to do that. The buy-in is $10,000. Ed thinks he know where he can get the money. It's underhanded but worth a try.Ed's crime leads to other things, and that's all I'll say.Billy Bob Thornton, so marvelously photographed, gives an enigmatic performance as Ed. You have no idea what he's going to do. Will he blow up? What is he capable of? What is he thinking? The atmosphere created by the Coen Brothers is fraught with tension. It's like a coil waiting to spring. I doubt it's a coincidence that they chose to set their film in Santa Rosa, where Hitchcock filmed "Shadow of a Doubt." There is something very Hitchcockian about the atmosphere and the ominous feeling that danger is right around the corner.Another "don't miss this one" from Joel and Ethan Coen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do It, Billy Bob!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A laconic, chain-smoking barber (Billy Bob Thornton) blackmails his wife's boss and lover (James Gandolfini) for money to invest in dry cleaning, but his plan goes terribly wrong.The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Cinematography, which is a bit odd considering that the cinematography of Roger Deakins (on this picture) is straightforward and traditional. Most shots are made with the camera at eye level, with normal lensing and a long depth of field. The lighting is textbook, with quarter-light setups. (Not saying this is not good camera work, but hardly anything innovative.)Billy Bob Thornton is very strong here, less sleazy than usual, and Tony Shalhoub really steals the show (his talents are far too under-appreciated, I think).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Man Who Wasn't There, the Soul That Was With Us ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a cloud of absorbing poetry floating above "The Man Who Wasn't There", from the title to Roger Deakins' black-and-white photography. 'Who could be this man who wasn't there and what is 'there' referring to anyway? This is another fascinating enigma effortlessly concocted by the Coen brothers, who populated the screen with so many original characters at the edge of expressing their inner self for better or worse, and through their psychological dilemmas, inviting us to question our own lives' meanings.And it's not a surprise that the hypnotic beauty that makes this gem so worth to be discovered and watched as many times without the enjoyment being spoiled, is carried by the extraordinary performance of Billy Bob Thornton as Ed Crane, the barber. His deadpan expression all through the film provides the answer to the title, this is a man who lives his life without being quite into it? wherever he is, his soul isn't there. It's not a surprise either that he remains silent most the time, for he's the passive observer of his own life, slowly falling down in the slippery hill of routine, with quite possibly the most routinely activity ever: cutting hair. Hair have a strange habit to keep on growing, which is good for business, but doesn't leave much room for expression, it's the cycle of cutting and growth, so malicious it goes on even after death. In the barbershop, he cuts hair while trying not to get distracted by his talkative boss, and stepbrother. At home, he keeps on acquiescing to his wife (Frances McDormand), an accountant in a mall, knowing that she cheats on him with her boss, Big Dave (James Gandolfini). Yet Ed doesn't even care, and this is revealing of how totally disillusioned he is. And the detachment is not just all about attitude or a cool-looking carapace; it's the reason to be of the voice-over, carried by Thornton's virile voice and laconic tone. Because we wouldn't know what goes into that man who barely talks. The voice-over is a window on the man's soul, a man who most of the time, breathes and smokes, and only betrays his feelings with eyes-language, and it's an accomplishment for Thornton to embody the total indifference of a man toward his own failure with the only power of an irresistible sad-eyed expression. Indeed, this is the kind of bravura performance that can easily be overlooked by the Academy, more focused on larger-than-life characters but it's Crane's very averageness that makes him bloom within the darkness of his soul, to which his eyes lead like a tunnel. With his voice and look, Thornton has the stuff to rival Humphrey Bogart and Morgan Freeman, while his character is certainly no Bogart, and certainly no 'free man', still he's the perfect film-noir character. I know any film today can be labeled as film-noir as long as it features a character torn between ambitions and principles, and fatally lured into wrong choices, with a gritty atmosphere and cynical view on life to complete the picture. But the film's noir undertones go far beyond aesthetic purposes, it transcends the genre, polishes it, embellishes it, darkens it, not for the looks, but for the story. Ed Crane is a man trapped between light and shadows, in a scene where he leaves the mall after something dramatic happened, you can see his shadow penetrating a thin line of light, between two dark stains of inky obscurity, the feeling you get is his total isolation and entrapment that drove his whole life. And all his choices are motivated by the desire to get off that condition. But I might make the film sound like a sort of psychological study, there's a plot in "The Man Who Wasn't There", and a rich one, starting with Jon Polito's arrival as a con- man who'll make the kind of offer, Crane might see as a ticket to escape from his hellish routine. There are premises of great twists and revelations, but the film takes its time, and never goes faster than Thornton who is the lost soul of the film.Everyone around him talks, laughs, chats, dances, plays, everyone gives hints of their personality, or the others'. One of the most interesting characters is Riedenschneider, a lawyer, played in another stellar performance by Tony Shalhoub, the man teaches us that the more we look at people, the less likely we're to get the truth about them. And this lesson applies to Crane in two ways: the more he sees people, the more he got certitudes that end up being betrayed by reality, and the more we focus on him, the more likely we're to be surprised by his behavior. And Crane surprises us because he's a passive character on the surface but each action, each move he makes or breathe he takes, is of heavy consequences. Crane can either resign to the hypocrisy of marital wife or become his new master, make money or manage a promising piano player played by Scarlett Johannsen. This is the typical man trying to give his life a meaning, even more relevant in the late 40's since after World War II, people aspired for peace and stability, which can even be more oppressive than the exhilaration of War. Crane couldn't even go to the Army because of flat feet, and his whole life is a series of anticlimactic events, inducing a necessary appetite for excitement.The Coen brothers strike again with a noir masterpiece enriched with multiple layers of comedy, law procedural and psychological study. It's also a film of dazzling imagery thanks to its use of black-and-white and focus on relevant objects like a spinning wheel or a barber sign, working like true metaphors of boring and deadly routine. It's a nightmare around the clock turning in Crane's sad eyes, a tickling bomb that, in Crane's exceptional case, will end with an implosion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I am wondering if I am going to write or I am not, it is better to note down my impressions from the movie. As I add that I would like to be Coen brothers personal critic, it becomes more clear why I write.Although black-and-white, showing the grey everyday life of a man, who was not there, the two brothers send us where he was. In the toothless abstraction, in the dreamy imagination, in the half-world between the material and the intelligible.The people like the protagonist from this movie are not few, they are clever enough to do things which ordinary people would not or to do things that almost no one will do, and in a way, that all these things, touched by him become big, but in any case, not normal. A small reference to some professions to which are denied the abilities of other professions, professions in which the soul depth of their workers reaches at most the amazement of unprofessional played music.Unbelievable personages played by believable actors. UFO. The absurd of Camus again. Movie not for everyone, especially if he works in mentioned above professions. It flows slowly, like life, full of the divine capability of the brothers to worsen the situation till its self-annihilation.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I understand that the film was intended in black and white, but I decided on a viewing in color and it turned out beautifully - o, the sepia!The story is terrific, a haphazard film noir pastiche with an ultimate sense of black humour and an almost religious sort of 'side-story' with Ann &amp; the aliens. The genre mix of crime, drama, comedy and mystery comes off just perfectly.Billy Bob Thornton has the perfect looks, posture and acting skills to portray this film noir character who eventually gets it, but not before a long and winding road. And didn't I think it (though it was the first time I noticed this) that there was something 'up' when Ed was intensely listening to 'Birdy' (another wonderful role, by Scarlett Johansson) play? - check the trivia.This was also the first (and only, ever, as it turns out) time the Coens took on James Gandolfini to play in one of their films - an excellent choice, what a great performance.I'm back to the full 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Film That Wasn't There</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A dark comedy. I think that's one way to put it. A man gets naively involved in a crime that leads to another more serious crime and everything around him goes down the toilet, one thing after another. Yet, the entire time, he keeps a cool, introspective, somewhat philosophical mindset, as though he's remembering all of this and what could possibly be the implications of it all. Beethoven wrote music despite the fact that he couldn't hear any of it and this guy, Ed (wonderfully played by Billy Bob Thornton), speaks to us throughout this movie despite being mostly silent throughout the film. The plot is overcomplicated due to every character in it being more simple than they pretend to be. Nobody thinks things through at all. Everybody takes everything at face value, then discards it when it's essentially the truth. Aliens appear to appear. To someone, they provide all the answers when they don't. To someone else, they provide no answers when they clearly have provided a way out. I like the idea that the aliens are a metaphor for the Coen Brothers, writers and filmmakers coming in to look on their work. Again, though, it's brilliant, but it may not be, and the answers are not there, and the film is too postmodern for its simplicity to be anything other than simple and its deeper meanings to be anything other than window dressing. At the end of the day, a simple man was writing a story to a pulp magazine. His story may have more in it than he knows, but he's too simple to really know. Also: when Scarlet Johannson says she just wants to make you happy... let her make you happy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is an excellent movie thru and thru</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've watched this movie many times and while I can't put all the points together, this is just an excellent movie. The writing, directing, acting, cinematography, etc, is picture perfect. The crystal-clear black-and-white film give it an antiseptic feeling which is perfect for the dry and considered narration of the lead character, the barber, Ed Crane, laconically played by Billy Bob Thorton. This is really the only way he could contribute since the character is nearly mute in the film as compared to the three principal people in his life: his wife, Doris, played by Francis McDormand; his brother-in-law and lead barber at the shop, Frank, played by Michael Badalucco; and his wife's boss, Big Dave Brewster, played by James Gandolfini. Between these three people, Ed needn't bother more than a slightly-raised eyebrow or low-frequency response. They don't seem to care either way and neither does he.While surrounded by blabber-mouths, Ed stoically carries on, cutting hair and just occasionally wondering about the meaning in the universe (his consideration at one point to mix cut hair with "common house dirt" is startling for this character as his brother-in-law shows). But Ed soldiers on and on, taking some sojourns along the way but really not leaving the path life has led him to all along.It's such an interesting character and such an interesting way to present him. The Beethoven piano sonatas which account for, I believe, the complete soundtrack, is perfect for Ed's on-screen musings and short forays. Like Ed they are considered, solemn, quiet, and in the end, stunning.This has to be Thorton's best role by a mile (well, maybe half-a-mile remembering "Slingblade"). Of course, the movie is filled with many familiar Coen Brothers' faces who are all excellent and carry their chores with grace. The writing is tight and the film flows along like a Beethoven sonata. If you're looking for "Fargo" or "Big Lebowski", this is the other kind of film the Coen Brothers make, beautiful and stunning ... nearly enough to leave you with your mouth hanging open by the end.A film not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In small-town Santa Rosa, California, following World War II, chain-smoking barber Billy Bob Thornton (as Edward "Ed" Crane) is unhappy with his lot in life. He gives traveling salesman Jon Polito (as Creighton Tolliver) a haircut. The script-described "pansy" convinces Mr. Thornton to invest $10,000 in a proposed dry-cleaning business. Since Thornton doesn't actually have the money, he decides to blackmail his wife's lover. Alcoholic wife Frances McDormand (as Doris) has been having an affair with her boss, department store manager James Gandolfini (as David "Big Dave" Brewster)...Things don't go according to plan...This film starts as an intriguingly woven crime story, then meanders into a purely a character study; of course, it was the latter all along. Most striking is the use of black-and-white by the Coen brothers and photographer Roger Deakins. It may be meant to evoke 1940s films, but creates a different look entirely; there are few films that really look like the older ones - someone should see of the old black-and-white cameras and equipment still work, because there is a difference...In any case, Mr. Deakins does extraordinary work. He won several awards for cinematography. Also performing well are annoying barber Michael Badalucco (as Frank) and oily lawyer Tony Shalhoub (as Freddy Riedenschneider). The scene where a mourning Katherine Borowitz (as Ann) comes to pay Thornton her respects is marvelous. She is illustrated severely under a veil of dotted blackness while he listens softly under a shadowy breeze. We have jumped the shark by the time pianist Scarlett Johansson (as Birdy Abundas) instigates a pop-up fly, but at least it always looks excellent.******** The Man Who Wasn't There (5/13/01) Joel Coen ~ Billy Bob Thornton, Frances McDormand, James Gandolfini, Jon Polito</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie for Fans of the Coen Brothers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reactions to this interesting black-and-white film noir are likely to depend on whether you like the Coen brothers' sensibility or you don't. It will certainly not be to everyone's taste. The principal character, well played by Billy Bob Thornton, is a taciturn barber in a small California town. He's intentionally a nobody in a nobody setting who gets caught up in a spider's web of interlocking crimes. I won't say anything about the plot, which is a variation on the scenarios of other noir films. It's strength lies in the odd, often humorous perspective that the Coen brothers bring to all their films. This one is different than some of their previous work because the humor is, for the most part, subtler and the principal characters are intended to be ordinary people living ordinary, uninteresting lives in a mostly uninteresting way. But the acting is excellent, drawing on the talents of actors like Frances McDormand who are regulars in Coen films, newcomers to their stable (James Galdofini) and the young Scarlette Johanssen. My wife and I are Coen devotees, so we liked it. Others may find it slow-moving before it finally gets going. There's no one in the movie to like, not even Johanssen in the end. It's in black and white, which many film-goers don't care for. And film noir is film noir -- a passion for some, not so for others. See it or don't accordingly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though none of Coen brother's movies look the same, its easy to say when you see one. Another crime drama from them shot in black and white with a film-noir style featuring their muse Frances McDormand. Though its a crime thriller, it hardly keeps us guessing except in one scene just about half-time, I thought they were taking the 'From Dusk till Dawn' route and I was hoping them to as the extended 4th Act becomes pointless and predictable.Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thornton) is a sad, unsatisfied and chain smoking middle aged man - barber by profession. Married to Doris (Frances McDormand) who is having an affair with her boss Big Dave (James Gandolfini). When a wacky looking Creighton (Jon Polito) walks in for a haircut bragging about an opportunity in dry cleaning business, Ed sees a way out of his stagnated life. When he decides to resort to blackmail, things do not turn out the way he anticipates.Each actor reserves a different acting style when working with the Coen brothers, they become more eccentric, active and alive. But Thorton's character has lesser facial expressions than Arnie's T2 role. Jon Polito looked like a replacement to their usual choice John Goodman for such roles as he tries to act and talk him. This movie serves more like an experimentation vehicle for Coen Brothers for exploring genres since the script didn't look like it had any potential to be greater than what it turned out to be. Scarlett Johansson plays a small role and oozes sexiness and confidence she is attributed with today.Not their best but still so fun to watch</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lighting is too modern! Billy Bob Thorton and Aliens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The use of shadows was excellent. On Thorton's face in particular, the shadows were fantastic because his face is so open and devoid of emotion. Also, the clarity and lighting quality of this picture was awesome. However, the contrast of gray-scale tones from the early 2000s to the early 1900s differs so much. I believe to watch film noir you do need that low quality lighting and picture to fully appreciate the origins of film noir. This comparison is like listening to vinyl records over CDs, CDs are more modern but the sound of the records are so unique and that comparison is what we are missing. The shadows may be done magnificently in more modern films but to truly appreciate anything looking back to the roots, is the way to go. Billy Bob Thorton as Ed Crane, creates a whole new dimension for this film. Tied with the shadows of lighting Thorton's face, is portrayed as a man who thinks so much but yet says and does nothing(except smoke). His face is one that makes you nervous because he stares and is silent. However, when he does talk, the words he speaks are highly intelligent. These words, they show another dimension to this character because the pauses, inflections and overall dialect prove that he is the silent intelligent type. As his character Thorton does not show emotions via his expressions because he communicates them through the few words he does speak. By not broadcasting his emotions, Thorton grasps the audiences attention, in a suspenseful way because they wish to know what he is thinking now. Containing twisted love affairs, black mail, and murder, this film is outstanding . It's the story of a silent barber and how one day when he decided to change and everything went wrong. They say every action has a consequence, in this it is proved that our actions dictates what occurs in our lives. I love the story line, it is so realistic. But why are there aliens???? I did not get this twist and i am slightly upset as to why they included this bizarre twist...... overall I love this movie however!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Coen Bros. film nobody ever talks about</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Man Who Wasn't There revolves around and is narrated by a man named Ed Crane, a barber, under-played brilliantly by Billy Bob Thornton. Displeased with his profession and seeing an opportunity to buy into a dry cleaning franchise he decides to blackmail a local department store manager (James Gandolfini in one of those great 'character actor' parts he specialises in when he's not on TV) who is having an affair with his wife (Frances McDormand). Naturally, nothing goes to plan and one disaster leads to another as people are killed, betrayed and falsely accused. The best way to describe the film is as "typically Coenesque" and while that is a huge compliment it is also what works against the film. There is a definite feeling of been-there-done-that that lingers over the whole thing but I suppose that even the Coens cannot break new ground with every effort.If Miller's Crossing was about "men in hats" (Barry Sonnenfeld), then The Man Who Wasn't There is about shadows. Many of the most memorable shots in the Coen catalogue occur in this picture and it's obvious that Roger Deakins is truly in his element. I would venture to say that visually The Man Who Wasn't There is the greatest film from the brothers, although No Country For Old Men is also a contender for that title.As you'd expect, the performances are great across the board. The Coens excel in casting the right actors in the right parts. Even though they frequently use the same performers, it feels fresh every time and not like they are just casting their mates 'cause it's easier. Along with the aforementioned, Jon Polito and Tony Shalhoub chew up the scenery in great supporting parts and it's a nice surprise to see a young Scarlett Johansson pop up and display her natural talents early in her career. Read into that what you will...The Man Who Wasn't There is certainly worth your time and it fits nicely into the Coen canon. It is by no means their 'worst' film (that will always be Intolerable Cruelty, which is still decent) but just don't go into it expecting anything overly original. Indeed, besides its black and white photography it doesn't really have much to separate it from their other work, that is to say that amongst their filmography you will find similar subjects being discussed in better films. Criminal plans gone wrong? Check. Disillusioned central character? Check. Frances McDormand having an affair? Check. You get the idea. Still, The Coens prove that even when they are treading water they can deliver a better product than most directors going for gold, which is something they should be pretty proud of!</fullReview>

It is a comedy but a dark one, with a low-key approach that stresses the absurdities of life. Thornton is well cast as a barber who thinks he has found a means to escape the daily rut but instead finds himself involved in murder. The fine cast includes the likes of Gandolfini, Johansson, and Shalhoub as interesting characters. The cinematography strikingly evokes the atmosphere of a bygone era that is nostalgic as well as tinged with darkness. Beethoven's "Pathetique" Sonata is effectively used to convey a mood of melancholy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The man who wasn't there - A modern classic!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has got to be one of the unsung gems within the coen brothers' collection of classics. With an entourage of films such as Fargo, Barton Fink, The Big Lebowski and Oh Brother Where Art Thou, (it is very ironic to say that) it's easy to overlook 'The man who wasn't there'.Starring, a middle aged Ed Crane (Billy-Bob Thornton) working as an assistant Barber in his brother-in-laws barbershop in 1940's America, narrating and sharing the events of his life in a retrospective manner. You are introduced to his calm, quiet character somewhat content with his mundane life, his job, his cheating wife and his house. Nothing in his life is great but also nothing seems to be wrong, everything is OK.Following through his daily routine, and his humdrum existence he continues on day after day cutting hair until one day a particularly optimistic customer walks through the door. A salesman has come into town to present his new invention to a local business to arrange a financial partnership for the $10,000 funding required to start, his 'Dry Cleaning' company. His idea is duly rejected and he is left looking for someone else for the capital.Though clearly not having the money Ed decides to step in to 'raise' the amount required through means of blackmailing his wife's adulterer. Hereon the story of the quiet simplistic man develops, twists and turns through the result of obtaining the money.Shot beautifully in black and white film noir style, the camera frames and angles used in some of the scenes are unique and wonderfully placed, but yet simplistic. In a real Coen Brothers style the film never really takes a particular path and as soon as you feel it becomes predictable another story seems to develop, forever changing the outline of the film.Billy-Bob is exceptional in his role and with the Coen directing his screen presence is immense, even despite the fact that his character is based on someone who has primarily in his life taken a back seat. With the support of the impressive Tony Shalhoub as his fast-talking lawyer and Frances McDormand as his wife and even a minor part for a younger Scarlet Johansen.</fullReview>

While I appreciate this type of film, I should point out that some Coen Brother films take turns that are just too weird or fall flat--the prime example being Barton Fink. I should also say that MANY viewers simply won't like or appreciate the strange twists, so I would think reviews for any of these movies would be extreme (either you hate the films or you love 'em).Billy Bob Thornton plays the lead like he is a bit of a zombie, but I assume that is how he was supposed to play it. He's a barber married to a wife who is cheating on him with her boss. Billy Bob hears about a scheme to make money but needs startup money, so he decides to blackmail his wife's lover by sending an anonymous threatening note--pay $10,000 or we'll expose your affair. All this happens in the just the first 1/4 of the film. Where the plot goes next and the MANY odd little diversions I'll leave for you the viewer to find out BUT I will say that there are many plot twists, quirky performances and a subplot involving aliens--all placed in a black and white photographed world that looks like it's from an old Film Noir flick. Perhaps, at times, there are a few too many twists and the movie could have easily eliminated a few of these subplots, but this is a minor quibble.A final note: If you watch the Coen Brothers' film INTOLERABLE CRUELTY, you'll see Billy Bob do a character who is almost 180 degrees opposite the one he plays here. I really think this was a great inside joke and is worth a look!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beguiling but artificial</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joel Coen's films are all comedies, but they tend to divide into two groups; riotous farces ('Raising Arizona', 'The Big Lebowski'), for which I don't particularly care, and stylised, deadpan movies such as 'Fargo' or this film, which I personally prefer. This latter class of films are in fact so deadpan you might not even realise they are comic, although viewed straight, they might appear to be a little heartless. 'The Man Who Wasn't There' tells the story of a hapless, unemotional barber who lives in a small town in 1950s America: he hits upon a scheme to make money, but everything goes wrong. The initial premise of the scheme is this: he discovers his wife is having an affair, so he elects to anonymously blackmail his cuckolder under threat of exposure. This idea is typical of the film as a whole: preposterously dispassionate, but presented without any hint of explicit smirk. Them movie is shot elegantly in black and white, echoing the films made at the time of its setting, and Billy Bob Thornton is great as its almost silent "hero"; it's a strangely beguiling story, in spite of taking place in a wholly constructed universe that is an deliberate mixture of clich and utter originality. Some similarities to the work of Jim Jarmusch can perhaps be detected here, although in my mind, there's a little less soul, and a little more show-off cleverness, in Coen's work (even if the latter is completely absent from the superficial tone). Ultimately, this movie doesn't really have much to say about the human condition; but it's wonderfully assembled and executed nonetheless. In conclusion, it's a distinctive oddity, albeit one that is very much aware that this is what it is; and one of Coen's better movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We're being asked to think about Hitchcock, who used this quintessential small town for "Shadow of a Doubt." But what makes Hitch's movies disturbing is their insistence on the reality of absolute evil -- you can never dismiss anything in them as a fantasy or a breakdown in reality, like the burning hotel in "Barton Fink" or the last-minute rescue of Norville Barnes from certain death in "Hudsucker Proxy." The Coen Brothers' movies, while hugely enjoyable, are a little too jokey. This is a dark story, but its tone is too mixed to find a place in one's nightmares; the UFO story is ludicrous, the reference to Heisenberg totally unnecessary. After a while, you just count the references to other films. (Tolliver at the bottom of the lake, his hairpiece drifting in the current, reminded me of Shelley Winters in "Night of the Hunter.") But Thornton is perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of the Coen-brothers. It's best to state that right away so there is no doubt about where i'm coming from.Edward Crane (Billy-Bob Thornton) is a barber in a small town in California in the late 1940's. His wife is working at a department store and sleeps with her boss. Suddenly an offer falls into Cranes lap. If he can just get a hold of 10.000 dollars this is the opportunity of his life. But how? Many people would say that the greatest work of the Coen brothers now lie a while back into the past. I would have to agree with that although i have seen nothing wrong with their later movies. The thing that i can say though is that they have perhaps become more and more about a polished surface than a rich inside so to speak. And this movie sure does not lack in visuals. Filmed in glorious black and white, every crease in Billy-Bob Thorntons face is showing like canyons in a landscape. The murder story is noir standard-fare you might say. And of course that is somewhat of a problem. You are not very likely to be surprised when knowing the genre lets you see where this is going early on. Still it's a fine display of film-making. And even if it won't have you holding your breath to the end it is still a rewarding experience. If the Coen brothers would have made it less a show of stylish film-making, and more of a gut experience, this could have been something truly great. Now it's just very good. I rate it 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Generally I felt this was a really good movie, but for me it lacked a bit of drama and pizazz. It was remarkable to see Billy-Bob do so much with so little. I've never been so captivated with someone who doesn't say a word. His timing and expression was excellent, and his use of the cigarette seemed to me to add another dimension to the character, and it made for some great close-up visuals. I felt a bit bored sometimes, and wished that the camera work could have been made less ordinary for the non-close-up scenes. All of the actors did a terrific job, but some of the dialog was lacking in interest or pace. Anyway, I felt it was a worthwhile experience, but less film-noir than I had expected. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie that seemed to split the Coen Brothers fans into two camps. I seem to be in the minority of viewers who actually liked it. Poetic and beautifully shot each scene is a small part of the unraveling of Ed Cranes' life. The downbeat tone at the beginning of the movie is a purposeful move to paint a picture of a life unfulfilled which leads to Eds attempt to break out. The whole movie hinges on this decision and the slow unraveling of his plans leading to the destruction of everyone around him. Its a theme the Coen Brothers come back to in many of their movies and it is brilliantly executed here. Each plot thread is part of the whole and each part fits together to create a extraordinary meditation on life and the pursuit of happiness. It doesn't have a happy ending but not all stories do.</fullReview>

He is quietly understated and makes the role his - such that I could not imagine anyone else as Crane. The supporting case is just as wonderful, though special mention should go to Tony Shalhoub as the suitably unpleasant attorney.The best films are those in which the tale is unimportant; just sit back and enjoy the how it is told. 'The Man Who Wasn't There' is one of this endangered species. Wonderful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unique modern day old classic movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's in black &amp; white, directed by weird Joel Coen and starring controversial Billy Bob Thornton. Does it sound boring or even bad? Guess again..Movie was full of classic cinematic magic. Makers really have studied old movies and mixed up modern day storytelling to make the movie look and feel excellent. All the pictures were fixed at their best and the result was just pure genius, just the right thing to show slow and little depressed mood of the film. All the actors were giving a great performance and they fit to their characters extremely well. Billy Bob Thornton as a chain smoking little talking dull barber was giving a performance of his life. Excellent work!`The Man who wasn't there' is really a different kind of film comparing what Hollywood nova days do. It is a successful mix of classic old film and the modern day talent of filmmaking. Calm but strong storytelling in slow pace is not boring at all instead the movie was really hooking and just wanted you to know what will happen next. I'm sure it's a keeper in a film history in its own way. 7.5(7)/10</fullReview>

The one flaw of the movie is that it does move at a 'deliberate' pace. But I would rather spend the two hours watching this film than 90 minutes watching an equally good film that is not as original. The Coens' strengths are their great plots, unique dialog, and original style.

Billy Bob Thornton might not be everyone's favourite actor and cup of tea but he stills knows how to throw in a great performance here and there without any criticism whatsoever and this is his masterpiece. The Coen Brothers do take you in there world in there movies but the world they take you into in The Man Who Wasn't There is more hypnotic and beautiful than you can ever imagine. A fine supporting cast from Frances McDormand and James Gandolfillinii turn this into not just a dark film about a man lost in his own mind but it is very enjoyable to watch also in the way of it's story. I can listen to Billy Bob's voice all day long as his own voice can just send you to sleep and not in a bad way.A brilliant hypnotic film about a man on the doge and being pushed through his own insanity. Also watch out for a young Scarlet Johansson.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When freddy reudenschneider asks this question, the cat is out of the bag--'the man who wasnt there' is being held up to us movie-goers as the quintessential example (via Coen Brothers) of what the post-world war II life would be like---a bungalow in the suburbs, a dull job, a listless and loveless marriage, a cheating spouse...and here we are, not just in santa rosa, CA, but all over the western hemisphere, replicating this experience.This movie is being sold short by viewers as simply an artistic acheivement when it ought to be explored, thoroughly in fact, for the authentic presentation of the American adult experience that it portrays. I agree with many of the other reviewers that it is well-made and contains intersting performances, but viewing in its historical context is where this movie succeeds. Living in an age where 'box office success' is most often used as an indicator of what makes a film 'great' or 'memorable' allows only a few chances in a year to see stuff that really matters. "The Man...' is one of those movies, not seen by anywhere near enough people...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I got this because I like Billy Bob Thornton and the writers behind Fargo, a winning combination no doubt. I watched this while I was also reading a mainstream novel of Phillip K. Dick's (not at the same time of course) which was set in the same time period, so I was in a kind of 50's groove, perhaps explaining why I finally decided to rent it. I though the casting was quite good, and the use of black and white wasn't a lame attempt to lend some kind of artistic integrity to the film. The story was quite good in a realistic way, I wish at least one of the characters had a good outcome but that's more a reflection on me than the The Man Who Wasn't There. There's none of the typical elements of your typical blockbuster films in here but the account of Ed Crane played by Billy Bob Thornton is enough to keep the interest levels up, and there are some laughs along the way.Recommended for anyone who likes Billy Bob Thornton or the Coen brothers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Style and Substance in Equilibrium</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the kind of movie many people today call "slow". Other guys, like me for example, come out of the cinema thinking "not all is lost, thank heavens", walking right into the next lamppost. The Coen Brothers and their team got style. But style never rules over substance in this one.They really succeded in emulating the high quality fotography of the forties and early fifties that characterizes the classical Film Noir. (Just look at the scene in the supermarket with the pianos!) But that's not all. There is always - beyond the references, the props or even the general plot - a message or a philosophical comment lurking in the background without revealing itself openly. It leaves lasting imprints in the memory.I share the Coen's apparent fondness for phonies. Basically Ed Crane is a lone, innocent, naive human surrounded by them - and no flying saucer will carry him away. "Coen stock actors" like McDormand, Polito and Shalhoub are as effective as well casted Gandolfini and Scarlett Johansson (looking like Teresa Wright in Hitchcock's Shadow of Doubt). Richard Jenkins as the morose small town lawyer has some great moments, too.The monologs and dialogs are splendid. The mention of famous "Schroedinger's Cat" is well placed and nicely embedded in one of expensive defense-lawyer Riedenschneider's ramblings. The most striking exchange was for me the one between Ed Crane and the piano teacher/talent scout. Crane just does not understand why his protge will most probably not become a world famous pianiste, why the might of sheer willpower is put in question by a small fat foreigner. I don't know the right term for this kind of conversation in which arguments just don't get through, I just know: That's life. All over the world.</fullReview>

For those, like me, who thinks that USA Cinema reachs 80 % of it's peak in the 1940's,they surely love this film. It's kind of tribute of the Film-Noir genre. The use of shadows makes me think about the Edward Dymytryk movies of 1945-1950. Billy Bob Thornton looks like a bored Humphrey Bogart and the settings of the late 1940's is simply fabulous. It's a cool film, like a J.J. Cale record at 3 AM, with a good cigarette and a glass of whiskey. It's also very slow and that's a great quality. Films are, in fact, pictures and are made to watch, not to be heard. This one is simply beautiful to see. There's also a strange sense of humour about hair !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film got under my skin. Now have to confess, I've liked everything the Coen Bros. have done -- everything.But this film stands head and shoulders above 90% of recent movies based oncinematography and musical score alone.Add to these the strengths of an amazing series of performances from every single cast member.The plot is simple: a nearly-invisible man attempts to step outside of the box in which he functions effectively -- and the wheels of grim fate are set in motion.This is one of three films starring Billy Bob Thornton in 2001. Each is very different, and in this movie, Billy Bob Thornton gives an amazingly restrained performance where we almost will our own feelings into the character. This is a man who has moved through his life with an expression that suggests he knows what's going on or is one step ahead. But behind that expression is a deer in the headlights.There are other actors, of course-- some Coen Bros. regulars and not a 'throwaway' part in the bunch. Especially wonderful moments are provided for all the actors and each rises to the occasion -- I particularly liked Ed's lawyer/genealogist/widower friend (Richard Jenkins) who in just a few scenes makes an indelible impression as a lost soul. Reliable James Gandalfini is utterly believable as a bluffer at the end of his game. And Tony Shalhoub was robbed of the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his brilliant turn as a brilliant lawyer.But as I said up front, it's the cinematography and the score that caused me to refer to the greatest movie ever made in the headline. Roger Deakins and constant Coen collaborator Carter Burwell have reached the level of Toland and Hermann in their crafts. See This Film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an entrancing film to watch, like a masterful ballet of light and word. This film should be watched if only to bask in the film work.I notice many people comment on the artful use of B&amp;W. I think it's interesting that they shot in color and then more or less relegated the film to a tech shop for B&amp;W post-processing. I'm not accusing the emperor of having no clothes; I'm just saying it's fascinating that a film shop was able to render such a visually fine final product.I think of "Big" Dave's line: "I'm not proud of what I did. But you...". That's *the* line in the movie, and harkens back to Fargo; a line Jerry Lundegaard could have easily said to his father-in-law--if not for his standard-issue Minnesotan reticence.Ed and Doris Crane are at one and the same time clear messages and ciphers. What do they want? Why did they really get together? That Ed appears to be both repressed *and* free--a contradiction in terms, to be sure--is a stunning achievement.This movie is a black hole, sucking in every bit of light you may have shed on it in hopes of getting insight bounced back. Is it a fair portrayal of life without God, set in the post-War era? Or is it really just about sex? Should we apply Augustine, Freud, or Jung to the task of making sense of the Cranes, and the cast of characters knocked about in the moral event storm whirling about their heads?I think the Coens are always trying to find ways to make us confront the second-hand algorithms we use to process moral questions. These methods may work 98% of the time, but life throws you the occasional curve ball, and I think movies like "The Man..." inoculate us against these eventualities by giving us cinematic representations of that remaining 2%.Oh. And did I mention the saucer people?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has a great noir taste that really sucks you in, thanks to a blistering performance by Billy Bob, with fine performances by the up and coming Scarlett Johansson, and Tony Shalhoub as Freddy "I don't capitulate, I litigate" Riedenschneider.However, this will not go down with the best of the Coen flicks, as the screenplay has problems, especially the final scenes are just a total screw up, some weird UFO crap and a stupid ending. The Coen's often seem at a loss on how to end a film, the end of Raising Arizona is stupid, as was this film, yet in Fargo, they seemed to get everything right, even the ending, perhaps that is why it is their highest rated film.So, if you like a character study that is memorable, although not in the league with William Macy's performance in Fargo, and if you liked the cinematography of "Brother, where art thou", then you will enjoy this, but don't expect the complete package like Fargo or Arizona or even Brother. Just rent it for the fine effort from Billy Bob a la "Slingblade" and for the cool noir feel, and try not to get too disgusted with the final scenes after the car rolls. A shame, since a slight rewrite of the end portions of the screenplay and this could have been a top film.Still a worthy rental for a Saturday night curled up with the big screen and a dark ale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Coens have done it again, grabbing a kind of storyline they have a passion for: the everyday man who gets involved in a course of action that leads to devastating consequences. Here, a magnificent Billy Bob Thornton is the everyday man, a man who doesn't talk much, thinks a lot, but never stopped to think in the evolution of things. And, like "Fargo", the snowball effect takes his world by storm. Will he be able to get a grip on himself? The Coens have an unique capability of achieving something that looks paradoxal - every film they make stands out from the others, making their films so different between them. And "The Man Who Wasn't There" is probably the crowning jewel of their chameleon-like cinema: i'm not even talking about the magnificent black and white cinematography, i'm talking about the way the hero is portrayed, the way things happen and the way they are solved, all this greeted by a way of filming and editing that pays hommage to film noir, but ends up being much more than that. The ending feels like it's dragging a lot, but the quality of the filmmaking siblings turn this into another fulcrum in their work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I review this movie years after it came out. That is because it is one of these that have to be seen a lot of times before you can be able to really judge it.In my opinion, you must not view it, or try to comprehend every twist in the plot. This film is about the ambiance it irradiates. You must sense it, rather than try to figure out everything.Most of the people who did not like it seem to think that it was too slow-paced. To me, this is sad, for it shows that they have missed the actual point. This is not about a barber, a homicide, a wife that cheated on her husband. It is about a society that has lost touch with what is really relevant in life.That is why Thornton gives such a brilliant performance; he depicts a man who has nothing to lose anymore, and who would do about anything to change his miserable every day life. The recurring image of the flying saucer is the representation of this evasion of his, the way he found to escape the world in which he is trapped.A true masterpiece, and one of the Coen brothers best. Keep it up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People who are uncomfortable in an art museum probably won't take to this movie. It doesn't offer the quirky characters of previous Coen legends and it's not set in our lifetime with familiar sets and props such as car dealerships and bowling alleys. Instead, The Man Who Wasn't There draws mesmerizing sketches of archetypes from a past era--sketches we only know from black and white photographs and black and white films. This movie plays on our familiar conception of the past as black and white. The characters are whittled down to a few motivational impulses, perfectly suited to the contrived old-Hollywood plot. Everything about this film is exquisitely crafted, from the chiarascuro of each frame to the precise dialogue to the brilliantly engineered plot.I'm guessing that those who have the gift of appreciation for paintings and photographs will love this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the plot wasn't anything to get excited about. BBT was great as the barber who doesn't like to talk much; he justs sits back and observes and knows his wife is cheating on him. So, he blackmales the guy she's cheating with(which is her boss)to get money to start a dry cleaning business. It sounds really interesting doesn't it? The problem is the movie just develops too slowly. Once BBT kills the guy, it starts to drag in the middle. I was expecting the movie to be over 15 minutes earlier than it was. It should have been edited better. But, the black and white look was excellent, which is probably what got it noticed more than anything else.FINAL VERDICT: Not one of the Coens' best. If you are a fan of BBT, I recommend seeing this. But, otherwise, it isn't really a comedy, so the average viewer may become bored half-way through. If nothing else is on, you may want to watch this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good premise spoiled by over-long, meandering plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a premise that is both simple and interesting, but spoiled by an overlong plot, "The Man Who Wasn't There" fails to deliver the kind of depth and pathos it requires to make an impact on its audience.Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thornton) is a quiet, unambitious barber living in a passionless marriage to his wife Doris (Frances MacDormand). Wherever he goes he is a largely inconspicuous prescence barely noticed by anyone. He ambles on regardless, not appearing to care. He then suspects his wife of having an affair with the chubby, cheerful businessman next door Big Dave (James Gandolfini) and decides to make a change to his dreary existence by making a deal with a shady businessman (Jon Polito) to blackmail Big Dave for money to start a dry-cleaning business...The plot is well-written and possesses alot of strong elements. But unfortunately the pace drags considerably during the film's second half. The result is that alot of scenes feel largely extraneous, neither contributing very much to the plot or deepening the characters. The black-and-white look of the film, whilst never entirely pleasing, does contribute to the sense of inertia felt by the characters, especially Ed.With a reputation for taking on unique challenges as an actor, Thornton gives a strong but flawed performance as Ed. He is good at conveying the boredom of the man and his aimless existence but it is a largely humourless performance in a character that is never really given any depth. We are never told why Ed has such an apathetic attidude towards life. Thornton dominates the film to such an extent that many of the supporting players (comprised of some popular actors such as James Gandolfini and Tony Shalhoub) are rendered largely forgettable.A brave effort by all concerned to do something a little bit different, yet the film tries too hard to be "deep" and "heavy" and the lack of levity and humour make it's potentially rich premise very unpalatable.Disappointing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first when I borrowed this film from my friend I didn't have about what would happen. I had seen some other cohen-brother films but they were all so different from each other that I couldn't even guess what I was about to see. I was stunned by the beatiful pictures shown and of the eccentricity of the protagonist. Ed Crane is a normal barber with no great ambitions. He just goes along with the current in a world where is no individuals. Everyone does what they're expected to do. Barber cuts the hair and so forth... When, after Ed does something horribly terrible, he sort of frees himself from the mass.The Man Who Wasn't There is sort of a growing story of Ed Crane the Barber of a small town who's just a piece of a larger puzzle. Ed growth is initiaded by the accident happened at the shopping mall. He becomes an individual and frees himself from the stereotypic society with fatal consequences. He understands the insignificance of his life and knows that he's somewhat free'er than his co-citizens... 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Movie That Isn't There</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been a long time since I loved a Coen brothers movie. Gone are the days of Raising Arizona and Blood Simple. Somewhere along the way something warm seeped away from the films. Everything since Fargo, and including Fargo for my money, has more seemed an advert for how clever the filmakers are this time, instead of how compelling the motives and drives of the human beings within the film.This latest film, The Man Who Wasn't There, for me walks into the same shallow water as Lebowski, Brother, and Fargo, the water of slick style over substance and meaning, of self-congratulatory cleverness. No doubt about it, the Coens are doing their homework, because intellectually it all hangs together rather nicely, enough to please most critics at least.I loved the black and white camera work in this, and I can't say anything against the writing. It was tight. The acting was seamless, although I find Frances McDormand always seems the same in a Coen film: no surprises.For me it was a soul-less exercise in smarts, lacking blood. When I remember Miller's Crossing I recall emotions, mine engaged with the characters'. When I think of Barton Fink I remember the feelings I had identifying with the characters. Blood Simple gave the hairs on the back of my neck a tickle. Raising Arizona tickled me all over from the belly out.What I got from The Man Who Wasn't There was a big so what? Who cares? A nice looking bit of wooden characterization moving in a fog through a polished gem of a story that says nothing about love, fear, hope, or much of anything, except film itself.Their movies used to be about more than just movies. Nowadays they're just chokin' the story-making chicken.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is basically an old-fashioned tale told with extreme panache.A hint of blackmail, intrigue, betrayal, murder, et al form the basis of the plot, and as such really reminds you of how the 'olden-days' made movies. Of course the other blatant homage to old style is the colour tone, which is black and white. It works tremendously.As do the cast. Billy Bob Thornton, in the first role I've really seen him in, excels as Ed Crane, a Barber whose life truly encapsulates the 'Man Who Wasn't There' persona. He's excellent as portraying someone who seems to exist more than live.Well shot, well acted, well plotted, and generally very well paced this is a fine movie, and worthy of praise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The black and white caught my eye and I thought for a while that I was watching an introduction to a film. I wasn't disappoined as some might be but then I thought it might have been carefully designed and important. I listened with some initial interest to the narrator until I realized the language was truly mundane if not banal. Billy Bob is someone I have come to pay attention to as an actor until this film. Now, I'm afraid I'll be inclined to shut a film down early because I have realized he can be had. It's always a shame to learn that a good actor has been prevailed upon to purvey something inferior. The Coens have had success but this feeble attempt has knocked them down in my view. The film dallied on the way to nowhere and it was with a sense of satisfaction that I realized when it was over that it was likely never intended to go anywhere; a genuine failure. Billy Bob! If you are there Smoking is harmful to your audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Did the Coens peak with Fargo? Judging by this, absolutely not. Returning to the bleak, surreal comedy-drama that distinguished earlier works such as Barton Fink and Blood Simple, the Brothers Weird have knocked out a beautifully-shot, deeply resonant modern noir. Billy Bob Thornton turns in a quietly magnetic central performance as Ed Crane, the man who just "cuts the hair", a barber in forties small-town California with a motormouth wife and a face that would make Clint Eastwod say "Damn, he's craggy". When a dry-cleaning pimping travelling salesman drops by, a series of events begin to unfold that push Ed into a life-altering decision. Detailing the various plot twists and character turns is a meaningless excercise, as without the beautiful cinematography and the subtle nuances of the supporting cast the story means little. See this film, and marvel at it's fantastically-warped take on life, love and dry-cleaning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS ALL OVER ITEd Crane is a laconic barber who discovers that his wife is cheating on him and, indifferent to the fact, decides to take advantage from it by blackmailing her lover to get money to invest on dry cleaning. His plan goes wrong when the blackmailed man asks him for help and then, discovering that he planned it (or maybe not, it's not at all revealed)attacks him as he screams: "What kind of a man are you?". Crane kills him with a knife.This killing scene is absolutely wonderful. Crane is driving his drunken wife to bed and he begins to remember the day he knew her. Suddenly the phone rings. It's Great Dave, the blackmailed guy, asking him to go to his office (he's already paid). Crane goes there and finds a devastated man. Great Dave punches him and begins to strangle him. Crane kills him and walks out slowly of the building. He goes back home, sits in the same position where he was when the phone rang, and continues the trail of memories with the same sentence he was using before.The movie's full with those little, subtle and clever details that really make a Coen film. Let me say something about the Coens: they never do what you expect. Their movies are either excellent or very good (with the possible exception of "The hudsucker proxy"). But they NEVER do what you expect from them. Not only in the storylines, absolutely fresh, original and twisted as hell (during the course of "The man who wasn't there" not once did I guess what was about to happen), but also on their philmography. After filming a version of the Odyssey set in the 1930's in America and reminiscent of the Preston Sturges comedies ("Oh Brother, where art thou?") and a hillarious modern interpretation of "The big sleep" that replaces Phillip Marlowe by The Dude, a former hippie who lives trying to make the less amount of effort possible ("The big Lebowski") they come up with this. Genius stuff.Besides this the movie has other atractives. The acting is absolutely wonderful, almost unbelieveable. We'd already seen how great Frances McDormand was in other Coen movies. Plus we got Billy Bob Thornton (who BECOMES Ed Crane), Jon Polito and Michael Badalucco. And a special mention for Tony Shualhob (or however it's spelled), the star of the great TV series "Monk": this is one hell of an actor, believe me. And the black and white photography is superb. I know there's a color version of this movie shown in the theathers in Europe, and I simply can't imagine it. This movie should be seen in black and white.I don't recommend this movie to everyone, though. Joel and Ethan Coen're not everybody's cup of tea. Someone might complain about the very (deliberately) vague script, the very personal sense of humor or might get bored by the slow, contemplative way in wich they shoot. But if you wanna get your chances, go for this picture.SAY NO MORE</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The b+w may not be perfect, but this film has the Q word all over it. Thornton is quite magnificent, as are just about all the other actors. The atmosphere is spot on, and the plot convincing enough to make you both sad and - perversely - happy (for Crane, for his relief) at the end.If you've seen the Coens' 'Fargo' (or, for that matter, Falling Down) you'll instantly recognise the theme of a man's world falling apart despite his best intentions to manipulate it into doing what he wants it to do. For Crane it's all about escaping - a mind crushing job, a marriage of misery, a town full of people content to comply and ignore anyone who refuses to do the same - familiar enough feelings for most of us. Whether he can escape or not depends, however, not only on his strength of character but on circumstances that never fail to lead him to disappointment. But from the start, everything is against him, and he helps it all along by submitting to some flag-wavingly dodgy schemes (Polito, as another superbly grotesque Coen character) and a major moment of albeit desperate action that could possibly seal his fate.The atmosphere and a couple of sequences imbue a strong element of sci-fi, (nothing is ever straightforward for the Coens) including a scene that appears to pay homage to Close Encounters. This is not as incongruous as it sounds, as Crane has basically been plunged into the Twilight Zone, one in which he has become a living ghost. Being invisible has its advantages of course, but the lagubrious Crane routinely fails to take them. The final scene sees justice finally dealt, and Crane's hope for something better undiminished.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie. I love this time period in American history when people dressed in nice suits, wore hats and had good manners. It was also a time when the appearance of impropriety was something a person would avoid at all costs. A person's public reputation was quite important. Against this backdrop, the Coen brothers have concocted a story of blackmail and internecine deceit that eventually envelops all the principals. I love the story and the "quiet desperation" of Ed Crane's character is something many people try to keep hidden while going about the tasks in their mundane lives. While Ed doesn't say much in the barbershop, his mind is attuned to his circumstances and he knows that he's not quite satisfied with his identity; that there should be something more out there for him. The story really works for me and I found this much more satisfying than Fargo, which had an obvious (and unsympathetic) villain, and overly prolific use of those Minnesota accents. Thornton is terrific in this movie. He has the patience and calm to play this quietly intelligent man, and I don't think many other actors could handle it properly. I'm not crazy about the very end of the movie, but I believe the Coens added that to say that crimes are pinned on people simply to "solve" them, which makes the public feel safer and that was certainly a major priority in that era (as it is today). I highly recommend this film. It rates in my top five (of any genre) from the last 2 years. This is a great movie. I give it a 9.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems to me that Coen brothers are always capable of excellent work on individual bits and pieces of a movie but ,except for "Fargo", they have never quite succeed in tying it all together into a superb piece of work. "Man who wasn't there" is another example of this. For all the homage it pays to the films of 40's and early 50's it does not quite stack up and it loses its focus and grip towards the end. However, it is is safe to say that, despite this criticism, the film has probably one of the best acting performances ever captioned on a movie screen. Billy Bob Thornton earned my immense respect with this performance, and this is coming from somebody who has not held his abilities in high esteem to begin with. His work here is worth an Oscar nomination for the best actor of a decade, not just year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Coen brothers are a national treasure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somehow, even now in the benighted 21st Century, Joel and Ethan Coen still continue to schnooker American studio bigwigs into paying them good money to make interesting, unique films. All I can say to them is, "Thank you"."The Man who Wasn't There" takes its sweet time to build up tension, and never quite reaches a conventional climax. The plot meanders through various left turns, random scenes that don't fit into the narrative, and scenes that seem to take place merely to allow the Coens and cinematographer Roger Deakins to play around with light and smoke and enjoy how cool it all looks on B&amp;W film. No matter. The whole thing is a load of fun. Unlike the overly slapsticky "O Brother", this movie is played completely deadpan, which requires the viewer to pay close attention in order to catch the underlying comedy, but the payoff is worth the effort.The pacing is, as many here have noted, quite slow and deliberate, but the Coens have a wonderful sense of the absurd that keeps the movie from falling into boredom or melancholy. While the conservative, conformist dullness of post-war America would seem to be an overly easy target for satire, the Coens manage to avoid most of the easy choices. The true villain here isn't greed, or heavy-handed government, or social conservatism, or any of the usual targets of film noir... although all of these evils make an appearance. Rather, the villains of this movie are the lives of quiet desperation that ordinary people lead after they sell out their dreams in exchange for security. Ed Crane's life falls apart after his schemes backfire... but he is somehow curiously redeemed as a human being. Billy Bob Thornton is simply perfect in the lead role, displaying an amazing range of emotions without ever cracking a smile or raising his voice. Tony Shalhoub chews up scenery as a celebrity defense lawyer. Frances McDormand is stellar as always... I suspect Joel Coen would cast her in his movies even if she wasn't married to him. It's simply a top-notch film... and even in the places where it takes a wrong turn, it still manages to be worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a great sendup of '40s noir, of course, but it's also a pretty good movie even if you've never seen anything made earlier than, say, 1964.Billy Bob Thornton demonstrates again that less is more; the man seems nearly comatose during most of his screen time, but that face of his, and the ever-present cigarette, are almost comically hypnotic. That's the center of the film; then Coens add just enough oddball scenes and throwaway lines around the edges to make the whole thing memorable. Nicely done!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off I would like to tell you this movie did not grab me in the beginning. I felt it was long and drawn out! The ending didn't make sense to me cause frankly they dont prosecute without substantial evidence.. I mean come on, I know this takes place in the early 50's and 60's but still. I won't give away too much of the movie for you readers. Just keep in mind that this movie will not grab u at the start. So be patient and end the end im sure u will like it.."Heavens to Betsy"-neos</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like the superb Gosford Park, this movie is not for those who watch Bruckheimer movies as part of their staple diet. 'The Man Who Wasn't There' is not the fastest moving of films, but what it does provide you with are brilliant acting, including an especially wonderful performance by Ed Crane (Thornton) who fits the film noir part down to a T. The characters are all expertly cast, many of whom appeared in the Coen brothers earlier films. It's almost like watching the school play. You already know roughly who's in it, but it's always exciting to see what they decide to choose that year. Francis McDormand is, as always, a great supporting actress, and plays the 'distant wife' part very believably. I won't ruin the movie in any way, but all I can say is sit back and enjoy. Make sure to watch it in one sitting, and laugh at yourself at the end of it. The human condition is rather amusing, after all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A MAN WHO WASN'T THERESTARRING: BILLY BOB THORNTON, FRANCES McDORMAND, JAMES GOLDFINI, AND TONY SHALHOUB"The Man Who Wasn't There" is about a quiet barber, named Ed Crane, his wife is having an affair with her boss. Ed blackmails her boss, Big Dave, for 10,000 to pay a man that could give him a new career. After he threatens to blackmail him. Everything goes wrong for Ed, though. He then becomes a ghost to people in ways, or a man who wasn't there.Billy Bob Thornton deserved an Oscar nomination in my opinion, for this movie. He played this quiet, lonely man very well and convincing. Supporting acts like Frances Mcdormand and James Goldfini play their parts in the movie as well as Billy Bob. Oscar nominations should have been for screenplay and Actor for Billy Bob Thornton. The Oscar nomination this movie got was for Cinematography and I agree, it was very dark and perfectly for the movie.I recommend this film highly.I give this film **** stars out of *****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not everyone's cup of tea, but compelling for Coen and/or noir aficionados. I'm not as knowledgeable in these areas as many of the reviewers here, but I was fascinated by the movie. The suggestion by one reviewer that the protagonist is a closeted homosexual never occurred to me while I was watching, but upon reflection, it does make some sense.The main character leads a brittle, low-key life. He treads softly, because this seems to be the only way he can get by. And yet, he's a barber who wants to be more than a barber, and thus is led to investing in an ill-considered scheme. (BTW, I didn't think dry-cleaning was such a new thing in the '50's)Altho he is a blackmailer, there are redeeming traits in this guy. He really seems to love his wife, and does all he can to save her from the chair. SPOILER: Her suicide seems unmotivated, but may indicate that underneath, she loves him too, or at lest, feels remorse for hurting him.In addition, the guy really tries to help a young girl to achieve a career -- even tho she is not suited for it, and doesn't really want it. In short, he comes off as incompetent, but good-hearted.The movie is highly stylized. The acting, direction, and photography are first-class.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Coen Brothers' clever homage to classic film noir is probably their finest film to date.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CONTAINS SPOILERS!! While it may an overlong, gushing homage to the classic film noir and Hitchcockian detective mysteries the Coen Brothers grew up on, The Man Who Wasn't There has the same quirky sense of humor that made such past Coen brothers films, like Barton Fink and Fargo the acclaimed masterpieces they are today. Though it is slightly inconsistent and the well-constructed screenplay is thrown off towards the end (there are several points towards the third quarter where the movie could end and the plot would still be cohesive) it is still their finest film. The exquisite black and white photography of Roger Deakins is on a par with Vilmos Zsigmond's work in Altman's The Long Goodbye. The moving shots add a sense of poignancy to each movement and emotion. The sophisticated direction of Joel Coen adds a naturalistic sense to the shots. The Coen Brothers have always worn their influences on their sleeve, but never as much as they do here. The Man Who Wasn't There might be their most serious film, even though it's still a comedy, and it's a welcome change of pace.The film is set in 1940s suburbia and perfectly depicts the desolation and depressing lives of those within its confines. James Gandolfini delivers his finest film performance as Big Dave Brewster, a department store owner who employs hard-drinking Doris Crane (Frances McDormand.) Doris's husband, Ed (Billy Bob Thorton) is a seemingly mundane Barber, who suspects her to be having an affair with Brewster. In the opening scenes we are introduced to his world, as boring as it may be. The Coens fill the scenes with strange characters and images as Thorton describes endless details of the various popular hairstyles of the era. This helps up get inside the mind of Ed. He senses the events going on around him, but the rest of the world sees him as a dolt. "The barber," as he puts it.One day Ed is cutting hair and overhears a drifter (the hilarious Jon Polito) named Tolliver talking about an incredible new enterprise called dry cleaning. A way of cleaning clothing and linen with chemicals without the problem of shrinking clothes or leaking colors. He asks Ed if he would be interested in funding the stores. Ed takes it into consideration and decides to blackmail Brewster for $10,000 (the amount Tolliver needs to get the store started.) Brewster's store is owned by his wife's family, so if word got out that he was cheating on his wife, he'd lose everything, so he pays up. Ed has Dave drop the money in the garbage can of the hotel where he plans to meet Tolliver. He gets the $10,000, gives it to Tolliver and goes off on his way.At the same time Ed meets Birdy (Scarlett Johansson.) The daughter of his friend Walter (Richard Jenkins) and becomes fascinated by her nack of playing music. Their relationship is another interesting sub-plot of the film. Ed believes she has a gift and begins seeing her and watching her play piano as the saga with Doris and Dave unfolds. One night Dave calls him over to the store to tell him that he knows it was Ed. After an altercation, Ed stabs and kills Dave in self-defense and makes off clean, but Doris is charged with the murder. Attorney Freddy Riedenschneider (Tony Shaloub) is brought in to defend her. The day after Ed privately admits to them that he killed Dave, Doris kills herself. Subsequently Ed is informed that she was pregnant with Dave's baby at the time. He never seeds Tolliver or his blackmail money again.Fed up with the bad choices he's made Ed decides to take Birdy for piano lessons that he would pay for. Upon meeting the instructor (Adam Alexi Malle) he learns that Birdy has no talent. On their way back Birdy wants to make it up to him and attempts to perform a sexual favor for him in the car. Through the confusion he crashes the car. This is the point where the film gets a little cryptic. Ed flashbacks to his "happy" life with Doris before she died, sitting around silently in their suburban palace thinking of something to say to each other. When he comes to he is charged with the murder of Tolliver (who was actually killed by Big Dave Brewster after the money pick-up.) His story is too complicated to believe so he is charged with Tolliver's murder and sentenced to death.While the end is a little cryptic, and the "magazine interview" angle makes for an abrupt ending (be it a drawn out one,) The Man Who Wasn't There is the best film of the year. It's dark, funny and morose. All the things that make the Coen Brothers films great. It is also intelligent, witty and emotionally charged, which is what makes it a great film. While the Coen brothers have made a few clunkers (the Hudsucker Proxy, O Brother Where Are thou) they have yet to make a film that isn't a laugh per minute or a shocked expression per minute. It's hard to say that this is a great film noir, because every nuance of the film is borrowed, but the characters are likeable and interesting. It isn't a film but a moving portrait of restrained emotions and hopeless lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Coens, with a hidden "agenda" (**SPOILERS**)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, so I'm a Coen fan. These guys can take a genre and reduce it to its purest form in a single finely-crafted movie. "The Man Who Wasn't There" definitely follows the pattern, with its sense of foreboding, plodding pace, painstaking filming and editing, and more Noir "hooks" than you can shake a lit cigarette at. It's absolutely beautiful to watch, and a loving homage to a genre that is referenced more often than it is experienced these days. And while I'm not a big Billy Bob fan, his performance in this role was impeccable and riveting.Yet for all the craftsmanship, its pace was slow and it seemed a little empty, like something was missing. The missing element is found in the answer to the movie's central question: "What kind of man are you?"*** SPOILER FOLLOWS ***So what kind of man is he? A gay man. Yes, I believe Billy Bob's character is a closeted homosexual. Think about it. He hasn't slept with his wife in years, and doesn't seem too bothered by her ongoing affair: his interest in it is primarily in how he can use it for blackmail. The salesman tries to make a move on him in his hotel room, and the situation is made all the more embarrassing by just how SURE the salesman was that he'd be into it. And of course most upstanding citizens would be distressed to have their friend's teenage daughter making sexual advances on them, but the way Billy Bob reacts to Birdy is different than you would expect out of most other men.He lives the very safe, straight barber life because given his orientation, and the straightjacket of the times, it is very important that he appear that way. And why stick his neck out and be adventurous, when society won't allow him to be what he really wants to be anyway? As far as society's expectations were concerned, he truly Wasn't There.One of the wonderful things about Noir is the way in which it provides a photo-negative mirror image of the times in which it was made. Paradoxically, its very darkness illuminates the unacknowledged anxieties and misfits overshadowed by happy, optimistic glow of the times. Yet despite Noir's insights into the postwar world's dark underbelly, some things were off-limits even to this genre. "The Man Who Wasn't There" hits on an issue that, while topical today, was too deep and dark even for Noir at the time. The Coen brothers have not only distilled this form down and perfected its essence, they have extended it. A great cinematic achievement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but not as good as others have said</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe I'm just impatient, but I found the first half of "The Man Who Wasn't There," pretty boring to sit through. Admittedly, sometimes there are things you don't notice until you've seen a film multiple times, so maybe I missed some of those the first time through, but it seemed like the first half could have been shortened considerably. The second half of the film makes up for the first. There are quite a few surprise plot twists and director Joel Coen builds a lot of tension and creates a sense of dread.Billy Bob Thornton is great as the main character. He says so much even when he seems to be doing nothing at all. The rest of the cast is also impressive, especially McDormand and Shalhoub. Also impressive is the cinematography. Roger Deakins does so much with black and white that one could easily mistake it for one of the older film noir pictures that obviously influenced the Coens.What I'm less than thrilled with is the script. In addition to the first half of the movie dragging, there are a couple other problems. I'm not sure what Scarlett Johansson's character was in the movie. Don't get me wrong, she did a good job, but I don't see the importance of the character. Again, perhaps I'm missing something. Also, a lot of the dialogue seems to be self-consciously trying to be "noir," that it becomes cliche and annoying. Lines like "Me, I just cut the hair," would be funny if the delivery wasn't so serious.Overall, "The Man Who Wasn't There," is an enjoyable half-a-movie. The first half drags, but the second half is very good film noir drama. It's well acted despite the flaws in the script. It's worth a look if you like this kind of thing.Rating: 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thoroughly entertaining and artful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Coen Brothers are one of the few 'complete' filmmaking teams in the film industry and this could not be more evident than in the film, "The Man Who Wasn't There". By 'complete' I am referring to the attention that is paid to every aspect of a film. Director Joel Coen frames every shot as if he has studied the paintings of Edward Hopper(an important that made art during the period of American history that this film is set in). The sharp contrast of light and shadow coupled with continous views through opened doorways and windows gives the film an almost three dimensional look. The use of the classical piano Beethoven piece is featured in the opening credits and is introduced throughout the film at key moments until it becomes part of the characters movement and thoughts. And who else but the Coen Brothers can make a character's tragic descent seems simultaneously comical and (with the closing lines uttered by Billy Bob Thornton) spiritually uplifting. And let's forget that Frances McDormand is the most versatile actress in film today. She is incredibly sexy, dangerous and vulnerable as Doris Crane, the wife of Billy Bob's character.I've never hated, lusted after and then felt deep compassion for a film character as I did for Mrs. Crane. Other great performances were given by such underrated actors as Tony Shaloub, Michael Badalucca and James Gandolfini.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never seen a Coen Brothers movie I didn't like. And they didn't disappoint me with this one. They've managed to recreate a 30's era Film Noir with an updated twist. The plot moves very slowly, but I was riveted throughout.I'm always prepared to dislike Billy Bob Thorton for some reason. But I like nearly everything he does. He's perfect for this movie, perfect look, perfect tone, perfect everything.The film is visually stunning but it never really leaves the bounds of the era it's set in in. There are certainly scenes that couldn't have been filmed in the 30's, but they blend in seamlessly with the rest of the film.It's quite a feat to take a character who can't even muster very much enthusiasm about saving his wife from jail or saving himself from the chair and make him sympathetic. But the Coen Bros pull it off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film noir in the classic tradition with a fresh perspective.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit: I am not a big fan of the Coen brothers. I thought Fargo was a meaningless gore-fest that left you in the middle of nowhere (pun intended). But for some odd reason I LOVED The Man Who Wasn't There! I suppose the only explanation for this is that the film noir genre is one of my favorites, and believe me: The Man Who Wasn't There lives up to every precedent that has been set by such films as Chinatown and The Maltese Falcon. Yet it still maintains that touch of class, that fresh look that keeps it up-to-date, despite the fact that it is set in the twenties/thirties. I understand why some people didn't like it, though: it certainly has a sort of run-on feel that may bother some (and intrigue others). But that's how many classic movies are! In my humble opinion, the sole purpose of The Man Who Wasn't There was to tell a good story and never break a sweat. And when you look at it from that perspective, I believe you, too, will find a new respect for it. First of all, Billy Bob Thornton is amazing (as always): he plays the part of the lonely, solemn barber to perfection, yet his acting is so subtle that it doesn't distract from the rest of the film. It is only in retrospect that you can go, "wow: he really was incredible!" Secondly, the music is beautiful: the piano solos and string harmonies are quite reminescent of Fargo (which was the single good aspect of that film) and they fit in perfectly with the overall morbid mood. And, of course, the cinematography is simply astounding: the black-and-white coloring was necessary to give it a true film noir feel, but the lack of color doesn't even subtract from the overall beauty of the movie. In fact, it adds to it! As you watch the events of the story unfold, you are completely immerged in the film, experiencing every emotion that the lead character undergoes. And the ending is especially tragic, leaving the viewer with something to think about and perhaps even a tear streaming down his cheek. All in all, The Man Who Wasn't There is a crowd-pleasing nostalgia that is not easily forgotten.Overall rating: 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film Noir is Alive and Well!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Man Who Wasn't There" represents the Coen Brothers entrance into the dark shadowy world of Film Noir. Shot in black and white by cinematographer Roger Deakins, this film takes us back to the classic film noir features of the 40s and 50s to the days before widescreen and living color. The story set in the late 40s, centers on "second chair" barber Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thornton) who works for his brother-in-law Frank (Michael Badalucco) and who's life has evolved into a loveless hum-drum existence. His wife Doris (Frances McDormand) is having an affair with her boss "Big Dave" Brewster (James Gandolfini) who is married to the heir of a chain of department stores (Katherine Borowitz). Along comes business entrepreneur Creighton Tolliver (Jon Polito) who offers Crane a chance to escape his drab lifestyle by investing in his dry cleaning venture. Naturally Ed doesn't have the $10,000 required and decides to blackmail his wife's lover. This is when the story develops more twists and turns than a pretzel factory. Thorton, who is rapidly becoming one of the Hollywood's best actors, is outstanding as Ed Crane. He plays him with an air of mystery, a sort of a time bomb waiting to explode. McDormand is excellent as the unfaithful wife, Polito suitably oily as Tolliver and Gandolfini in an all too brief role, shines as the brutish "Big Dave". The scene where Ann Nirdlinger tells Crane about a close encounter with aliens is a bit baffling and unnecessary to my mind. Tony Shaloub does a nice turn as lawyer Freddy Riedenschneider (Try saying that three times in succession). The big star of the piece though is the amazing black and white cinematography of Deakins. One is fortunate these days to see ANY film shot in black and white, much less a masterpiece such as this. The contrasts, the lighting and the shadows are all there and shows that film noir is alive and well and living in the 21st century.</fullReview>

But it didn't go there, leaving plenty of time for a few more plot twists and one final big one at the end.And the cinematography, the contrast in light and shadows, just cannot be duplicated if it was filmed in color.Surprisingly the Coen Brothers would be making something like this, but not surprising, they've end up in making a really good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Man Who Wasn't There" is a beautiful film all-around. Visually, it's spectacular. You actually start to feel like you're watching a film from the 1940's and not a modern film in black and white. The lighting is beautiful and creative, just like the films of the past. And you can't ask for a much better cast. Billy Bob Thornton delivers one of his best performances up-to-date, and that's considering he says barely a word as his character Ed Crane, excluding the narration. His facial expressions alone tell a story, even the way he puffs on his cigarette. James Gandolfini has a smaller role, but he's also terrific. It's nice to see him play a character who's not a gangster or a hitman. Frances McDormand is great, as always, and so is Coen Bros. regular Jon Polito, as the pansy. Scarlett Johannsen from "Ghost World," shows up in a fine early performance. And finally, Tony Shalhoub is totally convincing as Ed's hotshot attorney. It was interesting to hear the way the Coens perceived this movie. Listening to the audio commentary, I noticed they perceived "The Man Who Wasn't There" as a dark comedy. My initial impression of the movie was more tragic than funny. And I think I'll still perceive it as a tragic story, especially since your sympathy for Ed Crane grows as the story continues. But the story is also intriguing, and the film does borrow elements of an old-fashioned film noir. I recommend this movie to anyone who is a Coen Brothers fan, or anyone who is a fan of good films in general. As I said, it's an incredibly beautiful film!My score: 8 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this on Saturday and watched it with my boyfriend ... who was so bored he put me off it and I had to try again when he was out!! I loved it, he hated it. It's that sort of movie.Visually, "The Man Who ..." is beautifully shot in atmospheric black and white. This movie is in fact so beautiful that it's easy to be distracted from the story while admiring the cinematography. At times it feels like some plot points are being drawn out for too long because the Coen brothers have a fantastic idea for some visuals and they are determined to show it off to us.The plot starts out as classic film noir and is well summarised in other comments here. The addition of a flying saucer (briefly) doesn't hurt it. In fact, I thought that more than anything this movie was about dislocation, that Ed was helplessly outside his own life, unable to control any of the things that happen around him (even when he tries to exert some control, by taking Birdy to a piano teacher, it all goes horribly wrong), because he really isn't "there" in any meaningful way. It's as if he made a choice to separate himself from human interaction: for example he is virtually silent in the barbershop, and at one point he says he has not had sex with his wife in many years. Despite his wish to be all but invisible Life comes up and knocks on his door, and the only decision he ever makes (to obtain $10,000 by blackmail) is the catalyst for everything that follows. Guess you can hide from the world, but it won't hide from you.I loved the way black and white worked with Billy Bob's craggy features and enjoyed the slow pace of this movie. If it had been more action packed and had a slicker plot, I wouldn't have spent any time thinking about his character, which is possibly the Coen's intention.Either that, or they sit at home and read all these reviews and laugh their pants off!See this movie, but make sure you're prepared to relax into its gentle flow. I give it 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love the Coen brothers. This film is another one to tack up to the wall of success for these guys. The Man Who Wasn't There is neo-noir at its finest. Ofcourse it is not a carbon copy of the 40's Genre. The reason this movie should be rented by any film enthusiast is because it combines great direction, acting and plot. When a director can accomplish this it is rare (not so much with these two brothers) and must be seen.The reason this movie is somewhat different from other noir films is because there is no Femme-Fatale: The woman to coerces the man into doing evil things for her. This movie uses Billy Bob perfectly as a mono-tone barber who creates a web of intuige and uncertainty with one gut decision. I won't go any further, but you get the picture. It is also filmed in black and white to extentuate the underlying shadyness in this picture. Another film technique that makes this film a joy is the use of a voice over narration from the main character. From start to finish Billy Bob narrates his inner-monologue so the audience can get a taste of the mind behind the character. Rent this movie the next time you go to the video store, you'll enjoy it's cleverness and unique qualities.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet Another Amazing Performance by Billy Bob Thornton</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1984, brothers Joel and Ethan Coen established themselves as filmmakers with their debut film, `Blood Simple,' a noirish thriller that heralded a new and unique voice among the denizens of the cinematic world. Since then, the Coen Brothers have crafted and delivered a number of memorable films, featuring eclectic storylines and diverse characters, all of which have something to say about who we are and what makes us tick; all of the things that make the world go ?round. Whatever the subject matter, at their core their films are all examinations of the human condition; character studies that illuminate the infinitesimal possibilities wrought by that thing we know as human nature. Whether it's through the ruminations of the Dude in `The Big Lebowski,' or the musings of a pomade wearing escaped convict in `O Brother Where Art Thou?,' the Coen's films are insightful, as well as entertaining, and always unique. When you walk into a Coen Brothers film, you never know what you're going to get, but you can bet it's going to be an experience. And `The Man Who Wasn't There,' directed by Joel Coen, and starring Billy Bob Thornton and Frances McDormand, is no exception. In it, they revisit the `noir' territory of their first film, while contemplating the suggestion that there are things in life that just may be predestined; fate may provide a choice of paths to traverse, but in the end, they all seemingly lead to the same place. It's 1949, in a quiet town in California; a place that suits Ed Crane (Thornton) just fine. Quiet and unassuming, Ed is the second-chair barber in a small shop owned by his brother-in-law and first-chair barber, Frank (Michael Badalucco). Unlike most barbers, Ed doesn't like to talk. He just likes to cut the hair. Which works out fine, because Frank talks enough for them both. Ed suspects that his wife, Doris (McDormand), among other things, likes to drink a bit too much; he also suspects that she may be having an affair with her boss, department store owner `Big Dave' Brewster (James Gandolfini). But Ed's not one to get too worked up. Over anything. In his quiet and unassuming way, he's an observer; a watcher of the life being lived around him. Which pretty much suits him just fine. Almost. Ed goes along, cutting hair and watching; sometimes wondering. About his wife; about life; about what it means to just blend in. And then something happens that momentarily shakes him loose of his cocoon: A salesman, Creighton Tolliver (Jon Polito) blows into town with nothing to sell but an idea; but it's an idea for a revolutionary new concept that will make him-- along with the right investor-- rich. And Ed is interested. Because all he'll have to do is invest, let Tolliver do the work, and he can just...blend in. It's the perfect plan, but like all perfect plans there's a flaw, beginning with the fact that Ed doesn't have the money to invest. But through a lifetime of watching, Ed has learned a thing or two; and now, he has a plan of his own. A plan that once put into play will trigger a chain of convoluted events beyond anything he could ever have possibly imagined. And before it's over, Ed will understand what the guy meant when he said something about `best laid plans.' Because his best laid plans are about to change his life forever. And not necessarily for the good. With an approach that is every bit as quiet and unassuming as their protagonist, producer Ethan and director Joel deliver their most subtle film yet. The story (which the Coen's also wrote themselves) perfectly captures the era in which it is set, and is fraught with the unexpected. The Coen's weave a web of twists and turns that are almost nonchalantly intricate, and rarely take you where you think you're going. As in real life, things happen-- the import of which is often not realized until after the fact, and then, only after the next event-- prompted by the first-- occurs. And as the film has a somewhat mesmerizing quality to it-- aided in no small part by the brilliant B&amp;W cinematography by Roger Deakens-- it is later, upon reflection and after having had a chance to thoroughly digest the events you've witnessed, that you will feel the real impact of it all. And it's then, most probably in a quiet and unassuming way, that you will say to yourself, `Wow--' The Coen Brothers are gifted storytellers and filmmakers, they know what they want to say, and moreover, know exactly how to get it across to their audience. All of what the Coens bring to the table makes for a good movie, but in this case, the single element that takes it beyond `good' to `truly inspired,' is the performance by Billy Bob Thornton as Ed. In one performance after another, in film after film-- beginning with his dynamic portrayal of Karl in `Sling Blade'-- Thornton has veritably created a category of actor unique unto himself, that of Leading Man/Character Actor. Like no other actor, he has the ability to truly transform himself with every new role, so thoroughly that not a trace of himself remains. And each character he creates is totally new, physically as well as psychologically; it's as if Thornton is the product of some kind of artistic schizophrenic existence that enables him to become just about anyone he chooses. It's a rare talent, and as he demonstrates-- again-- with his portrayal here of Ed, it's a talent he uses wisely, and most effectively. And it makes you wonder if there is, in fact, a REAL Billy Bob Thornton. He is truly, one amazing actor. The supporting cast includes Scarlett Johansson (Birdy), Richard Jenkins (Walter), Katherine Borowitz (Ann) and Tony Shalhoub (Riedenschneider). Thought provoking and transporting, `The Man Who Wasn't There,' reaffirms the unique genius that `is' The Coen Brothers. I rate this one 8/10.     </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its no doubt one of the best movies from the Coen brothers. The scenario is adapted very realistic around 1940. The film has not much action to show but many surprising twists and a dramatic story for the man who wasnt there. Billy Bob Thornton performed his main role very cool without talking much and playing in the same time a very important key element in this thriller. If you liked this dont miss Coens "FARGO" or "Blood Simple". I gave 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Coens have created another masterpiece. This is their finest work. The screenplay is full of ironic humour at every turn. Thornton is wonderful as Ed Crane, the man who works at a barber shop who doesn't really consider himself a barber. Out of boredom, he goes into blackmail so he can earn money to invest in a dry cleaning scheme. There, that's it! Amazing isn't it? Only the Coens could ever devise a film on this premise and make it work its wonder for 116 minutes of black-and-white glory. I liked the film after the last elegant line spun. After a few days of going over it in my mind, I loved it more and more. It's skeletal elegy of an everyman taps straight into your mind and holds you there long after the final shot.Eerie and shocking, "The Man Who Wasn't There" gets a solid 8.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Coen brothers' best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Coen Brothers' new movie, The Man Who Wasn't There, is a film noir shot it glorious black and white. In the tradition of their masterpiece Fargo, this movie also depicts a simple plan that just goes totally wrong. It all starts with a plan to obtain money, and ends up with murder, unexpected twists, and unraveling tension. Although The Man Who Wasn't There does not go as deep as Fargo does, I still very much enjoyed its well-written story and excellent cinematography. The title is very appropriate to Billy Bob Thornton's Ed Crane, a barber who seems aloof to the world around him. `I don't talk much; I just cut the hair,' he claims, and its true, all he does is stare and smoke his cigarette. He is married to Doris (Frances McDormand), and he knows she is having an affair with her boss, Big Dave (James Gandolfini). Unfortunately, Ed Crane couldn't care less about the affair. When a customer in the barbershop proposes a business deal for $10,000 (for a new invention-dry cleaning), Ed decides to blackmail Dave. He sends him a blackmail letter, asking for $10,000 or else the affair will be revealed to Dave's wife, Ed himself, and everybody else. Because he is a respected member of the community and wants to gain control of his wife's business, Dave has no choice. This is good news for Ed. Except there's one problem: Dave knows about the man with the dry cleaning idea.Using black and white cinematography and simple camera angles, the Coen brothers have produced simplistic shots that are reminiscent of old movies. I don't know if the movie will also look good if shot in color, but I enjoyed it the way it is. I also have no idea why it was shot in black in white. Is it because of one sequence where a man bleeds to death, or was it because it is a film noir? Nonetheless, I'm sure the director had his reasons, and I did enjoy the black and white atmosphere.Billy Bob Thornton shows development as a very versatile actor. I also admired his performance in Monster's Ball as a racist prison guard who falls in love with a black woman. He displays his versatility by playing a bank robber in a comedy Bandits, which although I have not seen, the few trailer scenes probably tell it all. But I think his portrayal of Ed Crane is his best performance of the year. He manages to look the same and aloof all the time, even in times when great emotion is needed. This performance fit the character perfectly; he convincingly portrays the man who wasn't there.As I mentioned earlier, The Man Who Wasn't There does not go as deep as Fargo does in terms of the characters and the insight to the human condition. But The Man Who Wasn't There is perfect in its own little way. I was captivated by its story development all the way through. The screenplay is so well written, complete with smart and sometimes fully dialogue. After the dreadful Oh, Brother Where Art Though last year, the Coen brothers bounces back big with The Man Who Wasn't There. This is one of the best films of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a certain illness one feels whenever part of an organization (or society) that doesn't see you for who you are, does not care about who you are, and only wants to see an image, stylized to fit one of a few socially acceptable `types,' instead of the reality. We've all encountered it, at work, at play, at school, even in our neighborhoods. `Let us prepare a face to meet the faces we meet' is the great line from `The Lovesong of J Alfred Prufrock' (TS Eliot). The Man Who Wasn't There is about a man who is invisible in society: when he's seen, he's reduced to a `type': a husband, a barber, a taxpayer, a relative ? anything but a human with drives, internal direction, spontaneity, love, or a soul. His life is reduced to set of carefully circumscribed roles. And, lacking any proclivity to self-examination, he never wonders why the collective reflecting pool is shallow, so dark, and so empty. He accepts the necessity of preparing a face to meet the faces he meets (he is, after all, a barber, so this is his profession) as a matter of course; and, when he cuts hair, he does so as an automaton, lacking the gritty sense of self that would allow him to follow his own inspiration. He wonders at hair, for example, that it grows as a part of one's self, and is just cut off and discarded. The obvious question he needs to ask himself is, `How many parts of myself have I cut off and discarded?' The thought never occurs to him. Instead, he seeks to service his image in the traditional American way: by getting rich. Billy Bob Thornton narrates this story, this prosaic human tragedy, as if in a coma of detachment from himself, reminding us of those other lines from Prufrock, `Let us go then you and I, While the evening is spread out against the sky, Like a patient etherized upon a table.' See this movie, if you dare.</fullReview>

Now I feel much better and am ready to be good again. So here is the new, happier, more family friendly review: This movie was not too good. It had very little potty humor, explosions or MTV-style adolescent sexual pandering. It tried to be arty. The emotions it attempts to squeeze out of the audience are small and unclear. Its plot is stupid and hard to follow. The acting and camera angles are weird. There are no scenes of people wearing bodily fluids in their hair or blasting Third World types into lumpy fruit shakes. And the soundtrack didn't shake the fillings out of my mouth. So all in all I didn't feel that warm thrill of confusion and space cadet glow that you get say, with movies that epitomize all that is right and good and warm and fuzzy about Hollywood (like "Collateral Damage" or "Crossroads").

I can't decide if this is a Coen spoof (one always suspects), a tribute to film noir, or an outright movie/story presented on its own merits. Whatever their goal, it is a wonderful piece of moviemaking. Basic story with bizarre twists - some (or most) beyond belief. The movie is billed as black &amp; white, but trust me it is gray on gray. Billy Bob Thornton's face was born for this palate. Interesting story, superb direction combined with wonderful acting from Thornton, Frances McDormand and no less than THREE scene stealers: Jon Polito, Michael Badalucco and Tony Shalhoub. So many funny moments and lines at such awkward times that you find yourself wondering if it was supposed to be funny. The Coens are masters at the top of their game.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fortunately, Coen Brothers have displayed once again their unusual ability to tell serious, metaphysical but full of humanity stories in which common people have to cope with exceptional and amazing situations. After their risky but successful incursion in mad comedy genre -I mean 'The Big Lebowski' and 'O brother. Where art you'-, I was looking forward to see again in a movie theatre their masterful and thorough way of making serious films paying tribute to 40's and 50's movie classics. As it happened in 'Fargo', 'Barton Fink' or 'Miller's crossing', a tragic story gives them the possibility of creating a deeply elaborated script plenty of thrilling twists and a non expected ending, even though film's rythm is intentionally slow. Dialogues are as powerful as main character overvoice narration. This last point force me to write something of the superb Billy Bob Thornton's performance. I've read somewhere a comparison between his role here and Humphrey Bogart's film noir characters. In my opinion, Bob Thornton's work here is more than this. It is an ironic review of Bogart's tough creations. Here we're in front of an antihero, a shy guy with no personality nor expectations. All his live turns around a grey, disgusting and boring barber's shop. There he works and there he watch days passing by without batting an eyelid. Suddenly, he decides to change things. And from that moment until the end of the story we can enjoy Bob Thornton capability of showing his character's suffering and joy just by some nearly imperceptible changes on his face or his sight. Black and white photography is marvelous, a pleasure for audience's eyes, and deserves to be placed at the same level of Kubrick's and Wells achievements. Thanks once again to Joel and Ethan for sharing with us their personal style of making films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ah, the Coens...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joel and Ethan Coen are the Hollywood equivalent of that guy you know who tells you the most blatant lies with a straight face. He's probably joking, but...you never know.They have made some of the finest, most well-constructed, and oddest films of the 80's and 90's. And through it all, they have fooled us left and right. They claim that "Fargo" is based on a true story. It is not. They claim that "O Brother Where Art Thou?" is based on "The Odyssey". They've never read "The Odyssey". They claim that their editor is the Oscar-nominated Roderick Jaynes, whom they have used for numerous films. They actually do all of their own editing, and Jaynes is a pseudonym they use.Perhaps the most distinguished characteristic of the Coen films is their fascination with borrowing from a genre without completely imitating it. "Miller's Crossing" was a mob movie where the Coens made up their own slang. "The Hudsucker Proxy" was a slicked-up Preston Sturges screwball comedy. And now, with their latest, "The Man Who Wasn't There", the Coens have tackled 40's film noir.The story centers around barber Ed Crane, played to subtle comic perfection by Billy Bob Thornton, who gets an unusual customer one day. A man with a plan. "Drycleaning. That's right. Washing...without water!" Crane is intrigued and wants in on the plan. All he has to do is raise $10,000.There is much, much more that happens, but I dare not reveal any of the details. What follows is a smorgasbord of double crossings, murders, flying saucers, rambling philosophical monologues, and of course, haircuts. And through it all is Crane, nodding slightly, blowing an endless stream of cigarette smoke from him as if repel all that come near.Thornton's performance deserves immense recognition. In a typical film from the Coens, overacting is abundant. Indeed, the supporting cast (of whom the most notable are Frances McDormand, Tony Shalhoub, Michael Badalucco and Jon Polito) are firing on all cylinders, delivering every line like it may be their last. Thornton, however, sees his world crumbling around him, and he barely flinches. His Ed Crane is a natural poker player, one who shows nobody what he is feeling.Like most Coen films, it is a visual treat. Roger Deakins' black-and-white cinematography shines with the nostalgia of the Golden Age of Hollywood. Various shots, such as a car flying through the air in slow motion and a pair of doors opening to reveal a brightly lit death chamber, stick in your mind long after the theater lights come up. Carter Burwell's score is haunting, as with most Burwell scores, and it blends beautifully with the sonatas of Mozart and Beethoven.And as expected with the brothers, the script is a marvel. The Coens are never one to take a cheap shot, and they always manage to leave you at a point where you have no idea where the film will go. The script zings with dialogue that perfectly represents the paranoid, post World War II era. And the plot contains small tricks to make its audience smile (Crane, during one of his voiceovers, is interrupted by a phone call. After about 10 minutes of surprising plot twists, he is back at his house, and the voiceover continues).This film ranks amongst the Coens best. It is not as original as "Fargo", as intriguing as "Blood Simple", or as funny as "Raising Arizona", but it is a large success on all scales that make the Coens two of the most beloved filmmakers in modern Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have a real love/hate relationship with the Cohen's work. I think "Raising Arizona" and "Fargo" are outstanding yet I loathe "Big Lebowski" and "O'Brother". This great film falls into the former. Under it's black and white/film noir veneer, lies a story about communication and miscommunication. As a people we are more prone to mistaking what is meant than comprehending. We live in a world of underlying thoughts, past experiences, implied agendas, and non-verbal messages that cloud over the communciation process. We are left with only frail words to attempt to convey our meaning. That is why Thornton's character wants to avoid "gabby" people, because he wants to avoid the futility of trying to communicate (and the realization that most people talk on and on without saying much). The final scenes bring the point home as we witness he and his wife helplessly trying to talk on their couch and in his last words where he hopes to see her in another world where there are things other than words to make his point.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thornton) is a very quiet man. He's one of those characters who creates awkward silences in almost every scene, as he fails to play into the standard conversational banalities that everyone else does. Ask him a question, he answers it with as few words as he can. You have the information you asked for, and he fully expects you to be satisfied with that. He doesn't talk about himself much (even as the narrator, he tells you what happened to him, but doesn't tall you directly much about himself at all). This is not a man who shares, or opens up, or anything like that.I wonder if a character like this is easier or harder to play than a more extroverted character. I imagine it would be harder, and it's definitely harder to make a character like this likable. When a character keeps all of his emotions inside and only allows you to see his actions, which are also meticulously guarded and controlled, it's hard to find him sympathetic. As a result, even when an actor rises to this considerable challenge, as Thornton does in this film, he is often overlooked by moviegoers who consider the performance lacking (e.g., "He didn't do anything!"). Other strong performances underrated for similar reasons are Brad Pitt's in "Meet Joe Black" and Tom Cruise's in "Eyes Wide Shut".Just look at Thornton's face. It's remarkable. Especially if you've seen at least a few of his other films. You can look at Ed Crane and think "Oh yeah, that's Thornton," but upon reflection, Ed Crane doesn't look much like Thornton's other characters at all. That alone is remarkable. Compare to Kevin Spacey, for instance, who is another excellent actor.... most of his most famous characters look (and often talk) exactly the same. Thornton creates wildly dissimilar characters, even with a script that makes him work overtime to create a character at all.Not that I'm complaining about the script. The script is masterful. As is the direction and (especially) the cinematography. Yes, it's very slow. I know. If you don't like movies that take their time to delve a little deeper into the characters and story, well... skip this one. But if you're willing to be patient, you're going to see a hell of a story, with some terrific plot-twists, and several remarkable performances. Frances McDormand is rapidly stringing together an impressive array of exceptional performances, just in the last few years. She's had exquisite supporting roles in this film, in Wonder Boys, and in Almost Famous. And that's ignoring her previous work in films like pre-Fargo films like Blood Simple, where she was no less accomplished, but a lot less recognized.If you're a Coen brothers fan, I think you'll like this. I am, and I did, so... why not? But this is a different sort of Coen film than I've seen before (as most of them are). There is humor in this film, but it is very low key, very understated, and very beside the point. The humor works to alleviate the tension at key moments (usually at moments when most films would be upping the tension, which is a nice change of pace). The humor also exists to alienate Ed Crane from everyone else. Ed doesn't seem to respond to humor.I've only seen this movie once, and I should like to see it again soon. The one thing that doesn't really sit well with me is some of the things that fly in from left field, like the UFOs, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and so on. They certainly have the effect of introducing some recognizable Coen absurdities to the proceedings, but they seem to undercut the loving homage to the noir era that the film tries so hard to get across. I'm not sure what the intention was with that stuff, but it didn't damage my enjoyment of the film.</fullReview>

James Gandolfini (The Sopranos) plays a interesting role that I did not think he could play. I always had the feeling that he could only play the self confident non-emotional gangster type. Guess I was wrong, he was brilliant.I enjoyed The Man Who Wasn`t There.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coen Brothers Barber shop Quartet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And can this barber cut.Not only hair,but also as stories lead character and protagonist.Told with a first person style of narration and shot in B&amp;W with a 40's film noir backdrop,it both tells an interesting crime story with plot twists and enough characterization to uplift and keep fresh.Even though Ed Crane (protagonist)effectively played with reserve and dry candor by Billy bob Thornton,is a departure from usual Coen scripts,this one both works well and doesn't need black humor,blood or convoluted crime mystery.It has a degree of all three with the same restraint, and workable nuance as quiet and implicitly inner deep thinker Crane. Cranes character takes a little geting used too,but once his acumen and ability to absorb that sphere of influences that coagulate and form opportunitites around him,take shape,he quickly cuts to the chase and rises to the occasion.I liked his character and persona,almost from the start.His devil may care and understated way of approaching a situation is almost Bogart-like in comparison.With that Marlo,40's wide brim hat and cig hangin from mouth,he cuts a very Marloweish form that blends well with the shadowy night scenes and sidewalk demure.What makes this film standout,in my mind is an interesting story that flows and progersses,with an ease and believable nature as if it coulda happened and shoulda happened.No fancy pants,shoot em from the hip,kinda hard to unravel mystery,just believable story that inspires that Miss Marple and Agatha,in all us true mystery hounds of Barbershopville.What better place to get a feel of the landscape and town than the well traversed local barber shop.The cast and production value are first rate,but its the story that makes this one agreable.No one cast member is too overexposed and,the film really belongs to the Ed Crane character.But supporting cast are very good and more than make this a pleasant movie experience.The wrong cast coulda ruined the entire project.Almost every cast member fits perfectly.And that wonderfull underlying score and beautifull piano sonata {A Karl Haas theme song for his show}are enticing additions to an already beautifully choreographed script and Noirish feel.Even the cops with their Mulholland Falls lookalike garb,seem for real.No cheap hiFing from these guys,just by the book and dead serious,pound the beat texture.Like the rest of the movie,is takes on the serious yet almost surreal feel of a crime gone wrong and the bad guys Vs. good guys are misplaced.That is true in good film noir,where the bad guys are hard to discern,with all their social polish and culture {Sydney Greenstreet,Peter Lorre and Claude Rains} to name a few examples of meanies that appear gentlemanly,UNTIL!!. So the Quartet will include Claude,Sydney,Peter and MAYBE ED. No,he is just a struggling male in search for a cure for those 40's male menopause blues.The 4th and 5th wheel for that quartet will be Joel and then Ethan Coen,with Frances a close behind 6th.

But the truth is that this is a dull story about boring people with very small aspirations and dreams of only slightly improving their stations in life. We have an adulterous affair, a guilt ridden suicide, an accidental killing, visits by aliens, and execution and a talented pianist's career ruined in an auto accident. That would seem quite enough to provide some excitement but it fails to generate anything other than mild amusement about how life just passes some people by.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superbly done faux film noir in black and white.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Edit: Watched it again November 2015, I still find it superb, one of the more interesting movies I've seen. Thornton in a performance of a lifetime.SPOILERS - Something about the trailers for "The Man Who Wasn't There" made me want to see it as soon as it came out on DVD. So I rented it yesterday upon first release. I enjoyed the first half of the movie a lot more than the second half. The B&amp;W filming gives it a great atmosphere, and BB Thornton plays Ed, the barber of few words, just perfectly. In fact, BB "is" this movie. I believe he will be remembered as one of the fine actors of our time. Many popular actors, like Travolta, Denzel, and Hanks, are really just different faces of themselves, there is a sameness about all their performances. But not Billy Bob. Take 4 films, for example -- this one, "Sling Blade", "Pushing Tin", and "A Simple Plan." All different roles, almost different people playing them, but all BB. But I digress.This film is a tribute, and a spoof of, the 1940s "film noir" genre. Set after the WWII, in 1949, Ed goes through life almost as a "man who wasn't there." He sees an opportunity to invest in the leading edge of new technology, "dry cleaning", but has to blackmail his wife's boss and lover to get the $10,000. Boss finds out, confronts him, is beating Ed, when a quick jab into the neck severs the artery. Ed's wife, who had cooked the books for her boss, gets arrested for the murder. Wife hangs herself in prison, but later Ed gets accused of the dry cleaning investor's murder, he gets an incompetent lawyer, who plea-bargains "guilty" and Ed goes to the electric chair.The story is not so important. Anything could have happened to still make the point of the film. Ed was a man who wasn't really there, even in his own life, and the big things that could have gotten him, didn't, but he met his demise for something he didn't do. That's the irony, the spoof.The film is most enjoyable for the masterful cinematography and the sound editing. Regardless of where the story was going, I was just caught up in the atmosphere of this film. The DVD sound and picture are crisp. But the DVD itself is rather disappointing. The extras are not particularly interesting, and they are not entertaining. Especially the commentary track which does nothing to address the filmmakers' intent during key scenes. They don't seem to identify at all with what we viewers might be curious about. Instead they talk here and there about what they found interesting.Still, for someone who likes somewhat offbeat films, and this genre, it is a good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If it were not for the unusual B&amp;W look, the cast, and the novelty of a voice-over narrator whose delivery has all the passion of someone reading aloud from the phonebook, this film would not keep anyone in their seat beyond the 15th minute. Together, these elements seduce you along until you make the unhappy discovery that nobody's behind the wheel. By then you are so noircotized by the pacing and the bony vagueness of Billy Bob Thornton's face, you feel an almost Puritanical determination to follow out the breadcrumb trail left by the Coen brothers to see if they really mean to be as serious as they keep hinting. And no, they don't. There is only the string of jokes, the self-consciousness of the Coen style, and a simple human life ending in a thud. Most telling weakness: the movie cannot decide whether its main character was a stone-faced seer or hopelessly dense, and neither can we.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>interesting theoretically, lacking in presentation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers, interpretation:Presentation: Overall, I like the theoretical aspects of this movie ? although there are certain problems ? it's mostly the presentation that made this less than a must-see movie for me. The pace is incredibly slow to start and only picks up momentum later when it actually gives you something to think about. Yes the black and white is moderately interesting and there are some creative screenshots, but it's just not enough to keep me interested. The humor was also a different brand from that which I enjoyed in ?The Big Lebowski' and ?Fargo.' Mainly two types of humor are used: expectation and randomness humor. A line is uttered and you can already foretell the response and you're supposed to laugh because you're smart enough to see this. The problem with this type of humor is that for the audience to expect the next line the joke itself has to be cliched. An excellent example of how trivial this humor is is the fact that everyone laughed when the line from the trailer came up, `they put on their pants one leg at a time just like everyone else.' The Coen's did not mean for this to be funny, but it illustrates the point. When this gets old, random humor is used ? the humor of unexpectation. For example, when Ed says he'd like to collect the hair and mix it with soil and the spaceships and the sudden attempt at fellatio. We later learn that these occurrences were not actually random, but they are randomness humor nonetheless. Personally I prefer less slapsticky humor such as irony and creative social analysis and such.Theoretically: So Ed is the modern man? What does that mean? Ed is a barber. He is like Sisyphus who is condemned to eternally push a boulder up a hill. Ed must forever cut hair that just keeps growing back and even grows a bit after the body is dead. So spiritually is hinted at. Ed is not a completely a modern man because he admits the possibility of a future life both here symbolically and in the end directly.Besides the agnosticism, Ed is more optimistic than the typical stereotypical modern man. He is bored with life but doesn't pass into renunciation; he tries to create meaning, or at least entertainment. Specifically, this occurs when Ed gets suckered into the dry cleaning scam and when he tries to get something by living through the piano player. So with Ed's lack of words, his boredom is symbolized. Also, his lack of language shows his impotence in dealing with his position as modern man. Yes, Ed narrates the movie and clearly has an excellent ability to describe, but he cannot get at his essence. This is shown when Ed cannot defend his faith in the piano player's talents. He knows that he feels passionate about the music, but cannot explain why, just like he can't explain why everything turned out the way it did.Another anti-modern-man theme is the movie's poetic justice. Sure, Ed is convicted in an absurd way that clashes with the reality of what happened, but in the end he is justly punished for a crime he has committed. He could arguably be considered innocent of murder because of the self-defense defense, but he is clearly guilty of criminal negligence in this instance and of blackmail earlier. A more accurate portrayal of chaos would have done without the poetic justice since that requires some sort of metaphysical foundation which is clearly not acceptable here. The spaceships and Ed's wife's reappearance in the end are used to get us past these qualms, but they seem contrived and unconvincing.An underlying problem with this movie is the misrepresentation of the Heisenberg uncertainty principal. It doesn't state that the closer you look at something the less you know about it, it states that when taking measurements of subatomic particles it is impossible to determine both the position and momentum of the particle at the same moment. This is far from the metaphor of chaos it is used as. An accurate representation would say that when looking closely at something you can only know part of it. And that is only at one time; it is possible to know more if given more observations. You can never know everything because the eye is limited to perceiving one thing at a time. So we have order, just no absolute order, at least from what we know. The idea of chaos could still be used, it should just be explained through the pseudo-philosophy of some character (probably the lawyer again), instead of being used under the guise of actual science.The ending was slightly redeeming and made the lackluster beginning and middle worth sitting through, but it's definitely not my favorite Coen brothers film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great film if you can stick with it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this stylish, mesmerizing, black-and-white film noir, Billy Bob Thornton plays Ed Crane, a nearly comatose barber in post-war Santa Rosa. Thornton's rugged features capture and reflect light like an Ansel Adams landscape, giving him remarkable screen presence even as he remains nearly motionless except to sweep the floor or drag off an ever-present cigarette. Frances McDormand holds up her end as his wife, and a variety of other larger-than-life players add life and laughs as they dodge into and out of a slowly twisting plot.Crane hopes to break out of a deep rut by sinking some money into a mysterious new technology called `dry cleaning.' In the wondrously twisted universe of the Coen Brothers, dry cleaning is described in terms that make it seem slightly more fantastical than the flying saucers that appear sporadically in this film. This is part of a major theme -- that our perceptions of reality are, in many ways, flawed and confused. In a similar vein, the movie is rife with characters misinterpreting the actions, intentions, and motivations of their friends, lovers, and acquaintances. And when folks inevitably start dying, both prosecutors and defense attorneys show little interest in knowing or considering facts that don't help to build their respective cases. The upshot is that, despite the serious flaws inherent both in our perceptions of reality and in the workings of our justice system, capital punishment has long enjoyed the support of the American people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes is so difficult to comment a film with such premises as this one. Each film that comes out from the brilliant mind of the Coen's brothers is a new puzzle piece of a perfect masterpiece, their whole filmography. Their humour is just as fine as the most intellectual European writer with the major strength of being well located into the American "empty" province. "The man who wasn't there" is a film shot in a perfect black and white with very standard roles and this is perhaps its winning factor. Life goes on with in a barber shop without too many exciting events. Suddenly a man wonders whether he has still something to say and to do in the emptiness of his life with a betrayed wife.As always in the Coel's films the plot is intelligent and full of well defined characters. The atmosphere is always cynic as in the best "Fargo" age.Rating:7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Man Who Wasn't There" (or TMWWT) is an amusing film noir piece from the Coen brothers. It centres around Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thornton), a quiet barber who decides to raise some cash, to invest in a business opportunity, by blackmailing Big Dave (James Gandolfini) because Dave is having an affair with Ed's wife (Frances McDormand). From there it all goes downhill...The highlight of TMWWT is that it looks gorgeous. The Oscar nomination for cinematography is extremely well deserved. It's shot in high quality, crisp black &amp; white. The shots are all well framed, and the lightning all done with a great degree of technical precision. In fact it looks almost too good for film noir - there's none of the gritty, real feel of most film noir movies. Joel Coen is adept here, giving us long lingering shots of Crane staring off into space, a cigarette drooping from his lips, and yet able to capture the more fantastical elements - that creep in later on - with equal ease.The acting too is worthy of note. I felt Frances McDormand didn't really draw me in as much as she has done before (most noticeably in the Coens' "Fargo"), but the rest of the cast were great. Gandolfini, as usual, was throwing his muscle and presence around but Thornton deserves particular notice. He delivers a dry, not-quite-happy-or-sad performance as Ed Crane, and seems to let the events of the movie wash over him with a remarkable nonchalance.The film's biggest flaw is the Coens' script. It seems to meander along, and Ed Crane just seems to get carried with it. He isn't so much reacting to one event after the other, as just being pushed along without a bother. There's obviously a certain amount of humour being injected into the proceedings - particularly as the plot grows more and more absurd and thus there's a problem as to what the film is trying to achieve - it can't quite be a typical film noir homage, and yet it certainly isn't a comedy either. This somewhat uneven pacing left me with a vague feeling of dis-satisfaction at the end, as to what exactly I had just seen.I certainly enjoyed "The Man Who Wasn't There" and, as it is in IMDB, I'd place it in my Top 250 movies... but it wouldn't get into the Top 50. There's something lacking from it that has it being good, but not great. 7.5/10</fullReview>

Never before has a black and white film looked so amazing.Tony Shalhoub continues the Coen Brother tradition of a supporting character that just steals every scene he (and often in Coen Brother films she, remember Julianne Moore in Big Lobowski?) is in. Billy Bob Thorton and the rest of the cast also do an outstanding job. At some point, I suppose that it's inevitable that the Coen brothers will make a sub par film, but it hasn't happened yet, and this one is among their best, which is really saying something.

		<fullReview>I've read some of the comments slagging off this film. I understand that some think it is pretentious, boring or a disappointment. I guess I'm lucky not to share their cynicism as I am not too familiar with the work of the Coen brothers; in fact, 'O Brother' was the first I'd seen. With the exception of the UFO images, which I definitely didn't 'get', I thought this was a very good movie. The atmosphere created by the period and the black and white photography would not on its own be sufficient to impress, but the whole think reeks authenticity to the point where at one time, the cigarette smoke drifting in the air made me think, that for one ghastly moment, someone was puffing in the multiplex. I felt as if I was there with the characters. Although there was a weak section, about two-thirds of the way through, overall I was mesmerised. I was particularly impressed by Scarlett Johansen, who was exceptional, although not as exceptional as Thora Birch, in 'Ghostworld'. Billy Bob Thornton was teriffic, and I hope he is at least nominated for Best Actor Oscar. He may have a phobia about antique furniture, but it certainly doesn't stop him acting with some. As with all good thrillers of this style, the humour, unforced, is much funnier than in films which try to be comedies. There were one or two hysterical moments in this film, although I seemed to be in a minority on this score. I'm glad I was the man who was there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Believe me or not, or roll on the floor laughing, but until last week I didn't know who the Coen brothers were... Then I accidentally saw The Man Who Wasn't There. I was completely overwhelmed. One could say that the plot was a bit slow. That's absolutely true, but I see it as the power behind it. I wasn't bored a single second. I wasn't just watching the things Ed Crane did, no, I got to KNOW him! But he surprised me after all. I.e. Crane was telling me how he met his wife Doris, when he got a phone-call from Doris' lover. Crane went to see the guy, ended up killing him, went back home and picked up the story like nothing had happened. Brilliant! The only black and white stuff I ever saw before were the Laurel&amp;Hardey tapes my father used to watch. But it wasn't till now that I understand the power of it. Crane is a dull and complex man, who wouldn't do well in a happy, coloured environment. It's the shades on his dark face that make you appreciate his character even more. Every shot the Coen brothers use in TMWWT is an award winning photograph. Or at least: he could be on my wall! As far as I'm concerned the Coens deserve a price for that as well, besides from their Cannes award for Best Director. You shouldn't see this film if you enjoyed watching happy ending Hollywood movies, with action from the first second (Hollow Man, Blow, MI1 &amp; 2, Die Hard, Gone in 60 Seconds etc. etc.). But when you like to get to know the characters you're looking at AND be surprised in the end, be SURE to see this one!The Man Who Wasn't There, a film that absolutely WAS there. 9/10. (I wouldn't look too slimey by saying 10/10, but that's how it should be rewarded.).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tragedy of a modern man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Coen Brothers' movies (anyone who has read some of my comments will know that they are my favourite) tend to think deeply about the human (especially the male) soul on the one hand and spoof the common trend to think about it on the other. Tony Shalhoub's character and his pleas are the perfect example for this. With Ed Crane, the Coens have created a so-called modern man, a man who doesn't either understand or ask. He thinks a lot but he doesn't speak much and his life seems quite unbearable. The Coens let this man make some mistakes, and as a kind of punishment they take away everything from him, every glimmer of hope to make anything out of his life, so that finally seeing the ending, which I don't want to spoil, one may well talk about a happy-end.Billy Bob Thornton looks absolutely fascinating with his almost mimeless face, within the beautiful pictures the Coens created around him. Frances McDormand again proves that she is a fabulous supporting actress. The same is true for Tony Shalhoub (fabulous supporting actor), who should receive his first Oscar nomination at last. As a Coen `expert', I should rank this newest movie right between `Barton Fink' and `Miller's Crossing'. `The Man Who Wasn't There' is not their funniest and not their darkest movie, but it is the one where laughing and thinking are closest together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Genius!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yet again, the Coen's prove that they are the most original filmmakers working today, with a twisted story of murder, extortion, and hairdressing. Ed Crane, played with remarkable ennui by stone-faced Thornton, is a barber caught on the hop when he tries to blackmail his wife's lover for $10,000, in order to invest in dry cleaning. From then on there is accidental murder, suicide, and eventually some kind of justice. Crane narrates the full story with such a deadpan delivery, and Thornton performance is so spot on that you find it difficult to either like, or loathe, the character. But it seems to me that that's the point. He really 'isn't there'. Other characters hardly react to him, and when he confesses to the murder it is ignored as being implausible. Because the character is so anonymous, and yet needs to carry the film, the supporting parts are peppered with some of the best lines, and performances. Frances McDormand, as Crane's wife, and Tony Shalhoub, as the flashy lawyer stand out, and counterpoint Crane's nonchalance.This is a fantastic movie from every point. It looks perfect, with sublime lighting and use of black and white, that really enhances the story, and the script is full of the usual off-kilter humour and one-liners that mark the Coen's work. That they can still produce a movie of such originality after previous commercial success is genius!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read through a bunch of the comments and it seems a lot of people found it dull and boring. and i can see that, it's not everyone's cup of tea. however; everyone admits that the acting and cinematography is great. so there's a start. and if you're willing to attend a movie and be forced to invest yourself in the characters and have to think a little whilst watching, you will be left with a great film going experience.of any writers i find that the coen's always manage to come up with the best scripts, always. i love Lynch, i love Kubrick and i love Fellini, but the Coens are THE BEST writers (true Kubrick wasn't really a writer...). and in my opinion this is one of their best. is it as good as the script for Fargo? no, i don't think so, but fargo is among the best scripts ever written. and this one isn't far behind. a brilliant movie about a misunderstood man who tries to climb out of a trapped job situation and has it all backfire on him (it is a noir...). if you watch closely you learn to see all the humanity built up in the character of Ed Crane, even tho he speaks scantily a word about himself. it's brilliant on the part of the Coens where you learn so much, and have so much empathy for such a quiet character.a beautifully written, wonderfully acted, amazingly shot, fantastic movie. play close attention to the details and the actions of the characters.oh ya i forgot to mention how funny it is. it's damn funny at times if you're paying attention.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing this film about a month ago at the Crest at my home town and seeing the film made me think hard about my society. sometimes, i feel like ed crane when it comes to my high school. I'm the man who wasn't there. I'm nearly a phantom to my classmates. anyway, i believe that the Coen Brothers have struck yet another chord in their film making with The Man Who Wasn't There. it is a film that will astonishing and hold you at every minute of the movie. All of the cast members were incredible, especially Billy Bob Thornton. He quoting a film critic which i agree, manage to play a boring man without giving a boring performance. Literally what he did what something that you rarely see in film making. His subtleness at every turn may have astonish the audience or even shocked them. in a way, we all have a Ed Crane in ourselves. i liked the coens' style of film making and i think the real kudos should be towards the cinematographer Roger Deakins. he may be one of the best cinematographers that we ever had in the film industry. this is a film that gives the name "film-noir" a WHOLE new definition. i love this film so much and i wish to see it again sometime. the coen brothers do a very good job at making a film that has the right elements and the right characters. they make films that anyone couldn't believe it would be directed by them. i recommend this film to everyone who loves film-noir movies. the coen brothers have yet made another excellent movie. folks, you will be amazed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Billy Bob Thornton plays a quiet barber with no life but has a criminal plan go astray that turns him into a deadly menace. His deadpan expressions transfer into brilliant acting, sort of like Gary Cooper gone psycho. Frances McDormand is his two timing wife. James Gandolfini is an adulterating businessman with a violent past and Tony Shalhoub is a fast talking defense lawyer in love with his own technique and the other characters in the film add to a decadent lifestyle trapped in a criminal scheme. Like 'Fargo', the Coens invent a scenario that involves a sandstorm of crime where the characters involved get in deeper and deeper over their heads. Filmed in colour but transferred to black and white, the dreamlike images the Coens transmit to the audience's mind, play out like subliminal psychological images and as slowly as the film is paced, it's necessary to absorb all the feelings of dread that makes for somewhat muted entertainment with a satisfying underbelly. This film has real foundation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film Noir Revisited</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Coen brothers are more popular in Europe than in the States, which is not strange since they constantly choose to go in the opposite direction of the regular Hollywood strategies. These genius brothers dare to be different and they do it superbly time after time. The Man Who Wasn't There is no exception. Film noir is a more or less dead movie category today, and this film serves as a modern tribute to that gendre. Thornton plays the discontent and misplaced barber who tries to make things better for himself, only resulting in making things worse. The characters in the film are as in any Coen movie exceptionally interesting, especially the smaller roles. If you look past the humor, the flawless style and the sense of watching an updated movie with that great 40's feeling, you will notice that the film is made with more heart and deeper meaning than any other Coen movie. I am one of the few who think that Fargo (1996) is not one of the best Coen films. In my opinion their best work include Miller's Crossing (1990), The Big Lebowski (1998) and O Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000). I can confidently add The Man Who Wasn't There to that impressive list.

		<fullReview>This movie is for people who enjoy the process of watching a film. If you think that MI:2 is a great movie, don't see this. This film requires the viewer to invest a considerable amount of time and effort, and in the end you will be rewarded. It takes a certain type of person to enjoy film noir's antiquated heroes (mental note: the word hero and Ed Crane don't seem congruent) and because of this many will not understand the position Ed Crane finds himself in. That is just fine with the Coen's, as well as their cast and crew. Some films are made to be mass consumed, and that is as it should be. Other films are made for a select few who can find poetry in silence and comfort in the cinematic expression of human solitude. I belong to the latter, and so will most fans of The Man Who Wasn't There. I look forward to many repeated viewings of the Coen's latest and all their previous works. They all stand my test of time. Phillipe Marlowe Ed ain't, and that is what makes his laconic idea of a man searingly trenchant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How, I would like to know, can an actor say so little and still convey so much? Billy Bob Thornton's voice can be heard almost constantly as the narrator in this film, however the dialog he speaks on-camera probably wouldn't fill two pages. But you're never in doubt somehow what Ed Crane is thinking and feeling throughout this movie. BBT's command of his facial expressions are a thing of beauty and a joy forever.The Coen Brothers have successfully created a modern-day film noir. All of the classic elements are there, except they're better, clearer and even more everything than the originals of this genre. Frances McDormand, James Gandolfini &amp; Michael Badalucco all turned in exemplary supporting roles, but somehow Katherine Borowitz's performance as Ann Nirdlinger stole the supporting actor spotlight in my opinion. Her badly frightened/super uptight facial expressions provided the few smiles that this movie offered. Her kooky speech after her husband's untimely death was perfect.If you like a film that moves at a leisurely pace, and relies on the strength of the story and the actors telling it, rather than explosions, explicit sex and/or raunchy violence - you must not miss this movie. I gave it at 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes less is less</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whenever I see a movie by the Coen brothers, I pay them the compliment of trying to forget who they are and just watch the movie. It's very hard not to like these guys. Clearly they love movies, have seen most of them and lavish doting detail upon their own. They write clever scripts and find a way to let each actor shine in his or her part, however small. Sometimes they even have some pungent points to make about life. And yet.... There was only one Coen flick I found really gripping: their first, BLOOD SIMPLE. Shot on location in Texas on a budget of next to nothing, with a cast of unknowns (of whom only three--Frances McDormand, M. Emmet Walsh &amp; Dan Hedaya--were ever heard from agan) and a script that on paper must've read like the cheesiest Z-grade potboiler, they made magic. I was immersed deeper than a born-again Baptist. The Hedaya burial scene had my heart pounding; when it was over I felt as drained as the guy doing the burying. The final sequence had me on the edge of my seat, where I never found myself again until, I think, SEVEN. I was so immersed that even the arty stuff, like the bullet holes through the door each producing a shaft of eerie light, or the newspaper flying towards us in slow motion while McDormand and the guy talked in regular motion, or the foot-level dolly shot, etc.--all that not only didn't bump me out of the action but enhanced it for me. I left the theater in a kind of daze. "Who the hell are these guys??" .....But after that it was as though they'd contracted terminal self-awareness. Haven't seen all their movies since then but quite a few, have found something to like (sometimes a lot to like) in all of them, but each time it's like I'm watching myself watching it. They won't let me lose myself in it. In a way they're the opposite of David Lynch, whose stuff is disturbing because he's so good at drawing you in and then leaving you trapped in that unsettling dream logic. The Coens are disturbing because they leave you standing outside the fence, almost daring you to climb over it. So as I said at the outset, I try to forget these guys are probably geniuses who could do whatever they wanted, and just take what they give me. On those terms, I'd say my favorite from them has been FARGO, which came the closest to BLOOD SIMPLE in letting me care about what I was watching, as though the characters were actual people about whom I could read in the paper--in fact, wasn't that the one the Coens originally claimed was based on a true story?--and my least favorite has been BARTON FINK, but again, I haven't seen them all. Special mention for the ashes scene in THE BIG LEBOWSKI where I almost fell out of my chair laughing, I appreciate a movie that can make me do that. ....So here we are with THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE. Well as always with the Coens, there's a lot to like. Billy Bob Thornton is aces with me for a number of reasons (but he'd better do right by Angelina, goddammit) but chiefly the way he stays rigidly within each character's emotional range. His "big moments" are those of the character, not the actor. Think how rare that is, think how most of the time Joe or Jane Star will turn on the waterworks or otherwise "play up" a big scene. Not Thornton, and it's probably cost him several Oscars, especially for SLINGBLADE &amp; A SIMPLE PLAN. Mrs. Coen (I forget which one is her husband) again can do no wrong. The period detail's impeccable, although just once in my moviegoing life I'd like to see one where the vintage cars have some dents &amp; grime on them, don't look like they're from someone's vintage car collection. Some nice black-&amp;-white compositions, like the silhouette shots or Gandolfini sitting at his desk half in shadow. Good music; this movie may do for Beethoven's "Pathetique" sonata what THE LADYKILLERS did for Boccherini's "Minuet." Many striking moments although the Italian wedding sequence with the guy riding a pig seemed a bit much, especially right after McDormand's snide comments about "the wops." (They made a point about period prejudice, then seemed to indulge in it themselves.) In short, a lot of vintage Coen, BUT.... There was just nothing here to care about. The protagonist had drifted into being a barber; okay fine, that was his choice. Married a woman with whom he had no rapport, again his choice. This was no personification of postwar America or modern existentialist man or what have you, just some semi-dim bulb who took what life gave him &amp; seemed attached to nothing in life but his cigarettes. (He even smoked while cutting hair; even in the 1940s would customers have put up with that?) He makes several decisions (necessary for the plot) that seem patently ludicrous. The trademark Coen ironic plot twists have no sort of ring of inevitability to them, they're just clever movie plot twists. The scene with the girl in the car was jaw-droppingly out of the blue, related to nothing happening beforehand or afterwards, just seemed added as another Noir reference. I won't "spoil" the ending, mainly 'cause there's really nothing to spoil, it seems as desultory as everything before it, but I'll just say----SPOILER IF YOU'VE READ CAMUS' "THE STRANGER"----it really doesn't hold a candle to Camus' "The Stranger," just more vacuous ramblings by a vacuous guy sleepwalking through life. Man who wasn't there? This was the movie that wasn't there. Sometimes less really is less. But of course the Coens are geniuses &amp; all that. By the way---since the movie's elephantine pace gave me time to notice stuff like this---in one scene where McDormand wears glasses, we can tell they're not prescription lenses 'cause there's no refraction through them. Seemed an odd slip, given the general attention to detail. Maybe it was deliberate, see if someone would notice? Finally, the movie's title is itself another Noir reference, from the scene in DETECTIVE STORY (1950) where the detectives are ridiculing Joseph Wiseman's alibi, until William Bendix chortles "The man who wasn't there..." Still &amp; all, worth a look for the acting &amp; decor. It was literally the only movie I could find to want to see this weekend, although I would've preferred to see MULHOLLAND DRIVE again if it were still playing....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent use of lighting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lighting becomes extremely important when a movie is filmed in black and white. The director is given the responsibility to decide how to light the scene and which parts to highlight. Joel Coen appeared to really enjoy this responsibility with his very unique and interesting use of lighting techniques. I especially enjoyed a scene in a dark cell where only a beam of light shined in from a window that was enclosed in bars. The stark boundary of the light cut actor Tony Shalhoub under his eyes, forcing the audience's attention to his smug grin. The boundary wouldn't have been so stark and the emphasis would have been lost if the film was done in color.I realize it's a small detail, but attention to detail is what separates the great movies from the good movies.</fullReview>

The acting is greatacross the board, the disintegration of Ed Crane's plans isbrilliantly rendered, and there is quite of bit of the dry humor whichis so prevalent in the Coen's work. There are a few spots wherethe film drags, and some very bizarre, somewhat randomhappenings, but overall this is a very fine, well-made, piece ofcinema.Rating: 9\10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely loved this movie. It is the tale of a man so ordinary, so passive, whose one uncharacteristic act sets in motion a chain of events that affects everyone around him! Billy Bob Thornton, who is fast becoming my favorite actor, plays barber Ed Crane without a smile. His wife Doris (Frances McDormand) is a bookkeeper at Nirdlinger's department store. (Don't you just love that name?) James Gandolfini is her boss. He's a big blustery guy who is fond of regaling folks with tales of his WWII heroics against "the Nips." And he's married into the family that owns the store. Ed suspects that Doris and Big Dave (Gandolfini) are having an affair, but he really doesn't care. He breaks out of his ennui, only when a sleazy salesman comes to town looking for financial backing for a chain of dry cleaning stores. Ed bites at the possibility of a better life, but the route he takes to get there proves deadly. Beautifully acted, carefully shot in velvety black and white, The Man Who Wasn't There is a modern film noir masterpiece from Ethan and Joel Coen. Their 1949 Santa Rosa, California, is perfect. The costumes are perfect. Everyone wears a hat. And everyone, except the kids, smokes! You haven't seen this much smoke in a film since. . . .well, since I can't remember. It's my favorite film of 2001. Go see it, then let's talk!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>T.S. Elliot meets "Out of the Past" in a barber shop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Coen brothers new release, The Man Who Wasn't There, contains some of the most imaginative black and white images I've seen in awhile. Even though the plot and performances were quite effective, I was really less captivated by the discourse of the film than its look. TMWWT was originally shot in color, and then released in black in white with the texture of a color film with the color turned all the way down. The result is a washed out effect, which becomes a visual metaphor for the emptiness of the characters, particularly the protagonist Ed Crane, played with subtle and slight expression (almost excruciating understatement) by Billy Bob Thornton in an Oscar worthy performance. The noirish use of light and shadow reminded me of von Sterberg's "Morroco," (a descendent of German Expressionism) as well as the noir films of the '40s and '50s. The visual style was not only a great homage to the genre, but also unified the film material. Roger Deakins has shot a number of films for the Coens, and this certainly is first rate. Carter Burwell's score, as always, helps support the mood, and blends well with the film's look. While in many ways typical of the genre, the film itself atypically works at a very deliberate pace. Of course, the Coen's typically walk a shifting line between tragedy and satire (ref. "Barton Fink"), where here the languorous pacing turns the tale toward the surreal both in tone and, in at least one occasion, content. Ed Crane (Thornton) is the second barber working in his brother-in-law's (Michael Badalucco) shop. Ed is married to Doris (Frances McDormand), whom he discovers through attention to the interactional patterns with her boss (James Gandolfini) during a dinner party at their home is having an affair. Soon afterwards at the shop, he serves a customer (Jon Polito) who presents him with a business opportunity requiring 10k to join as a silent partner. The combination of this venture and his wife's infidelity sets in motion the expected double crosses, twists, betrayals which works not only at the level of plot but also at a psychological and relational level.  In a sense, Crane is the embodiment of Elliot's "Hollow Man," "gesture without motion....headpiece filled with straw, alas." There is one telling scene where Ed is peering into the bathroom where his wife is bathing. The background is in focus, while Ed is smoking (always smoking), standing in full silhouette in the foreground standing outside and leaning on the doorway. He comes into the room, and at her command, picks up a razor and shaves her legs, mechanically dipping it into the water, and removes the lather he had just placed from her legs. Here, he seems without person, without substance; a robotic drone with no soul. This scene is repeated metaphorically during a key moment towards the end of the film, which both unifies the work, while demonstrating the eviscerating effect of events on the life of this deeply empty man. The Coen brothers have created one of the most vivid depictions of anomie in several years. TMWWT makes my list of one of the year's best. ***1/2 from me. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Acting that was there!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was not all there with the strange &amp; mysterious new film by the Coen brothers `The Man Who Wasn't There'. The movie stars Billy Bob Thornton as very still barber who must deal with blackmail, infidelity, and murder. It was beautifully filmed in black &amp; white by long time Coen collaborator- Cinematographer Roger Deakins. Even though I truly enjoyed Billy Bob's quiet performance, I felt at times someone should have `spiked' up his drink with a little whiskey. He was just way too calm for all the ruckus that was going on around him. The film was also 30 minutes too long; the Coens should have done more `cutting' and `trimming' to their work. I also did enjoy Tony Shalhoub's performance as the gabby lawyer which was just `a little of the top' of the great supporting acting I have seen so far this year. `The Man Who Wasn't There' is tedious at times, but the `highlights' of the movie are Billy Bob and Tony's `hair-raising' performances. *** Average</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film transcends description</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like all beauty, this film transcends description, but I'll try it anyway. The thing that hits me with the Coen's films are how they seem to always break the tired trend of predictable characters and, instead, choose to set them in an exhausting world, one that they are completely unaware of. Thorton's character is surrounded by a mundane world and passively chooses to accept his role in that world -- not caring in any way about it or any one, and having no idea as to who he actually is. That is what makes this film so amazing. We are forced to look beyond what he is feeling, simply because he feels nothing, and are left with a moving picture of tranquility that is exemplified by his admirable indifference. I could go into each scene, but, like I wouldn't be doing it justice; see this film if you haven't already. And if you have, see it again, you'll enjoy it even more than you did the first time. By far, the best film of the last few years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An insight into the 50's, Coen Bro's style (slight spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The overall affect of this move was to satirize the 1950s as a time where men had little control over there own life beyond the lot they were given to them at birth. This point was made effectively while keeping me interested with strong characters, and humorous dialogue.What struck me immediately during the movie was how effectively the setting was established; it looked like a 1950's Time magazine advertisement come to life. This is probably due largely to Roger Deakins' cinematography efforts, but the wardrobes, cars, props, even the 4 or 5 standard hair cuts that Ed Crane gives day after day (flat top, executive contour etc.) all contributed. The setting let you know that the characters are in a different time where things are much more uniform and cut and dry than they are today.The plot was similar to The Big Lebowski's in that it wasn't the most important part; if you try to follow it very closely, and look for the strength of the movie there, you might be disappointed. It basically takes an ordinary man, and puts him in extraordinary circumstances. There are parts where explanation is left out (the 2nd trial), and parts where the viewer is left wondering the legitimacy (why they wouldn't fingerprint the murder weapon).These minor flaws aside, the plot served to have Ed Crane lose control over his life the minute he attempted to take control of it (by blackmailing for money to start a business).The characters were what ultimately made the movie for me. As often the case in Coen Bro's movies (especially the Hudsucker Proxy), many of the characters were characterizations of their role in life. That is to say, certain aspects of characters where amplified to serve the satirizing effect of the movie. This makes them seem unrealistic and zany, but it is very effective at making the point of the movie stronger and at making the charicters interesting. Ed Crane is soooo ordinary, and his life soooo routine and boring. The lawyer, Freddy Riedenschneider, is soooo self-centered and focused on winning. When Ed Crane tells him that he murdered big Dave, Freddy simply dismisses it as a bad defense case and starts thinking of other plans of defense without stopping for a second to consider the truth of what Ed has just said.Most importantly, the movie kept me interested, and entertained. I felt sorry for Ed, but at the same time found his observations in the spot of a helpless man very interesting.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Man Who Wasn't There" is a wonderfully shot film noir. The Coen's use of light and shadow in this black and white movie is stunning to watch. It's just a shame that they couldn't have made the movie more interesting. You can't empathize will Billy Bob, or any of the other characters for that matter. There's no moral core to any of the characters or to the movie itself. One bright spot though, was Tony Shaloub's portrayal of MacDormand's defense attorney. He gives an excellent performance. Don't count him out for Supporting Actor when Oscar time comes rolling around. Anyhow, a so-so movie that can wait to be seen till it's on video. I found "Fargo" and "Oh Brother Where Art Thou" much more enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Coens grow up (almost)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Man Who Wasn't There" is the most subdued of the Coens' films and the longest. They've always seemed to design their work to please today's attention span-deficient audiences. Their latest, though, takes a few moments to look around. It breathes. The film runs only two hours but feels longer. This may be the Coens' most thoughtful, sophisticated film yet. It's many things: a comment on the post-WWII era, the economy, flying saucers, and cigarettes (Notice how almost everyone smokes and does so in almost every scene).It's a good story but meanders sometimes aimlessly in true Coen fashion. Once again, it feels as if they made it up as they went along. But if this writing technique has worked well before, why not keep using it? The story always finds itself eventually. "Man" is your basic normal-guy-in-extraordinary-circumstances story. Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thornton) acts on instinct and doesn't seem to care what the consequences are for his actions. Everything works out well for him as long as no one believes that this common barber could be capable of such mischief. The performances are as usual second to none, especially by Thornton. The film, like its main character, is a contradiction: it's their second weirdest picture behind "Barton Fink" and yet it's also their most mainstream. The brothers are regarded as indie filmmakers but their films consistently have a slick, mainstream look. This is due in no small part to who they've hired to shoot their films, Barry Sonenfeld at first and then later (starting with "Fink") Roger Deakins. I'm not convinced this should have been transferred to black and white. The studio wouldn't let them shoot in B&amp;W so they compromised: shoot in color, transfer it to a black and white print. That way a color print is still available (an inevitable feature on the ?special edition' DVD, I'm sure). I don't like the way their compromise looks, though. It feels like cheating. You can tell it wasn't shot in black and white. I wish they would have held fast and gotten the blessing to shoot it on B&amp;W film. As it is, I can only imagine how much better Deakins' photography would've looked.The Coens have earned the kind of reverence in the filmmaking community that has Academy members and critics looking for an excuse to heap awards on them. "Man" will end up being another such excuse. You could make an argument for it in almost any Oscar category and it's likely to capture a few nominations. The Academy is looking for an excuse to award Deakins and this is probably it. They love Thornton and McDormand as well. I don't see any way this doesn't get an original screenplay nomination either.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breaking the Rules</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are certain rules to moviemaking, as there are to all art forms.First of all, the art must be entertaining, for it is not, the public will not be pleased. And even the final effect of experiencing the art must be satisfying, for even today the greatest marketing tool at anyone's disposal is "word of mouth".It is not enough, for example, to be pretentious and to concoct a really suicidal scenario, for the public will leave the cinema yucking their tongues, not at all happy, and then if and when their friends ask them if the movie is worth seeing, their countenances will tell all. (There are pretentious people in this world who really think they have something if they partake of pretentious art, but fortunately they are in the far minority.)Secondly and continually afterwards, any other rule you want to apply to moviemaking - or again any other art form - is stillborn if the first rule is broken. Do you have something important to say? Then let it be conveyed on the carrier wave of good entertainment. Many great comedians are great social critics, and the reason they can influence people is that they make people laugh - the public is entertained.This movie comes with the reputation of these brother from Texas, their somewhat uneven portfolio that on the whole is still very good, and that's what drives the few who see this movie to actually see it. But the majority of these people are, in my opinion, sorely disappointed, for the rather egotistical Coen Brothers have disregarded the First Rule of Art.This was the first of two movies I saw on the same day, something I do not do very often, only when the first cinematic experience is so BAD a new and better cinematic experience is needed immediately. I was fortunate enough to get in to see Spy Games only a few hours later, and was much more pleased with that movie, and finally could go home with a smile on my face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Coens are back on form!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is simply a modern 'noir' masterpiece with brilliant performances all round, especially from Billy Bob Thornton as Ed Crane and Frances McDormand as his wife Alice.Ed Crane is a laconic, small town barber and an outwardly unexceptional man, lacking in passion and stuck in a dreary life and sexless marriage. Laconicness is often a quality we associate with careful, wise thinking and circumspection. In reality Ed Crane is both hapless and devious (like Jerry Lundeegard in 'Fargo'). Crane cons his wife's boss, department store manager Big Dave Nirdlinger, played by James Gandolfini, (with whom she is having an affair) into handing over blackmail money to a con artist whose spurious business idea he had initially refused. Things come full circle when we learn that Big Dave has found out from the confidence trickster (with the help of his fists) about Ed's sneaky little trick. In a frenzied fight, during an after hours meeting at Nirdlingers', Ed kills Big Dave in self-defence. The authorities discovery of the embezzled money leads to a murder charge being made against Alice and from then on Ed's foolishness and deceit leads to greater tragedy.A strong theme in Coen brothers' films is how ordinary people's attempts to find shortcuts out of humble or uncomfortable predicaments ends up creating uncontrollable mayhem and disaster. This is a superb film, beautifully shot in black-and-white and compelling right to the end. This could be the best ever Coen brothers' movie, and there's a long line of great films to choose from.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good cinematography, ludicrous story (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film's conclusion really messed with my head and got me asking questions about life and death. As all films of this type, crafted by people with the Coen brother's experience, should. However, in this case the cinematography also "hides" something, namely that the story just doesen't stand up.Ed stabbed big Dave while holding his wife's knife with his bare hands. The knife was found (and that IS mentioned in the film, as evidence against the wife), and the police did not check it for fingerprints? Even if one overlooks that, it was pretty obvious everything happened during a FIGHT (the scattered papers &amp; the cracked window). Big Dave's history of fighting, his sheer size and the fact everything happened in his office makes it obviousthat this was not premeditated, and makes it likely that the murdereracted in self-defense.Even decades ago, a white middle class woman would never have gotten a capital verdict under these circumstances even if there was no doubt about she did it. Same would be true as far as the man is concerned. Yet the lawyer does not even consider this as a line of defense, and makes the case out to be desperate.As for the second trial, the Coen brothers skip telling us anythingconcrete about it. IMHO deliberately, because I don't see how any jury would find the man guilty of a capital offense in a case like that. Hell, even the fact that he BEAT THE VICTIM TO DEATH would never standup.So, good cinematography. Lousy story. Unlike Fargo, in which both were up to scratch. And, since this film, in many ways, exploresFargo's themes, I'd say it's a step down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Metaphor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Waiting to see this movie, I had to wonder how it would compare to Fargo. Probably my favorite thing about Fargo was how intensely white everything was, symbolizing the almost sinister benevolence of Fargo towards the hapless people who lived there. The Man Who Wasn't There's big metaphor is just as fun; hair as a symbol of growth. Noteworthy is the fact that Ed Crane's head of hair is the only one that keeps growing throughout the picture. People go to him to get their hair cut; people in general don't want to grow, and it foreshadows him as someone who'd take a life. The traveling salesman is both bald and has an unrealistically full head of hair, suggesting both his supposed amoral behavior in skipping town with the money and his being surprisingly innocent of that offense. The list just goes on. I highly recommend seeing this movie, then seeing it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Failed attempt at something, but not clear what</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the face of it, this is a serious attempt by Joel and Ethan Coen to recreate, in black and white, a 1940s film-noir; or possibly they set out to parody the style for laughs; or then again their main interest may have been to tell a story with existential overtones about a Camusesque "outsider", and noir was just the most suitable filmic style. Whatever the fabulous brothers' intentions, what they have finished up with is a rather self-conscious, pretentious film, with little pace or humour, and which is certainly not a patch on the best crime dramas of the 40s, either in terms of entertainment or underlying "meaning". Billy Bob Thornton plays the emotionally deprived barber, Ed Crane, who is condemned to repeat a task over and over again, like the mythical Sisyphus who rolled a boulder up a hill, only for it to roll down again; except Ed's continual task is to cut hair, which only grows again even, as he reminds us, after death. (Ed's repetitive job is matched by his compulsive chain smoking, which apparently led to Thornton kicking the habit!) Following a chance meeting with someone who a better a judge of character would immediately recognise as a conman, Ed decides to raise $10,000 by blackmailing the man with whom his wife Doris (Frances McDormand) is having an affair. This sets off a chain of events resulting in tragedy all round. The film's glacial atmosphere begins to warms up a little during a sub-plot involving Ed and a young woman (Scarlett Johansson) who he thinks is a budding piano prodigy, though again he proves to be out of touch with reality.As we expect from the Coens, the film has visual interest - including some great shots straight out of German expressionist cinema - and interesting minor characters - especially James Gandolfini as the "other man", and Tony Shalhoub as a big-time defence lawyer. But much of the plot is too absurd for the deadpan treatment it receives, and one longs for the bravura of, say, O Brother, Where Art Thou? or Barton Fink. A disappointment then, but - as Ethan and Joel with their interest in Greek mythology might say - even Homer nods. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ed Crane was there all right. He was in every shot, practically every single frame of "The Man Who Wasn't There." Anchoring every scene, Ed was the compass that the other characters maneuvered around without knowing that he was silently, and unwittingly manipulating their lives. Ed, played with boxed energy, by Billy Bob Thornton is the guy you never notice, at the bank, at the park, at the corner barbershop. Ed doesn't say much, but still waters run as deep as his nicotine habit. His partner, Frank (Michael Badalucco) is as chatty as Ed is tight-lipped. His non-stop banter (like the two old ladies who sat behind me in the theatre) assaulted every silence with good-natured and insufferable banalities. Doris Crane, played pitch perfect by Frances McDormand, is sass and brains, but she too, becomes the accidental victim of Ed's not so brilliant plan. James Gandolfini is able to rid himself of Tony Soprano's mantle as Big Dave, the meaty, menacing, and not as bright as he thinks he is, boss of Doris Crane. Jon Polito is so wonderfully sleazy as the toupee wearing, dirty dry-cleaning entrepreneur, Creighton Tolliver, (don't you just love it?) that you expect his business card to have fingerprints all over it. And Tony Shalhoub as Freddy Riedenschneider, who refers to himself in the third person, is hilarious as a fastidious, self-serving, fast-talking attorney.The Coen brothers love movies. They love to make them, they love to watch them, and the love is contagious. There are some brilliantly staged scenes in The Man Who Wasn't There, all shadows and smoke, and the noirish atmosphere is heavy with the inertia of a man that everyone takes for granted. As the world moves on quickly in one direction Ed travels slowly against the current. Billy Bob Thornton is the picture of actorly restraint as the ordinary guy that becomes tangled in a spider's web of his own creation. The $10,000 Ed asks as a blackmail sum is so meager, even by 1940 standards, that it's as if to say that it isn't about the money. It's about the fun of the chase. And that could be the Coen Brother's motto.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As somebody who is generally a huge fan of Coen films (The Big Lebowski, O Brother, and Miller's Crossing are my personal favorites), I have to admit being disappointed with "The Man Who Wasn't There." Maybe I was expecting too much after all the raves I'd heard. Granted, I'm not much of a fan of classic film noir. So, perhaps my disappointment stems more from personal taste than flaws in the film itself. Whatever the reason, I left the theater a little unsatisfied.The blackmail-scheme-gone-very-wrong storyline is perhaps the best one the Coens have ever produced. This puts the film in stark contrast with their previous project "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" in which I thought the only weakness was related to story. However, what "O Brother" lacked in plot strength, it more than made up for in such things as music, dialogue, humor, and general fun. "The Man Who Wasn't There" is about the farthest thing you can get from fun this side of a root canal.As I'm sure you've heard, the film is excruciatingly slow-moving. I've had fellow Coen Brothers buffs tell me that this is part of its character and is in keeping with the pace of the character it studies. I'm not sure I buy that, though. While I certainly enjoy evaluating films for their artistic integrity and ingenuity, I'm also seeking to be entertained at the cinema. This film wasn't very entertaining and probably won't be very popular with most people outside of arthouse enthusiasts or hardcore Coen fans. In fact, I went with my girlfriend, her sister, and her sister's boyfriend (none of whom are anointed Coen fans as I am) and they were all visibly bored.I think the film could be improved by a quicker pace. After all, the plot is very compelling and certainly kept my attention. But watching "The Man Who Wasn't There" is about like reading an Ayn Rand novel: The story and underlying message are great....but do the creators need to make it such a chore to come about them?</fullReview>

Because that really seems to split the camps. Some will love that one and yet hate this one, etc. I, personally, love BLOOD SIMPLE, FARGO, RAISING ARIZONA and most of THE BIG LEBOWSKI. I think MILLER'S CROSSING &amp; HUDSUCKER PROXY were a mess and even though I loved the old bluegrass soundtrack and some clever bits, I really didn't like O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU. So, I didnt know what to expect on this one. Billy Bob Thornton is perfectly cast with a very difficult role - he has to play a man who is always on the outside, quiet, yet make sure he isn't boring and Thornton pulls that off (watch this man as a seething, psycho druggie in ONE FALSE MOVE, his work in SWINGBLADE and the powerful performance in A SIMPLE PLAN - he's capable of great things). Thornton is surrounded by a strong cast, especially Tony Shaloub. I enjoyed the period feel, the noir touches of the film and the twists and turns almost work. Near the end you can feel the brothers were probably wrestling where to go next and the ending does have a bit of an unsatisfying pay-off, but overall I enjoyed it and the camerawork and the cinematography are simply brilliant.

The name Nirdlinger is that of Phyllis' husband in _Double Indemnity_; another character is named Dedrickson or Dietrick--the name substituted for Nirdlinger in the first movie version. _The Postman Always Rings Twice_ has the plot device of a death house narrative. Both novels focus on fate, the impossibility of escaping it, the irony of how it finally catches up with the protagonist, the stoic acceptance, at the end, of responsibility, and finally the indeterminacy of life and the circumstances which trap, and destroy physically if not spiritually, the everyman protagonist. The film does just fine with these themes. I think the Coen brothers would agree that everyone who likes the film should read these wonderful novels.</fullReview>

This deadpan film noir revolves around a nondescript barber named Ed, whose life is just a little smaller than he hoped, but not much. Ed uses his wife's infidelity to blackmail her lover (and employer), which leads to...well...this IS film noir...Joel Coen sets Billy Bob Thorton (Ed the Barber) in the eye of the storm. The world whirls around Ed, who remains laconic and calm at the center, but you know that trouble is brewing. Without giving too much away, I thought the movie was 20 minutes too long, and could have done without flying saucers, and a certain scene of auto-erotica that seemed just too implausible. Billy Bob Thorton, Frances McDormand and Tony Shalhoub give captivating performances. Joel Coen has some great fun with lighting in Black and White. But like "The Big Lebowski" the Coen Brothers seem unable to resist the temptation to put one too many brushstrokes on the canvas. Worth seeing? Yes, but it could have been better.

		<fullReview>The Coen Brothers once again treat us to a fascinating insight into the world of the 'ordinary man'. Once again extra-ordinary things happen to the common folk and this film does not fail to disappoint. Being in black and white adds atmosphere and the cast, as usual, is first rate with superb performances from Billy Bob and Frances McDormand. The plot is a thick and tasty as you would expect from the Coen Brothers revolving around affairs, murder, ransom demands and a amusing wigs. The film could hardly be described as fast, but its slow and methodical build up is its undoubted forte and this is a film you would not want to miss. The acting is fantastic, the script as original as ever, with the usual dry humour, and the directing quite superb. The atmosphere created in some scenes was just brilliant and it sure beats the lame attempts that "Hollywood blockbusters" have to offer. This is another classic to be added to the Coen collection and a must see film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simplicity at its Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Coen Brothers have an uncanny ability to make simple appear complex. To start with, Ethan Coen directed the actors to perfection. He tackled two pretty much impossible tasks. First, he had James 'Tony Soprano' Gandolfini as a tough guy who somehow didn't mirror his tough guy TV persona. Secondly, he gave Billy Bob Thornton the instruction to simply be, rather than act. His dead pan facial expressions combined with his glum voice over somehow added to the energy of the movie rather than detracted from it. The only real problem I had with the movie was the fact that some of the shots were so unbelievable that I found myself missing some of the Voice over. A great job once again by one of the greatest duos to ever take on Hollywood's main stream and succeed at being themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film, but somehow not satisfying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie. I should say that I am a huge fan of the Coen brothers, and often find myself defending their work. Most of their movies are not immediately accessible. It is not unusual for the movies to get the "cult" label, because people only realize how good they are on a second or third viewing (Big Lebowski, Raising Arizona). I get the feeling that I will feel better about this if I see it again.That said, Billy Bob Thornton delivers an incredible performance. All of the actors are more than capable, but he carries the film. It is his performance and the cinematography that make this film what it is. It may be a little slow for most, but it is this hypnotic pace that establishes the tone of the film. There are some great Coen touches, like the haircuts and some bits of dialogue.Bottom line, this movie is better than 95% of what is out. If you are reading this and haven't seen it, go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another brilliant effort by the Coen brothers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After all these years, I should know better. I should know better than to be surprised by the consistently improving style and talent of the Coen brothers. Abby and Ray. Barton Fink. Norville Barnes. Jerry Lundegaard. The Dude. Ulysses Everett McGill. Has anyone else ever created so many memorable characters?Allow me to introduce you to the Coen brothers' latest character masterpiece, Ed Crane. Ed Crane is a simple, unassuming man, who has lived most of his life in the background. He is a man of few words and even less action, content to observe the world around him. Oh, and did I mention he's a barber?Set in post-WWII Smalltown, USA, The Man Who Wasn't There introduces us to Ed Crane, shortly before his life gets very interesting. Played to deadpan perfection by Billy Bob Thornton, his monotone voice and expressionless face is betrayed only by ever-seeing, ever-recording eyes.Trapped in a passionless marriage to Doris (played by Coen brothers' regular, Frances McDormand) who he is quite certain is cheating on him with his friend Big Dave (Tony Sopr -- err, I mean, Jame Gandolfini), and working with his brother-in-law Frank (The Practice's Michael Badalucco), Ed seems content to just live out his pathetic existence while the rest of the 20th century passes him by.That is until one day when a travelling huckster (another Coen regular, Jon Polito) crosses his barber chair and gets Ed excited about some crazy new idea -- "drycleaning"!! All he needs is a $10,000 investment from a silent partner -- and Ed starts to dream about making it big, just like Big Dave. Well, Ed sets off a scheme to get the money, and as with most Coen brothers' films, that scheme quickly awry, and his every effort to set things straight just makes them worse, yet you get the sense that Ed is enjoying actually living his life, even as he spirals towards inevitable disaster.This movie is simply a delight to watch, the writing is clever, the pacing is near perfection and the casting is as always brilliant, not the least of which lawyer Freddy Riedenschneider (played by Tony Shaloub), another character that won't soon be forgotten.It's a shame that the Coen brothers movies never seem to get "discovered" by the general movie-going public until they get to video, but if the smaller expectations of their movies means that they will continue to be allowed to make this kind of intelligent and fascinating character studies, well, I'm OK with that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If Humbert Humbert was a barber</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Coens prove time and again its OK to be smart in Hollywood. In 1990 they brought the masses Dashiell Hammett, last year they introduced many to Homer, and this year they bring us Vladimir Nabokov dressed up in a film noir over coat. The parallels between Ed Crane and Nabokov's Humbert Humbert are inescapable. Both texts are written from the point of view of a dead man in a jail cell with a heightened awareness of audience; this point of view is immediately problematic in that, in neither works, can the audience trust that the narrator is reliable. Not only do we see an idealized version of Ed Crane's life and his handling of the events leading up to his execution, but both HH and EC encounter a similar parade of characters. Birdy, of coarse, is Dolly, the sexually provocative, forbidden, and despite EC's adoration quite an ordinary Clean Teen. Both are widowed by alcoholic wives whose carelessness is the cause of their demise. And like Quilty, the dry cleaning guy is not only murdered but he is also gay.The point of this film is not for the audience to judge EC's actions, but to appreciate his story as a work of art, his tombstone or signpost in Nabokovian fashion. Because the audience is so frequently attuned to the heightened aesthetic that is characteristic of film noir, it proves to be an effective style to adopt for this tale. Furthermore, Crane preaches to us, in HH-ian fashion, through the mouths of his minor characters. Through the lawyer, we catch a glimpse of the postmodern crisis created by the many ways of seeing; that `the more you looked at it, the less you saw.' Through the eccentric piano teacher, we learn that, unlike the `executive curl', art is imprecise because it must come from the soul. Like HH, EC is a romantic whose life story is crafted with such precision that it reeks of artifice. And while his narrative sounds more like Dashiel Hammet than Harold Bloom, it is clear to me that if Humbert Humbert were a barber, he would be just like Ed Crane.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A quintessential, and yet uncharacteristic, Coen brothers film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In summary, a small-town barber in 1940s Santa Rosa finds his life midway through to be a most unremarkable thing, and can't even seem to get angry about it. Instead, he commits one small crime which he hopes might turn things around for him without causing anyone too much harm. Of course, what always happens in film noir, which this picture is to its very core -- cool, moralistic, and existential in its concerns -- is that in fact harm comes to everyone. And of course, in some way, they all deserve it.Neither Billy Bob Thornton, who stars in this movie, nor Joel and Ethan Coen, who divvy up the producing, writing, and directing credits between them in their usual fashion, have ever been as slow, as quiet, or as downright meditative as their collective work is here. This is paradoxically a quintessential Coen brothers film, and also entirely uncharacteristic of their earlier work. Whereas the Coens tend to revel in violence and a frenetic pace, this is slow-motion film noir, subdued almost to the point of narcosis. If the movie had a heart, it would beat about twice a minute. There is, in fact, only a single scene of on-screen violence, which may be an all-time low for them, and it is nice to see after all this time that they have more in their bag of tricks than only those which go whiz-bang and explode near your face. One thing that persists, though, is the Coens' complete disinterest in realism as an aesthetic notion: everything is stylized, and done so with elements derived entirely from other, earlier movies. This isn't a movie about its characters, or even about another era, so much as it is about that era's own iconography. Every angle is framed and lit to perfection in period style; every line of dialogue was written and then uttered with slavish reverence to the novels and movies which inspired them (see James M. Cain and Dashiell Hammet); there is as much design in the actors' very body language as there is in the patterned wallpaper behind them -- that is to say, lots. One would never confuse The Man Who Wasn't There with any of its movie ancestors like, say, the original versions of The Big Sleep or The Postman Always Rings Twice. The Coens are too self-conscious for that, but they are very deliberately cutting new clothes from antique material. The Coens are masters, though, who only happen to be history buffs, so one doesn't want to complain too much about such things. What their film sets out to do, it does brilliantly. Just when you thought you'd seen all Billy Bob Thornton might be capable of (which wasn't a whole lot), he beautifully pulls off the formidable task of drawing us into the soul of a man who, by all accounts, doesn't really have much of a soul. In the surrounding roles, James Gandolfini, Frances McDormand, Tony Shalhoub, Jon Polito, and Richard Jenkins are all perfect. And Roger Deakins' black and white cinematography is so gorgeous, I would recommend the film to a deaf person.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Like Barber Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have enjoyed all the previous Coen Brothers films in a very good light. I enjoyed this one in a dark light. I do not think that you can conceivably compare their previous work to this picture. Not even, `Fargo.' In many ways this film is the opposite of `O Brother Where Art Thou?' When I left the theater after seeing O Brother, I was upbeat and that movie just made you feel good. This will likely do the opposite. However, don't rule this film out because you think it might lack humor. It doesn't lack humor; it's just not your everyday kind.All in all this film made 1949 seem much more depressing than the Great Depression that was rampant during O Brother. Billy Bob Thornton shines through as Ed Crane, the Barber. By the end of the film, it felt like I was within Crane. The depth of the character is extraordinary. I felt sorry by the end, and walked out into the cold street pondering for a long while after the feature had ended. If I had to give this come kind of rating, it would probably be three out of four stars. It was a very good for a dark, deep film. The Coens offered us something distinctly different from their average menu.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It has been a bad year hasn't it? This film is for Coen Brother fans, film noir buffs and the like. How to classify it? Suspense? Mystery? Drama? Comedy? Nope. I think we'll leave it at Coen brothers.What can I say about Billy Bob Thorton's performance? Restraint, understated...the actor's on downers! Of course I'm reminded that he wasn't there. Frances McDormand was not written an Oscar-winning part but she portrayed her character believably. Tony Shaloub, Michael Badalucco and James Gandalfini provided great contrast and Scarlett Johansson is showing up more and more.But beyond it's cinematography, this film does little more than beat the theme to death. Yes, he wasn't there. I believe it. This could have been a film short and not sacrificed much of the plot development. The Tobacco Institute must have paid for product placement since no brand was featured but I felt the urge to break my 20-year hiatus and return to the habit.Although the man wasn't there, he certainly tried to go, but his attempts were all thwarted by mortality as well as morality. And haven't we all felt transparent at some times in our lives? But besides that, what are the brothers trying to say?Walk, don't run to see this one. It will be there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just a noir, proof that 'noir', is a genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following the release of "Memento", and the social impact cause by the events of September 11th of this year, it is obvious now that with the release of "The Man Who Wasn't There", noir is in the frame to stay.Pathology? Castration? Social disfunction? Fort-da? Jouissance? --yes, yes, yes, yes, and, oh, by the way, yes.I hate to say it, but I think Schrader's assessment is now officially defunct. The only question for me which remains: Why in the world does that style of expressionism, darkness, and disorientation still act as the fall-back hallmark of the pieces bound by other story-related conventions in the works of the films noir? It's almost not fair....because most of us wouldn't have it any other way, regardless of the reason.The performances in this piece are second-to-none, and I now understand why Thornton said it was the toughest role he's ever played. What incredible sense of the natural and subtety by young Johanssen. Watching her inate grip of sensitivity, and curiousity, is near mind-blowing. (no punn intended) Now there's an actor with a future. Finally, I have to say that as a LONG TERM COEN LOVER, I simply don't know how they will continue to outdo and grow....with the full and disturbing understanding that they will. I rank this film with "Miller's" and "Barton", films which I felt knocked a wall down. Ambrosia, pure and simple.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Similar to "The Outsider"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the movie yesterday and loved it. I am surprised with the user comments since nobody mentioned the similarities of the movie with the book "The Outsider" (or "The Stranger") by Albert Camus.Ed Crane is very similar with Meursault (the hero of Camus in "The Outsider") as a guy who is condemned by society because he doesn't play the game. Both of them are outsiders living in their own fringe, solitary lives. In both stories, society wants to make life as easy as can be, making up lies so that everything can run smoothly because absolute truth can hurt sometimes.The Cohen brothers didn't copy Albert Camus in the film but I believe that they were influenced. An example of differences is the fact that Ed Crane is much less self-aware of his life (although he has some glimpses) than Meursault. It needs an expert to compare the movie with the book and assess whether the film is influenced by Camus or not. Definitely I am not one! I just outlined some thoughts about commonalities between the two. I hope I am not misunderstood here.I definitely recommend reading the book of Albert Camus if you saw the film and vice versa.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At last! A Coen Brothers movie I found fully satisfying! An obvious cinematic send-up of film noir (very funny) and at the same time a consideration of the existential state of an invisible man, of misguided ambition that leads to convoluted tragedy and unforeseen consequences. The black and white images are stunningly expressive (after all, movies are a visual medium). Billy Bob Thornton as the almost catatonic barber (Everyman?), Ed Crane, is brilliant. Even Frances McDormand, who usually leaves me cold, gives a dead-on performance. Hard to find fault with any of the actors in the wonderful array of oddballs.My only complaint about this marvelously conceived and executed film is that the "auteurs" were so in love with their ideas they over-stepped the bounds and chose not to end it at the most affecting moment - when Ed Crane sits on his Sears-like sofa, realizing how completely alone he is after the full tragedy has taken place.Nonetheless, by all means, see this fine film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>wow. you have to see this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading reviews of this film on imdb and other magazines, this film certainly seemed to be worth a watch. So a friend and I went to the local to watch the film. Normally the most talkative pair, me and my friend, managed to reach pizza hut, barely without a word to each other(a good 5 minute walk).Many people seem critical of the voice over, especially the fact tha it was done in a monotone voice. However, as we have seen in scorcese films such as goodfellas and casino, the voiceover can be used extremely effectively. Had the voiceover been animated, this would have spoilt the feel of the film, as this man(Ed Crane- played by Billy Bob Thornton) certainly was "the man who wasnt there".The main attribute to this film has to be the outstanding acting of Billy Bob Thornton. I had not seen any of his previous films and been so impressed that I remembered his performance, but this was a performance of extreme note, and perhaps on of the best I have ever seen. He fitted perfectly into the role, and there was not even 1 line which I think he delivered badly - something which I have never been able to say before about a performance!The direction also was stunning. The black and white fitted in with the era but also in a way managed to emphasise the flatness of his life. The camera angles, and the use of shadows to emphasise characters was extremely effective.The amazing thing about this film is that when asked what it is about I am not able to say anything more than that it is about the life of a barber. The film follows his nothingless life, and the story has nothing of note in it. However as a complete film it leaves you stunned and amazed, and even moved! This film has various amusing passing comments and ironic turns in story, all of which add to the noiree feeling of the film.I can perhaps see how some of the more uneducated and unappreciative among us could find this film dull, bu this is only because they have completely missed the whole point of the film, and have failed to appreciate the art of a true feat in storytelling and direction.**DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THE FACT THAT THIS FILM IS ON A NEAR LIMITED RELEASE. THIS IS A MUST SEE - FOR THOSE THAT APPRECIATE THE ART OF CINEMA.Great film9.5/10Tom</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am somewhat embarrassed to confess that this is the first Coen brothers film I have seen. After such a fantastic cinematic experience, I will certainly be viewing more. This film is so different from the standard fare that movie-goers are currently offered, that it ought to be viewed more as a work of art than as a picture. It is superbly nuanced and despite it's length (some two hours), I hardly noticed the time.If you enjoy action in your films, this may not be for you, but I found it a highly original and artistic piece of film-making, which saw the best direction I can remember seeing in the past couple of years. Not many films could get away with being in black and white these days, but it is not even an effort for the clearly gifted Coen brothers.Film Noir is something of a lost art. This fittingly titled picture delivers a portrait of a man who has ambition and yet doesn't have what is inside. The evaluation of Birdy's musical ability seems in some ways to relate to Ed. He hits the right notes and yet they do not come from the soul.I won't give any of the plot away, but if ever you thought that from a single action an individual's world can be turned upside down, then this, while never seeming far fetched, will prove you wrong. Also, I had never considered myself to be a fan, but Billy Bob Thornton is exceptional.Everything here is intentional. It's just great. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's a carpet of deceit and corruption that lies under almost every act, even of a simple barber.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't quite figured out why I love film noir, but the Coen Brothers make me remember some of the reasons. Cinematographer Roger Deakin drenches the shots in vivid black and white, reminding me of noir's diet of good and evil, like a virginal young musician who suprisingly goes down on Billy Bob Thornton's Ed to reward him for trying to help her, thus precipitating an almost deadly accident because of the reward.And then the voiceover, so filled with wisdom and dread as Billy Bob navigates between his private crime and its waves of consequences. Or simply the carpet of deceit and corruption that lies under almost every act, even of a simple barber.But for me noir and memory collide in that barbershop, the porcelain pure 40's world, lovingly recreated here with the requisite hierarchy of first and second chairs, paralleling the classical music motif of the film. The hush of Ed's crime as he trims or buzzes the blonde-haired, blue-eyed innocents, so much like me in my grandfather's Rochester shop, reminds me that underneath Grandpa's bright checkered floor an elaborate numbers racket flourished without a sound. The Coens recreate atmosphere with enviable success.How to justify their outrageous alien visitation motif I don't know other than Ed keeps thinking he doesn't belong in this world, and he does ruminate on the mystical property of hair growth. He's an outrider.The usual Coen barnyard of eccentric characters is here, such as Ed's double-crossing dry cleaning partner; they all could have easily arrived by flying saucer.Tony Shalhoub as Doris's lawyer is an over-the-top, overachieving combination of Johnny Cochran and F. Lee Bailey, but he is mesmerizing when he blathers about new strategies of knowing like circumstantial evidence and its sister, reasonable doubt. In one of Shaloub's scenes, shafts of light beam from the ceiling in a loving homage to `Citizen Kane.' Classy Coens in the right company.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coen Brothers, Where Art Thou?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I left this film feeling somewhat numb and disappointed. It seems that since'The Big Lebowski' the Coen Brothers have begun to lose the plot. This proved that in a very literal sense.'Oh Brother....' was far too episodic and overly reliant on its pseudo-literary origins to really engage with the viewer. Similarly, 'The Man who....' (not the Travis album) derives its plot almost entirely from 'Double Indemnity' right down to the closing scene which is an exact copy of 'Indemnity's original down-beat conclusion.'The Man Who....' is most similar to Fargo in tone, but what makes the latter a more satisfactory experience is the breadth of characterisation present. For every cold-hearted William H. Macy, you have a warm-hearted Frances McDormand to melt the icy cynicism of her surroundings. If you set about making a character study of a heartless, one-dimensional, middle-aged nobody, then at least surround him with realistic, well-drawn supporting roles.'The Hudsucker Proxy', 'Barton Fink' and even 'The Big Lebowski' succeeded in being intellectually rewarding without relying on a monotonous voice-over to ram home a message to the viewer. Instead they made use of the Coen's capacity for visual metaphor and subtley drawn narratives, alluding to cinema's past without blatantly plagiarising it. 'The Man Who....' just seemed to lack that subtelty. As a result it appeared deliberately one-dimensional and wilfully pretentious in its philosophical leanings. Maybe that's the idea. Very post-modern. Very 'clever'. Lets hope their next film is one for the fans and not one for the critics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Command Performance from Thornton in Dark Coen Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains Spoilers "The Man Who Wasn't There" is the best film noir Hollywood has offered since Pleasantville (1998), but that may not be saying much. The problem is the film lacks punch and takes too long in developing its dark main point about a plain-spoken barber (Thornton) who just can't seem to get noticed.Thornton's barber Frank Kane is about as quiet and shy as they come. While other barbers cut hair, chat, cut hair, and gossip some more, Kane just cuts hair. He tells you that in the film.Kane isn't dumb though. He notices things. He notices for example, the four or five specific cuts he applies to kids and whether he has cut their hair. He knows his clientele.Kane also notices that his wife Doris (Frances McDormand) is having an affair with Big Dave Brewster (played by James Gandolfini of "The Sopranos). Kane wants to get back at them and devises a scheme where he can blackmail Dave out of ten thousand dollars and pay for an investment venture on dry cleaning. (Keep in mind this is set in the 50's, so that isn't such a bad idea back then)So everything's going fine until something goes wrong... Dave gets killed and Doris is blamed. But Kane knows who did it and he's not exactly telling.The plot is fairly straightforward but the film does a lot with point of view. It's not who committed the crime that is interesting, but, like in any Coen brothers' film, in the characters. The most interesting character is of course Thornton.Not unlike Henry Fonda's character in another film noir, Alfred Hitchcock's "The Wrong Man," The Coens show how a plain, quiet generally uninteresting character can be extremely interesting in being ordinary. That is what is so incredible about Thronton's performance. He is straightlaced throughout. Never has much emotion, even when he finds out his wife is having an affair. He doesn't seem to care that much on the surface.Perhaps what keeps us so intrigued is that we are so clueless why. Why doesn't he act like he cares. But when you watch Thornton's performance, it's obvious he does, that he plays a conniving character who feels plenty of emotions-- just none he expresses.But the film, all in black and white, misses its own point. If Frank is so interesting for being unnoticed, for just fitting in, why then near the end of the film is he so important then? Why is he noticed then?The Coens seem to drive just up to the edge of brilliance but then drop right off the cliff. The Coens-- so incredible in their story in Miller's Crossing and Fargo--- so off in their story in The Big Lebowski-- give you half of one here. It's almost brilliant, but not enough. But expect Thornton to be up for an Oscar nomination for his performance. If you like great acting, watch him. It's there. But even with a good script and a strong supporting cast, you still walk out of the film wishing there was more (or less) to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Coens continue to defy expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is the new Coen Brothers movie? A black comedy? An homage to film noir? A showcase for some really bad hairpieces? Essentially, what you get is a beautifully shot and constructed film, more in the vein of BARTON FINK and BLOOD SIMPLE than the last couple Coen flicks. There are several moments of pure, orgasmic moviegoing pleasure--the fight between Billy Bob Thornton and James Gandolfini ranks as one of the Coens' best scenes ever. However, the movie hits that point about halfway through where it veers off into foreign territory and never quite comes back. As soon as Katherine Borowitz shows up, babbling about space aliens, the tight little thriller verges into obtuseness. Still, even an average Coen Brothers film beats any other movie out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nip It In The Bud</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About half way through this thing, it hit me. Who does Billy Bob Thornton remind me of? Who is he doing? Barney! Barney Fife! As in 'nip it in the bud.' Skinny as a rail, dark protruding eyes and lips and completely inept. Living a life of quiet angst in a small, sleepy town with a lot of shade trees.The newest film from those Coen Brothers, Joel and Ethan, via USA Films, has an awful title, `The Man Who Wasn't There,' starring chameleon, Billy Bob Thornton. This is his story, delivered in a monotone voice-over. Narration throughout a film usually means trouble, like they blinked 'cause they couldn't keep the plot together. Not this time. This film is all about trouble but it's not on the screen, it's bubbling just beneath the surface.Billy Bob is Floyd the barber, no wait, he's Ed the barber telling us a tale of life in 1949 America when men wore hats and ties. Women wore hats too plus stocking with seams and their shoes matched their bags. Order out of chaos. It's very difficult to present the recent past accurately, don't fear, the Coens have done it again. The details of this modest-budget production are meticulous. And the details of the plot have more twists and turns than Highway One. Just enjoy the ride.The dark themes are typical for a Joel-Ethan script and they are played for laughs; murder, adultery, embezzlement, aliens and the electric chair. Tee hee. And mercifully, no rock and roll. Only Beethoven, who hasn't been this scary since Clockwork Orange, me droogies.Coen cohort, Roger Deakins shot this on color negative and printed it in black and white presenting images with all the uncomfortable elegance as Diane Arbus photo book. In a word, gorgeous. Deakins says they took visual inspiration from noir classics like Shadow of a Doubt and Double Indemnity but the soul of the film is strictly The Postman Always Rings Twice and the look and sound of it echoes Call Northside 777. The scenes with Tony Shaloub, mostly in silhouette, are very Citizen Kane.The Coens love actors. Like a lot of directors, Joel C. is in love with his leading lady and puts the same actress in all his films. But unlike a lot of other directors, he's actually married to the woman and so far hasn't traded her in for a progressively younger version with each new effort. Someone please stop David Lynch.Frances MacDormand is this film's femme fatale, Doris. Smoking, soaking, drunkenly swerving and sleeping it off. More gorgeous. And another Coen regular, Jon Polito (known also for Barry Levinson's TV Homicide) quietly owns the screen even when he's submerged. Other actors who primarily work on the small screen, Michael Badalucco (ABC's The Practice) and James Gandolfini (HBO's The Sopranos) shine like silver.Again, this is Ed's story and it's a ghost story, that's why the man isn't there. But what is there is great. I can just hear Andy now. 'You beat everything, Barney, d'you know that? You just beat everything.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The true "ghost world" - Coens at their best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a great NY Times article about how this film is really about a living ghost that can explicate this film and Ed Crane far better than I ever could. But I think all the complaints about boredom, slow pace, and lack of vitality are completely off the mark. The Coens obviously were making a point about spiritually drained people who let themselves float through life until they make fatal decisions. Billy Bob's understated acting is so deceptively simple - unattentive viewers might not see how deeply felt and modulated the performance is. Also, this is the most gorgeous looking film I've seen in many a moon. Roger Deakins continues to prove he's one of the greatest DPs around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visual Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story involves a barber looking to break his life of monotony and when he does, his behavior barely surpasses an uncomfortable eye shift. Billy Bob Thorton spends the entire movie reacting to the things around him, as if he were not really there; however, he's in 99% of the scenes (it's okay - he's narrating during his off-camera time). His performance is extraordinary. Frances McDormand and James Gandolfini live up to their expected stellar performances and joining their praises are Michael Badalucco, Tony Shalhoub and Scarlett Johansson.Roger Deakins has outdone himself again as the cinematographer for this black and white visual masterpiece. His work can also be seen in Fargo and The Shawshank Redemption. Every shot of this movie was beautifully captured. From cigarette smoke to the light that strikes through the interrogation room, every frame of film could easily be framed as a photograph. The choice of black and white is not arbitrary or gimmicky; it's metaphorical and places us in the mindset of early America. This film will no doubt win best cinematography at the Oscars. It's brilliant but does not get in the way of the characters or the story.This is an upscale Coen brothers movie, ranking with Fargo because of its spectacular ensemble cast and the zany touches of its "everyday" characters. There's even an alien abduction subplot thrown in that brings to mind the similarly daring plot detour in Fargo, when Marge's asian classmate comes to visit her in the restaurant.Do yourself a favor and see this one on the big screen; it's worth it for the visuals alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film noir homage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This black and white 40s noir homage to James M Cain, relates the story of a barber (Thornton) who blackmails his wife's lover (McDormand as the wife and Gandolfini as the lover) to buy into a partnership (with Polito) to start a dry cleaners (his ambitions simply have no limit!). The remainder of the film charts the consequences of that action. A subplot also has him trying to encourage his friend's schoolgirl daughter to success as a musician, so that he can manage her. Like Cain's novels the film is about ordinary people doing extraordinary things and usually losing. Whilst it has similarities with Fargo in terms of subject matter, and Miller's Crossing in terms of setting, dialogue and style, it has important differences. Despite the thrillerish plot, it deliberately avoids moving quickly or suspensefully. Instead it concentrates on the slow and stupid thoughts and movements of the main character and thus moves more slowly than you would expect from the premise, into an ever-downward spiral. The subplot, though largely superfluous to the main plot, does accentuate the loser streak in Thornton and manages a quick homage-with-a-twist to Lolita at the same time. The highlights are the photography, the acting (especially from Thornton, Gandolfini and Tony Shalhoub - as a shyster defence lawyer)and, on the whole, the plot. However, great though this film is, it's not as good as my personal Coen brother favourites, "Fargo" and "Miller's Crossing". One of the problems was the slow pace, although I appreciate that this was intentional and I was in a cinema without air conditioning on a hot night. Also the pace is explained with a good joke at the end of the film. More problematic are the plot holes surrounding the trial scenes towards the end of the film that slightly spoil the ending. In all, however, an excellent film (and better than either "O brother where art thou" or "Big Lebowski").</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Kind of Men are They?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems the Coens have made this movie in response to their critics concern about meaning. It is an established fact (beyond doubt) that the Coens are some of the most brilliant, innovative, daring film-makers currently at work. But while their flair for story, character and cinematic je ne sais quoi is impeachable, many critics and fans alike come away thinking, 'sure, but what the hell did it all mean?'Is it possible that the Coens are making monkeys out of us? What exactly are these stories, so overflowing with cryptic imagery, about??The duck tattoo in 'Raising Arizona'? The hat in 'Miller's Crossing'? The box in 'Barton Fink'? The blind prophet of 'Oh Brother'? What does it all mean? Close analsis off the films only proves futile. It is as though the Brothers are giving us beautiful jigsaw puzzle pieces and laughing as we try to fit the irreconcilable pieces together.'The Man Who Wasn't There' goes some way to finally exploding this running joke. It deals, up front and specifically, with meaning, or rather our inability to create meaning from the confusion surrounding us.Tony Shaloub's lawyer character has a long speech about the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. He says (twice) that to look at something closely in search of meaning is a waste of time, that the more you look, the less sense things make.This is as close as we have ever come to the heart of the Coens' movies. Don't look too close, they are saying, because if you scratch the surface you will fall through the tear. Don't strain your brain. Just sit back and enjoy the ride, relish the enigma, and for Chrissake don't ask any difficult questions.Which, in my opinion, is a bit of a cop-out. What are movies for? What are artists for? To ask questions? Maybe. To give answers? I would prefer to think so.'The Man Who Wasn't There' is a brilliant film, because the Coens have exercised their usual meticulous control over camera, script and performances. Their trademark humour is there in abundance, as are the grotesques and dislocations we have come to love.But as for answers, 'The Man Who Wasn't There' falls horribly short. It is a riddle with no solution, a childish trick, an illusion, 'full of sound and fury yet signifying nothing'.The Coens are laughing harder than ever and would laugh even harder if they read this. Their references to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle are a very clever touch, and are a clear attempt to excuse their failings. But failings they are, and they prevent a brilliant film from ever becoming great.The Coens are in danger of drifting into the kind of wilful obtuseness that distinguishes David Lynch's worst excesses. The fact that they seem content to do so is a sad and sorry admission that they have no answers</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm heartened to see the vast majority of users admiring this fine piece of work from the Coens. For those few complaining about the slow pace of the film, I suggest either ritalin or a steady stream of Jerry Bruckheimer movies. This is a gem that will generate alot of thought and feeling long after the film is over. In technical/cinematic aspects, it is the Coens and their collaborators (esp DP Roger Deakins) most accomplished film. But it is also a summation, crystalization of the central recurring theme in all of their films. I refer back to a line from the Big Lebowski: "sometimes you hit the bar, sometimes the bar hits you" (I might not be exact). Basically, the Coens are fixated on men who are put in extraordinary circumstances &amp; carried along a strange wild path by life. At some point, they have the opportunity to just passively roll along or make active decisions altering the course. Most of the time these characters make the wrong choices that spiral out of control - which begs the question in this film "what kind of man are you?" Despite the crazy circumstances that sometimes throw us for curves in life, we still need to actively define our character and make positive decisions. As one viewer correctly surmised - this is classic existentialism done with panache and dark humor - Coens style.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie, I found it to be the Coens best work since Fargo &amp; was relieved to see them taking both their characters and themselves seriously again. On the surface, it appears to be an elegant ode to the past with painstaking period detail and gorgeous b &amp; w cinematography. To be sure, there are specific nods to Hitchcock (it's even set in the same year and town as Shadow of a Doubt) and the Coens' perennial favorite author James M. Cain. But this film seemed to speak to the present - Americans have just enjoyed a period of exceptional prosperity, yet there is a palpable moral/spiritual vacuum beneath the surface. After 9-11, somehow these themes seem to cut deeper. Perhaps, that's just me feeling things more deeply, but it would please me greatly if the American public embraced this melancholy, beautiful morality tale. I should also mention it features an astonishing lead performance by Billy Bob Thornton. Someone else complained that Billy Bob seemed to sleepwalk and that the film was "boring." That was a viewer not paying close attention to the subtle modulations of what I think is one of Thornton's most moving performances.</fullReview>

Basically following his intuition proving why he is one of the top DP's working in the world. A simple elegant look to a dark comedy. It is pure throwback to another era of cinema, yet keeps a foot in the present.Billy Bob is really honing himself to become one of the top film actors and his deadpan performance here drives the plot down the curvy road of twists and turns that the Coen brothers have created a brand name with.Frances McDormand gives another stellar performance(like FARGO) along with the rest of the ensemble.I'll never feel the same about shaving ever again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coens return to top form!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit I'm likely to be in the minority, but I'm a big fan of the Coens and was disappointed by O Brother Where Art Thou. Granted it was impeccably crafted and had great music &amp; some amusing moments. But overall it seemed a bit too arch and pointless for my tastes. Which is why I am extremely pleased to report that the Coens have returned to the form by becoming serious again. The Man Who Wasn't There is throwback to classic 40s film noir. The script recalls classic James M. Cain &amp; Billy Bob Thornton uncannily resembles Bogart (physically and in his economical delivery). The beautiful b &amp; w work of ace DP Roger Deakins may represent a career high (and considering the astonishing quality of his work - that's saying ALOT) &amp; easily gives the seminal work of John Alton in the 40s and 50s (T-Men, The Big Combo) a run for its money as the best b &amp; w noir cinematography ever seen. What I was most grateful to see was the sober, existential tone of the film that largely skirted smirking, smug post-modern irony. Sure, there are plenty of oddball, surreal touches and the Coens' idiosyncratic sensibility is most assuredly present. But, the film and the filmmakers are definitely taking it seriously this time. The hero (or anti-hero)'s dilemma may harken back to classic noir heros of the 40s but he also reflect contemporary malaise.</fullReview>

"Man Who Wasn't There" is a striking noir picture (featuring unbelievable black-and-white cinematography by Roger Deakins) that is marvelously deadpan and low-key, and features one of Billy Bob Thornton's best performances to date. (The film makes good use of his laconic presence, to say nothing of his craggy features -- he's almost a cross between Sterling Hayden and Rondo Hatton.)Look for Tony Shalhoub's showy performance as a slick, big-city attorney to snag an Oscar nomination -- that's not necessarily a compliment, but it's the kind of big acting the Academy loves.I haven't liked a Coen brothers effort since the glory days of "Blood Simple" and "Raising Arizona," but this is a film I would rank with those two gems.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is rare to sit openmouthed at a film, which not only ties so many elements together so artfully but manages to engage every sense and every fiber of your being. I sat and watched a movie unfold before me that was not only one of the best film-noir movies, but has a story that is so engaging and so spot on that I wanted to sit through it from beginning to end as soon as the film ended. The cinematography was amazing, the use of shadows and light and the crispness of the black and white was impeccable. The story never got tedious or boring, you were grabbed the whole time, and the acting was so first rate that you did not typecast the characters in your head. James Galdofini was not Tony Soprano, Billy Bob Thornton was not remotely like any other character he ever played. In other words, this film has legs, and one experiences sensory overload of the best sense, in that it is hard to process all the good stuff that is going on onscreen.In short, this is a film for the average man, this is a film for film schools and universities to study, this is a film that is the cream that rises over the dogpile that passes for American cinema these days.When the film comes out on DVD, i am going to bite the bullet and by a player and 10 copies to give to friends and strangers. And when it gets into general release i've already promised all my friends i am going to drag them into the cinema, even if i have to pay.Best film of the year, and perhaps of any other year.</fullReview>

Frances McDormand gives a respectable performance as a conniving adulteress, but the real hidden gem here is Billy Bob Thornton who gives a terrific performance as a humble barber who blackmails the man (played by James Gandolfini) who is having an affair with his wife (McDormand) and may possibly have something to do with his untimely death.This movie was recently screened at the Cannes Film Festival to which it received rave reviews and a warm reception.

The unhappy barber knows life has passed him by, but he is so passionless and shortsighted that he can't see a way out. He allows himself to be victimized and manipulated by his friends, his wife, and his own weaknesses. But for some reason, we root for him to get out of all this. He is, in some respects, deserving but in others an idiot foil so common to the wonderfully creative Coens. As he weaves his tangled web, Thornton is filled with sickness. He truly feels he deserves more but every move leads to more despair. This is done in eye popping black and white and really takes off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this film is deceptively simple at the beginning, almost like there are plot-holes but I think this is part of the theme that develops. Life is sometimes about how people see what they want to see, doesn't matter what the truth is, and the speech about the 'uncertainty principle' by the lawyer with the huge appetite for success and food underlines this. I enjoyed this scene and the direction in this part was fun.It also seemed a bit predictable in places, like when Big Dave calls and tells him to come to the shop, and also when Doris doesn't appear in court, but again I think this is on purpose, to kind of reflect life.The predictability is upturned nicely however with the alien references which are quite interesting, starting when the grieving wife shows up at the door in a creepy hat and with a far-out alien abduction story. I like the way it highlights the era of UFO sightings, and then when the film was released was when Scientology reference started becoming a household theory. Im not sure why he (dreams he) sees them just before he is sent to the chair. It was almost like it would be a preferable place to go.BBT did a great job and I just wonder how many cigarettes he had to smoke while filming. It's no wonder he narrated like a double bass. If you have to shoot one scene 15 times that's 15 cigarettes in as many hours. But he seemed to be enjoying each and every one so it's good testament to his acting. I thought the business man was a great actor, he gave me the comic relief, I would have liked a bit more story-time with him.I'm a Coen Brother fan, as are so many people who watch their films so I feel bad giving a 6 but there was just something missing in this one. Even though it is a dramatic storyline I thought the film didn't portray any kinda feeling. It reminded me of the film 'A Simple Man', also by the Coen's, where the male lead character was very quiet, got pushed around, seemed to take what life gives. They are both films I would watch again to draw more from them.</fullReview>

You would think, having killed someone, he would try to keep it quiet.

Nobody checked the fingerprints on the murder weapon, which he left at the scene of the crime? 5) Billy Bob is only guilty of one crime, and that is blackmail, which is not a hanging offense. In film noir, people deserve their fate, and he should not die for it.6) Billy Bob was acting in self defense when he killed Big Dave. This was never brought up. Big Dave was strangling him.7) Billy Bob obviously did not kill the salesman. If he had, he would not have left the contract in the car with him, with his name on it.8) There is nothing illegal about investing in dry cleaning. Why would the police assume that Billy Bob would invest in his venture, and then kill the salesman, before he could get the dry cleaning business going? And like I said, leave the contract in the car? By the way, I don't really understand the spoiler concept, but this contains spoilers, so I warned you. I never read these until I've finished watching the movie. Why would anyone?</fullReview>

It is a remarkable story about Ed Crane (played by Billy Bob Thornton), a very quiet barber in the midst of a very gabby brother in law co-barber. The twists and turns in this film are intriguing to say the least. Frances McDormand plays Doris, Ed's wife with her usual acting perfection. And James Gandolfini is Big Dave, the boss for whom she works. Scarlett Johansson is Birdy Abundas, a young and promising piano student who mesmerizes Ed's character. The treatment of the cinema in black and white is outstanding. Tony Shaloub's performance as Freddy Riendenschneider, the crooked lawyer suits him perfectly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In their first full out black and white feature, the Coen brothers dared to do what very few directors would want or even attempt to do; make a modern-day film noir. Shot in shimmering colorless photography, all that is left are the sets, the shadows and the actors. Really, that is all that is needed to affect and engage the audience if those three elements are done well. Here, they are as we follow Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thornton), a chain-smoking barber moving through life at the slowest pace possible; without a pulse it seems. He finds something different and somewhat exciting to do with his life when he decides to blackmail his wife and her lover for money in order to become silent partner to an entrepreneur.Like most film noir, ordinary people attempt certain things and it almost never works out, usually leading to someone's demise. Here, the plot seems almost an afterthought as the the look and feel of the film takes center stage. Without color, all that is left is the shadows, heavily taking up the background and plunging all into darkness. We also get great performances by Thornton, who really tones his usual personification down, Frances McDormand, James Gandolfini, Michael Badalucco, and Tony Shaloub. Still, the Coens dominate every frame with their typical cynical look at human nature and the way it contorts itself so wildly to change the situation it is in. Adding this gorgeous cinematography was just a bonus for the story that is eye-grabbing and completely engrossing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the film that wasn't there</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this film has all the right ingredients but somehow the sum of the parts makes up for a curiously unsatisfying whole. it looks good, has a an interesting storyline, good script, some great acting - but - WHAT is missing? i really can't put my finger on it. perhaps it is just too slick. oh and there is far too much voice-over. billy bob thornton's character doesn't say much to the other characters but that is no excuse to have his thoughts over-punctuating the film - he has such a fantastic face it would have been enough to let THAT do all the talking. his character is curiously absent but has a slightly surreal way of viewing the world and that is quite enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quirky in a Good Way, but Ending Still Falls Flat.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Man Who Wasn't There" was almost an interesting film noir style production, but the ending still left me disappointed.The acting by Billy Bob Thornton and the other realistic characters makes the movie interesting &amp; quirky, the cinematography was also excellent, and it brings back memories of real 1940-50s characters. Thornton's character seems to hold a mysterious strength to remain optimistic about his future even when his past holds no evidence of increased success around the next corner. I really liked "Fargo" and have to compare this Coen Brothers production to what I think was a very entertaining movie through to the end. I also kept wishing the movie was in color (similar to the Aviator) even if very muted, and feel the significant extra effort could have been worthwhile &amp; innovative.Although I can appreciate experimenting with script ideas, I was disappointed with the ending of this story just as with "No Country for Old Men", because I enjoyed the rest of both movies. I would like to see a return to a more traditional (Fargo style) endings, because I can't see this flat, pointless ending style ever living up to the rest of the story. Even the "Fargo" ending was a stretch with a pregnant "Margie" approaching a secluded house alone with potentially two cold blooded killers inside, and armed with only a .38, but it was within the realm of possibility and somehow put the killers in their place as common criminals, while "Margie" just did her job. Film noir usually ends with some form of justice, even if the "hero" is not better off than where he started. Thornton's character was neither very heroic or very guilty, just a regular bored guy who tried to gain some justice for himself in a convoluted way, but never deserved the death penalty he was dealt.In this case, I want to root for the movie, but I do not get any satisfaction from finding that, in the end, any sense of justice is denied, ignored, or completely fouled up. The ending seems truncated in a strange place, that feels very wrong and flat to me, instead of adding a convincing "life is never fair" element that I think was the goal. For most of the viewers, the facts that "life is not fair" and boring much of the time, is not news, and what we are trying to escape thinking about for a couple of hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A quite different film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blood Simple, the Coen brothers' first film, was a loving tribute to the noir genre. Seventeen years later, they return to similar territory with The Man Who Wasn't There, another wonderful postmodern mixture of genres and moods executed with the brothers' trademark style and wit.In an effort to make it seem like a straightforward noir, two essential ingredients are present: black-and-white cinematography (once again, kudos to Roger Deakins) and narration. That this is a quite unusual take on the genre emerges from the fact that the narration contains many humorous moments, especially when haircuts are discussed. This happens because the film's protagonist is a barber, a lonely man named Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thornton). Every day he observes what happens around him without caring that much, since he finds his life monotonous and wants more from it. As such, when he meets an eccentric businessman (Jon Polito) with a bizarre proposal, he immediately accepts it. At the same time, he also suspects his wife (Frances McDormand) is having an affair with her employer (James Gandolfini) and blackmails them in secret, causing a chain reaction that is very unlikely to end well.The Man Who Wasn't There has all the elements of classic noirs - the detached main character, the brooding narration, the adulterous spouse, and of course a tragic outcome. What sets it apart from its obvious inspirations is how the Coen brothers use these elements, suiting them to their quirky imagination. The story never gets as weird as Fargo or The Big Lebowski, but those looking for a straightforward genre picture might be disappointed. Then again, what could they expect from those who gave us the aforementioned modern classics? As is tradition with the Coens, the screenplay oozes excellence all around, the delicious dialogue finding its perfect ally in a solid cast: Thornton, always good in quieter roles, is a spot-on leading man, while Polito, Gandolfini and other supporting players (Scarlett Johansson, Richard Jenkins, Tony Shalhoub) add their own special something to the movie's peculiar atmosphere.Yes, it's slow at times. Yes, it can be off-putting for those not familiar with the Coen universe. But it's also an exhilarating, enchanting piece of cinema, worth seeing if you're in the mood for something special.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't remember much marketing of this film when it came out, and I stumbled upon it during one of my "nothing on TV" nights - but I am so glad I did. This is a truly under-watched film - a Cohen Brothers film through and through of black comedy &amp; film noir.Black Comedy?!? You bet. I found myself chuckling at parts...you're actually are supposed to chuckle at, and then become emotionally torn at parts that you wont see coming. That's a Cohen brothers staple, that and the quirky-almost real life characters.Ed Crane (Billy-Bob Thorton) is a ..."quiet man". Usually, those are the ones we see running a muck on the evening news doing something so horrific, you never believe it. So is the case here. He's a barber, married to the bookkeeper (Frances McDormond) of the town's hoity-toity stores - Nerdlingers (come on, the name alone deserves a chuckle!). Ed works in the barbershop with his wife's brother - who can't stop talking for a moment (Cohen's mainstay Michael Badalucco who's always great in their films!) One day, opportunity walks through the door of the barbershop - and this sparks a 'fire' in Ed we come to find out has been dead for years. Dead...not "non-existant". That's the paradox of Ed Crane. But it also puts events into motion that makes this a twisted tale of greed, money, mayhem &amp; pathos that only the Cohen Brothers could make in this manner.One of the characters that comes along later in the story, the hot-shot, overly expensive attorney Freddie played by Tony Shalhoub, is marvelous, and is my favorite of the film. Listen to what he says as he puts together his defense strategies. And his scenes are dramatically lit - hits right on the film noir genre.Scarlett Johnansen is just adorable as the 'sweet little innocent piano playing' teen "Birdy" - but what I found even more interesting was the short but pivotal part played by Adam Alexi-Malle as Jacques Carcanogues. Everyone is a critic and his critique of Birdy is quite ingenious for if you listen closely you can get whats coming later before it surprises you.There are tons of parts like these from James Gandolfini to Christopher McDonald that garner your interest as they are each important to unveiling the life of Ed Crane and those around him. Ed is not a complex man, just a quiet one. He didn't live a complex life, just a deceptive one.One more thing I adore about this film is its "quietness." Beethoven's underlying score ads to the film immensely, but this quietness speaks volumes as well. Again, a truly under-watched film - and I hope movie lovers find this and fall in love with it as I have.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ed Crane is Everyman. It's tempting to project celebrities of the era on Billy Bob Thornton's appearance and portrait of a nondescript barber who repeatedly, abjectly re-introduces himself to friends, family and acquaintances throughout the film. It's tempting because he really does resemble Bogart, Cooper, Clift, Dean and Ozzie Nelson (my money's on Edward R. Murrow), but he's different. Ed Crane moves through this film like an emotional damping field composed of understated agendas and ironic, situational wit. He acts as a catalyst that sets events in motion that remove the many convincing masks worn by hard-nosed yet optimistic post-war people surrounding him, and ultimately becomes the recipient of all the disastrous effects he initiated. French film freaks in the 70s coined the term "film noir" to conveniently categorize a number of movies made earlier and far away at a time when "communist" was an accusation applied with similarly reckless abandon by recognized authorities. This film tells a far simpler tale of the differences between appearance and truth, and it does so with the appetite of people who love film-making for exquisite visual presentation, superb taste for dialog and narrative, and a treasury of cinematic wisdom and taste intended to delight an audience that also loves film. It works as a radio-drama. It cooks with the sound off. It stands up like Casablanca to repeated viewings, and never grows tiresome. The only thing I'd like to revise is the confrontation between Ann Nirdlinger-Brewster(-Coen) and Ed Crane at his doorstep. I wish that Katherine Borowitz' pregnancy had been made evident as she walks away with a butterfly net over her head, Alfred Hitchcock's profile revealed in the darkness of night, and the suggestion that Big Ed hadn't touched her since the UFO incident outside Eugene hanging like the shadow of a sequel, uncertain in the Santa Rosa stillness. If you mess up during the aggitato and nobody notices, was a mistake made? Freddy Riedenschneider's pimposity is a breathtaking exploration of untruth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In reducing the noir genre, the Coens aren't left with much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Coens watch a lot of movies. Like De Palma and Scorsese (among others), they have a tremendous knowledge of film and inevitably end up making references to their favorites in all of their films. Most of the time, though, they come up with a unique and compelling vision. However, with "The Man Who Wasn't There," they consciously deconstruct the noir genre and in the process suck all the melodrama and life out of it.(I will skip the plot summary - nobody on IMDb wants to read them and it's not like we're all auditioning for a job) Like the usual Coen films, "The Man Who Wasn't There" is marked by technical perfection. Joel's direction is intelligent and probing, always looking for a new way to view the characters. In this film, the use of shadows is especially impressive (and mind you, suitably over the top for a mock-noir film). The performances are good as well, not surprising considering the talent on board. Also, Deakins the cinematographer deserves a lot of credit.Where the film fails is at the script level. The Coens have always been calculating in their preparation - there is no spontaneity to their films (not a bad thing necessarily, just a style). Each one moves along towards the inevitable denouement. However, they usually come up with brilliant scenes and invent new dialogue and phrase structure. In this film, they revise the noir genre by making the characters lifeless, opposing in the process the melodrama seen in films such as "Touch of Evil" and the vitality of "The Third Man." Noir films are at their best when characters strive to better their lives and inevitably fail. In "The Man who wasn't there," the characters merely trudge along, not caring much for their livelihoods. Ed just goes through the motions. The only life in the movie comes from Gandolfini, and he's killed early on.And Tony Shalhoub's character is pure nonsense - his lines show the film to be straining, the viewer gets the sense that the Coens are showing off; that they just read about the uncertainty principle and somehow it all fits in. It's all fairly meaningless, much like their other films (to their credit, or detriment, they are incapable of making a movie without a sense of irony). However, coupled with the dreariness of the rest of the film, Shalhoub just feels out of place.There are good ideas here but not a cohesive film. "The Man Who Wasn't There" does not even approach "Fargo," which in my opinion might be too perfect for its own good. I almost wish the Coens would stop watching so many movies and consciously deconstructing them - I want them to take a chance, to be spontaneous for once.Either way, the 6/10 is on the basis of their films, "The Man Who Wasn't There" is of course better than most of the stuff coming out nowadays.I say this as a huge fan, and as someone who thinks they are one of, if not the best American writer/director of the past 20 years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the absence of color here, there is nothing black and white about a Coen Brothers film. They always manage to deconstruct traditional film genres and turn them on their heads, while they mess with ours in the process. "The Man Who Wasn't There" is a master class in film noir technique, for a hip, post-modern generation who missed the originals.Billy Bob Thorton stars as Ed Crane, a brooding, somnabulant, nebbish of a barber, who suddenly springs to life, like a cobra out of a box. Thornton, a wildly uneven actor, earns his acting props as he channels the great Montgomery Clift, brush cut and all.Frances McDormand plays Doris, Ed's heartbreaker of a wife, who wants nothing more than a little spice in her humdrum life. Gandolfini gleefully hams it up as her lover, 'Big Dave'. The supporting cast, mostly the Coens' usual suspects, are uniformly great. Watch for Scarlett Johansson as a piano-playing Lolita.The overall look of the film is absolutely stunning, with cinematography to die for.Pun intended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak By Coen Brothers Standards</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Weak by Coen Brothers standards still means considerably better than average. It has great technical moments like the sequence where Thornton fills the screen in a contemplative pose as his voice-over plays over a Beethoven piano solo. After a few seconds the camera pulls back and you see Johansson playing the piano in the foreground.Apparently this was shot on color film and desaturated in post-production because the shadows and contrasts are not really up to film noir standards.The script is not particularly clever and the Coen's rely on two gimmicks to make it more interesting; the irony of the criss cross as the two men are credited with each other's crime and the barber's basic invisibility to everyone (which makes him the title character-"The Man Who Wasn't There").Unfortunately the desire to wring the last ounce of irony out of the story is responsible for a cobbled on final ten minutes. This is totally lame and extends the movie beyond the car accident, a better ending that actually made for better irony. They should have gone out on the spinning hubcap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I originally checked out this movie because the beautifully modern Scarlett Johansson had been a part of it, but I am glad that I watched it because it's not your typical morale story wrapped up in some different style.I'm a bit perplexed as to the overall theme of the movie, even though Billy Bob's incredibly stoic character went into detail about how he felt about this time in this man's life. I learned little and therefore, I was entertained about as much. The b&amp;w detail and starkness was emensely helpful to see how this man saw the world for so long, but again, the story was either lacking or very indirect. I was disappointed to see that Birdy, Johansson's character, turned out to be so very average as well.Overall, it got a 6 from me. An average shot in the dark that had stylistic flair, but an indirect message and story.</fullReview>

Yes, 'Man who wasn't there' is beautifully filmed and Billy Bob is great. And sure, the plot is not insignificant: although to me it was a rip-off on the famous novel 'The Stranger' by Camus, depicting absurdity and cruelty in everyday life. Not some gangster environment, like the classic film noir, from which it borrows its form. But the movie doesn't feel as original as it should, perhaps because the brothers are distancing themselves too much from the story and borrowing too much. I never did like Camus too much either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Haircuts &amp; Murder Film Noir Coen Brothers Triumph</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title claim that this is based on a true story &amp; well it may be. Certainly some of the tale is so ridiculous that you can believe it's true, it would take an imaginative screen writer to think up some of the twists &amp; turns &amp; sheer outright strangeness you see.First of all the casting is simply flawless. At first I wondered what on earth Billy Bob Thornton was doing in the role of Ed Crane, playing a barber, he seemed totally wrong for the part. But instead of the usual Hollywood knee-jerk reaction of putting a big name personality on screen to attract audiences, giving us ego instead of character, Billy Bob does a wonderful job of creating the man of few words, Ed Crane. Well, this is the Cohen Brothers after all, not some predictable Brockheimer or Speilberg rubbish!The inclusion of old time Coen Bro's playlist actors like Francis McDormond (Ed Crane's wife, Dorris Crane) &amp; Jon Polito (dry cleaning evangelist, Creighton Tolliver) ad to the talent bank without overwhelming the screen with too many familiar faces from previous movies. McDormond is pathetic/tragic, while Polito is suitably sleezey.A little criticism surrounds the casting of James Gandolfini .... "David Allen 'Big Dave' Brewster" in the film, who pretty much reprises his role in the TV series "The Soppranos". No bad thing, the act fits in perfectly, but you do end up hoping he can find other modes of expression. His on screen wife is played by Katherine Borowitz .... as Ann Nirdlinger, the owners of the store "Big Dave" runs (&amp; who is embezzling funds from with the aid of McDormond who does the accounts). Borowitz is simply spooky, especially the part where she visits Ed Crane's house after Big Dave is murdered &amp; tells Crane that the Government &amp; aliens are involved, "We camped out.... there were lights in the sky...they took him up into a flying saucer..." &amp; so on. Her eyes simply freaked me out the whole way through &amp; she permanently looked as if she was being electrocuted. Wierd.The surrounding issues wind &amp; twist, sometimes without any logical reason, but as I said it's supposed to be based on real life &amp; that can be wierd enough, as we all know. To an extent you have to let it flow like a river &amp; see what comes past. In the end it all makes sense.... mostly! The are two scenes that left me puzzled by their significance, the dream scene where Ed Crane sees the flying saucer &amp; seems to have some communication with it &amp; the flash back with the asphalt salesman. Perhaps the latter shows how loveless &amp; barren the marriage was between Ed &amp; Doris Crane, but you know that already by this point.As in all film noir the simple act of blackmail that kicks the whole tragedy into high gear, unravels in a messy way. Bodies pile up at a steady, but restrained pace, there are some slightly cliched scenes with the resulting court cases, but then there are wonderfully poetic bits of cinematography concerning the crowd scenes. Notice the part where Ed Crane is walking against the crowd &amp; the later part where he drives his car slowly, as he shadows the private detective walking along the street. It's all like a dream.How the part of Scarlett Johansson .... "Rachael 'Birdy' Abundas", fits in I am not quite sure. The story goes off on a tangent for a while, as, in the midst of the tragedy &amp; with matters getting out of his control, Ed Crane attempts to mentor the piano playing teenager trying to boost her talent. He gets more than he bargained for...well almost! (you'll see what I mean). But if this section had been missed out I don't see how it would have affected the plot. Maybe it was included simply because it happened. Anyway you get to see an old 1950s car well &amp; truly thrown through the air, I hope it was a model or a mockup. Either way it's a simply wonderful scene as the car Ed Crane drives leaves the road at speed &amp; is seen spiraling through the air.The story takes another twist, in typical noir style, the final scene again concentrating on haircuts, with bitter irony.If you can tolerate the almost non-existent dialogue from Thornton &amp; the totally retro style then this is for you. This is not a film for those who want their steaks served as mince between a bun. This is a film for those who like films &amp; as such gets my hearty endorsement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You could say it was slow or drowsy, but I liked the effect and enjoyed the film. Billy Bob Thornton was so classically understated that he really almost wasn't there. Along with playing Ed Crane, a barber who starts out with as much excitement in his life as an unturned stone, Thornton also supplied the narrative which gives Jack Webb a run for his money in its matter-of-fact presentation. Wonderful black-and-white cinematography adds to the atmosphere of the film. Many scenes constructed of contrasting dark and light made the film even more enjoyable, especially some of the jail scenes. Ed Crane looked as if he would be in black and white even if the film was in color. Although missing several "regulars" such as John Goodman and John Turturro, I knew I could count on Frances McDormand to put in her normal quirky performance. The film had enough plot twists (some elements were just plain weird) and a seemingly almost unintentional comedic twist. I haven't smoked a cigarette for over eleven years, but found myself wanting one after I had seen Ed Crane go through about 50 before the movie was over. Maybe not for everybody, but still an enjoyable and diverting film.</fullReview>

I guess I was hoping The Man Who Wasn't There would be different, since it wasn't a comedy. Coen comedies always sort of left me dry, anyway, so I was looking forward to a new drama. The Coens do their best work when their humor is contrasted against some kind of heavy darkness.The problem is that it just isn't heavy enough, or dark enough. In the end, it's just a rather unfunny comedy with a couple of dead bodies in it. Visually, it's perfect. It doesn't capture the style of the old film noirs, but rather improves on it. The actors are all very good, too, even if some of them aren't at their best. But, the story just isn't strong enough to hold it together. There's no intensity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>RATING: **1/2 out of ****About halfway through the Coen brother's new film "The Man Who Wasn't There", barber Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thornton) gazes in wonder at one of the customers, gawking about how "the hair keeps growing it's a part of us- and we just cut it off." When his co-barber and brother-in-law Frank (Michael Badalucco) asks what is he talking about, Ed just replies, "I dunno. Skip it." Phew. For a second there, I thought the Coen brothers were actually taking this tired speculation seriously. The plot to "The Man Who Wasn't There" starts out simple enough. Billy Bob Thornton plays Ed Crane, barber. Him and his wife, Doris (Frances McDormand) never talk much, but he knows enough to suspect that she's having an affair with her boss, Big Dave Nerdlinger (James Gandolfini). When a hopeful entrepreneur enters town (he's got big plans for something he calls "dry cleaning"), all he needs is 10,000 bucks to get his business started. This gets Ed interested, so he creates a blackmailing scheme demanding the cash or the whole world will know about Doris and Big Dave. You know something's going to go sour in this mix. Let me tell you now, this is not your typical Coen brothers movie. Sure, it's got some quirky characters, it's shot in glorious black and white, and the script is well composed ("She proposed we get married. I said, 'don't you want to get to know me more?' She said 'why, does it get better?'") But there is a crucial ingredient missing in all of this. In all of their films that I've seen, the Coen brothers always give it their all. There's always something definitely Coen in their films. Yet watching "The Man Who Wasn't There", I felt that they weren't completely behind it. It's like watching a film school student doing his/her final thesis project.For a while, the noir aspects of the film are handled incredibly well. The performances are, as would be expected, terrific. Thornton gives another aptly controlled performance, and his chemistry with the rest of the cast is interesting, seeing as his character doesn't let himself come into contact with most of the world. James Gandolfini gives a good performance as well, and does a good job with the limited palate he is given. And Frances McDormand-- what more can be said about her? She is one of the best actresses working today, and she just stole the show for me.I've also always found that in every Coen brothers film, Joel and Ethan always had the last laugh, like they are chuckling at the audience as they pull the rug from under us. But one of the major problems in "The Man Who Wasn't There" is that it takes itself completely seriously (except for one strange episode with a spaceship, in which it has the good sense to inject a little humor into). This isn't a good thing, considering that the Coen brothers aren't exactly philosophers. During its second half, the film becomes lightheaded and fluffy, using cheesy metaphors that never work (like that darn hair one I talked about earlier). Ed Crane all of a sudden turns his head to the sky and tries to give his life meaning. That wouldn't be so bad, but this sort of stuff just can't stem from a dark noir successfully.I was very disappointed to see the second half of the film in such disarray. It just drags and drags; there's an entire subplot about a piano "prodigy" that could've been told in one minute of narration. When the film tries too hard to seem like a deep, thoughtful journey, all it really does is expose how shallow it is. Maybe I would appreciate this more if it didn't come from someone who seemed like they could really revolutionize the genre. I guess I would've expected the Coen brothers to go for something a little less... standard. "The Man Who Wasn't There" starts out as an unpredictable thriller, but in the end, it's hardly there at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unusual disappointment** (see below) from the Coen's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>May contain some small spoilersWhen viewing a movie concocted by the Coen's, the first thing that comes to my mind is the ambivalence the film seems to bring out in it's audience. Many die hards swear religiously that every Coen film is the Holy Grail of film making. On the other end of the spectrum you have those that just don't get the parvenu film makers. I am somewhere in the middle of these two Coen proponents/opponents. I admire the Coen's immensely for their ability to create films that are just about as original as anything you will ever see. I thought O BROTHER WHERE ART THOUGH was one of the best films of last year and I certainly believe that FARGO was easily the better picture in 1996 ( losing out to best picture winner THE ENGLISH PATIENT). THE BIG LEBOWSKI was also an ingenious film and in it Jeff Bridges turned in perhaps his most intriguing and puissant performance. I loved all of these films. Having said that, they have had their share of disappointments, THE HUDSUCKER PROXY and MILLERS CROSSING come to mind. Still, the Coen's remain one of the best film makers working today.For reasons that are not quite clear to me, THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE is more of a disappointment than I would like to admit. I am a stalwart believer that many of their films require a second viewing to appreciate what they are trying to say. I adhered to that theory with O Brother and Fargo and especially Lebowski. So perhaps in the years to come I may buy the DVD and watch it a few more times and pick up things that perhaps I did not or could not see the first two times I watched this film. I hope that is the case because I feel this is a decent film, but it is just missing something that many of their other films aren't. I enjoyed the film to a point, especially the performances of Billy Bob Thorton and Tony Shaloub but when I left the theater, I did so feeling a little cheated, being that it was a Coen film.Thorton plays Ed Crane, a quiet, saturnine barber that just seems to exist. He doesn't seem particularly sanguine but at the same time, he doesn't seem overly sad. He just seems like a man that is in the middle of his life and has accepted the fact that things are about as good as they are going to get. He plays Bingo with his wife, he goes to work every day, he comes home every night and has dinner at the same time and he doesn't complain. Life is life. C'est la vie. His wife, Doris Crane, on the other hand, seems a little more eccentric. She works in a department store and she seems a trite enamoured with her boss, Big Dave. She is played with duplicitous undertones beautifully by Coen veteran, Frances McDormand and her boss is portrayed by James Gandolfini as a proud man that thinks he is a little too successful. He flirts clandestinely, so he believes, with Doris and she eats it up. Many times they seem to be displaying their affections towards one another while Ed is in the next room or right across the dinner table. And perhaps they do this because many times it is hard to see if Ed has a pulse, let alone if he is paying any attention to what is happening in front of him.During the film a murder takes place, a lawyer is called in and all the while the proceedings get stranger and stranger, and seeing as this is a Coen film, that only stands to reason. Doris goes to prison for the murder of her boss and Ed Crane has to hire Freddy Riedenschneider, the best but slimiest attorney around. Think of Don King and any one of O.J's team of magicians working for him and you have Riedenschneider.Tony Shaloub, who I think is one of the most underrated actors out there, nails this performance to the letter. He is a scurrilous, slimy snake that is at the apex of his profession but he affords himself all the luxuries his clients will give him. What is perfect about this character is that we have seen characters like him in many films before, the difference is that these characters usually present the facade to their clients that they genuinely care about them. They are written to come off as people that want to win because they care about them and that they are really just good people caught in a bad situation. But not Freddy. Freddy lets you know how brilliant he is, then shows you how brilliant he is and then just when you are impressed by his swagger and grasp of what is happening, he will hit you with a bill for every single expense he has incurred. Not just for his legal team and his time, but for his seven course meal three times a day and his swanky accomodations in the town's five star hotel. He gives this to you not with a sugar coated smile or a confident wink, but with the attitude that says, "Hey this is business. You know it and I know it."The plot gets all convoluted along the way and all the while I was interested but not really rivetted. I was intrigued but not overwhelmed. And maybe that is due more to the fact that this is a Coen Brother's film and I have grown to expect more, much more. To me the biggest problem with this film is that it just exists. There is really nothing wrong with it but there is nothing that stands out. I don't mean to perpetually offer comparisons, but unfortunately it is inevitable, and when I think of O Brother... and Fargo and Lebowski, I think of small characters from each film that stay with me. Characters like the guy shovelling snow who has to give a description of Steve Buscemi in Fargo. I think of Pete's cousin in O Brother, or I even think of George Clooney from the same movie. In Lebowski you have Buscemi as Donny, who is probably the smartest guy in the film yet is constantly being told to shut up. Then you have the Nihilists, all with personalities, all which stayed with me well after the film was through. The Man Who Wasn't There can't give me the same satisfaction. It is a film that prods along and doesn't waste your time for two hours but it doesn't do much to enhance it. And that is to bad because the Coen's can usually be counted on for that.6.5 out of 10..... This is a film worth seeing for some of the performances, just don't expect the film to make an impact the way some of the their past efforts have.** a disappointment simply because the Coen's name is attached to the project.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I usually enjoy Coen Brothers films, but this one left me wishing it would end as quickly as possible. I could have walked, but at some point I thought perhaps something consequential might happen. It didn't. I think it is meant to be a satire of all the noir films from Double Indemnity and The Postman Always Rings Twice to the more recent L.A. Confidential. Instead, there is no more than enough material here for a 15 minute sketch on Saturday Night Live.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very disappointing, particularly since I've loved just abouteverything else the Coen brothers have done. The film is soself-conscious about re-creating the look, feel, and conventions of1940s film noir that it forgets to be about anything. Billy BobThornton (not my favorite actor) plays a barber in 1940s SantaRosa (I kept expecting references to Hitchcock's "Shadow of aDoubt" but none showed) who gets involved in a shady investmentdeal. Things spiral out of control, and his wife (FrancesMcDormand, excellent as usual) winds up in jail. There are severalplot twists and reversals, but the pace of the film is extremely slow.The problem stems from the Thornton character, who narrates adnauseum. His character is a little on the slow side (surprise!), sothe film noir convention of monotone male narration, usually fromthe perspective of a cynical smart-aleck, now comes from a boringnobody stuck in a dead-end life. We are told he is meant tosymbolize "modern man." UFOs show up. Audiences scratch theirheads and wonder if their money might be better spent elsewhere.I don't usually shy away from puzzling films (I loved "MulhollandDrive," after all), and maybe this movie gets better with repeatedviewings, but my first impression of this film is not a favorable one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Much There There</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The ironies of film noir -- you seem to get away with something, but fate has rude surprises in mind -- just aren't very fresh anymore, nor is the sour, life-sucks tone of this surfacey melodrama. The Coens evoke "Double Indemnity" (there's even an in-joke homage) and "High Sierra" and such, and Billy Bob projects some quiet, Bogart-like machismo (maybe it's all those cigarettes and low-slung fedoras). Ultimately, though, the movie seemed more about the gleaming black-and-white cinematography and fabulous '40s roadsters than man's condition. The Coen Brothers' love of movies can work for or against them -- it helped the picaresque "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" float, I thought. But here they seem to be following the film-noir blueprint rather slavishly, and not adding much to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very keen to see this film, becausei) it's a Coen brothers film, andii) it got awesome reviews everywhere, not least on IMDB.I was disappointed for a number of reasons, but I'll just ramble a bit.When I saw this, I'd just put 'Unbreakable' on DVD[1] for my mother to watch while I was gone (this sounds odder than it is), and one of the trailers before TMWWT was for Bandits. Having watched TMWWT, I couldn't help but think that Bruce Willis's portrayal of a similar character in 'Unbreakable' was perhaps better than Billy Bob Thornton's in TMWWT. I could be wrong.There wasn't a great deal of comedy here, black or otherwise, unlike most of the rest of the Coens' films. One of the reviews I read (in the London Grauniad) said that this was comedic film-noir. I just saw tragic film-noir. The story could have been taken straight from the fifties, the sole embellishment being the pointless sub-plots. It did drag a little in places.Performances were good, although I can't see any oscars being flung at this, except perhaps for photography. The film was shot beautifully, and after a while I didn't really notice that it was a period piece at all.I didn't dislike the film. I thought it was good. But I wouldn't tell anyone it was unmissable (like I do with the Big Lebowski or Fargo).7/10[1] She told me later that she wasn't quite sure, but thought she'd rewound it when it was finished</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Man Who Wasn't There is artistically and technically perfect. But, the movie has no heart, and Billy Bob Thornton gives yet another overrated performance for stylized eye contortions with no substance. As students of film history, the Coens imbue the film with all the trappings and elements of film noir. But two essential ingredients are missing: a plot that stays true to its alleged mystery, and heart. Another problem is that the structure of the movie makes it incumbent for Billy Bob Thornton to be John Garfield, Humphrey Bogart, Fred McMurray, Burt Lancaster, and Edmond O'Brien all rolled up into one, and he doesn't come close to pulling it off. What kind of man is he? He is THE BARBER!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of all the hundreds of reviews to this film on here, I'll openly admit I'm probably the least qualified to comment. I've never heard of the Coen Brothers let alone seen one of their films. You can also count on one hand the 'Film Noir' films I've seen in my lifetime.I would never dismiss an entire genre of film making, especially one of years gone by, but it does seem most of the films in this genre bore me to tears.Yes it was excellently shot, the cast were expertly chosen &amp; acted well and darkness created an great &amp; appropriate mood for the film. All that was brilliant. But it lacked one thing. A story line. There was no excitement at all. It dragged on &amp; on in the middle that I'm sure I nodded off and is quite honestly one of the most boring films in years. It could quite easily have been condensed down into a 30 minute short film without any problem and been lacking anything.It may have been quite good like that.It appeared to be a perfect example of converting a book into a film but without any of the adaptations, namely you're left with people taking the equivalent of 12 pages or 10 minutes to walk down the stairs.Many people I'm sure watched this film &amp; felt sympathy for Ed but I found him so drab &amp; irritating, he just needed a good kick up the backside to put a life into him. It was also probably the worst piece of policework in the world that they didn't take any fingerprints on the knife, having been in use by police for about 20 years by the 1940's.So overall, had the article Ed was writing to the mens magazine in the film, been left at that (a magazine feature) it actually would have been a fascinating read. Sadly as a film it was atrotious, &amp; one which I wouldn't recommend. Nothing at all to do with it being Black &amp; White, set in the 40's, or the camerawork, that was all good. It just lacked even a remotely interesting storyline.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Coen Bros are amongst the most talented &amp; influential filmmakers working in filmdom today &amp; I expected 'The Man Who Wasn't There' to be a yet another stunner by the Oscar-Winners. Unfortunately, I was underwhelmed. Its An Average Fare, that relies on a story that's predicable. 'The Man Who Wasn't There' Synopsis: A laconic, chain-smoking barber blackmails his wife's boss &amp; lover for money to invest in dry cleaning, but his plan goes terribly wrong.'The Man Who Wasn't There' offers nothing new to the genre of neo-noir. I was engrossed, but only in parts, particularly in the first-hour, which offers some very interesting sequences. But, the second-hour, is a complete misfire. Also, the lethargic pacing acts as a deterrent. The Coen Bros certainly aren't in their elements this time around. Their Screenplay has a few impressive moments, but otherwise, its predictable. Joel Coen's Direction, however, is atmospheric. Cinematography is excellent. Editing is not crisp enough. Art Design is fabulous.Performance-Wise: Billy Bob Thornton delivers a believable performance. Frances McDormand is fantastic. She's the real scene-stealer here! The Late/Great James Gandolfini shines in a brief role, while Tony Shalhoub is first-rate. Scarlett Johansson is awkward. Richard Jenkins is ever-effective. On the whole, 'The Man Who Wasn't There' scores less on pluses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joyless chore through style over content that one senses not even its creators are that fond of.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its look is gloomy; its feel heavy, it is without anything that resembles black comedy and refrains from providing us with the sort of real substance that backed up everything loopy and seemingly disjointed in the likes of Barton Fink and A Serious Man. The style begins to distract us as the film wears on, we begin to realise that the makers have invoked the genre of film noir without having actually made a film noir ? in spite of everybody seeming to think that it is. The 'look' becomes more interesting than anything unfolding therein; we become frustrated that a decent beginning has given way to a series of uninvolving nonsense.These things are not often the items one uses to pull up a film by the Coen brothers, a rare misfire that unfortunately does well to break the procession of 'good film/bad film' that the movie-making Brothers had somewhat uncannily carved out for themselves. This is one of those rare 'serious' films of theirs that doesn't quite work ? a film without the reigned in, infectious energy of Raising Arizona and without the dramatic substance of a Fargo that it so dearly would love to have. The Man Who Wasn't There is, in fact, in such a muddle over whether it's an urban drama covering simple folk suspicious of extramarital affairs who're stuck in jobs they don't especially like, or something revolving around an extortion plot for a large amount of money, or even a redemptive thriller about a man granted one final chance at redemption, that it doesn't end up being any of these. By the end, we no longer care.Billy Bob Thornton is good value as Ed Crane, a middle aged barber living in California a few years after World War Two has ended and of whom has a wife plus a greater circle of acquaintances, few of whom he likes. Crane is a glum looking man, someone stuck in a suburban zone wherein cutting hair and listening to the radio in-between customers by day gives way to suspicions over his wife Doris' (McDormand) affair with a brash War veteran played by James Gandolfini by night. Not even his pride and joy, a "garbage compactor built into the sink" is enough to compensate him when all the nastiness eventually kicks off. Mirroring Miller's Crossing, the Coens throw a Joe Polito character into the mix for an important early scene before removing him completely, but why does a man with no hair wade into a barbers in the first place? The reason lies behind what the man has to say, something important that may interest Crane ? an idea put to him involving a large sum of money he desires for an investment. Crane accepts, but anonymously blackmails Gandolfini's character for the cash ? something which backfires when Polito gets involved and Crane ends up killing the Gandolfini character.Cue all sorts of panic and hair brained misdemeanours, Crane's conservative approach to being a murderer; the deceased's wife going nuts over a conspiracy theory; Tony Shalhoub's lawyer getting all involved on account of Crane's wife being suspected on top of a sultry young pianist named Birdy Abundas (Johansson) who later becomes more and more involved. This is one of those plot heavy Coen films which are often symptomatic of a characteristic that sees us dragged to the very edge of what's too much and what's just enough. Encroaching over that line, something Miller's Crossing did well to avoid and something Intolerable Cruelty did with the sort of crude, ego-centric relish that made one want to avoid anything the Coen's made from thereon in, The Man Who Wasn't There eventually slips into a smug abyss wherein our care is eroded as we come to dislike its characters more and more before giving up entirely.When Crane, already established to be submissive in his nature following various interactions with his wife, steps forward and confesses, it should be a seamless revelation that veers the picture down a fresh route and away from this suburban set drawl reading lines off a hymn sheet that often demands a subverting of 'perfect' American norms. Instead, it bogs the film down; catapults it into a realm dominated by arrogant artistic visual flourishes and superfluous sex appeal in the form of Johansson's thankless role. Its Black and White colour scheme; 1940s setting and unsubtle reference to pulp magazines at its very end does well to create the illusion we're watching something hard boiled or undercut by noir convention, but strip things away and we are in fact a long way from anything even remotely resembling something noirish. What we have is something with the sombre tone of Fargo, and a narrative involving organised crime al the kidnapping in said example, on top of a promising start as these people devolve into lowlifes on top of a pristine set up. Unfortunately, there is no weight behind it; no reason to give a damn by the end and certainly not enough reason to recommend it.</fullReview>

But, nothing goes well as it seems. And as the barber's plot unravels the delicious surprises, stunning revelations, and plain strange occurrences.*Special Stars- Billy Bob Thorton, Jon Polito, Frances McDormand, James Gandolfini, Scarlett Johanson, Tony Shalhoub *Theme- Life is a gift, you should use it wisely.*Based on- Film Noir, 50's detective novels *Trivia/location/goofs- Black and white film. Adam Alexi-Malle is a accomplished concert pianist and played in his scenes. Small town scenes shot in Orange and Pasadena California and on Paramount New York street back-lot.*Emotion- A somewhat unforgettable film, the Cohen brothers are back with a dark twisted film unlike anything you have seen. This film will disturb and delight you long after the film has ended. This film is highly rated as a Cohen Brothers crowd pleaser and well worth your time if you enjoy dramatic character roles. This film is not for people that enjoy special effect, car cases, or high energy action. This is a 'thinking person's' film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Messy, but what the hell!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2001, the Coen brothers ventured enthusiastically and knowledgably into the field of classic film noir, a genre left largely untouched in the last few decades, aside from occasional nostalgic trips such as Tim Ed Wood Burton's (1994). With the developments in colour and the lifting of heavy censorship encouraging more directors to explore realism, the old-fashioned Black &amp; White capers have become more of a treasured memory than a fully functioning cinematic style. Despite the petty peer pressure, The Man Who Wasn't There proudly dons its drab palette and dreary mood to present us with the scenario of a disillusioned, drug-addled barber named Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thornton) with an absurdly extroverted co-worker (Michael Badalucco) seeking a diversion from his tiresome profession, and subconsciously hunting for a more profitable occupation. When a rambunctious Danny-De-Vito-esque businessman (Jon Polito) barges his way into the shop and makes him a gimmicky yet still enticing offer, he accepts it quite readily after some relentless persuasion. However, there is still the matter of a $10 000 deposit to finance the enterprise, but Ed believes it can easily be obtained by anonymously blackmailing his own boss and comrade (James Gandolfini) with the knowledge that he and Ed's wife Doris (Frances McDormand) are committing adultery.The ensuing events show a rather heavy-handed effort from the screenplay writers to wring out as much drama and tragedy as possible from each set of circumstances as is humanly possible, resulting in the plot being dragged right across into the areas of suicide, murder, court cases and the like. On almost every occasion, the most obvious storyline direction is opted for, with it feeling as if the final melodramatic conclusion was only reached underhandedly by a lazy series of shortcuts instead of fairly by meticulous scripting.This slackness isn't helped by the fact that the story's catalyst, Ed Crane, is so atrociously underplayed and maltreated by an almost inanimate Bob Thornton. His facial features and physicality are never altered in the slightest, regardless of what is happening around him, and his voice remains in a grating monotone, especially when he must deliver the uselessly hackneyed narration. McDormand has similar issues with her performance: although her character is a heavy drinker, the distant intoxicated manner is quite overdone, but Doris is still much more interesting to watch than her husband. Thankfully, the supporting players are very much on track and consistently engaging and entertaining. Polito, Badalucco and Gandolfini, successfully alternating between comic and creepy, are joined by Tony Shalhoub as a classically charismatic fast-talking lawyer, Adam Alexi-Malle as expert pianist Jacques Carcanogues, and a very young Scarlett Johansson as an aspiring teenage musician who is rejected by Carcanogues. The sub-plot of Johansson's character is one of the screenplay's few original aspects, and it is very refreshing to see at least one film in which an underage person is shown simply engaging in a hobby without quickly becoming a luminary in that field. All the same, its unique initial concept is sadly diluted by its mundane execution, giving it a bizarrely mutated sense of rebellious conformity.It is an artistic debacle, but films don't always need perfect artistry to win over their audience. Whilst on an intellectual level it wreaks of horribly contrived ideas, it carries an impossibly appealing atmosphere of dark intrigue and irresistible fun. Its numerous flaws are constantly in plain sight, and yet in the midst of such delightful entertainment we could hardly care less about their existence. More cynical audience members will no doubt be quick to snigger and scorn as they would in any film that isn't a big-budget Oscar-winning Holocaust epic, but ultimately all viewers will be happily enjoying themselves right through to the end, for it is simply one of those ridiculously lovable movies that could get away with anything.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Man Who Wasn't There is like a beautiful porcelain doll you are not allowed to touch. It's nice to look at, but you can't have any fun with it.Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thornton) is an unhappy stoic. He talks in a monotone. He thinks in a monotone. He lives in a monotone. We know this not just because we can see it in all this film's black and white glory. We also hear it as Ed narrates this story of his life in the 1950s. He tells us how he married his wife Doris (Frances McDormand) and became the 2nd chair barber at the shop of his brother-in-law Frank (Michael Badalucco). He even tells us about the affair he suspects his wife of having with her boss, Big Dave Brashear (James Gandolfini). Ed feels himself sinking into the quicksand of his existence and he doesn't even have the will to try and claw his way out.Then one day, Ed sees that way out. For 10 thousand dollars he could buy into the dry cleaning dreams of a traveling entrepreneur named Creighton Tolliver (Jon Polito). To get the money, Ed decides to blackmail Big Dave. He anonymously demands Big Dave give him 10 thousand dollars or the secret of his affair with Doris will get out. Big Dave agrees to pay but like just about every blackmail scheme in a black and white movie, things go wrong and people end up dead. Both Doris and Ed end up on trial for murder, forcing them to mortgage their lives to pay big city defense attorney Freddie Reidenschnieder (Tony Shalhoub). In the midst of all this, Ed finds himself drawn to young Rachel Abundas (Scarlett Johansson) and her magical playing of the piano. Ed finds another way out of his life through her but just like the blackmail scheme, it doesn't turn out anything like he wanted.Like most Cohen brothers movies, this movie is smart, stylish, filled with striking imagery and clever performances and nothing goes quite the way you expect. Like many Cohen brothers movies, it's also not that overtly entertaining. The Man Who Wasn't There is a good demonstration of the difference between brilliant filmmakers like the Cohen brothers and brilliant filmmakers like Stephen Spielberg. The latter are always trying to entertain the audience. The former only try to entertain themselves. Every so often, a Cohen brothers movie will resonate with a broader audience but, usually, their storytelling is something you can admire and appreciate more than you enjoy.That's the case with this film. There's some crackerjack work done by this cast, with Billy Bob Thornton making even the narratively static Ed an interesting presence. The camera work proves again that a well lit black and white movie looks a lot better than a color film. The direction balances a leisurely, mesmerizing pace with an awful lot of activity. There're even a few touches of the Cohen brother's trademarked oddness.In the end, though, this remains a movie for folks who like watching the Cohens entertain themselves. There's a passivity and distance to the story that may have been a deliberate creative choice, but it's still unappealing. You never know where the film is going, but you never care where it ends up.If you're a Cohen brothers fan, you've probably already seen The Man Who Wasn't There. If you're not, I don't think watching this movie will turn you into one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coens trade humor for perfection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie that has everything going for it except entertainment. An unemotional man's search for life's meaning has the Coen brothers weaving together some of the key existential questions in a well-constructed story. The movie is cinematically perfect, replete with great acting, brilliant direction and engaging cinematography. However, the one thing I find missing from the movie is entertainment that I associate with most of the Coens' offerings. After all, these are the directors who filmed a melancholy story like Fargo in a charmingly funny way. In this movie, the Coens leave behind attempts at dark humor to portray a consistently grim picture. The scenes are long-drawn at times, sometimes to the point of being boring. While the movie illustrates the directorial abilities of the Coens, the morose and slow nature of the story means that a viewer needs to be in a certain mood to enjoy the film. Overall, I think the movie, especially the script, is an advertisement for Coens' skills, but in being drab, it is one of the few films from the brothers where you will not think and enjoy at the same time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I usually really like the Coen brothers' work. Quirky without being incomprehensible, grotesque without being disgusting, they have some neat ideas. However, I had a hard time following "The Man Who Wasn't There". This film noir about a barber (Billy Bob Thornton) in post-WWII Santa Rosa trying to get into another line of work with unpleasant consequences is a little too far out to figure out. Thornton, Frances McDormand, Michael Badalucco and James Gandolfini all turn in some interesting performances, but the movie is reminiscent of the Coens' debut "Blood Simple", in that it's a little hard to tell who is doing what to whom.That all said, I still think that it's worth seeing. I agree with a previous reviewer that Thornton has the perfect face for a film noir. The black-and-white setting naturally heightens the mood. What really catches our eyes nowadays is the presence of Scarlett Johansson; her role here seems to foreshadow her roles in "Lost in Translation" and "Match Point".So, I recommend it, but remember that you're likely to get confused. Also starring Jon Polito, Richard Jenkins (Nate Sr. on "Six Feet Under") and Tony Shalhoub.PS: Santa Rosa was also the setting for "Shadow of a Doubt" and "Scream", and Charles Schulz lived there. What a combo!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful Looking and Acted, But for Coen Brothers Fanatic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Man Who Wasn't There" is another Coen Brothers tribute to a genre/specific film/director, as "O Brother Where Art Thou?" was a tribute/take-off/inspired by "Sullivan's Travels". This one is a paean to Billy Wilder's "Double Indemnity" and "Sunset Boulevard," though they already referenced the latter in "Barton Fink." But the Coens' are more fatalistic and existential than Wilder so the moral lesson is more depressing.Billy Bob Thornton plays a Camus-like character passive except for an almost accidental, defensive act, yet plagued by temptations he doesn't act on.The character actors get to play against type, and their hair and make-up are really fine, including Tony Shalhoub as a slick lawyer, Frances McDormand as a femme fatale, and Jon Polito as a salesman. And this is the third movie this year with the teen Bacall-voiced Scarlet Johansson. Deakins' black and white cinematography is beautiful, but combined with Carter Burwell's score and Thornton's deadpan narration, the overall effect is lulling rather than hypnotic, so I know I missed a scene or two as when the music credits came up I hadn't heard those songs. This one is mostly for Cohen auteurists. (originally written 11/10/2001)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I suppose everyone knows by now who the Coen-brothers are. If you have never heard from "Fargo", "The Big Lebowski" or "O Brother, Where art thou?", you must have been on another planet the last 10 years. The other day, I saw one of their latest movies: "The Man who wasn't there". A beautiful and slow but highly enjoyable crime drama with an excellent performance by Billy Bob Thornton. He plays a barber, who gets involved in a murder and some other illegal activities. Other familiar faces in this movie are Frances McDormand (who's married to Joel Coen for more than 20 years), James Gandolfini (a.k.a. Tony Soprano) and Scarlett Johansson (who was amazingly brilliant in "Lost in Translation").The movie is in black and white which gives it a retro-effect. The cinematography is wonderful, it's a lust for the eye. The acting, the story, the whole movie is highly recommendable. It's impossible to compare it with "The Big Lebowski" or "Fargo". These are two completely different movies. If you want to compare it to any other work of the Coen-brothers, you must take "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" as comparison to this movie. It's the same style although "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" is much more of a comedy than "The Man Who Wasn't There". Overall certainly worth watching! A fine piece of art! 8/10</fullReview>

While it doesn't have the usual oddball antics or quirky energy that runs rampant through most Coen Brothers films, TMWWT was a bit of a break from the norm. It was something completely different, a little gem in the middle of a minefield.The Coen's typically don't obsess with style or substance in their shot selection, which was always the basis of their previous success. But in this film, you can see the intricacy of composition in each shot, sharply outlined in every slow movement or in every lazy close-up. The dialogue is a little trite in some places, but then again, no one can be perfect. Visually, this film was a cut above the rest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two hours of my life I'll never get back, not worth a $2 rental</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me state that I have been an advocate of the Cohen Brothers' films since Barton Fink, like most of the other commentators here. But I think instead of spouting out the tag-line of "looking at things changes them" or some post-War take on 'modern man', the more apt phrase should be "There's a sucker born every minute." I don't think I've seen a more overblown, pretentious, tedious piece of tripe in my entire life. Good cinematography and a *pretense* of artiness a good film does not make. I must disagree vehemently with the commentator from Switzerland and say that this film is ALL about style over substance. In fact, I'd be hard pressed to find any substance here whatsoever, except for what contrived meaning the hypnotized, star-struck, fawning I'll-love-everything-the-Cohen-Brothers-vomit-up-in-the-middle-of-the-night, terminally pretentious eternal film students who profess to like this steaming heap of garbage have apparently invested it with. This film does not work on any level, not as an intellectual exercise, an examination of the creative process, a statement on alienation or existential angst, not even as film noir. This is a terrible, terrible film, and as much as I'd like to allow everyone their own opinion on this one I have to insist that anyone who claims to 'love' this film is either fooling themselves or just posturing for the sake of some contrived sophistication ... quite like the Cohens themselves here. I would elaborate on the many reasons this film ranks right up there with The Exorcist II as a colossal failure (except that at least Boorman's disaster was worth a good laugh every now and then), but I've already wasted enough time just by watching this film, I don't plan to waste any more deconstructing it. I would like to say you've got to see this for yourself and make up your own mind, but ... save yourself the trouble, save yourself the $2 and the 2 hours, and do something worthwhile with your time like read a good book or spend quality time with loved ones.

'Fargo' was just an odd story about some nice folks from Minnesota. All of these movies are entertaining and are definitely worth checking out. I walked into "The Man Who Wasn't There" with these films in mind wondering what new quirkiness I was about to encounter. It turns out that the new quirkiness is "boredom." I had a really hard time not falling asleep in this movie. It goes on for two and a half hours and has enough action to fill a five minute trailer. Billy Bob's dry monotonous narration had the same affect on me as a hypnotist's watch. I recommend this movie to anyone suffering from insomnia.I like the actors and actresses in this movie.

		<fullReview>I'm an ardent fan of the Coens and I love their fondness for quirk in their films. However, it would appear that since their success with Fargo, they've lost their ability to manage it effectively. While I totally dug O'Brother, The Big Lamebowski and TMWWT both suffer from their applied quirk becoming non-sequitur rather than comedic genius. The subplots around the young girl's sexuality and the widow's alien obsession came from nowhere and added nothing to further this already tedious tale but only served to further confuse it. The one bright spot was Tony Schalub who gave his best performance since Big Night.I give due credit to the cinematography, mood and casting. All were fine. Unfortunately all too much has been made of the noir style. It's as if that alone justifies to many the non-sensical and directionless plot. I am afraid that the Coens vision may be blurred by the success of Fargo and that their creative output may be at it's end. I certainly hope it isn't so I pray for a redeemer film from them much like David Lynch redeemed himself with Mulholland Drive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(contains minor spoilers)The Coen brothers' new movie is very uneven, and in its unevenness it is ultimately disappointing. The problem as I see it is entirely with the script; the actors are all great (Billy Bob Thornton is excellent as Ed Crane) and do their best to deal with a script that doesn't know where it's going.The Man Who Wasn't There starts as a film noir; the problem is that none of the characters is sufficiently noir. Ed Crane may be bad enough to blackmail somebody, but he is not really a murderer, and he's a far cry from the ultimate good guy turned bad, Fred MacMurray's Walter Neff from Double Indemnity. Not happy with the homage to the film noir, the script was spiced up with an obvious nod to Stanley Kubrick's Lolita, which I felt was totally out of place and simply added 30 superfluous minutes to a movie that was at any rate too long.I call this a major disappointment. 6/10, and that's only for the actors and the cinematography. The script may be among the Coens' weakest so far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Postmodernism takes on another topic in Coens' new tour de force</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Coen brothers are the outstanding example of postmodern film making. While other artists play around with the trappings of postmodernism, Joel and Ethan eschew most of the glitz and go straight to the heart of the aesthetic approach. More than anything else, what they do is always playful, inviting audiences to engage in word play, thematic expropriation, overlaid images, and, most expertly, the game of guess-what-I'm-trying-to-pull-on-you-now. Some of their contemporaries make narrative more obscure, turn and twist sound to fracture perception, brutalize the viewer with violent acts or emotions, propagate vertigo with hand-held cameras and digital images, and exploit the full bang of their technical armories. Sometimes the affect is profound and lasting; and sometimes the result is thoroughly confusing. I can think of a respectable collection of movies in 2001 that have burrowed into me and remained unsettling for some time after I've left the theater. I never feel that way with the Coens' films. However, no one entertains and stimulates me intellectually like the Coens, and THE MAN. . . is no exception.Last year's unexcelled O BROTHER. . . traded in the ODYSSEY, as has been well acknowledged. Far less discussed was its use of THE WIZARD OF OZ, of Busby Berkeley extravaganzas, of dance-number movies of the '40s and '50s, of WPA documentary photography, particularly that of Walker Evans, and of the American classic film of the '30s, THE GRAPES OF WRATH. Joel and Ethan ran rampant through the "arts" stealing this and that at will and making a beautiful pastiche that truly worked. Plus it had the great music to hold it all together. This time they've turned even more unexpectedly to the somber existentialism of the post-WWII West, particularly Camus; to "Lonely Crowd" and "Organization Man" alienation; and, with my greatest surprise, theoretical physics. Who would have ever thought that someone could make a movie with its core built around Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle (even if it's oversimplified)? I can't wait to see my astrophysicist friend at a folk music performance this weekend and tell him the Coens have made another movie right down his alley. Then there are all the tangents that add to the entertainment. When the Coens put Heisenberg at the center and began the film with the observation that the Russians had the atomic bomb, were they referring to the controversy over whether or not the great thinker actively prevented the Nazis from developing their own?Saying more would ruin the movie for those who haven't seen it. If you are among them and like the Coens, go see it. But be prepared to be teased, tricked, and tickled, often all at the same time. Wow, it's great.</fullReview>

The whole thing seems like it is meant as a fantasy and so I did not really worry about historical accuracy. The 40's is a stylish time period to us today, and why not have a film look cool as well as be a bit twisted? Some scenes I could predict but in a more a Greek-Chorus type feeling of predicting the inevitable for the characters instead of "oh this movie is predictable."

		<fullReview>So another Coen film eh? The noir movie season continues with the greatness of Memento and Mulholland Drive, now we have a black and white 50's potrayal of Ed Crane involved in a most twisted plot. Ed (Billy Bob) is a barber who in short, is a sap. He doesn't talk much, is anti-social, has a wife who uses him more out of convenience than anything cause he makes such a good door mat. Ed's life is pretty uneventful. Until one day a stranger comes to down (a con artist) that tries to get Ed to invest 10,000 dollars in a scheme. Since Ed is so sad and even has the intelligence to know that the guy seems to be a crook, he decides to get him the money anyway, as if to make his life more meaningful or perhaps interesting. But how he gets the money creates a cascade of events that is well written and devised.Ed is played with great realism by Billy Bob. How he holds his smokes, how his delayed voice takes time to draw out, is all handled masterfully. There's even a great scene where the con artist makes a pass at Ed by winking at him, and Ed's only reaction is to flash his eyes in surprise. The look on Billy Bob's face is so simple and uninvolved but conveys a message so well with the littlest of acting whatsoever. A real testament to Thornton's ability. The Coens once again create an ingenious script, but this time it takes a little more patience to sit through. There also the typical dark humour situated with Coen films such as Fargo but nowhere near the greatness of previous work..I did find myself at one point in the film giving up on it, but it brought itself back when the actors got there chance to show off, and key things started happening. Ed's wife played by Frances McDormand is wonderful, and the best acting is even reserved for the lawyer Freddy Riedenschneider (Tony Shalhoub), who plays his part with such zeal you wonder if there is even an actor on the screen. But what I enjoyed most from this film was its look. It is probably the best looking picture I have seen all year, using just the perfect black and white tone, and creating some awesome work using light, shading, shadows, and cigarette smoke. It also has the great nostalgic feel. It's not a great film, but has some real good performances, and looks amazing. I would still recommend it even so, but I wouldn't exactly run to theatre to see it again either.Rating 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

The Coen's strain for the metaphysical within the limited confines of noire pulp, but because they violate the basic defining premises of their chosen genre, break its rigid rules, they fail. This is a highly embellished but essentially simple sordid tale of infidelity, blackmail, suicide, and murder that begs The Big Questions: Who Are we? What is life? It looks for meaning in a grain of sand but sees only sand.The look of the movie, a lustrous black &amp; white, is flawless, its visual composition, studied (there's an overhead shot, all shadow and light, of the main character exiting a building that must be a reference to Edward Hopper's etching "Night Shadows"). The Coen's are masters of the simple dramatic gesture, of buried body language. It's obvious that a couple are having an affair by the way they sit next to each other at a table, even in the presence of their spouses. And the Coen's do violence extremely well: A knife to the neck flashes by for a fraction of a second, obscenely savage and unforgettable. A small-town retro-'50's setting is meant to expose essential Americana, like a Hopper painting. Hip modern minimalism enhances irony, understatement, drama. But the deadpan dry black humor the Coen's do so well ("Fargo") is unfortunately restricted. There is too much control: their usual sensitivity to language and idiom becomes mannered; there is an anal preoccupation with, a stringent tyranny over the physical: Cars are spotless, interiors immaculately arranged, clothes too right, nothing breathes. This banishment of chaos is one with their devout adherence to stifling noire convention. The movie puts itself in a straight jacket, but then attempts ballet. It does away with psychological reality, the fuss and muss of the irrational; there is no character, only caricature. Its uptight, leaden, literal physicality eliminates the openness needed for multiple meanings and symbolism. When here and there, of a sudden, it probes below its meticulously contrived, brilliant but brittle surface to explore the depths below, that surface shatters. When the principal, a barber, takes to pondering the relentless regenerative onslaught of life, he thinks in terms of how hair keeps on growing on people's heads of its own, only for him to endlessly cut it off. It's as if Bogart's Sam Spade were to stop at a pier self-consciously made to look like a Hollywood set and ponder how time flows like a river. The Coen's violate the convention they labor so punctiliously to establish, undercutting both it and the meaning they're looking for beyond it. The effect is trite, worse, untrue to formImprobabilities, holes abound--not good when plot is so paramount: Why does the adulterer confide in the adulteree about being blackmailed? Fingerprints on the murder weapon left at the scene of the crime are completely overlooked. The murder cases made against each Crane, husband and wife, are wholly circumstantial, insufficient to bring to trial. The wrong persons accused twice is simply too (pun) much. The suicide is poorly motivated. The fate of the $10,000 should have been made clear at the onset, prior to the discovery of the body. The girl's sudden sexual solicitude is pure male fantasy.The soundtrack depends on small quotes from several Beethoven piano sonatas as the only illumination in an otherwise dreary world; yet, inadvertently, the artistic freedom, honesty, and courage embodied by that music, even the atypically morose and simple portions quoted, only serve to underscore the lack of these very things in the movie itself. The girl who plays the sonatas is taken to a respected music teacher to see if he will take her as his pupil. His verdict is that she is a "nice" girl, too "nice," that she plays the right notes but doesn't have a feeling for the deeper meanings of the music. So too this movie. It is impressively accurate and true to form, downright punctiliously precise, but bereft of soul.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie reminds me of Nirvana's album "In Utero." Where is he going with this? "In Utero" followed up the hugely popular "Nevermind." "Nevermind" was one of the all time biggest selling albums ever, everybody owned a copy. However, when those fans bought "In Utero," many hated it. They thought that the album was very different and not as easy on the ears. It certainly was not very commercial. Many "so called" Nirvana fans left. Of course when they told Nirvana about that, Nirvana said Good!, that was the point. They were not real fans anyways. I believe that this film was the Coen's "In Utero." Created for the die-hard Coen fans and meant to put off the thousands of "Oh Brother..." fans. For the same purpose, to bring the true fans back into the fold. Let's face it, "Oh Brother" was the most simplistic and least entertaining of all Coen films and because of that, they got hundreds of thousands of new fans. Funny how that works out. This film was a film that only die hard Coen fans would like and you know what? We really don't like it that much. But we are comforted by the fact, that it is the boys getting back to what they do best, making strange, off beat films that make us wonder, is there something more going on here? And for that, I commend the brothers. Coen Fan rating of *** out of ****. Other rating, * out of ****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not since the stroke of luck by Steve Soddenberg that he had last year (and hoping again on December 7th!) that a director has done two excellent movies back to back, and having both films released within a year. Spielberg has done it, so has John Carpenter, now Joel and Ethan Coen return to the big screen for the first time since their last highly successful hit O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU? with what is perhaps one of their best films in their careers with THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE. MAN WHO WASN'T THERE is about a man who most of the time seems like he isn't there, Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thornton). Ed is a simple looking man for 1949, with his Sinatra hair-stlye, smoking a cigarette, and giving young boys haircuts with different types of style, you would think that he is boring and harmless. That's on the outside, inside Ed there's a brilliant and intelligent man who is aware that his wife Doris (Frances McDormand) is having an affair with her department store boss, Big Dave Brewster (James Gandolfini). And when Ed is proposed by a smooth-talking salesman Creighton Tolliver (Jon Polito), to co-fiance a dry cleaning business and become partners, Ed figures that the easiest way to come up with $10,000 is to blackmail Big Dave by sending him a anomouous letter. Big Dave is furious and when he asks Ed to come to Big Dave's department store, Dave suspects Ed for the blackmail and tries to put a stop to this blackmailing, thus leaving Ed to do the most reasonable action, defend himself, thus killing Big Dave. Ironic, it's not Ed being charged with Dave's murder but Doris! This has Ed's attorney and friend Walter Abundas (Richard Jenkins) to suggest that Ed hires flashy attorney Freddy Riedenschneider (Tony Shalhoub). Freddy is the 1940's Eddie Cochran or F. Lee Bailey, the type of attorney that would make Charles Manson look like a misuderstood fella. During the lead up to the trial, Ed takes over the barber shop while his brother-in-law and boss Frank Raffo (Michael Badalucco) figures out his fiances to support Freddy's charge of defense, and Ed begins a passion affection for Walter's piano playing daughter Birdy (Scarlett Johansson). If all of this seems complex and unusual, it is, it's a Coen brothers film of course. Which means that if you are a Coen brothers fan (like myself) then MAN WHO WASN'T THERE is a major must see! I would rank this film to be one of their best films, (behind FARGO and BLOOD SIMPLE). This is a amazing film with the different techniques that the Coen brothers use to tell this story. First there is the cinematography by Coen regular Roger Deakins. Deakins uses only black and white for the coloring of the film, and some scenes (including the ending) are spectacular with the image and coloring that the film shows. I also loved how Deakins would have Ed look outside his automobile window as the car is driving slow, and to see the rapid and crazy rush of the people walking down the streets of Santa Rosiata, California. Seocnd there is the acting, I thought Billy Bob Thornton did a great job in BANDITS. In MAN WHO WASN'T THERE, he blows his previous acting job out of the water with what is perhaps his best role since SLING BLADE. Ed doesn't say much in the film, he narrates the story. Imagine that quiet and lonely man sitting at the coffee shop table reading the newspaper, what is he thinking? With Ed you hear and follow everything that is on his mind, and makes Ed one of the most intresting characters to narrate a story since Edward Norton's Narratror "Jack" character from FIGHT CLUB. Plus, I also enjoyed the acting by the always wonderful Frances McDormand who does a good job playing the grouchy wife of the quiet barber, and James Gandolfini does a great job as well as the bullying Big Dave. But the only actor that almost steals the show from Thronton is Tony Shalhoub as the oily defense attorney. Shalhoub does a excellent job describing his plans and possible motives to help give the accussed Doris a acquittial. There's even a hilarious scene where Ed actually confesses to the murder, and Freddy says that "the guilty husband motive won't work." Third there is the music by another regular Carter Burwell. The music for this film is like Ed, quiet and simple. Burwell uses mostly piano solos including a piece from Beethoven, for the background of the movie. There are times when some films work with big and flashy composing scores, like scores by John Williams and Danny Elfman. Then there are those others that can be just as effective by being timid and soft, Burwell succeeds with this film. And finally, there is the Coen Brothers, the best sibling team filmmakers in Hollywood (yes, they are better than the "only made two films" Wicholski brothers). They are masters at story telling, one film would be a dark murder mystery, the next a wacked out crazy comedy, then a dark comic murder thriller, to a bizare and funny comedy/musical. The Coen Brothers have made a variety of style of films, and they richly deserved to win the Best Director's Award for the 2001 Cannes Film Festival (David Lynch also gladly deserved to win as well, but that's a different story). I feel that if the Academy gets their heads out of the clouds and into reality, they would finally recognize the directing duo with a award for Best Director and even Best Picture for this film, for this is another showcase of their brilliant work. THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE is a film that will be like most of the Coen Brothers films, some will love it, others will despise it. I for one, love all of the Coen Brothers films, and I will say that this film, is one that should be put on the must see list of their films as #2, only behind FARGO, and that's a great achievement! You'll be a darn fool to miss this film! ***** (out of five)</fullReview>

We have a film that is visually stunning, a beautiful Beethoven score and excellent acting from Thornton and McDormand.The noir touches are there to see, but this is a film that encapsulates the whole 1950s. Set in the same town Hitchcock set "Shadow Of a Doubt", it does draw upon a similar theme of an unlikely, unsuspected murderer.Rises from the talented portfolio of work, as one of the best 3 Coen Brothers films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Half the screenplay, TWICE the tedium!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I admit to being overly forgiving of the shortcomings of a lot of motion pictures. I usually understand the how and why of things that fall short of the desired goal, but in the case in question I will admit that I don't understand at all.Beautifully photographed, marvelously edited, visually well crafted, this was still cinematic tofu.There are a few movies from Europe that make it in the USA. A lot of European "films" don't travel well because they really lack content-- they are ninety minutes of film with forty minutes of story. The Man Who Wasn't There fully qualifies to join that club. The pace reminded me of winter molasses races where the spectators all leave before the finish. Pace should be a factor of story; only if the story is boring should the pace bore you also, so I must admit it fit. There was the promise of a story, but we never really got to the story of this barber, of how he didn't really have a life, but only existed in the same way a zero holds a place in a number-- maybe because the zero is important, and it has meaning. Ed, it appears, did not, and no matter what winks, nods, and nudges employed, we never really saw into Ed, we never saw why his life was empty, what role he had in the community, in family, or in anything. To tell the story of a nothing you have to tell the story of something, and they did not.We make a lot of jokes about sugar-free meaning flavor free, but in this case truth in advertising would lead to a tag line of "Beautiful look with half the screenplay and TWICE the tedium!" Who knows? It might sell tickets. Some people enjoy being bored.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Coens return to top form. After Fargo it seemed that the Coens were shooting straight for popular acceptance with their two (IMHO) weakest movies, The Big Lebowski and O Brother.This movie finally distances them from the couch critic crowd due to the fact that it strictly art-house fare. Make no mistake about it, this movie will make little money. It lacks the explosive suprises (and the sex) of American Beauty, a Hollywood film pretending to be an art film. But this film is so far better than American Beauty that any further mention of that film serves only to tarnish the film I'm reviewing now.The film is slow and ponderous. At the same time, it is brilliantly written and beautifully photographed as well as competently directed. The acting, as is to be expected, is top notch. This is hands-down the best Billy Bob Thornton movie since Slingblade, and he shines in role. He looks, acts, and even delivers his lines like Humphrey Bogart. It's clear the Coens are going for that look as Thornton's hair and costume strongly resembles that of the great Bogart.The cinematography deserves its own paragragh (and an Oscar). Deakins outdoes himself in this film. It is quite possibly the best looking black and white movie I have ever seen, and this is from somebody who adores and consumes b&amp;w film like candy. The composition and the textures are so sharp that you almost feel like you're watching the next evolution of film, even if it is good ol' black and white.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie from scene 1 and while I was aware of the slow pace, I could not tear my eyes away from the screen.The best movie released this year, Memento be damned.</fullReview>

Ed,is blackmailing his friend Big Dave, who's having an affair with his wife Doris. So that he can get $10,000.00 to open a dry cleaning business with his partner Tolliver. When Big Dave kills Tolliver thinking that he's blackmailing him only to find out that it's Ed! Ed then kills Big Dave when Big Dave tries to kill him! It's then that Ed's wife Doris gets arrested for killing Big Dave! Who killed Tolliver for whom the innocent Ed gets executed for killing! This is a short synopsis of a movie that is so laborious in it's story and it's acting that the audience will need a combination of pain killers and sleeping pills just to sit through it. With Billy Bob Thornton looking like an extra from "Night of the living Dead" who at the end of the movie when he's executed seem glad that it's finally over for him so he can get back to living. With Frances McDormand who has that look of shock on her face which gets more pronounced as the movie limps along. As if she didn't realize just how dull the script was until she signed to do it and now it's to late to back out. With Jon Polito who flipped his bird as well as his wig to end up being in the movie. And with James Grandolfini who when he's killed off, early in the film, he has that look of gratitude and relief on his face knowing that his pain and suffering by being in the movie is at last finally over.</fullReview>

There is not one single solitary person in the farcial drama that is likeable, except maybe for Scarlett Johanssen as a teen age young lady. The setting is in a small town in California where everyone is either unpleasant or unlikeable and at times very ethnically vulgar. In film noir films of the past, that I grew up on,they were fast &amp; you cared for nearly all the people in it.There was also much humour in them, there was no humour in this at all. The cast is large &amp; all the actors including Billy Bob Thornton, Frances McDormond, James Gandolfini, Tony Shalloub have given fine performances in other films. The only thing worthwhile in the film is the cinematography &amp; the sets.

Everything is just right up until the murder (I'm being vague out of consideration), but then the movie gets bogged down with the lawyer and his investigation. The subplot involving the girl and the piano just did not belong in the same film. I suppose I appreciated the way the movie tried to come around at the end by making Thornton's character pay for an one death after getting away with causing another (a la "The Postman Always Rings Twice"), but it takes so long to get there that it just doesn't have any kind of impact. And don't even get me started about the UFO. Yeah, that's right. The UFO.Noir's simple. You take an aimless man, have him carry out a desperate crime, and then watch him squirm as the walls start closing in. You keep it simple. I felt angry and cheated after "The Man Who Wasn't There" was over. My girlfriend suggested that the film wasn't so much a film noir as an *homage* to the film noir style. Maybe, but who wants to see that? Noir is my favorite of all genres. It is a genre so rarely made today that when someone does get together the right look, characters, and situations, I want to see it done right.</fullReview>

James Gandolfini plays the EXACT same character he plays in the Saprano's. Billy Bob gives the thickest performance of all time, I think. It's interesting for a spell, but MAN does it get old and boringly obtuse fast.There were some great bits. Tony Shalhoub was simply terrific as the high priced lawyer. Katherine Borowitz as Big Dave's wife almost stole the show when she turned away from Ed Crane after that mental part about the aliens, but that was all her character was allowed. Scarlett Johansson was good as Birdy, but as with several other, her parts were too insignificant, until a way-too-late-in-the-movie turn in her case. Same with Jon Politio, a GREAT actor with a great potential part, who is gone after 20 minutes of the movie.And what the hell was that part on the couch between Ed and Doris after her demise? An out of character Lynchian phase for the Coen's if you ask me. Unnecessary.I do have to admit, it was nice seeing Jon Polito and Michael Badalucco together again, first time since Miller's Crossing, I think!I absolutely ADORE the Coen Brothers. Every movie of their's I either loved wholly or, at the very least, was completely entertained by. (ok, save Crimewave, but that doesn't count.) But this overlong, thick, endless attempt at mystery-noir just left me uninterested, even in discussing it with friends afterward.

The Coen Brothers' pulpy fiction salute to James M. Cain focuses on dour barber Thornton (in an excellent turn here) circa 1949 whose nowhere existence takes a turn for the better/worse when he decides to invest in a dry cleaning business with shady goings on and a serpentine turn into a web of film noir deceit and homicide. Gorgeously lensed by premiere cinematographer Roger Deakins, who filmed in color and processed into richly textured, silvery black and white, giving the film a lustrous tone to the somber proceedings with a ghostly pallor. Strong supporting cast and a decidedly leisurely paced direction combine to keep the viewer focused to see what else is going on in the story at hand. Craftsmanship filmmaking indeed.</fullReview>

Finaly i think the main flaw was a lack of characters you wanted to see win (in fact the only characters that I liked were "Big Dave" who was killed in the first 40 mins and the "Young Man" Played by Abraham Benrubi who had aproximatly 3 lines)I'm sure this movie has it's audience, it just wasn't for me."I will perfect my own race of people.

		<shortDescription>Disappointing film noir pastiche.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A big disappointments for anyone who loved the wit and panache of "Oh Brother Where Art Thou?". Albeit beautifully acted, and great as a series of stills, the story moves at a funereal pace. As a pastiche of film noir it is intermittently amusing, though never engrossing, partly because it moves so slowly. If it had stopped 15 minutes earlier it might have passed as OK, but the last scenes were deplorable. Either the Coen Brothers were taking all this too seriously, or else not seriously enough. 2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Man Who Wasn't There: 8/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wished Billy Bob Thornton hadn't narrated the film because he was supposed to be a quiet character that kept everything to himself; a fine character crafted by the Coen brothers. Letting him narrate was probably the worst thing that you can do in this film. The genre is not well known now and it is obviously dated, but the Coens decided to do it anyways. They tapped on an unfamiliar genre and still succeeded to make it entertaining. Now given that it's not perfect (slow pacing, dull directing) and it may not be one of their best, The Man Who Wasn't There still has a great script and is a great tribute to the genre.There's an audio review of this film, check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Third time lucky..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recorded this film off TV a few months ago as I'm generally a big fan of the coen brothers and whilst I knew very little about this film (Its not one that many of my friends appear to have seen/talked about) it looked to have a strong cast and the idea of a Coen take on 1940s noir was pretty irresistible. However I must say when I first sat down and put the film on (I made the oft made mistake of putting a film that requires your full attention on whilst in the middle of doing various other things therefore not delivering my full attention) I found it cold and difficult to engage with. The cinematography is stunning and the beauty of the simple but effective slow paced shots with long shadows and lingering smoke kept me interested for a while but I could not engage with the dry conversation and seemingly low pace of the plot development to begin with. The main protagonist is quiet by his own admission and it seemed that his voice-overs were the only real plot driver (I had other things to do and twice didn't get past the first 40 minutes) However I now admit that I was completely wrong about this film and it took a night where I was too tired to move off the sofa and finally gave this film the attention it deserved to really appreciate it. There are strong characters and a slow developing but ultimately gripping set of plots and themes behind the initially cold dialogue and beautiful shots. At times it is surprising, sometimes shocking and on occasion darkly comic but once you have watched this film properly it will get under your skin in the same manner as many of the best coen films and you will spend time pondering its motifs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If The Outsider (A. Kamus) or K (F. Kafka) or even Mr Jones (Bob Dylan) ... was an American barber (living in California late 40s, early 50s...). It is a story about a barber (as per Joel's statement), in the late 40s in Santa Rosa California, who doesn't want to be a barber and wants to become a dry cleaner and in his attempt to become a dry cleaner he sets a chain of events in motion which have tragic consequences for everyone involved. A true Greek tragedy (very classic from this perspective)A top choice for your movies library (a film that you can watch over &amp; over again since it is simply not just an interesting story told well). Maybe too European for some of the US critics. Alas, certainly if they had devoted "half the time they spent" writing their piece "to even the most cursory investigation" of the references (movies, literature, concepts, commerce/market, philosophy, modern life in Western societies, music etc. etc.) of this movie then "perhaps", "perhaps" they'd be more useful to their readers. In any case, no need for a "crowd of spectators". A great opportunity to think and re-think... Each scene needs to be carefully watched, all dialogs have something to say (and can be re-used as such in day to day conversations), the barber always smokes but doesn't eat/drink, his clothes are always well ironed, he has strong feelings about things but can't seem to find a way to express himself, he needs a "way out of this place" but all his attempts are like those of the Trojans (Kavafis) etc. etc. Enjoy</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Someday, Somewhere, Someone Will Somehow Understand This Movie in The End !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many times I retreated, "do not write about it, you'd have questions more than answers", but to tell you the truth, I reached to a limit where firstly I want to explode, secondly I found some point of view to explain the case of this genuine stupid movie. It's the ultimate dream for any artist when he makes what he wants the way he wants. Sometimes we need to make something in specific as we desire and to hell with anyone or anything else. Here the Coen brothers extremely did it ! But it succeeded also at being that odious. And it's a real odious in itself, more than the matter of being understandable. I mean it's an original work, but believe me it's so stupid as well. It's not stupid because it made me see myself stupid in front of it, but really because it looks stupid and feels stupid. Actually, FOR MEEEEEEEEEEEEE, nothing was that watchable in here. It's all in the provocatively stony face, and the deliberately strange performance of Mr. Billy Bob Thornton. Totally disgusting. Don't bother yourself to connect anything with anyone, the intellectual status of the film looking so-deep-it's-mind-seductive but there is no logic or basically an enough enjoyment that pushes you to discover the whole mystery of this damn black and white film. Even the fine cinematography was like a great sail but without moving boat. It's so unbearable with almost enigmatic-for-being-enigmatic events. I hated the most the scene in which Scarlett Johansson is trying to contact orally with Thornton's sexual organs (!) it was dramatically or else the biggest crap I've ever seen here. The vague flashback about the wife was the most dull, and as for the UFO scene I deem it the most laughable for sure. Personally it's simple and so comfortable : this movie had exhausted me in thinking about it to reach to nothing but feeling so bad about its makers' intention to be so subjective, so not interested in people's opinions, or even the difficulty of delivering their own thoughts. In fact part of me is saying in loud defense : That's art Mr, and that's how the freedom of the artiest develops along the ages. But the other part surely says : That wasn't enjoyable, convincing, nor encouraging to feel any enjoyable or convincing goods it may have ! It's the most Coen's movie for the Coen brothers. They deserved to make something mad ? without the charming plot ? once for the fun of it. In non-sarcastic way this could be their most long-lived film too, as I believe many viewers will explore it, and maybe be crazy about it (some people actually claim that they understood and loved 2001 : A Space Odyssey !!??). Maybe someday someone will brief us "what the hell was that", and ironically that one could be me. However, I still have a certain stance against movies that want hard not to be understood or even amusing along the way. So if I figured out its genius meaning one day or not, both ways I didn't like it. If it's a Cult Favorite for some, it's definitely a Cult Detestable for me. (The Man Who Wasn't There) is one of the purest silliness I've ever experienced through a film. It managed to make me hate any meaning Was or Wasn't There. Truly : thanks for nothing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid but no classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Coen's finally try to do a noir. They've already done Preston Sturges and Screwball Comedies and have a thing for paying homage to movies from a bygone era. To their credit, they are very talented craftsmen and the camera-work is good. The cast also looks very 40's-50's. They plot is just up noir street as well. You can expect nothing less from the scripters of Blood Simple and Miller's Crossing.However, there are two notable failures. The first is the casting. Billy Bob Thornton just does not look like a noir hero and he's quiet throughout the movie. Hardly a handful of dialogue. Frances McDormand, great actress that she is, is hardly a femme fatale. Only the Sopranos guy and Tony Chalhoub look the part in their roles. The second problem is the dialogue. There is not one memorable one-liner thrown in. No wisecracks either and that is one thing a person always remembers from a noir film - the dialogue. Dialogue from 40's movies is quoted even today. Here its only meant to service the plot - no zing, no bitchiness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, what shall one say? Brilliant acting, brilliant photo, very clever script indeed and a fantastic remake of the 40s thriller movies in every detail, except for the graphic violence. Billy Bob Thornton must be one of America's best actors, without moving a muscle in his face, except for blowing out tobacco smoke.The one thing one might criticize is the philosophy in the end that put your thoughts away from the plain feeling. You want to feel simple and sophisticated, like the character Thornton is performing, but that puts you away from it. Otherwise, this would be a 9 at least.</fullReview>

The Brothers have an obvious eye for developing intriguing cinematic moments, but have never made a film without at least a couple of unforgivable, and objectionable artistic moments. In spite of the fact that the Brothers are art house favorites, this film is, no surprise to some, rated highest by teenagers on IMDB.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen "Big Lebowski", and I was crazy about it. It was a very funny and unusual film. After that, I saw "O Brother", and I found it still entertaining, yet a little bit strange. I liked the Odyssee-theme, so it was OK for me. I love film noir, so I bought "The man who wasn't there". What a disappointment! Sure, it has artistic values, the black and white images are great! Still, the story is very weak and progresses much too slowly. I wouldn't say that the actors did a bad job. Billy Bob Thornton was great, still, it couldn't make up for the weak story. Somehow, it seemed quite incoherent, not strange enough to be a farce, and not funny enough to be a comedy. I am quite disappointed. It might not be a bad film, but surely not what I expected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why all the acclaim?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite being a fan of the Coen brothers and their regular actors like the wonderful Frances McDormand, I was very disappointed in this film. It was boring, depressing and monotonous. And the pacing was glacial. In addition, I am very tired of Billy Bob Thornton's expressionless acting style, although it certainly fit the role he had to play here. There are few films I see in the theater that make me want to get up and leave--this was one of them. Had I not been with two other people, I would have left.The two redeeming features of this film were the period costumes and lovely cinematography. (There were one or two good lines or signature over-the-top touches as well.) They helped keep the movie from being a complete turkey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Don't Mind Slowly Paced or Quietly Meaningful - But This is Plain Dull</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is boring. Boring Boring Boring. And this is coming from someone who usually appreciates the Coen Brothers' movies. This from someone who has seen 'The English Patient' about three times and is planning to watch it again some day. This from someone who shakes their head when they hear people refusing to watch black and white films.When asked what this film is about, the Coens responded dryly that it is about a barber who wants to be a dry-cleaner. I liked that line. It's so Coen-ish. However, that may as well be the extent of the film. Billy Bob Thornton, a very underrated actor, pulls off the role of Ed Crane - a man who isn't really there. He has no real drive or passion for life. He just exists and watches those around him consume life in big gulps - his wife (Frances McDormand), her boss (Gandolfini), his brother in law (Badalucco) etc. Ed just watches these people go about their business like ants running around getting caught up in their own minor little worlds to no avail. Though I knew I was meant to side with Ed, I didn't. His detached passivity pervades the whole film like noxious gas. There are many great films about detached, alienated, underachieving protagonists. Yet this film, through Ed, successfully suffocates everything around him. I found myself trying to cling to the little pleasures - snippets of dialogue, the cinematography, Coen regular Jon Polito - but to no avail. While this film has things to say about life, meaning and perception, they aren't engaging at all and the lack of any cohesiveness is distracting. Time just passes and doesn't go anywhere. Things don't stick. My suggestion? watch other, more worthy Coen pictures instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Coen Brothers are in dire need of intervening help; so dire that they don't think they need any. They let their love for the Screen block any critical self-editing. TMWWT is a series of first acts to oldie-but-goodie film-noir ideas strung together in the apparent hopes of making another Euro-style statement on One Modern Man's Predicament. It merely comes across as what they are: ideas that the Coens don't dare let go for fear they will get away from them. A good many pulp-serials prove to be the same way when they're published in one-volume. The Coens have the right ingredients but they cook them wrong. TMWWT is great moviemaking but it's no movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kudos to the wonderful black-and-white cinematography. It's a throwback to the 1940s films and in some spots, looks just fabulous. Kudos, too, to Billy Bob Thornton for playing such a low-key role and yet still maintaining interest in his character all the way.However, Thornton and the camera-work can't make up for the slow, uninteresting story which desperately needed some of the usual Coen Brothers humor. It could have used some action, too. It just doesn't have enough of either to sustain interest. It's no surprise this movie bombed at the box office. The only people who praised it were the elitist critics, of course, who are afraid to criticize 'in" directors such as the Coens.I could put up with the slow story but I was disappointed to hear over 20 abuses of the Lord's name in vain, many by Frances McDormand, unfortunately. I lost some respect for her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The critic who didn't care</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ask yourself one question: Do you feel lucky, Coen?, to paraphrase a line from "Dirty Harry." To say that The Man Who Wasn't There is the first stinker to bear the Coen brothers name is questionable. A lot of people didn't care for Hudsucker Proxy, but it's a lot funnier and a lot more endearing than TMWWT. The Coens are misunderstood. First of all their name is pronounced "Cone" not "Co-hen," seeing as though they're Irish and not Jewish. That's not such a big deal. The fact that critics championed this film as post-noir is somewhat laughable. Like in the aforementioned HUDSUCKER, the Bros. Co-hinn's attempt to emulate an arcane cinematechnique results in an unintentional parody of the genre. While they can produce really good post-noir like Blood Simple and Fargo, TMWWT shows that they may be taking themselves a little too seriously. First of all, the plot relies on a seemingly endless series of unfeasible coincidences. The film itself relies on the viewer to take some pity on Billy Bob Thorton's Barber - an apologetic, monotonous, boring loser whose flirtatious wife, Frances McDormand, is perpetually having an affair. This is impossible because the character is difficult to understand. Thorton's performance makes this even more difficult, since he's so boring. He can't be funny - when he tries to be funny it's sad, and vice versa. Frances McDormand's character, who always seems to be drunk, is involved with Tony Soprano. Tony Soprano's wife is, apparently, insane. Now you know how it goes from here: somebody who's involved in something does something to somebody who's involved with someone who's involved in something somehow relate to the something that someone is doing to someone, and then, the end. Unfortunatley, after all the film-noir parody - yes, film noir parody - is over and done with, there's a tacked on plot with Ms. Lost in Translation in what i would call an unfortunate performance in the sense that she's too modern and too arrogant to be featured in a period piece. Thorton thinks she has a chance of making it, so he emotionally invests himself in ensuring a better life for this girl who wow's him with her ability to note read Beethoven. The courtroom scenes are the height of tedium. Calling this dramedy is a laugh. If you believe the lines "he said I was modern man" are anything other than comedy, you're sadly mistaken. The plot twists and turns so much - it doesn't make sense, and it isn't entertaining. The acting is bad, it's too long, it doesn't work as a comedy. Film noir is just about dark subject matter - sometimes the plots twist a lot, and spellbinds and creates more tension and mystery and confusion - that's what makes it great. Then finally, everything is explained at the end. This is the most unapologetically inarticulate of their genre-parodies. It isn't nearly a comment. It's a plea to a sedate audience that film noir plots should be lampooned for their dense, multi-faceted layers - more films like this should be made! Nothing is sacred anymore! The fact that some movies rely on many stories distilled and jam-packed together into two and 1/2 hours is funny! If this was a straight comedy, it would've worked. It ain't and it don't.</fullReview>

I would of had more familiar female actresses comprise the roles than their counterparts in the film. Billy Bob played a magnificent role in this film. The movie in black and white seemed to make his role of smoking his cigarette in his white barber robe seem more forceful. I thought the movie could of ended 20 minutes earlier and it would of had the same effect or a more meaningful ending after the accident.

There are jokes the "attentive" audience is supposed to get, like the scene where one of Billy Bob's customers is wearing a wig. "Hardly notice it's there." This is an allusion to Billy Bob's own wig, which most of us in the audience will not notice. And on and on.Filmmakers can be heavy-handed and repetitive and still make decent movies: David Lynch's "Mulholland Drive" is a case in point.

		<shortDescription>A Disappointing, Dull Film Noir...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Man Who Wasn't ThereFilm noirs have been done excellently over the past years, but not many are as great as they could be. That's why, after seeing commercials and reading reviews for `The Man Who Wasn't There,' I expected a lot from the film. Unfortunately, it was very disappointing.Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thornton) is second-hand at a barbershop in 1949. He `doesn't talk much,' he says `I just cut the hair.' Well, that's true. Ed Crane barely talks at all. The only thing we hear from him throughout the film is his strangely soft and unmoving voice-over narrative recalling the accounts of the past few weeks of his quiet life.  The story begins when Crane suspects that his wife (Academy Award Winner Frances McDormand) is having an affair with the rich manager of a clothing store, named Big Dave (James Gandolfini). After Crane hears about a dry cleaning scam from a customer, he blackmails Big Dave for ten thousand dollars to invest in the dry cleaning business. Unfortunately, Big Dave soon finds out who the blackmailer is, and in a moment of self-defense, Crane kills Big Dave. Now, Crane's wife has been convicted of murder, and everything in his life goes downhill from there on?`The Man Who Wasn't There' starts off very good. The beginning credits were more than reminiscent of the Humphrey Bogart era, and so was the calm voice-over by Thornton. I was instantly engaged in the story of this man living in a small town in California, and how his life could possibly get any worse. Well, after about an hour, the film had barely moved along at all. The pacing for this movie is very slow, and there are many films that could ? and should ? have been cut not only due to time, but because they paid nothing to the film's progress or character development in any way.Billy Bob Thornton is very good as Ed Crane, and uses the same quiet technique as he did with the character in `Sling Blade.' The movie is worth seeing just for his convincing performance.Frances McDormand is quite believable as his wife; the kind of small-town wife you always hear about. Bingo on Tuesday, alcohol throughout the week; she seems very depressed, and that is probably why she begins to have an affair with Big Dave. James Gandolfini would not be my first choice for the character of Big Dave, but he pulled it off quite nicely. The obese man proves he has more acting talent than just playing Tony Soprano (John Goodman would have made a nice choice for Big Dave, only because he is almost always in the Coen Brothers' films and it seems like they wrote the part for him. I'm surprised they didn't get him for the part ? maybe they tried and he refused?).Tony Shaloub (`Men In Black') plays the most enjoyable role of a big-town lawyer sent in to defend McDormand's character. He is wacky, enjoyable, and his crazy antics make the film. His are the only scenes I really laughed at. It seemed the most like a `Fargo Moment.' The Coen Brothers, creators of `Fargo' and the disappointing `O Brother, Where Art Thou,' wrote and directed this film (well, Joel directed, Ethan produced, they both wrote the script?). I was in the minority about `O Brother, Where Art Thou.' I thought the film was boring, slow-paced and weird (what was the ending all about?). `Fargo' was excellent, mainly because it was demented humor and a great script, with some great actors. This film, however, seems to be boasting `original' all over. It seems the brothers are trying to stuff their recent films with odd bits and pieces to make them original. Well, I didn't find it original.In the end, `The Man Who Wasn't There' is not a winner. It could have been, but after an hour the film seems to slow down to a miserably slow pace, without any good surprises (like no one saw the end coming?). How this got so much attention from the critics is beyond me, because it just seems like one of those `Look at me! I'm original!' films. That's two disappointing Coen Brothers films in a row. For me, at least.2.5/5 stars ? turn the movie off once you get an hour ? 1.5 hours into it?John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whew, what a disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was sucked in by the reviews, and even the scores from this database. I'm sorry, but the Cohen's deal didn't work this time. The movie certainly had the fresh plot line and offbeat nature that is classic Cohen, but as much as I tried to hang in there, it just never came to the point where I went wow, like I eventually did on Lebowski, and especially for 'O Brother', not to mention Fargo. Not this time. This one simply misses.Being a unique plotline, and offbeat is really intriguing when it works, but this one simply didn't. My recommendation: rent "o brother" again...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Are the Coens the new fashion? (Do we believe the Emperor is wearing clothes even if we don't see them?)Without exception (and I have seen "Blood Simple," "Fargo","Hudsucker Proxy," "O Brother Where Art Thou?," "Miller's Crossing" and tried 3 times to sit through "The Big Lebowski")I have been left cold by each story, telling myself (except for Hudsucker,which just stank, plain and simple)that they were evolving. I thought "Fargo" was funny in places (thought Margie was divine)but it went on too long. I tried "Miller's Crossing" because I like Gabriel Byrne and Mellissa Gay Harden. There were redeeming moments, but not many.Then too, I'm not particularly amused by seeing the same supporting characters over and over again. In fact, I find it distracting. These familiar faces never become lost in the character. It's simply Jon Polito, for example, playing another fat sleaze. I have tried to see a pattern in their films. I tried to find extenuating circumstances for the lack of entertainment value in a series of films which have obviously been painfully constructed. Problem is, all you see is how painstaking it is. I don't want to see the zipper in the back of the monster's suit. I want to be entertained. In a literate fashion, if possible, which this one strove to be, but not necessarily. I like silly stuff well enough -Loved, for example, "Beautician and the Beast," the new "Mummy" and its sequel. Even the Di Caprio "Man in the Iron Mask." I loved Billy Bob or Bille Ray or whoever he is, in "Primary Colors." He had a character there and he developed it. In this one, I KNOW he's the man of the title, but who gave a d---? Sure, he disappeared. Sure, he was supposed to. I GET it, but you know what? I think he was bored. I know I was.I think somebody decided the Coens were cool, or hip, or chic, and word of mouth has solemnly carried them along. The popcorn was great - just the right amount of butter - but the movie was really boring.Have you seen "The Others?" Incredible! Classy AND entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thornton once again the only good thing in a mediocre film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Self-consciously dry and offbeat drama of irony has barber Billy Bob Thornton involved with a con-man, a businessman who is having an affair with the barber's wife, and...a spaceship. Black-and-white offering from the hit-and-miss Coen Brothers has a streak of bemused malice, but the pacing is so deliberately slow and languorous that interest wanes in the final stretch. The script is filled with talky speeches that don't propel the plot, which isn't so slyly twisted (as one might expect). Possibly aware they were slipping into formula, the Coens tack on a silly, irreverent ending, which only makes it seem like they're now aping David Lynch. Joel and Ethan are certainly talented, and they're full of visual bravado, but the silvery cinematography doesn't reveal anything in particular (it's there to recall old film noir--and to be admired for that alone). Billy Bob Thornton is solid as usual, but this seems an inside joke. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the most boring movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like noir movies you MIGHT like this one. Otherwise, I would stay away. I'm pretty sure 90% of the people who like this movie are Coen fans who would like anything that they do, no matter how unwatchable, and defend them to the death. There are a couple of positives. Tony Shalhoub is always good, no matter what. Scarlett Johansson is good but it was distracting for me how much she looks like Laura Prepon in this movie. Oh, and the first couple of minutes were alright. Beyond that, sheer boredom.The Coens are just too hit or miss. Big Lebowski - my favorite movie Raising Arizona - also good Fargo/Oh Brother - barely watchable, incredibly overrated Man Who../Ladykillers/Hudsucker - soul-numbingly dullIf you like Man Who Wasn't There, good for you. But I just can't recommend this movie to anyone. According to the current IMDb rating I'm way off here, but I still think it's a movie only a select few people can enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst movies I have ever seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my mind, the Coen brothers have made one excellent movie: Barton Fink.Fargo: I still don't understand what the fuss was all about, I didn't think it was very funny. Blood Simple was a half successful thriller. The Big Lebowski had its moments, but it wasn't a good movie. Then we come to O' Brother, which doesn't interest me at all and this movie. It was awful. The story was just lame, with some really weird subplots (like the UFO). Billy Bob Thornton however, did an excellent job and James Gandolfini was good as always. It also looked great, in black and white. Tony Shalhoub had some funny moments, too. The big problem here is the story, which basically doesn't exist. The night before I went to see this movie, I saw Apocalypse Now Redux. I could certainly tell the difference!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The plot that wasn't there</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enigmatic title for a typically enigmatic Coen Brothers film, which like the few others of theirs I've seen, sort of passed me by. I think I got it as a homage to film noir, particularly Fritz Lang, referred to at one point by name and in another by the expressionistic lighting used in a prison cell scene, to Hollywood prison dramas and even, bizarrely and briefly, post-war science fiction cinema, although there are some adult scenes which could only belong in a latter-day movie.Told in extended flashback style by Billy-Bob Thornton's quiet man title character from Death Row where he awaits execution (for the wrong murder!), the convolutions of the twisting plot evolve as his dreams of striking it big financially disappear when fate, as it will, takes an unexpected turn.Exquisitely shot in black and white and with many striking images, such as the flying car crash-scene, the spinning tyre hub that morphs into a surgeon's head-light and finally the fade-to-white sequence of Thornton's execution, for me the main problem was the sheer passivity of Thornton's character which didn't engage me at all, plus as ever the tangential nature of the narrative had me flummoxed at times.The acting was suitably apposite to the era but I never doubted for a second that they were being moved about like pawns on a chessboard, Hitchcock-style, to satisfy the director's vision, so that most of the performances seemed one-dimensional to me. I did enjoy the use of Beethoven's piano-music, which certainly added an elegiac air to proceedings, but in the end, film-noir lover as I am, I wasn't sure if this was meant to be a homage or pastiche leaving me puzzled and unfulfilled in the final reckoning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of those love-it-or-loathe-it films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been a huge Coen Bros. fan since I saw Barton Fink on BBC2 - you know, back when BBC2 showed decent movies. Almost a decade has passed and I have done my damnedest to watch every single one of their films. I adored some of them so much that I watched them dozens of times over. Fargo, The Big Lebowski, Blood Simple, Miller's Crossing - these films were absolutely perfect, certainly the work of genius. Sadly, this particular film was a real ordeal.The Film That Wasn't There - sorry, did I get the title right? - struck me as a turgid, meandering, soullessly flat and contrived work. It felt like somebody was playing a cruel joke on me. The film seemed to drag on interminably, and my interest in the characters waned to nothing within about 30 minutes. Billy Bob Thornton's narration, conveyed in a dreadful Monsieur Waldemar-style death-croak, really started to grate, and I started to think: this is really, really ball-achingly awful.Several people I know have watched this film and loved it. They called it beautiful and funny. I didn't think that it was either of these things. If you take a bad film, with an unprepossessing script, a flimsy and derivative plot, and as boring and weightless a central character as you can imagine and top it off with a horrible death-rattle voice-over, shooting in in black and white to make it look like a classic is like putting icing on a Brian Bosworth movie. I felt extremely cynical after the film; yes, people smoking cigarettes in black and white looks lovely, but we've seen Schindler's List already. As I said, some people loved this film. People whose judgment I trust, even. It's one of those movies you have to see for yourself - you might think it's the best film for ages. Or you might, like me, want to take your ex-rental copy back to Blockbusters and try to get your ?2.95 back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thornton is the lynchpin in this old school noir flick by the Coens. Unfortunately, Thornton is a drab, laconic, and deadpan lynchpin stuck in a plodding story of murder, adultery, and other intrigues which is less than provocative, engaging, compelling or even interesting. On the upside, the flick is a good shoot, well crafted, well acted, etc. On the downside, we're given 90 minutes of boredom and no one to really care about....no hero, no villain, no action or shred or wisp or fragment of titillation...nada, zero, zip. Worth a look for but best saved for broadcast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I started watching this film and about 20 minutes in I was ready to switch it off. It was awful. I do understand the feeling Coen was trying to portray but never achieved it. Other reviewers have said the cinematography was what made the film and I say this is what destroyed it. Some examples.. A wide shot of the interrogation room. Although a technically good shot. it is a shot you never would have seen in a movie of the era it is suppose to mimic. Another example.. a scene of a bellboy walking into a hotel lobby, near the end of the film.. there are obvious shadows on the pillar from the set lighting that points out to the viewer that this is indeed a film and pulls you from the story. Another scene in the interrogation room where Billy Bob is standing and pacing in amongst shadows of prison bars. Now normally the affect is supposed to be subtle and almost unnoticed but this affect is so in your face, it makes it obvious .. Good story though. Although it just didn't connect with me... Sorry</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the reason why I'm no longer a 'huge' Coen brothers fan.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I couldn't keep my eyes awake through this movie. It's mostly slow moving and boring with some interesting parts put in, such as when Ed Crane murders his wife's boss and his wife gets blamed for it. The main concept of the story line is pretty interesting, I'll admit, but the presentation of the story just didn't do it for me. Furthermore, most of the film seems to be a simple dedication to older, better films, like Citizen Kane and Exotica. In fact, 'birdy' just seems to be taken directly from Sarah Polley's roles in both Exotica and The Sweet Hereafter; the main character escaping harsh reality through her music and other actions, and the accident. This may have been on done purposely, but after watching so many great movies and then seeing them done over in this movie is just clichd to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Huge disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a big fan of Billy Bob Thornton and having really enjoyed `O Brother, Where Art Thou?' (The last movie by the Coen brothers) I was expecting a lot of this movie. It started very slow but I expected it to eventually pick up. After almost 2 hours the credits began to roll and I found myself sitting in the Theatre thinking that I have just wasted 2 hours of my time. There was a lot of great potential but the only thing the writers seemed to accomplish was missing any and every opportunity to make the film at least semi enjoyable. This movie makes my top ten of the worst movies I have ever seen. Save yourself 2 hours and skip this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's a lesson in filmmaking one would have thought the Coen Brothers knew by now: great music, dramatic lighting and stellar performances do not a great film make.That's it, plain and simple. All the impeccable craftsmanship one comes to expect from Joel and Ethan and Roger (Deakins) are here, no question about it. Unfortunately they forgot one thing: a story that's actually worth a damn. A reason to make a movie beyond fashioning a nifty black and white film noir just for the hell of it... but that's apparently what they've done."Fargo" was never one of my favorite films... but it's a masterpiece in comparison. It has what this one doesn't: a point. Some sort of reason for being. It leaves the audience with something other than depression. It tells a crime story not unlike this one, but through it we gain insight into some tragic and funny characters. We see desperate people pay the price for their misdeeds. It's basically a crime-doesn't-pay story, but an unusual one seen through an unlikely protagonist: a pregnant police chief who outsmarts everyone the same way Columbo did... unexpectedly. "The Man Who Wasn't There" contains a similar crime-doesn't pay theme... but it rings hollow and flat. As opposed to William H. Macy's character in "Fargo," Ed Crane has no real reason to gain our sympathies... thus we don't really care what happens to him. He's basically dead already... so whether he gets caught or pays for his actions is irrelevant. And compared with Lester Burnham in "American Beauty," he takes no action and makes no change in his life. Lester Burnham started off "dead" too... but he changed. He took action. And that's the difference between a good story -- and sympathetic character -- and "The Man Who Wasn't There."Admittedly, he twists and turns in this film are clever. Deakins's cinematography is genius. The Beethoven sonatas are beautiful. And the entire cast -- including Lolitaesque, classical piano-playing Scarlett Johannson -- is excellent.But is there anyone who leaves the theater after this long, bleak film and NOT ask himself: "What was the point, exactly?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know exactly which people of my age gave this movie such high ratings, but it certainly isn't any 25 year olds I know. Now, I can see redeeming qualities in this movie, but it certainly is NOT to be viewed for anyone under 60. When I went with my girlfriend to see this movie, I immediately noticed that our combined ages were literally less than any one person in the theater besides us. I couldn't believe the number of old people, and the lack of young people who went to see this film. The black and white didn't bother me, but the complete pace of the movie was annoying. It started off slow. .... ... and kept that same pace. I've never left a movie early before, but I couldn't take it after the first hour. Anyone my age who sees this and gives it high ratings must be completely full of crap, as it is not something I can find one other person to like. It's a horrible movie with a SLOW and uninteresting plot. Relying on imdb's overall rating for this one was a WASTE OF TIME. It's obviously fixed. It's not worth the ticket price or the rental price. I wouldn't even watch it if the cable was out and it was the only DVD left in the world. Simply put, this movie is GARBAGE. You've been warned.</fullReview>
