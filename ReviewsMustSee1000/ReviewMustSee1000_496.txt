		<shortDescription>The Good German is an ironic comment on Good Americans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is an homage not only to the vocabulary of film noir , but also to its social and political genesis. Film Noir developed after World War II and was an outgrowth of both the cynicism that was generated by WW II because it turned out to need another war to be the war to end all wars.... and because of the enormous evil that World War II revealed in contradistinction to the sunny idealism of the American Project.Film Noir of the 40's and 50's was a reaction to WW II, but those films themselves were always crime stories about naive men dragged into terrible circumstances through the lure of seductive, dangerous women. But they were never about the war itself or anything to do with the war itself. WWII movies were patriotic paeans to heroism like 30 Seconds over Tokyo or the common man like A Walk in the Sun or home front heroism like Mrs. Mininver. Indeed only Casablanca itself, as exemplified early on by Rick's character was suffused with some of the cynicism that we see in film noir, but the reason Casablance is beloved is because the cynicism melts away in the the understanding that there is something greater than one's own preservation.What is wonderful about the Good German is that it is a Film Noir film about the War itself and also about war in general...then and now. The film and its concerns are not dated or meaningless, but very much of the moment.The film also pays visual homage to other movies of the era, from the warm hearted cynicism of Billy Wilder's A Foreign Affair with Jean Arthur as the parochial Congressperson (like in this film) and Marlene Dietrich as the dangerous vamp with a dark past. Roberto Rossellini's Germany:Year Zero, shot in postwar Berlin, shows how fear, deprivation and terror destroy the soul as ell as the body.The Congressman is not just a boob but a participant in the propagation of evil and the Good American General of Beau Bridges is anything but good. Indeed, as we know now Americans protected Nazis who could help us in terms of confronting the next evil--Communism and Russia. And the story they tell about the V-2 rocket is true. The Germans and Werner van Braun used up the lives and caused the deaths of Jewish and other POW's slave labor to create and launch them and we, in terms of the American occupation and the incipient CIA aka the OSS, helped mass murderers to safety.Even the lawyer Teitel, the man researching the Nuremberg Trials, whose sole purpose is to pursue Justice, can be compromised. Tobey Maguire was chosen to play the vicious, venal Tully because to most American audiences he, as Peter Parker, typifies the best of America. He is meant to be jarring to the audience. Lena, indeed is the vamp, but unlike old film noir like Out of the Past, she doesn't lead Jake on, Jake misleads himself about her. She is just a desperate woman struggling to survive. Some would say this is a movie about moral ambiguities, but I think it's not that ambiguous. The filmmakers have cast judgment on some of our post war behavior and found it wanting. The only romanticism in this movie is in the style, a valentine to the look of old movies; there is no romanticism in its view of America at war.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely mesmerizing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Soderberg is a hit-or-miss director. Either his films are acclaimed and loved by most, or they're infamous and hated. Having read the reviews, and having heard the negative buzz, I was expecting a miss. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised.The film was mesmerizing. Say what you will about it, you have to commend Soderbergh on his cinematography skills. Black and white hasn't looked this good since "The Man Who Wasn't There". It was so rich, with so many textures. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. Definitely some of the best looking cinematography I've seen this year.Also the score is great. It evokes just the right noir-ish atmosphere. The editing is crisp and clever. All of the technical elements of this movie are flawless.I heard people complain about the story and the acting. I thought the acting was great. Clooney looks like he just came out of the 50's. He reminded me of Cary Grant. Cate Blanchett is perfect as the femme fatale. I can't think of any better casting choices for an old school film noir than these two.I also thought the story was engaging, even though it was sometimes confusing. I loved the way the information was dispersed, and the fact that the film changes perspectives, and at different points it's narrated by different characters. Some of the revelations in the plot were really sophisticated.Making this film the way it was made, using old school techniques, lighting, camera lenses, etc. was a gutsy move. I applaud Soderbergh for his experimentation. And I thin it's a successful one - it really feels like a 50's film noir classic. I wouldn't say it's Soderbergh's best film, but it's certainly one of his his most unique ones, and a return to form after a string of failures. I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought The Good German was a terrific, thought-provoking, movie, an unsentimental view of what it costs to survive war, for nations and individuals. The cast is excellent: George Clooney is the solid American we know from old movies: not glamorous, not necessarily heroic, but good; Tobey Maguire turns the boy soldier cliché upside down. Cate Blanchett is delicate and beautiful, but colder than ice.Reporter Clooney comes to Berlin just as the war ends to work, and to find former lover Blanchett. Covering the Potsdam Conference, he uncovers a murder, and the fierce post-war battles between Russia and the U.S. to win Germany's scientists. The movie is filled with people willing to betray any good inclination for their causes, which range from enhanced military strength to a better life away from war-ravaged Germany. What's the price for Clooney's reporter, and is it worth the cost? I don't see how any thinking person can't find resonance in today's headlines!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>40's Movie styling does not a thriller make.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Soderbergh continues to experiment, but as with Solaris, it just doesn't pay off.Its clear that from the off that Soderbergh has set himself a strict mandate for this film, make it as much like a forties movie as possible. The music, the acting style, the lighting, the process shots and background paintings all give it a great look and feel. However, everything is so low key and downbeat that it fails to deliver any suspense or menace. What is essentially a modern thriller dressed as classic noir just isn't thrilling. The plot twist and turns but the drama is never heightened, the pace never seems to increase, it just plods along to its conclusion. Apart from the sex and swearing, the actors seem straight jacketed into their roles by the 40's styling seemingly because the script lacks any of the dry wit and charm you'd find in a genuine movie of this era. George Clooney for example has every little to do, his character has none of the snappy dialog you'd expect, given his Marlowe-esquire role in the plot. Soderbergh compounds matters by drawing an unfortunate comparison with Bogart. Though generally the acting was of the high quality you'd expect from such a sterling cast, it's difficult to empathise with their characters plights given the lack of suspense or melodrama.Overall the experiment fails to deliver anything other than a beautifully shot but unengaging film.Very disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not-so-good German</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A clever look: imitation vintage B-movie in black and white; Steven Soderbergh's appropriate, artful gimmick for this film set in Berlin in the immediate aftermath of WWII.Cate Blanchett turns in an apt theatrical performance given "The Bad German's" archly retro conceit. As the film's mother/whore femme fatale, Cate is sphinx-like, world-weary and made up like a drag queen at Mardi Gras. George Clooney, meanwhile, turns in his routine performance that is altogether too modern and casual. Put him in scrubs and he's ready again for the ER. Together, they create no chemistry nor any other natural science. Toby McGuire, as a sleazy, black-marketing GI, is so painfully hammy you'll find yourself begging for him to stop.The storyline is awkwardly developed and unnecessarily opaque, its characters cold and remote. There's really nobody to cheer for or identify with; no emotions to hook us into this world. When was the last time that international intrigue, on-screen, was so unintriguing? It's too bad we've been served such an exciting cinematic look -- an overly lit, noir-like one -- only as window dressing on a story as bleak and dreary as the blitzkrieged landscapes on view.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent story telling in the post World War II tradition of THE THIRD MAN</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best film to evoke the period in recent memory. Blanchett and Clooney lead a strong cast and make a better film than expected from the novel's source material. Archival newsreel footage of 1945 Berlin and black and white cinematography put to very effective use. Toby McGuire as a self-serving, mean spirited weasel shows another side of the usually boyish charmer. Beau Bridges well cast as the US army brass who bears a self-righteous similarity to contemporary military higher-ups who think they have a corner on deciding the right thing to do. Secrets, lies, love and intrigue woven together to form a provocative study of moral ambiguities and tough choices in wartime. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth seeing, but I wish it were better than it is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Soderbergh is a director with a decent amount of guts but not a lot of talent. Here he attempts to make a classic Hollywood film, reminiscent of The Third Man and Casablanca, by mimicking, or at least trying to mimic, the classical style of cinematography, by scratching the negative, having the dialogue recorded on mono (I think), and having the actors deliver performances along the lines of the studio days. The gimmick honestly doesn't work all that well. Lovers of classic films will notice how different the film-making is from that of the '40s. How hazy the cinematography is compared to Casablanca or The Third Man (it looks like you're watching a movie on a black and white television). Or how much more swearing and sexual content there is in the film. Yes, the gimmick is a weak one and somewhat detrimental to the rest of the film. Otherwise, it's a pretty good mystery. Not a great one. The pacing lags in the middle, and the mystery only starts to make sense right near the end, when much of the audience has stopped caring. The film's strongest asset is Cate Blanchett, who channels Marlene Dietrich. She is easily one of today's best actresses, and the only cinematographic triumph of the film is the lighting of her face ? she's drop-dead beautiful. I'll probably be hung by the nostalgists, but I'd take her ? in both her acting skills and beauty ? over the lead actresses of Casablanca and The Third Man. George Clooney is decent, but his character is fairly two-dimensional. He's a pretty boring hero. I really liked Tobey Maguire, though. His character was much more interesting, and I wish he could have been in the movie more. I absolutely loved the climactic sequence, but the film continues on for too long after that. Blanchett's big revelation at the end feels rather anticlimactic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Big Gimmick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once you get past the gimmick of black and white, about ten minutes into the film, I would say, the rest goes down hill. There is no explication as why characters act the way they do for most of the principal parts. Why for example is the Scottish bar keep so willing to do anything and everything for the Kate character? And, while we're at it, what is a Scot doing running a bar in post-war Berlin? Huh? What is Kate character's motivation for acting the way she does throughout the movie in terms of her husband? Practically everyone walks through his part and about an hour into the film, I was hoping I could make a fast exit but I was with friends. This movie goes absolutely no where, the plot is clichéd and trite and you would do better to feed the pigeons in the park for entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Black And White German</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was so aware of the attempted style of the film that I could hardly concentrate on anything else. The look, oh, the look. Clooney and Blanchet - Bergman, Bogart, shadows and fog. Pity. It could have been a tense war time thriller - Who is he? Where is he? What is it about? I was always mesmerized by questions like that on films that "The Good German" seems to want to emulate. Sodebergh is one my most recent favorites and one of the main reasons is because he is unafraid of taking chances. The question is, what are the chances taken for? I get more "Bubble" - sort of - than "The Good German" Blanchet is great to watch, she's Hildegarde Kneff and/or a lip-full Gloria Grahame but other than admire her right there on the screen I wasn't permitted to feel anything. George Clooney is just as solid in black and white as he is in color and Tobey McGuire - well, the best I can say is that his contribution is brief. What I took with me as the most valuable aspect of this experiment is/was Thomas Newman's classically colorful score.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effective Thriller With A Couple Of Flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went in to see this movie with expectations relatively low . The company I was in had dragged me to see INLAND EMPIRE which I am on record as saying was the worst movie I have paid to see . It should also be remembered that this movie had a very limited release both sides of the pond which considering has an Oscar winning director and three big names in the cast is not a good sign , so I went in with fairly low expectations Perhaps my low expectations worked in the film's favour because it's a very effective film noir/ political thriller . Soderberg has brought a metonym to the story . He directs in monochrome and has mixed his own filmed material with stock footage of a devastated Berlin . Remember all those old movies where someone is driving a car and it's painfully obvious that it's filmed on a studio set with back projection ? Well there's a scene featuring Toby McGuire and George Clooney in a jeep where the same technique is used . The film also contains a title sequence straight out of the 1940s and has scenes with an overlong shot duration same as film from yesteryear Unfortunately by doing this Soderbergh draws attention to the fact that Paul Attanasio's screenplay wasn't written in the 40s because there's a sex scene and several uses of the F word . If you're making a film that's a homage to 1940s cinema shouldn't you go the whole hog and write a screenplay in the same manner ? Hasn't the producer shot himself in the foot ? You'll be left scratching your head wondering why sex and bad language has been included Still it's a minor complaint and one that doesn't destroy the movie which has a plot and if you had no idea that Cate Blanchett has been cast as Lena Brandt then you'd genuinely believe that her character was played by a European actress . Blanchett is the best actress in the world today and the fact that she wasn't Oscar nominated is another symptom that the annual academy awards are becoming more and more worthless . Tobey McGuire as Tully is considered less effective mainly because he has a sex scene which brought the cry from a couple of my cinema companions " That under no circumstances should spidey be seen to have sex " but seeing as they were both females I'm sure they were upset that George Clooney didn't get the opportunity to do some on screen horizontal jogging . Students of film studies will know the term " Impact aesthetics " and there's a great example of this when Captain Geismer studies a hundred dollar bill which will have you jumping out of your seat in fright This is a fairly good thriller which while it isn't a film for everyone did hold my attention through its running time and despite it's somewhat retro formalist technique has me asking why it didn't get a wider release in both Britain and America ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still interesting, if over-ambitious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In true noir-ish fashion, much of the intrigue with The Good German is about to whom, and why, the title applies. For a film that has so much devotion to being a 40s recreation or homage, and in spite of another mesmerising performance from the very talented Cate Blanchett, it is also a mystery as to why it is not more of a runaway success.Employing the grainy black-and-white look of Good Night and Good Luck, only more so, The Good German is a formal exercise in original 40s technique. It uses as its subject 1945 Berlin and the nightmare scenarios of post-war safety. Blanchett plays Lena Brandt, a Jewish German, who attributes her amazing survival to being the ex-wife of an SS man. (She claims he is dead, by the way). Her boyfriend is the violent and abusive Patrick Tully, engagingly played by Tobey Maguire. But haunting her life is also good-guy George Clooney, in the shape of US Captain Jake Geismer. They go back a long way. In more than one sense, to put it delicately. He is disturbed to see her turning tricks as much as he is to see her hanging out with a low-life like Tully.Lena wants to get out of Berlin, but that is easier said than done. Our film is awash with intrigues as everyone individually tries to help her, but everyone also schemes against each other. Who is a war criminal and who is just an ordinary German? Understandably, no-one wants to be caught with their pants down, and everybody is in Lena's.Lena herself plays her cards very close to her chest. She only reveals her hand towards the end. As she takes over centre-stage, her story provides some tension and emotional ballast to a plot that is otherwise a bit lifeless. Disappointingly, the usually capable Clooney is the weak link in the acting. His usually charismatically chirpy, cheeky style seems anachronistic and makes him look both typecast and mis-cast. The part could have been written for Humphrey Bogart. There and many thematic and visual references to Casablanca. But Clooney's lack of gravitas highlights the film's stylistic weakness. The Good German is ponderous without conveying a seriousness of the subject matter and so ends up just seeming self-important.Beautiful noir-ish chiaroscuro lighting is a delicious hearkening back to more substantial classics of old. But, with the exception of Lena, the characters lack the moral ambiguity that was so characteristic of such films. Jake mentions, "the good old days - when you could tell who was the bad guy by who was shooting at you." But, although the line could have come out of the mouth of Bogart, it refers to a period and style of film-making that is a world away from what this tries to be.Lena (Cate Blanchett) is a mystery, and the film is worth seeing for this magnificent, towering performance, that is also a study in emotional complexity. Long-suffering, she oozes oceans of repressed emotion in a way to make Ingrid Bergman proud. Although more complex than female protagonists of 40s movies, she is still the most successful part of the whole homage.The story does have a little more subtlety than one might have expected, but I find it hard to imagine vast audiences wading through it joyfully until the pace eventually picks up enough to warrant serious interest. It's good to see the usually very capable Steven Soderbergh directing serious cinema again (instead of his Ocean's Eleven romps) but this over-ambitious project doesn't quite cut it. See it if you're a fan of Blanchett, or if you enjoy seeing Clooney getting beaten up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real yawner! Dull script....cinematography weak at best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wanted to like this film. I have always found the noir style appealing, but when the script is weak and the characters unlikeable as is the case in this very slow film, that noir style only adds to the tedium of the experience. I'm no photography expert, but the cinematography also has a very amateurish "look" like the film was developed at Walgreens. Nothing like the "look" of classic noir films. This is true right up to end of the film where the movie closes with a laughable imitation of the closing scene of "Casablanca," airport, trench coats, fog machine and all. Really, really bad! Some in our audience were actually laughing at this point. This scene alone took this movie from C- to D-. George Clooney never seems like Capt Geismer, he only seems like George Clooney in costume. George, you are gorgeous, but as an actor you are exceedingly dull. Unfortunately, you are as uninteresting on screen as Al Pacino, Humphrey Bogart, etc are interesting. George, go back to "Oceans Eleven" where you are at least somewhat believable. Cate Blanchet, I thought, was surprisingly poor as Lena. Somber to the point of depressing, she was an unlikeable and uninteresting character (and for some unknown reason, Cate seemed to "squint" throughout the entire movie, maybe that helped generate the unconvincing accent). Poor Cate seemed to be doing an almost comic bad imitation of Marlene Dietrich, but Cate really reminded me of Cloris Leachman as Frau Blucher in "Young Frankenstein" - Cate was soooo "serious" she came across as doing a comedy bit imitation. The best part of the film was the first few minutes...some very interesting original shots of the devastation of post-war Berlin. Unfortunately, this only lasted 5-10 minutes and gave way way to the devastation of a bad, dull script.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Third Men Don't Wear Plaid on a Night in Casablanca</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unforgivable pastiche of some infinitely better movies. George Clooney is a journalist sent to cover the 1945 Potsdam conference and in typical movie journalist fashion somehow manages to do no work whatsoever while being drawn into a web of mystery and intrigue. He's possibly the least effectual thriller hero of all time, more Holly Golightly than Holly Martins, and one of the few pleasures the film offers is wondering who will be the next character to jump him from behind and beat him senseless. Will it be the double amputee? The little boy with the bicycle? Absurdities abound, there's unforgivable misuse of narration and all the moody black-and-white photography in the world couldn't make up for a plot more full of holes than the buildings of post-War Berlin. All this could have been redeemed by a bit of chemistry between the leads or some lively pacing but everybody involved seems to be half asleep, possibly numbed into submission by the dreary sub-Elgarian score. The only good thing about this movie is that you leave with a greatly enhanced respect for the skill and sophistication of the bygone filmmakers whose work it so singularly fails to emulate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They don't make 'em like they used to - and this is why!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Good German is an interesting experiment on the part of George Clooney and Steven Soderbergh, an experiment that, like Solaris, just does not pay off at all. This time, Soderbergh has tried to recreate the classic 30s and 40s noir films, drawing particularly heavily on Casablanca and The Third Man. Shot in black and white, and even in 1.66.1 rather than today's traditional widescreen, the film is an attempt to recapture an old film-making magic, but unfortunately the magic is long gone, and as a result The Good German comes across as simply trying too hard to bring back the 40s style. Further, in the attempt to fully realise and recreate the traditional noir style, substance is sacrificed, resulting in a rather thin and uninteresting plot. The characters are dull 1-dimensional and unengaging, to the extant that it is hard to care what happens to any of them. It is an attempt to make a 40s noir as they would have been made without the Hayes Code's restrictions on sex, swearing and violence - but unfortunately this lack of restriction makes little difference to the film.There is little discernible 'plot' over a third into the film, but what plot there is(for want of a better term) revolves around a great deal of intrigue about a murder and a missing former SS man in Berlin during the Potsdam conference. Clooney is an American journalist who encounters an old flame (Blanchett) who is now accompanied by Clooney's driver - played by Tobey Maguire. While Clooney and Blanchett are rather bland, Maguire at least injects a mild amount of interest by playing against type as a rather vile driver in the army. The movie thus suffers greatly when he is killed off early. By the time the plot 'intrigue' started to resolve itself, I was past caring why people were searching for this man (who is also Blanchett's husband) and whether or not they found him. The film sacrifices substance for style - but unfortunately the style isn't exactly on the money. It all looks stylish enough in black and white, Soderbergh heavily uses shadow, to the extent that it is comparable to Joel Schumacher's overuse of dry ice and smoke in his 80s films.The final scene is almost a shot-for-shot recreation of the end of Casablanca, but rather than lending the film credibility it only serves to underline the deficiencies of the Good German in trying to measure up to the 1940s classic. Blanchett is no Bergman and Clooney sure isn't Humphrey Bogart! Overall the film starts out with an interesting aim but in the end comes over as a load of pretentious and uninteresting twaddle, trying to capture (or steal) the magic from a movie style long gone. Casablanca is timeless. This is shameless. And a real shame.</fullReview>

The book was excellent but the screenplay changed the characters so much that the movie was ruined for me. Lena was NOT a prostitute or a Jew and she didn't turn in other Jews for the Nazi's. Tully didn't even know Jake. The German cop was the good German. Emil Brandt was not a secretary or a good guy. Why make Lena a horrible person and then turn around and make her husband who was a horrible person someone who wanted to come clean. If you've read the book, don't bother with the movie.

It's one of those films that matter so little that they won't even be remembered for how bad they were but will instead be forgotten.And don't even get me started on the Casablanca references.</fullReview>

I blame the failure on a poorly written and adapted screen play, as the novel is wonderful.

Toby should stick to Spiderman roles, as he really bombs in this one. The best part was the usage of archival newsreel footage from post-war Berlin. George and Kate had no chemistry, and what was supposed to be a hart-warming love morphed into a mutual disgust exchange. The entire audiences at my showing booed the film at its conclusion, and that is a sure sign that something's gone wrong. Such a pity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sadly disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Good German is one of my favorite contemporary novels. Joseph Kanon is a beautiful writer. And I had high hopes for this one -- Cate Blanchette, Toby McGuire, and a host of international actors. (we forgive the casting of George Clooney). But Stephen Soderbergh directed, so I had faith. A real disappointment. The story was pretty much tossed out the window. All Soderbergh appeared interested in was creating a replica of a 1940's film. And it's practically a caricature of itself. Filmed in black and white but very grainy as though it were an old, old copy of a movie; hard to look at much of the time; over-scored to the point of silliness sometimes; performed very flat and one dimensionally -- an attempt at a style perhaps, but it all sounds like Johnny one-note. And worst of all, the point of the story is boiled down to syrup. Surely, Mr. Kanon compromised way too far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A director's indulgences turn a fine novel into an auteur's dream gone bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Good German, the novel by Joseph Kanon, is a first-class thriller that makes some serious points. The Good German, the movie by Steven Soderbergh, isn't and doesn't. Books and movies are different animals, and a fan is naive to think that the strengths of one can always be translated into the other. Director Soderbergh, in my view, in order to achieve two objectives doesn't even try. The first, notable only if the viewer hasn't read the book, is to change substantial elements of the plot and the characters for what seems no greater purpose than to create star roles for George Clooney and Tobey Maguire and "acting moments" for the two of them and Cate Blanchett. He also seems, as so many Hollywood factory philosophers seem compelled to do, to want to make obvious points about how awful some government actions can be, how hideous "end-justifies-the-means" activities are and how noble is the average guy, played by a Hollywood star lead, of course, in resisting all this. But much, much worse, Soderbergh has used The Good German as a toy. He has said he wanted to make the movie in the style of the old Forties movies. For the most part he shot everything on stage sets, used the old camera lenses, insisted on boom mikes for sound recording and played with the harsh light contrasts familiar from movies like The Third Man and the B-level noirs photographed by John Alton. He even was his own cinematographer and editor (under pseudonyms). What he came up with is a stilted drama so harshly lit that the movie is unpleasant to watch. The movie is a collection of deep, deep contrasts that give washed-out brightness, dead white faces and shadows so black anything might be happening. This must have been great fun for Soderbergh to create but it's hell for the movie viewer to sit through for nearly two hours. The story, set in Berlin in 1945 when the Potsdam Conference is just starting, is hugely visual. There are desperate civilians everywhere, GIs living high, bombed-out ruins, war criminals being hunted by both the Soviets and the Americans, not to punish but, if they were rocket scientists, to bring back home. Intrigue and corruption bubble just below the rotten surface of the city. And Jake Geisner, played by George Clooney, finds himself up to his neck in intrigue when he spots a former mistress, Lena Brandt (Cate Blanchett) and is assigned a GI driver, Patrick Tully (Tobey Maguire). Then a GI is murdered, which leads Geisner into some dangerous situations and some moral conflicts. Unfortunately, among all the specious changes Soderbergh makes in the story-line, the worst is the conclusion. Instead of a satisfying bit of justice served up with irony, as in the book, we have an irrelevant bit of knowledge tossed at us that serves no purpose but to create another acting moment for Clooney and Blanchett. For me, even if I hadn't read the book this movie would have been a disappointment. It's an auteur's dream of a director's Hollywood clout, but gone bad. If Soderbergh doesn't get his act together soon, he'll wind up as a cautionary tale of talent being indulged, corrupted and wasted. I can't think of a movie of his I've seen since Out of Sight and The Limey that did much for me. Amid the Berlin debris, however, is the performance of Cate Blanchett. She looks awful in Soderbergh's unforgiving lighting and it's obvious at times that she's trying to channel Marlene Dietrich. Still, when she finally settles down into the part Blanchett gives a fine performance. For those who like to read thrillers and are intrigued with Germany right after the end of WWII, you won't do better than Ross Thomas' The Eighth Dwarf. And for those who want to see how dramatic lighting can really be used, try The Third Man or some of Alton's noirs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I know what Soderbergh is doing here. That doesn't mean I have to like it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Good German is an experiment gone horribly, horribly wrong, like Frankenstein's Monster or Crystal Pepsi. Director Stephen Soderbergh somehow got it into his head to mimic films from the 1940s. Not be inspired by them or pay homage to them, but literally imitate their look and sound and feel. I'm not sure that's a good idea in the first place and then Soderbergh does it in such a self-conscious, grating and ponderous fashion that he creates a film that is, to all intents and purposes, unwatchable.Jake Geismer (George Clooney) is a war correspondent sent to post-WWII Berlin to cover the Potsdam conference of Truman, Churchill and Stalin. It's a good thing there were other reporters there because Jake completely blows off that historic event to instead get mixed up in a simple yet confusing mystery involving his older German lover Lena Brandt (Cate Blanchett) and a rough-edged Army corporal named Tully (Tobey Maguire). Lena desperately wants to get out of Berlin and there are more than a few men willing to help her, some out of love and others for her help in keeping a secret. The unfocused story touches rather ham handedly on collective German guilt over the Holocaust, the first rumblings of the Cold War, the Nazi contribution to the U.S. missile program, life in the rubble of post-War Berlin and Jake Geismer being the biggest wuss in Europe. Seriously, Geismer gets his ass kicked so regularly it's like a running gag, except this movie isn't a comedy.I wasn't exaggerating when I described The Good German as a bad replica of a 1940s film. It's in black-and-white and Soderbergh uses the same sort of camera work, lighting and stage blocking as that era. He incessantly blasts scenes with the same kind of melodramatic theme music as that time. The movie is littered with stock footage of post-War Germany. Soderbergh even uses 1940's style editing techniques to segue from one scene to another. If that sort of overdrive nostalgia sounds like it might be neat, trust me. It's not.The problem is that all that effort is painfully purposeless. There's no point at all to any of that cinematic affectation. It doesn't lead anywhere or do anything to enhance the story. There's no metacommentary of any sort at work here. It's just a 21st century filmmaker apparently entertaining himself by regurgitating nearly 60 year old cinema. Imagine seeing modern NBA players trying to replicate on the court the way players shot, dribbled and passed back in the 1940s. It would look artificial and forced and out of sync. That's a great description of The Good German.Making matters worse, Soderbergh was apparently so caught up in his duplication efforts that he didn't notice that his story meanders and stops making sense at a couple points. He was also oblivious to his three big stars giving atrocious performances. Tobey Maguire's acting ranges from looking like he's reading off cue cards to raging like a meth addict who just smoked some crank. George Clooney is essentially doing a time traveling version of Danny Ocean. And Cate Blanchett seems to be focusing all her energy into speaking two octaves lower than her normal voice.It was a struggle to make it all the way through this movie. Like being stuck in a time warp where the seconds become minutes and the minutes become hours, the length of this film stretched out longer than the Pleistocene Era. I started to root for everyone to die in an anachronistic atomic explosion, just so this bleepin' piece of crap would end.One thing this film does prove is the old adage that when it comes to making movies, nobody knows nothing'. Soderbergh and Clooney have teamed up to do some excellent work and then they collaborate on this punishing waste of time and money.Stay far away from The Good German.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The same old story where the book is terrific and Hollywood's version can't do it justice. They altered the story and did away with characters that were critical to the plot. George Clooney was unconvincing in the lead role and should stick with TV or "O Brother Where Art Thou?" type of roles. He is not a heavy weight enough actor to pull off this role. I tried not to get excited about this film fearing it would not come close to the book. A little pessimism goes a long way. As it turns out this film did not even come close to building the suspense generated by the book.Read the book and file the film under "F" for forgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good idea, carried out somewhat badly.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clooney is bandied about by the red carpet wags as today's answer to Cary Grant and Clark Gable and, though he indeed always does look smashing, that does not mean he is capable of exhibiting the old world movie star acting that a film like this one calls for. Here, he plays an American officer sent to post WWII Berlin to cover a peace conference who decides to seek out a former lover (Blanchett) while he's there. It turns out, a little too coincidentally, that his driver Maquire also knows her and is carrying on his own affair with her. Blanchett is a woman of many secrets and the more Clooney tries to investigate what's happening with her, the more trouble he finds himself in. He winds up with practically everyone around him, from the Americans to the Soviets, ready to snuff him out as quickly as they can. The film is an experiment. Director Soderbergh set out to recreate the style and technique of 1940's noir film-making and eschewed the use of today's lighting and sound technology, as well as other attributes such as location filming. Clooney more than possesses the classic movie star looks, but his portrayal offers no nods to the past. His walk, his sense of rhythm and his manner are all mostly contemporary, so there's a conflict in presentation from the get-go. If he is less than desirable, than Maguire is nothing short of reprehensible. He's hammy, inappropriate and helplessly 2006 in every aspect of his acting. (These discrepancies are not helped by the inexplicable decision to have the screenplay riddled with expletives that seem terribly out of place within the film, whether they were around in 1945 or not.) In contrast, Blanchett is completely at home and expertly provides the film with the type of character, look and performance that might be found in a film from that era. She completely invests herself in the realm and is easily the best thing about the movie. Bridges and Thompson appear in small roles as confident, potentially shady authority figures. Thompson disappears more into his characterization than Bridges does, but Bridges is all right. Another decent, if contemporary portrayal is turned in by Orser as an army pal of Clooney's who assists him with some investigative details. Oliver, as Blanchett's spouse, is only a couple of years younger than her in real life, but could almost pass for her son! The black and white cinematography varies from striking and evocative to muddy and dull. There is some admirable and interesting art direction, production design and set work. Newman supplies an authentically stirring score though the film ultimately winds up being mostly unworthy of it. It's as if Soderbergh came up with a great idea to pay homage to the great films of the past and then shot himself in the foot through bad decision-making and poor casting (though it's become nearly obligatory by now for his films to star Clooney, he could have at least directed him to a more bit appropriate performance.) The result is a film that bores fans of current movies and disappoints fans of old Hollywood product. The revelations, meant to jolt the viewer, sadly seem a little tame in light of other prior films, not the least of which include "Sophie's Choice" from nearly 25 years earlier! It isn't a complete washout, but certainly falls short.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Homage or Pastiche?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure about the answer to my question. With its stylistic nods to 40's noir thrillers like "Notorious", "The Third Man", "Gilda" and at the end, "Casablanca", "The Good German" aims high but ultimately falls flat under the weight of an incomprehensible plot peopled by too many characters. Moreover, none of said characters evinces any sympathy so that as the body-count mounts up towards the end and even as Clooney and Blanchett remain standing to take their relationship who knows where, ultimately you don't really care either way, distracted as you are by the various cinematic reference points - I even detected an in-joke at the expense of "The Pianist". The film is beautifully shot with many attractive framing and tracking shots in luminous monochrome, but the acting quality is distinctly mixed, with Clooney never quite achieving Joseph Cotten standards as he takes hits from almost everyone in sight and Blanchett struggling to emote beyond her sub-Deitrich accent. Tobey Maguire seems to me altogether too typecast in his winsome underdog parts ("Spider Man", "Sea Biscuit") to wholly convince as Clooney's somewhat callous, duplicitous driver who gets in too deep and you don't believe Blanchett's even thinly-veiled attraction to him either. I did enjoy the nostalgic tricks employed by Soderburgh, for example the left to right dissolves between scenes and the musical motifs which accompany the various characters but there are also too many shots of Clooney walking off-shot, or tossing away a cigarette or worst just gazing into space. All told, you'd be better off renting out one of the source movies mentioned above to see how it should be done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I walked into the theater I was very excited to see this movie because I am a big fan of the movies that The Good German is based on. I was so disappointed by it. I personally thought that the plot was strange and hard to keep track of, there was absolutely no depth to George Clooney's or Tobey Maguire's performance. Cate Blanchett was beautiful as always. I know what the director was trying to achieve, but I thought that instead of using the film as art, it was at many times overexposed and somewhat silly. The references to Casablanca were nice, but I felt that many times they were silly. I won't give them away, but they are obvious, right down to the movie's poster. There was nothing particularly attention grabbing about this movie, and when the ending came, I laughed.</fullReview>

Apparently this means the actors swear every other word, which doesn't make it contemporary just dull and lacking in imagination. Cate Blanchett is okay although she has certainly been better elsewhere, but George Clooney is arch and affected while Tobey Maguire, usually a fine actor when properly cast is completely miscast, out of his depth and awful.

This movie has the worst plot, and spoilers, the plot doesn't go anywhere, it just shoves in this piece of rubbish on building weapons and killing scientists. Soderbergh tries to do the old filmmaking tricks from the 40s, but they just fall flat and look stupid. When he does the old zoom in on a letter, with the black boxes around it like in the 40s films, you can't even read what the letter says, it's that terrible.It's a waste of time, don't bother with it, even with the cast, Toby Maguire is terrible, Clooney isn't anything special and everyone else is just forgettable.I'm surprised more people don't like this film for what it represents.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The veneer of neo-noir techniques and B&amp;W cinematography can't conceal the many shortcomings of "The Good German". It's little more than a formulaic retread with none of its characters particularly sympathetic or likable - and worse yet - their activities and behavior make little sense. Tobey Maguire does a nice turn against type as a venal opportunist, but everybody else plows through the script like robot actors supplied by Central Casting. The plot is full of implausible schemes and betrayals which try to elevate the film from its rut of conventionality. Eventually the treacherous conspiracies culminate in the breathless pursuit of a stock villain which is no better than the standard climactic chase routines seen a thousand times previously. Soderbergh has the ability to produce challenging and original films, but he frequently turns out slick uninspiring products. This is one of his worst.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Intentionally imitating the movie aesthetics of something like Roberto Rossellini's Germania Anno Zero during the opening credits and then looking like a noir right afterwards, Soderbergh's latest starts off seeming like it might turn out to be a gem. It keeps that illusion in the viewer for about the first 15-20 minutes, and instead gets progressively more unengaging and unremarkable with every passing minute, finally leaving you virtually indifferent by the end. Convoluted plots must work extra hard to avoid gaping plot holes ? this one didn't work hard enough. The Good German hides behind an aura of mystery which quickly crumbles away as one unlikely twist starts following hot at the heels of another one, eventually testing the viewer's willingness to suspend his disbelief.***SPOILER***: Personally, my biggest disappointment was realising that the entire movie rested upon a very unlikely premise: that of an SS Officer having been married to a Jewish woman. This is simply historically impossible, as generous as one may want to be towards the movie. ***END OF SPOILER*** The Good German is apparently based upon true events, but the character played by Cate Blanchett was actually a combination of two real women: a Jewish one and an Aryan, an SS Officer's wife. In order to heighten the drama, the movie's writers made the latter become a Jewish SS Officer's wife. A melodramatic, historically unlikely gimmick for a central premise is not what good, solidly scripted movies are usually based upon. Meanwhile, George Clooney tried his best in his undefinable role, but at least Tobey Maguire made a very convincing prat. Perhaps the most remarkable player in this was accidentally Ravil Isyanov in his supporting role as the Russian General Sikorsky, who also has some of the best lines.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Good German The versatile director Steven Soderbergh has carved a niche for himself with his style and bringing together good star-cast ? remember Ocean's series? The Good German has George Clooney, Cate Blanchett and Tobey Maguire (Spiderman). This was enough for me to choose to see this movie.The story is about an American military journalist Jacob (George Clooney) who comes to Berlin after the World War II and gets entangled in a mystery of Lena Brandt (Cate Blanchett), her husband Emil Brandt, and her lover Patrick (Tobey Maguire). As audience it takes a bit of time to understand several characters and plots; and what is going on in the movie. The movie becomes much tighter in the last 20 minutes but by then Steven has lost the score.The irony of the movie is depicted by a line told at the end of the movie by Cate Blanchett, something like ? "?at last the puzzle is now solved!" I think Steven understood that the movie was too over the top and must have forced this line on Cate to give the audience a clear message that the movie is over now! Steven also provides a special tonal value to his screen canvass. This time he comes with a black and white 1930's look to this movie, with high contrast. The musical score also is lifted from the same era. All the actors have acted well and no special mention is required of any outstanding actor. Some studio set scenes are prominently visible in the film, which should have been avoided.I was expecting a better movie and it did not fit to my expectations (Stars 5.5 out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All style, little substance. A clumsy disappointment that besmirches the great actors in it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I LOVE Cate Blanchet, and George Clooney--- two of my favourite actors. Beau Bridges is a fave as well. But I was very disappointed in this movie. It's not the actors' fault, they evidently did what they were directed to do. Maybe the director had a very good vision for this movie? But what I saw was so thick with style it was choking me. And the style was empty. The mechanism of the 'movie' underneath it was very clumsy. Nothing was believable. The 'plot' didn't work. For example--- George Clooney kept getting beat up by practically everybody. His character was beaten, robbed, and disrespected in practically every scene, and he never once lifted a finger to demand respect, either as a captain in the US Army (albeit a War Correspondent, but still, a legal captain), or as even as a man.For example, the choice for black and white. I get it--- World War II, the 1940s, film noir--- duh. But the 1940s weren't black and white for the people living THEN, now was it? Immediate post-war Berlin might have been a gritty and hard scrabble place to be. But we, the modern and current audience, could not really see it, in this dim and blurry phony-atmosphere--- instead, we saw an ECHO of an old movie format from that era. I didn't want to taste what MOVIES were like then--- I wanted to taste what LIFE was like then (that is, for these particular characters).I don't object to the depression and low-life miasma of the characters in this movie. I accept that the sleazy politics and questionable behind-the-scenes duplicity and hypocrisy, etc., was real. I DO object, however, to a plot that doesn't work. I DO object to a movie like this one that violates its own laws of logic, and moves around so clumsily that it borders on the stupid.George Clooney and Cate Blanchet are so good that I could believe both of them. Unfortunately, they were in a movie world that was lame, dumb, illogical, and so poorly executed that their stellar presences, including that of the great Beau Bridges, as well, were worse than wasted--- they were besmirched. Shame on Steven Soderbergh, for his arrogance in proceeding full blast on this clunker without proper care and preparation, resulting in this half-a**ed stab at 'artsy grit'. Save your money and your time, and just say, perhaps regretfully and sadly, NO to this piece of rubbish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Surely you know that sensation while driving where you awake from a daydream, eyes glazed and complete unaware of how you got there. It is a strange feeling -- you clearly went though the motions, yet you cannot recall much about it. Essentially, that is what happened to me during this film. I know I sat through it... but somewhere along the way, I just tuned out.I have to admit that Steven Soderbergh's "The Good German" seemed, on the surface, to be one of the most intriguing films of 2006. It was easily one of my ten most anticipated movies during Oscar season. After all, what's not to like about a Soderbergh recreation of a 1940's production, using original equipment from that decade, shooting in a style reminiscent of "Casablanca" and having George Clooney and Cate Blanchett deliver lines like Bogart and Dietrich. It all sounded so magnificent to me.Unfortunately, this effort suffers from a veritable host of maladies. The plot is uninvolving and convoluted. The characters are balls of lint blowing in the breeze. The casting is questionable. The pace is lethargic beyond belief. The score is supremely forgettable. And the direction feels more like an experiment in 1940's imitation than it does a tangible exercise is cinematic storytelling."The Good German" is a young girl playing dress-up with Mommy's stuff -- nothing fits right and the make-up is applied too liberally. It all reeks of experimentation rather than execution. The effort is admirable, even cutely adorable... but you can't go out in public like that and expect to be taken seriously.To quickly mention the plot, almost out of habit rather than necessity, Clooney returns to Berlin just as WWII has ended. It is a corrupt city, overflowing with those who are looking for a quick buck. Tobey Maguire is his assigned driver and one of the aforementioned scammers. Cate Blanchett is the femme-fatale, married to a man that everyone seems to be after for one reason or another, and she is also fooling around with Maguire. Clooney and Blanchett have a past together. Secrets are being bantered around like currency. People get killed. Double-crosses and sub-plot intrigues rear their ugly heads. Exposition here. Exposition there. Blah, blah, blah. I forget the rest.Blanchett is the standout in the cast. She really goes for it and pulls off a nifty performance that feels "in place and in time" with the goal of the movie. Clooney has always struck me as an "old school" movie star -- but he seems too contemporary for this era. There is a smarmy confidence about him, most notable in the "Ocean's Eleven" series, that oozes out of every pore. It is very un-Cary Grant-like. And don't get me started on Tobey Maguire... So utterly miscast in every conceivable way. He looks like a greasy zit-faced teenager, rattling off lines with a baby's voice. He cannot pull this role off under any circumstances. Maguire is the antithesis of 1940's style and sophistication.Overall, "The Good German" is a nice tip of the cap to a wonderful era... and nothing more. It strikes me as an American Idol contestant trying to do Sinatra. The intent is commendable. The result is a shame. It looks nice in parts, but it really helps accentuate the brilliance of classics like "Casablanca" and "The Third Man"... Films whose authentic class and elegance appear effortless in comparison.TC Candler IndependentCritics.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imitation may be a form of flattery, but "The Good German" is such a cheap imitation of "Casablanca" that it comes off as a spoof. Here are some of the many elements found in both films: 1. A man and a woman are trying to get out of a country. 2. They are blocked by a foreign power. 3. The woman is married to a heroic man who is wanted by the enemy. 4. The woman is a former lover of the leading man. 5. The leading man feels rejected by the woman, but still wants her. 6. The leading man is a "reluctant hero". 7. The leading man helps the woman leave the country. 8. The woman pulls a gun on the leading man so she can escape. 9. Government agents are cynical and corrupt. 10.The ex-lovers say good-by at an airport. The main difference between the films: "Casablanca" is marvelous because the acting is convincing and the dialogue is gripping. "The Good German" is boring and the acting is wooden.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read the book, then saw the movie and cannot for the life of me figure out why screenwriters/producers/directors, et al take a perfectly good story and bastardize it all to hell! The only resemblance between the book and movie is the title and the character's names. How disappointing the movie was, they combined subplots into the main plot, distorted the main characters and made it something it wasn't. Generally books are better than movies, granted, but in this case they aren't even in the same universe, not even a parallel one. The music was overkill, nothing like a 40's flick. Overall, a HUGE disappointment! Don't waste your time/money. Read the book instead!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There isn't too much to say at the moment except that "The Good German" probably won't be getting as much Oscar buzz as one would've expected. With that said, there is no denying the fact that the visuals are mind-blowing. The black and white imagery gives the film a respectable amount of artistic merit, particularly whenever Cate Blanchett is on screen. Ms. Blanchett has never looked finer, and her German accent(in the film) is spot-on. George Clooney also impresses by mimicking the essence of the great Humphrey Bogart. Tobey Maguire feels oddly miscast, yet impresses at the same time. With all that said though, "The Good German" will only achieve greatness to some fans, and that is because the film itself only achieves the level of greatness when viewed as a worthy tribute to the marvelous "Casablanca." Otherwise, this new Clooney film will ooze to viewers as a stylish, but hollow film. Still, "The Good German" is a refreshing alternative to the predictable fare that we see nowadays.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorry Soderbergh, I see what you were doing and WHAT you're doing is cool. But the product isn't there. The performances are bad (with the exception of Blanchett who is always worth watching), the script doesn't really work, the story isn't compelling, and the world that is set up in the film isn't consistent. He spoke after the screening and he's a charismatic and compelling guy. I really have a lot of respect for him and the body of work he has accumulated. He always directs, shoots, and edits his films ... and in this instance, that could be part of the problem. I know that when I'm doing everything ... something has to suffer and in this case, it's the performances. As a filmmaker myself, it's hard not to be a fan of his. I'm watching the Limey as I write this ... but he's experimental and this experiment didn't work (IMHO). That said ... the film did look great and the use of shots and camera movement was flawless ... but that wasn't enough to engage me. Oh well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler warningI am very bothered by this film. I just saw the movie and they completed gutted the book. Took out the less pleasant aspects of the book so that the movie would be more like Casablanca. Instead of what it really was. A story about a murder cover up and a conspiracy to white wash Nazi scientists.' In the book no one cares about Tully's death and in fact the government does it sweep it under the rung. Emil is a S.S Nazi member who tries to kill jack over the notes about the camp. Lena turning other Jewish people to the Gestapo is treated to casually. In the book the women who did that get's tried as a war criminal. This movies changes major plot points to make it more neat and tidy. They took a great book and turned it in to pretentious Oscar bait. And it's terrible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Humphrey Bogart. Lauren Bacall. Katherine Hepburn. Those are some of the big names that one would find at home in the movies that Steven Sodebergh is trying to channel with "The Good German." It has the look down right (except for the sharper picture and sound, it looks exactly like a movie from the 40's), but it doesn't FEEL like one of those classics. And although I have to give credit to Sodebergh for his successes with this film, most of the failures with this film are his fault too.Jake Geismar (George Clooney) is a military journalist sent to cover the peace conference at the end of the German involvement in WWII. There he runs into his old flame, Lena Brandt (Cate Blanchett), who's dating his driver, Tully (Tobey Maguire). But after a murder takes place, Geismar is pulled into a mystery that centers around Lena.The main problem with "The Good German" is the way Sodebergh elects to tell the story. He switches points of view when it's not necessary (in fact, most of Tully's part could have been written out completely-I'm thinking that his part was expanded to have another big name in the cast); the only person we need center on is Geismar, and seeing everything from his point of view would have made it all more mysterious. Also, the story can get a little confusing at times, and the characters' backstories often don't make much sense.The acting ranges from great to out of place. The best thing "The Good German" has going for it is Cate Blanchett. She has the look and feel of a dame from this kind of a movie down pat. Less successful is George Clooney, but he's not bad. Tobey Maguire, on the other hand, simply isn't right for the part. He doesn't understand the acting style that is needed to fit in for a movie like this. Leland Orser is in the same boat as Clooney: not bad, but could be better. Everyone else fits right in.What Steven Sodebergh has attempted is ambitious, but his storytelling faults hold the film back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Soderbergh missed the mark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So many aspects of this film gnawed at me, leaving me with the feeling throughout the whole movie that Soderbergh had missed the mark. Silently, I kept thinking, "he got it all wrong." The film noir look in an attempt to capture the essence of Kanon's novel lacked the heart and soul of his work. The characters appeared lifeless, their personalities subdued as if necessarily neglected to maintain the moral ambiguity throughout the movie and to demonstrate America's selfish post-war agenda. But it's through the complexity of characters, their unambiguous passions and actions, that makes the moral ambiguity more dramatic. I should have felt the same passions and struggle that Jake Geismar felt when he was challenged to see what he did not want to see and to suspend judgment on the insidious behavior of the characters around him, including the woman he pined for. I should have felt the same struggle in Lena Brandt's attempt to find congruity between her past and her basic goodness, a light in her that Jake refused to let die. Without this tension it was too easy to judge the characters. Lena was a desperate woman and Jake a maverick, with little more needed to explain their personalities. Perhaps too much footage ended up on the cutting room floor. Also Tully, played by Toby Maguire, was a bad boy who's purpose in the plot was limited to portraying the arrogance, greed, and violence propagated by the post-war lack of law and order. But his role was overemphasized and the very likable Maguire was not convincing. Both Maguire and Clooney's contemporary acting clashed with the noir look and feel. At the end, nothing stuck - neither the plot nor the characters. About the only thing that resonated after viewing the film was Blanchett's performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is odd how Hollywood works.Low intelligence, formulaic, mass appeal, fluff like Ocean's 11 can come from the same folks who made this intelligent piece? It was probably known that it would be a commercial flop before it was even produced. I guess that the studios let guys who have raked in millions for them occasionally use their talents and resources to attempt the odd piece of high art at commercial risk.This movie lacks color, pyro-technics, a pop music soundtrack, in your face sex, over the top explicit gore, hidden product placement, feel good, catchy/gimmicky lines, trendiness, relentless action and a happy ending. In summary, it lacks most of the tried and true formulas of the current genre.Instead it tackles uncomfortable, multidimensional moral topics in the context of a piece of deliberately buried history in an artistic and adult manner. This movie requires some thinking and if you are a thinking person, you will probably be thinking about it long after.The slightly over exposed B&amp;W filming techniques seamlessly blend in with the extensive historical footage of 1945 occupied and ruined Berlin. I view this as quite innovative and it was visually effective in the context of the story told.This film is indeed different. There is true artistry and actor craftsmanship in this film. However, it may require too much effort for those who are in the mood to just sit back and be entertained and should be avoided in that context.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed this greatly ambitious picture from Steven Soderbergh.This is an enthralling and thrilling film right from the start. The use of 1940s-era motion picture equipment -- cameras, incandescent lights, boom mikes, etc. has you feel as if you are actually watching a movie from just after World War II. The only concession was the use of crass language, some nudity and a few bloody fisticuffs.This isn't a parody of 1940s film-noirs; it homage to them. It's very akin to Spielberg's direction of the "Indiana Jones" features, homage to 1940s serial films.When you have an all-star cast, as in this movie and one of the best film directors in the country, you cannot and will not go wrong.Rent some of the classics which this pays tribute to, such as: THE THIRD MAN (1949); JUDGMENT AT NUREMBERG (1961); DECISION BEFORE DAWN (1951); THE 39 STEPS (1935), and -- CASABLANCA (1942).A very enthusiastic recommendation here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The narrative is hit by the focus on the style but mostly the film works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Journalist Jake Geismer arrives in Berlin to cover the Potsdam conference. Assigned soldier Patrick Tully as his driver, Geismer soon finds that the cheerful, happy-go-lucky driver is also a quite violent man, tied up with a prostitute named Lena. This is Geismer's second shock as Lena turns out to be an old flame before she turned to selling herself in order to survive. Whenever a body is found in the Russian sector, Geismer finds the authorities unable or unwilling to investigate the crime and is himself drawn into the shady affair.Like Theo Robertson before me (so often the way here), I had reasonably low expectations for this film, partly due to the so-so reviews and "hit and run" appearance in cinemas in the UK and US alike. Watching it I can understand why it did come and go so quickly because it is not the most modern or immediately engaging of films if you look at it just on the surface. Underneath there is actually a solid political drama narrative that may not be as well done as I would have liked but was still interesting and well delivered. Part of the problem is also part of the appeal of the film and this is the style and feel of the film.Made in several regards as if it had been made in the mid-1940's, this film seems to have been a project for Sodenbergh to try to pull it off. I'm pleased to say that he has achieved it and that the film has the air of the period (in regards the making of the film rather than the place and period that the film is actually set). The problem is that so much focus seems to have been put on this and not enough on the delivery of the plot. By deliberately shooting on sound stages and in a rather stiff fashion the film cannot help but stiffen the way it all plays out and it does rather rob the narrative of urgency and thrills that it could easily have had in spades. It is a trade-off though, because stylistically the film is very interesting even if I wasn't totally sure the trade was always a good one.The cast do well to do quite an unnatural style of delivery but still engage with the audience and convince. Clooney holds back his easy charm and delivers in line with the spirit of the overall product, although I can see why his performance didn't please many of those that do love him. Maguire is much more interesting, mixing the typical bright-eyed GI character with something much darker at the same time. Blanchett also impresses with a solid performance as Lena. These carry the film although it is worth noting the good support from Bridges, Isyanov and others. The main impression left on me though came as a result of the Soderbergh as cinematographer as he captures the actors and sets with great style.Overall a great looking film with a solid, but not great, narrative driving it. It is a shame that the former seems to have come at the expense of the latter and that the trade-off is not totally worth it but it is still an interesting and engaging film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great tribute to film-noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On recent years,we have seen movies which try to emulate the visual or narrative style of past decades.They started as creative exercises made by cult directors to specialized audiences but now we can see many famous or acclaimed filmmakers doing the same for a massive public like Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez with Grindhouse or Steven Soderbergh with The Good German which is a great tribute to the film-noir in the 40s.In spite of having some false moves in his career(like Erin Brockovich or Ocean's Twelve),I admire the way in which Soderbergh orchestrates his career.He does some major Hollywood movies in order to win some economical and creative credibility to endorse his experimental movies which are always interesting and fun(like Solaris or Full Frontal).The Good German is one of that experiments.The film has an excellent story which has some ingenious things and the visual spectacle is amazing.The film has villains(the Nazis)and heroes(the North American people).But when the film advances we can see the morality of both groups is not too different.So,this film also makes us think and I think that's great.George Clooney and Cate Blanchett are excellent on their roles.Tobey Maguire's performance did not convince me too much and that's the only fail I found on this movie.The Good German is a fascinating experiment and a great tribute to film-noir.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Clooney has a penchant for black and white movies ? it's as if he wanted to be a contemporary of Clark Gable. Thus we have admired George's handsome features in "Failsafe" and "Good Night and Good Luck", not to mention the positively weird washed out colour of his Gulf war story "Three Kings". Stephen Soderberg on the other hand is a stylish director who likes to change styles. Here the story, from Joseph Kanon's historical thriller, is set in Berlin in 1945, and Soderberg decided to film it in a studio with the techniques of the day ? black and white photography, period studio lighting, back projection, fixed focus lenses, 1:1.66 aspect ratio and all the rest. He probably even told the film crew to say "Ready when you are, Mr Soderberg". In the case of one scene at the end he has lifted the whole setting from "Casablanca", and we have some underground stuff reminiscent of "The Third Man".Cate Blanchette as Lena the femme fatale is certainly channeling Marlene Dietrich but George Clooney is no Humphrey Bogart or Clark Gable. In fact his Jacob Geismer gets beaten up and/or given a bum steer by just about everyone he meets, starting with his driver the preposterous Corporal Tully (Tobey McGuire) who is not only shacked up with Geismer's pre-war love Lena but is on chatting terms with a Russian General. Fortunately Tully is eliminated fairly early on before the improbability of his character starts to bite.Soderberg has re-created the feel of the defeated city, and the euphoria of the victors, who sip champagne in the ruins as the future of Europe is decided. The food queues of staving Germans contrast with the groaning food tables at the Potsdam Conference, which Geisman is supposed to be reporting on for the "New Republic". Instead he is scrambling through the rubble, looking for a man who is supposed to be dead, Lena's husband, a person of interest to both the American and Russian authorities.Geisman you could describe as ineffectively noble ? he has picked a fight with city hall which he cannot win. German scientists are going to work for the Americans come what may. Everyone else is either on the make or just trying to survive. By film noir standards, Geisman is a bit of a wuss.As for Soderberg, he has produced a kind of American Dogme film -something more than a parody but something less than a tribute. The staging is contrived, the plot is decidedly clunky, the hero feeble, and some of the other parts unbelievable. The whole thing reminds me of a kid up a tree, about to fall out, yelling at his mother "Look what I can do Mummy". At least he keeps it to 90 minutes, like the period features he is referring to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good technical stuff in search of a story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film manages the unusual trick of having the billed star (George Clooney) as a bit part while the actual star of the film (the 'good German') barely appears at all. Unfortunately I don't think this was intentional.Soderbergh seems to have concentrated so hard showing off the technical aspects that it really doesn't matter what the audience feels, or even if the audience feels anything. I think he got so excited at the look of the film that it clean escaped him that the point of a film is to engage the audience and tell a story.Tobey Maguire is, as advertised, uncannily unpleasant, but still not believable as a baddie. Just not menacing enough.Robin Weigert, as the tart with a heart, features in the role of comedy light relief. While everyone else is doing noir, she seems to be in an entirely different film altogether - burlesque, maybe, although it kind of works ? as well as interpreter of what's going on in Lena's mind seeing as Lena is strangely unable to speak for herself during the entire film.Cate perfectly captures that emotionless, world-weary attitude but at the expense of any sort of personality that makes you believe that a man could want her, let alone fall in love with. The Marlene Dietrich impersonation grates towards the end of the film.George Clooney smokes a cigarette stylishly and smoulders well when called to but just doesn't seem to have any important part in the film, despite a lot of screen time.He simply isn't the catalyst for what happens in the film; pretty much all the events in the film had already been started in motion long before he even arrives on the scene. He doesn't move the story along much. Oddly, it feels as though it would be possible to take him out of the film entirely and still have nearly all the same events take place - bar a bit towards the end.He's basically a loser (not an anti hero) and hard to sympathise with. He loses every fight he's in (and he gets beaten up a lot); he's constantly lied to; he's played by the other characters like a fish on a line; he doesn't get the girl and can't even get laid despite paying for it. He's totally lost, running from pillar to post asking people what do they know, what are they doing and why are they doing it. Tully announces him as a patsy at the beginning of the film, and so he is. So far from Rick in Casablanca who had everything under control.Where are this man's emotions? He supposedly came back to Berlin to find Lena but when he does find her he seems strangely unconcerned with her circumstances. Finally, when at the very end he seems to have figured out that it's not going to work out between them he just walks away from the plane seemingly without a care in the world. If at any point there's some internal crisis as he realises his heart is about to be broken, we don't see it. Other notable absences include motivation for about half the cast: there's zero chemistry between Jake and Lena and equally nothing between Lena and the Tobey Maguire character. The only shimmer of emotion in the film is between Lena and Emil, the 'good German' - where there shouldn't be.Soderbergh is a good director but not as good as he thinks he is. At several points the characters have to do a voice over to explain what's going on in their minds (isn't that what acting and a good script are for?), and other characters are called in to explain the plot and other characters' motivations so the audience can understand what's going on. Not usually a good sign in a film if you need to add explanations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't expect this movie to be so satisfying, but it was. Maybe old studio films were satisfying because they tied everything up at the end. All of the questions were answered. You knew what would become of the characters after the camera stopped. This movie reminded me of a number of post-war films, The Big Lift and The Third Man in particular. Blanchett, who is not a great beauty but plays one magnificently in movies, is unforgettable as the ultimate surviver. No act is too repulsive, as the opening sequence testifies. (Screenwriting 101 - an early scene should encapsulate character, a short-cut to audience intimacy. Yes, I'm a former screenwriter. I confess.) Clooney, the reluctant movie star, is dead-on as the man who knows nothing, but thinks he knows everything. Can any character be beaten up this often and retain his balls? Clooney can. And then there's Tobey MaGuire's Corporal Tully, the "little picture" guy who can barely see past his "excitement". MaGuire delivers a glove-on-hand performance no one from the golden age of film noir could match. And for film buffs there's even a tip of the hat to Chinatown ? just follow the water, Jake. This movie floats in your mind like an after-image long after the DVD has ceased to play.</fullReview>

He's no Bogart. Toby McGuire is shrill and hard to watch as his crooked driver who's involved in the black market. As far as Kate Blanchett goes, I just don't get it. She's a fine actress and all, but is not the kind of Ingrid Bergman-esquire beauty (or even Faye Dunaway in "Chinatown") I think this film required. People who hate Clooney (I don't) might like "the Good German" for the fact he gets beat up not once, not twice but three times in this film (once even by the tiny McGuire!) while others might like the attempt at giving this film an old time look. Others might resent the obvious homage to "Casablanca" in the film's closing scenes.But forget it, Jake. It's NOT Chinatown.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Good German</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Soderbergh is one of my favorite directors because he has made so many different types of films and the stories and situations involving the characters are of such diversity. In this homage to the war dramas of Hollywood yore has Clooney's war correspondent returning to war-torn Berlin after Hitler's fall, finding that his life could be in danger after he starts to pursue the truth behind the murder of his "driver" (Tobey Maguire, quite a douchebag), known for his black market dealings in the devastated city. Clooney realizes that a former "secretary" (and flame, the two having an affair) is linked to Maguire "romantically" (basically she's a lay he likes to bully). She is the driving force behind his nosing around. It seems the Russians and Americans are interested in Blanchett's supposedly dead husband, a man who worked for a Nazi rocket expert who enslaved Jews to build rockets in a mountain factory. Well directed in B&amp;W on the Warner Bros sets that provide a evocative reflection of the good ole days (I kept thinking about Wilder's A Foreign Affair while watching it as well as Casablanca), the plot didn't necessarily blow me away and the performances are okay if not spectacular. Star power does mean something (Clooney, Blanchett, and Maguire) and their being photographed in a moody period in the gloomy damaged Berlin setting using the "classic style" (the lighting, melodramatic score, and flawed characters with their secrets and sins) certainly is a drawing reason to see The Good German. Blanchett portrays her character as guarded, protective of what she feels and hides behind this cold exterior Clooney is desperate to fracture so that he can see her humanity?but what she hides, some act she committed after Clooney left Berlin as Hitler rose in power before Berlin would be ravaged by war, could be too horrible to admit. Maguire is quite a loathsome creep in this film, and seeing him in this light might be a surprise to many of his fans, used to his more subdued, less hostile parts. The plot builds the mystery of "who is Emile Brandt?" and "what does everyone want with him?" with Clooney motivated to find out due to his emotional involvement with Blanchett. The use of profanity and more provocative subject matter (use of prostitution in Berlin a means to afford food, such an example) sets this apart from the classics The Good German is relatable to. I think as an exercise in "how to shoot a homage to the good stuff" by the director the film is an attractive diversion (he imitates the films inspiring him especially well), the plot never really catches fire. The "big secret" and how Blanchett can get herself a better life out of Berlin leaves much to be desired. Clooney, throughout, is treated as a patsy and his naiveté regarding Blanchett (we don't ever see what she might have been like prior to Hitler's rise and so this leaves her character an icy sort not so easy to like) really doesn't reflect well as he continues to face one problem after another. The Potsdam Peace conference is the backdrop for all the goings-on. America's infiltration in Berlin, and their secrecy as Clooney continues to get the run-around, is of significance to the plot as everyone has something concealed (one great scene shows Clooney following Beau Bridges to his office to talk Emile Brandt, with a number of key figures eyeing him with direct interest).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the past ten years or so Steven Soderbergh has become a director who does what he wants, when he wants. He makes the film he wants to make and he does it exactly how he feels it needs to be done, no matter how unorthodox or inconvenient. In 2004 he made Ocean's Twelve, the sequel to one of his biggest blockbuster successes. Then in 2005 he made the film Bubble, a small independently released film with no professional actors. Then in 2006 he picks his stars back up and makes The Good German with George Clooney and Cate Blanchett. And yet he does this film in a completely unconditional way that somewhat negates the star power that the film has.The Good German is about an army general who is visiting Berlin shortly after World War II. What begins as a routine mission quickly becomes a complicated murder mystery involving his mistress and his driver. The plot of the film is straightforward enough, but what makes this film different is the significant style choices that Soderbergh makes. The Good German is essentially an homage to classic film noir and war time thrillers. Soderbergh does everything in his power to make this film seem as if it were made in the 40's or 50's and if it didn't have all of the big names attached to it I might believe it really was that old. Sadly, this film goes all the way for style, and leaves behind all of its substance. Thus, after we become acquainted with the film's style we are left to watch a dull and hollow story unfold, never becoming more than a typical Hollywood junk film trying to be something it's not.The Good German is a film that deserves all the style points it gets. I commend Soderbergh for his efforts in making this pastiche film with the nuances he wanted. He got it just right, but to the extent where it takes away from everything else about the film (i.e. the story). This is a story that goes nowhere and is not interesting or compelling in the slightest. It's a mystery without mystery. I never found myself excited about finding out the answers to the questions the film raises. It is sloppy in its delivery of a hard hitting story and lazy in the way it develops said story. I tried my best to get into the film towards the beginning, but quickly found myself losing interest. Also, the film never improves. It's climax is terribly underwhelming and its conclusion is completely forgettable. From start to finish The Good German is all style and no substance.If you're a Soderbergh fan I might recommend this if you truly care about seeing everything the man has ever done. If you're a mild fan then there are plenty of other films from him that you should check out. This is definitely way towards the bottom in my Soderbergh recommendation list. Not including the film's acute style, it's easily one of his poorest efforts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotionless aesthetic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard about a modern past-war movie that would settle in destroyed and desperate Germany that was turned in intense black and white images and would include actors like George Clooney, I was really looking forward to this movie. Well, I guess I expected a little bit too much.The story has surely some interesting points and is also quite realistic, but somehow very difficult to follow. The actors mostly play without any emotions, especially George Clooney is doing a horribly weak job and the cold-hearted and not very credible Cate Blanchett isn't much better. Only Tobey Maguire as a hectic, emotional and unexperienced military guy who falls in love with a mysterious German "femme fatale" does a convincing job.Another minor detail that personally annoyed me is the fact that most of the actors that are trying to speak German are doing a horrible job, especially Cate Blanchett is not very easy to understand. As a native speaker I know that German is a very difficult language, but this film wants desperately be as atmospheric, precise and realistic as possible, so the actors should have had the help of some good German teachers for the few dialogues they do in German. The Gemran dialogues seem because of this lack of professionalism almost inaudible and silly.From an aesthetic point of view, the movie has a great atmosphere because it is turned in black and white what fits to the desperate and dark situation after the war and some camera shootings are also well done and directed. But this is sadly not enough to make this slow-paced and emotionless movie entertaining enough, even for a German or someone who is interested in history like me.To keep it short, the images and the atmosphere of the movie are well done, but the story and the acting could have been way better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It looks like "Casablanca" and works like "Chinatown", but never even approaches those two masterful classics. Soderbergh's attempt at recreating old school Hollywood cinema whilst sneakily injecting it with cynical modern-day attitudes is admirable, but just succeeds in fits and starts.There's too much mechanical artificiality (even to most of the performances) and the convoluted, yet mildly intriguing plot is full of half-baked ideas, though interesting ones. The director's toying with technical and narrative genre tropes stands in the way of character development and of a more thorough examination of the dark undercurrents the noir plot alludes to.That said, the whole enterprise is still watchable alone for its ambitious intentions and stylish execution.Maguire is terribly miscast.5 out of 10 airfield endings</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A flawed experiment in cinematic style and narrative deconstruction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the plethora of lukewarm reviews might suggest, The Good German (2006) isn't an easy film to love or indeed one to feel dazzled by in any widely accepted sense of the word. Though it is easy to admire the technique and to appreciate the film as a work of visual experimentation or deconstructive film criticism - attempting to view the present by way of the past, etc - the disparate elements of story, character and presentation never quite come together to form a complete, cohesive whole. As a result, we end up with a film that fails to cater to either audience; be they cineastes preoccupied with the stylistic elements of the film, or simply open-minded viewers looking for an intelligent, entertaining and well told tale. I think the reason the two sides fail to meet is simply down to the story being too familiar or well worn; with the visual experimentation and continual references to American and European post-war melodrama getting in the way of the story, while the very characteristics of the plot make the visuals seems somewhat shallow and ostentatious.It's not a bad film, but clearly this is the kind of work that carries with it an incredibly limited appeal; with the continual pretensions to classic films like Casablanca (1942) and The Third Man (1949), combined with the cinematic design that aims to recreate the look and feel of the films of that particular era - albeit, juxtaposed with harsher, twenty-first century preoccupations such as violence, sex and incredibly bad language - no doubt turning a lot of people off before the story has even had a chance to draw us in. The plot, once it gets moving, is fairly interesting and is carried well by the central casting of Clooney and Blanchet, who both give very strong, mannered performances in-keeping with this particular, heavily referential stylistic approach. There's still quite a few flaws though, most of them related to the familiarity of the plot, which has been done countless time, not only in the actual films of the post-war era but in similarly retrogressive experiments such as Lars von Trier's murky and dreamlike post-noir homage Europa (1991), as well as the three films by late German filmmaker Rainer Werner Fassbinder that became known as the BRD Trilogy; with The Good German drawing most heavily on the influence on the first and final films of the three, The Marriage of Maria Braun (1978) and Veronika Voss (1982).Where The Good German impresses most is in the stylistic reconstruction of an artificial film world in which the usual preconceived signs and signifiers familiar to the film-noir genre can be toyed with and subverted; giving us the iconic hero who isn't particular heroic, the femme-fatale as creator of her own universe and a collection of antagonists who never commit to a single role within the film. This allows the story to throw us a few interesting surprises, but again, the whole thing often ends up taking us out of the film (perhaps intentionally) due to the very obvious references to the film's aforementioned. The problem here is that the film, much like many of director Steven Soderbergh's more recent personal projects, such as Full Frontal (2002), Bubble (2005) and his adaptation/re-make of Andrei Tarkovsky's Solaris (2002), tend to feel like film school experiments as opposed to actual finished films. For me, this is a world away from his earlier films, which mixed visual imagination, quirky eccentricity, character and drama to great effect, producing incredibly interesting films such as his celebrated debut picture, Sex, Lies &amp; Videotape (1989) as well as greatly under-appreciated films like Kafka (1991), King of the Hill (1993) and Schizopolis (1996).Following these more offbeat, independent projects he turned to slightly more mainstream pictures, producing great work with Out of Sight (1998), The Limey (1999) and the flawed, though not entirely unforgettable Oceans 11 (2001). Since then he's gone a little off the boil for me, with the occasional hint of the old magic creeping into Traffic (2000), Solaris and the film in question, but never quite getting it back to the magic of his former glories. It is a real shame too, as I had great hopes for this film and really wanted to love it, but for me personally, there are just far too many niggling little flaws getting in the way of the occasional glimmers of brilliance. All the elements are there; strong characters that have shades of light and dark; an intriguing plot with serious historical footnotes; an impressive use of cinematography and anachronistic film technique, etc - but none of it seems to come together! As I mentioned earlier, the film tends to feel hollow, like a creative writing exercise; something to enjoy on a purely passive, purely aesthetic level, but not something that ever grabs you, shakes you around and stirs up a genuine sense of emotion.Over the course of the film characters fight, make up, live and die, make serious life-changing decisions and even greater life-changing mistakes, but none of it ever really moved me. With this in mind, The Good German is something that I might recommend to more dedicated fans of cinema that are able to overlook such shortcomings and can appreciate the film as a visual experiment or an attempt at deconstructing genre. It probably won't play as well to fans of more linear, entertainment based films, such as the Oceans series or Out of Sight, with the plot and characters seeming too slight, ironic and purposely clichéd. It does have a few points of interest, such as the more positive factors described above, but was never something that left me feeling satisfied or over-awed (and I usually love films of this nature). Perhaps a few subsequent late-night viewings will change the perspective of this and reveal hidden depths previously missed, but for now, The Good German remains a flawed experiment that never quite manages to click.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love Soderbergh, Love his films, Didn't care for this one... : (</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to quote reviewer MRaven's statement here, because I do not think that it can be said any better: 'The idea was to re-create the vibe of 1945 Germany in a 1943 film style. Visually, the duplication is impressive... but content-wise the film lacks emotional credibility.'Well said...I really do LOVE Soderbergh's films. I liked 'Sex Lies &amp; Videotape', and I really LOVED his 2nd film even more, the obscure and exquisite 'Kafka'. I really liked 'Solaris' and 'The Limey', etc., etc...So, clearly, I appreciate the guy, I like George Clooney, AND I friggin' love Film Noir! : ) So, what was the trouble here...? Well, first, the well deserved praise. The Look of the film, the cinematography, and the lighting were superb (except, I didn't care much for the over-bright outside stuff toward the beginning. It didn't seem to fit...) Also, I admire the pain-staking effort he used to be sure to use the same cameras, lenses, and equipment that was used to make films at that time. Beautiful idea! And believe me, I truly like MANY different and disparate kinds of film, from the most cheeeeeezy to the most Artsy. From Ed Wood to David Lynch and Kubrick, and some of my favourite films are B&amp;W. So why the hell didn't I care much for this movie...? I think what it was, was primarily the way the people were portrayed; they were NOT, I repeat, NOT shown in a way that matched all the lovely authenticism (authenticism...?) that the director worked SO hard to replicate. The people were very modern in their cynicism, language, thinking, and actions. Which, sadly, for me anyway, took me RIGHT out of the film. I don't think he elicited the proper performances and tone from these people. Even ol' George seemed 'off'... I WILL say though, and I'm not even particularly a fan of hers, that Cate Blanchette's performance as the German woman was excellent. Everyone else... Well... not so much...I kind of feel that if you are gonna go to ALL the bloody detail and trouble to make EVERYTHING look like it was authentically from the time period, and use ONLY cameras and lenses that were used in films made at that time, or if you are trying to copy the CLASSIC look of films such as 'Casablanca', etc., I believe the director should have really adjusted the story, the tone, and especially the CHARACTERS to match. This film should have made you really, ***REALLY*** FEEL like you were in one of those classic films, but to me it played as cold and lifeless and far too 'Modern'. The disparity between the authenticity, look, &amp; style of the period, and the tone of the story, in my lowly opinion, just simply did NOT mesh at all. It was very jarring to me.For what it's worth, not only did I not care for the journey through the film for the main reasons listed already, but to make it worse, the ending was TOTALLY predictable and the film was merely plodding it's way there. Don't get me wrong, I do not think every film needs some kind of breathtaking twist or some such, but if everything just kind of plods along in a wooden, uninteresting way and you know pretty much EXACTLY where it is going and if you're not getting much out of the performances or plot on the way, well, I think that about says it...I don't personally care for revisionist type films that take you out of the mood and tone of what you are EXPECTING in a particular type of movie, setting, or time period. Perhaps instead of trying truly to REPLICATE the time period (or our expectations of it) he was actually intending to put a Modernist tone to it (like they updated 'ROMEO &amp; JULIET' - which DID work because it was so innovative) But, here it surely did not. For me, if I am expecting 'CASABLANCA', I don't want to see George Clooney pounding away on some chick in a bed. Or, if I am expecting a Western or classic Film Noir, I DON'T want to hear the F Bomb constantly. Just takes me out of it; perhaps for others, they may feel that this is 'Innovative' or 'Daring', But I don't...I truly was going into this film FULLY expecting to like it because of my sincere appreciation for the director and for what I THOUGHT would be this really neat, authentic retro-classic film. It just wasn't...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Matching Visual Style Proves Insufficient</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea was to re-create the vibe of 1945 Germany in a 1943 film style. Visually, the duplication is impressive and the cinematography plausible, but content-wise the film lacks emotional credibility.Starting with the good parts, Kate Blanchett looks right and - if a little too reliant on the Deitrich style - sounds right in her part. The sets look like World War II Berlin, and stock footage of the period has been intercut to nice effect. It's a relief to see sparing use of CGI in a modern film, but there end the nice things I can say.Clooney and especially McGuire, just don't get it. They are too modern to be believable in this film and clearly don't understand the noir style. There is also a lot of distraction in he film in the form of product placement of a certain blended scotch that borders on the obnoxious. Clooney holds a smoldering cigarette in each scene and never gets around to smoking it, almost as if that will save him when the anti-smoking do-gooders level their accusations at him in some congressional inquiry of the future. The film is watchable, but only just. I appreciate any attempt to honor styles of film-making that made the genre great. But the too-slow dialogue, simple writing and the modern acting styles, save Ms.Blanchett, just couldn't transport the audience to the gritty noir ethos with any success.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What 's it all about?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To some people this is "Film Noir". Possibly because it was shot in B&amp;W and some viewers like to infer great universal messages like Good and Evil, Love is Blind, Crime and Punishment, etc., etc. in "Artistic" B&amp;W. The stark chiaroscuro has so much more meaning than plot or story. Immediately, there is something sinister and threatening - and mystery.Actually, the mystery is why one would want to sit through this film. It's hard to understand what's it all about and it seems to go nowhere. This is the first film I've seen in years that needed a "The End" at the end to let you know - there ain't no more, folks!Sure, Woody Allen shot "Manhatten" in B&amp;W and it evoked the mood and feeling of a time and place which is etched in the hearts and minds of those of us who lived there. So, is it the point that post-war Berlin is B&amp;W and "Film Noir" cannot be shot in color? Can't the story tell itself? Do we really need Lena to explain it to us just as she is to board the plane? Is the closing scene with the DC-3 an homage to "Play It Again Sam" or to "Casablanca"?Also, with all the smuggling going on, why can't a certain Miss be smuggled across the border? And who is the "Good German" - that fellow in Schenectady?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Worthwhile Effort That Falls Short</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Embracing the look &amp; feel of film noir is always commendable, but not always advisable to attempt, unless everything is as it should be, &amp; certain weak or unfitting elements of "The Good German" left me with a disappointed impression of the film, as a whole.The list of objections starts with a miscast Tobey Maguire as the needlessly foul mouthed, would be roughneck, young soldier abroad, who's form was as unfit to the rest of this film as his caricatured delivery &amp; pantomime was. It just made for a very unsettled introduction into the film, especially considering the presence of a superfluous sex scene, &amp; did the remainder of the film a disservice, in being so totally out of place.My second issue is that I detest films with multiple or floating narrative. Having never read the book, the implementation of jumping narrative only heightened the viewer's sense of feeling left out of the character development, adapted from the original text, &amp; leaves you to feel jilted by a truncated character, who was obviously important enough that the story need be told through their own voice. Of course, the truncated character dilemma spreads itself throughout the whole of the film, actually, as I felt that way about all the characters, short of the female lead, who's own development is the crux of the plot. Even the male lead, played quite well, by George Clooney, was a bit of an empty prop of a character, compared to what his 1940's film noir archetype is. The direction was fair, due mostly to decent cinematography, but it often seemed less like homage, &amp; more like knockoff, in general setup. Soderbergh's visuals did not strike me in any kind of impressive way, &amp; his closeups were largely successful due to having a couple very gifted faces to work with, in Clooney, &amp; Blanchett.The most positive credit should go to Cate Blanchett for doing what she constantly does, in taking on a role that I never seem to think she fits in, &amp; then turning out a very canny &amp; poignant performance in it, earning her place in the unsuited part, by only moments into her first appearance.Overall, it's a worthwhile attempt, &amp; not a bad view, for black &amp; white fans, on a bored rainy day, but doesn't impress like some of the more well known war dramas, &amp; certainly doesn't hold a candle to original film noir, or even to some other homages to it, like "The Man Who Wasn't There". The film is just too noticeably a hatchet job on some of the characters, &amp; finally leaves you feeling like you just sat through a slowly developing setup to a punchline.I'll just be ignorant &amp; blame Paul Attanasio, who's been known for hacking into other such books as Michael Crichton's "Disclosure" &amp; "Sphere", and Tom Clancy's "The Sum Of All Fears"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Soderbergh has done a wonderful job in creating a 1945 style movie. The problem is, he forgot to attach a story to his brilliance."The Good German" looks and sounds in many ways like one of the old 1930- 1945 Warner Bros. studio films. Filmed largely on sound stages and back lots, with lighting and staging and even line readings similar to those 65-75 years ago. But so what? If I wanted to see a really good 1940's style of Warner Bros. film, I would watch "Casablanca".Somebody forgot to add an interesting story and characters to this film. The actors all try their best, but it is confusing, inane and even rips off "Casablanca" in the ending scene, at the airport.Watch this, only if they make you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Soderberg attempts Carol Reed, fails to stick his landing. George Clooney plays an overly curious American captain, returning to Berlin after the war, who yearns for the good-old-days when he had the mysterious Lena all to himself and who gets his butt kicked by a seemingly endless parade of trench-coated continental baddies, up-to-no-good American spooks and a not-so-subordinate enlisted man, while he's looking for her. He gets punched out, kicked, pistol-whipped, hit with a chair and, in a shocking lapse of military decorum, whipped like a dog by his jeep driver. Gee, he's the hero fer chrissakes, let him win one, just one! Clooney seems to be channeling Chuck Wepner. Tobey Maguire plays an all-American blackmarketeer with adenoids, also hopelessly in love with the mysterious Lena and looking for one big score to spirit her out of Europe and back home to Mom or perhaps a basement apartment in Budapest. Who knows? It is a mystery, after all. Unfortunately, with his pre-adolescent voice he has difficulty striking the right blend of menace and world-weariness, sounding instead like Walter Denton whining to Miss Brooks about that snap quiz. Predictably, no one seems to take him seriously and, ultimately, he is found floating face down in a river. It is his best scene. Cate Blanchett, an enormously talented actress, here plays Lena, an equal opportunity mistress, the object of everyone's affection, as an East German moll/bargirl/prostitute/'widow' tettering dangerously between a heavily sedated Greta Garbo and Lili Von Shtupp. My gawd, I half expected her to burst into a medley from Cabaret. It escapes me as to why the men in this movie find the Lena character so irresistible. I suspect she has big feet. Really big. I can see George Clooney fresh off of the success of Good Night and Good Luck, listening to the producers pitch him about how they have this great idea to make a film look just like the old films of the late forties. Unfortunately, he heard Third Man, when they were talking Bowery Boys. An homage is one thing, blunt force trauma is quite another. All that's missing in the closing scene is Claude Rains playing a zither.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mildly interesting exercise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Comparison of this movie to Casablanca is all too obvious. The start of the movie, however, reminds me of Judgment at Nuremberg ? a post WW II Germany. There is a chauffeur picking up an American. (Incidentally, in the case of Nuremberg, the chauffeur is none other than young William Shatner, better known later as Captain Kirk). The visitors picked up are of course entirely different. And then there is also the German women, who are equally different: Marlene Dietrich played a refined lady while Cate Blanchett plays a prostitute. But the deliberate low pitch Blanchett used makes you almost certain that she is paying tribute to Dietrich. But these two movies, after all, are entirely different.TGG is in its core a mystery thriller, despite the backdrop of post-war international intrigue. Through a succession of plot twists, the movie reveals the dark side of human nature relentlessly, but hangs a final absolution on one word: survival.What is special about this movie is of course Steven Soderbergh's experiment of making a movie of the 50s in 2006. All the equipments and techniques are authentic. The results look authentic ? colouring (with black and white defined as "colour"), photography, editing, use of background music. But as a thriller, this movie, while certainly above average, does not have anything exceptional to offer, unless you want to look at it also as a lecture on morals, which in fact confuses rather than helps.At the end of the day, while this movie may well be an absorbing exercise for Mr Soderbergh (perhaps serving also a diversion between "Ocenn's 12" and "Ocean's 13"), it is only mildly interesting to the mass audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This slop, about the adventures of an American journalist, and the woman he once loved, in almost-postwar Germany, isn't terribly enjoyable - unless one looks at it in a wholly ironic life. If you think of The Good German as one of those cheesy propaganda cheapies made in the forties and fifties, the stench of overwrought schlock might be a bit more palatable. Well, maybe - if you also downed some cheap scotch in the process.Jacob (George Clooney) is a writer for the fledgling New Republic who zips over to Berlin to cover the close of The Big One. Tully (Tobey Maguire) is Jacob's driver, an opportunistic ne'er-do-well who's deeply involved in the black market, the little scamp. Tully's girlfriend is Lena (Cate Blanchett), a prostitute who sees Tully as a way out of Germany forever. Might a romantic triangle, full of lust and intrigue, develop? Maybe not. Soon, Tully's face down in the river, and everyone's trying to find Lena's presumed-dead husband, including the Russian and American military.I can appreciate what Steven Soderbergh was trying to do here - he wanted to recreate that ultracool 1940s cinema atmosphere, one in which everyone's attitude and demeanor are as black and white as the cinematography itself, and everyone chainsmokes. But in a weird concession to the present day, there's a ton of profanity. Why would you go to all of the trouble of creating this throwback atmosphere and then screw it up by tossing in anachronistic cursing? Did Soderbergh feel he needed to sex up the movie a little? What, German prostitutes aren't enough? And I can also appreciate casting decisions as much as the next guy - Clooney as Hero isn't really a stretch for him, though - but who the heck thought Tobey Maguire belonged in this movie? Put it this way - when the woman has a deeper, more masculine voice than the man, Something Is Wrong. Maguire's voice sounds like it's going to crack at any moment. He's in way over his head, since this is a movie that requires some range. See how good you are without a mask on, Mr. Spider-Man! Much of the movie involves Jacob running around Berlin, trying to piece together everything, while being thwarted by, well, everyone, including Lena, who lies constantly. It got to the point where I half-expected her to say she wasn't much of a smoker. But regardless of the endless lies, Jake fervently believes Lena's pure and innocent and just a goshdarn victim of circumstances. Which means, of course, that she's not.The movie tries shamelessly to ape Casablanca, but Clooney is no Bogie. He's always been compared to Cary Grant, a suave good guy who's in a little over his head, but that's not what this movie needed; it needed an oily, morally ambiguous bastard. Someone who might indeed screw over other people to further his own gains, or not. For some reason Steve Buscemi's name kept popping into my head. At any rate, Clooney's just not the man for the job here - he looks too pretty.On the other hand, Blanchett is about as perfect as you can get. Not hammy, not too understated, just fantastic. I liked her - mysterious, callous, believable. She reminds one of Ingrid Bergman, and it's quite a favorable comparison.Perhaps if Soderbergh had not decided to rip off (er, I mean, pay homage to) the cloak-and-dagger postwar films of the olden days, concentrating on filming a believable, cohesive plot; or maybe going all the way with his homage and not having profanity laced throughout, this might have made more sense. It does pick up a bit about halfway through, but everyone seems so intent on being Grand Actors that the result isn't very entertaining. I mean, heck, when Tobey Maguire kicks George Clooney not once, your movie has some serious credibility problems.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Good, Not Great, German</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Good German is a compelling film-noir mystery that, in the end, is perhaps a bit too mysterious. Director Steven Soderbergh pulls all of the cinematic tricks out of the bag while creating a genuine 1940's atmosphere in a story where Capt. Jacob Geismer (played by George Clooney) finds his former forbidden love Lena Brandt (Cate Blanchett) when he returns to Berlin to cover the Potsdam conference. After Lena's current boyfriend Tully is murdered, Geismer seeks to uncover the truth (of the murder, of Lena, and of himself) amid the complicated political atmosphere of post-war Berlin.The acting throughout the film is remarkable, and even actors in bit parts light up the screen (as much as they can in a film that is shot in a moody black-and-white). Cate Blanchett deftly portrays as Lena as a woman who has a deep, dark past but is able to create a multi-layered persona in order to protect herself from her troubled mind. George Clooney is a reliable main character, but Tobey Maguire is much better as Lena's conniving boyfriend who operates without morals and without remorse. Of the great and extensive supporting cast, Robin Weigert is haunting as Lena's roommate.However, as much as the film works to create an intrigue cast of characters, the story in which there are forced to play out their lives is often a bland, and at times nonsensical, Berlin. As Clooney continues to explore why Tully was murdered (and eventually discovers that he was trying to sell Lena's husband to the Russian), each new revelation in the case careens the plot in new directions that don't really connect. Lena's past is explained and it is both shocking and surprisingly sterile. Perhaps the film presents the lives of these characters as they would naturally have occurred in a post-World War II Berlin?moving around, in secrecy and collusion, to cover their tracks and protect their secrets, never fully pausing to think about the ramifications of their actions. However, this gives the film a jerky quality that is wholly unsatisfying.Technically, the film looks and feels like a film of a lost cinematic age. The cinematography handedly moves around in murky shades of gray and the film is edited in clever ways that reflect the look of an old film noir. Thomas Newman's deservingly Oscar-nominated score guides the film through the dark passages of Berlin, both alluding and contributing to the intense mysteriousness of the scenes.In the end, however, the movie is never really able to overcome the encumbering, uneven implausibility of its storyline. While the cast, especially Blanchett, succeeds at creating worthwhile characters and Soderbergh has demonstrated a mastery of old film techniques, the film is sadly, a mesmerizing, yet maddening, bore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An experiment that was not totally successful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was not involved in the planning of this movie by Clooney and Soderbergh, but it appears to me that this movie incorporates ideas from Casablanca and "The Third Man". The later movie was a collaboration between Orson Welles and the director Carol Reed, and I would recommend the viewer of The Good German to also see The Third Man.Cate Blanchett's acting in this film is, as always, outstanding. George does not actually act all that much; he is pretty much George Clooney regardless of the role. This is not meant to be overly critical of him- it is a well known fact that most veteran lead actors (John Wayne and Clark Gable come to mind) do not actually act as it is not really important for them to do so. The lead male character in this movie was Capt. Jacob "Jake" Geismer, but if instead the lead character had been called Capt. George Clooney I doubt that it would have mattered very much. The audience would have accepted it.In Casablanca there is not doubt the female lead is a good woman. In "The Third Man" the female lead (Anna Schmidt as played by the actress Alida Valli) is the girlfriend of the black market racketeer Harry Lime but she is only so bad as to be interesting. She, like Lena Brandt, wants desperately to get papers that allow her to go to the West; away from the Soviet presence. Until then, both women are dependent upon the generosity of men of dubious moral character (Lena Brandt depends upon Patrick Tully and Anna Schmidt depends upon Holly Martins) However, the similarities end there. Anna is (was) the girlfriend of a black marketeer but tries to keep up some sort of moral behavior despite the trying times. Lena Brandt is much rougher and though we can be sympathetic to her at first, the sympathy begins to wear off. Early in the movie Tully punches her in the stomach- and it is somewhat shocking to see that. However, as the movie progresses the viewer begins to feel that Lena deserves it!! Of particular interest is the fact that Lena was the (married) mistress of Geismer in pre-war Berlin yet when she meets him at the bar in post-war Berlin (obviously a take on Rick's Place in Casablanca) she greets him in a way that is not particularly enthusiastic; this despite her desperate need to leave Berlin. So, the character of Lena is certainly a dark one and sympathy continues to erode for her during the movie. I doubt if the movie makers planned this; I mean the steep decline of sympathy for her.Of interest is the role of the cabaret dancer in "The Third Man" being expanded in this movie. This is the character of Hennelore; portrayed by Robin Weigert. The role of Bernie Teitel is the same as that of Major Calloway in The Third Man- the resident military commander who knows more about what is going on than the protagonist- and finally informs the protagonist, and the audience, about why everything is going the way it is. At least in The Third Man the motivation of "the bad guy" is understandable- in "The Good German" it is murky at best and unbelievable at worst. In fact, the entire plot of "The Good German" is somewhat murky. Must be due to the old photographic processes used in the making of the film. I do wish that at least once in a while color was present in the film; to contrast with the black and white scenes. Also, at least once in a while Capt. Geismer should have worn civilian clothes. While on duty at Potsdam, yes, he should be in uniform. When seeing the U.S. commanders he should also have been in uniform. But, at the other times he could and should have been in civilian clothes. Well, see this movie if you wish- there are some points of interest in it but it is not a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So pleasing to the eyes...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first read about "The Good German" I have to say I was very excited. As a huge fan of classic film noir from the 40's I was very eager to see a new homage to that timeless era.Oscar winning director Steven Soderbergh and Oscar winning actor George Clooney team up yet again (Out of Sight, Ocean's Trilogy) and put their spin on the black and white character driven yarns of the old movie days.I have to say that I really enjoyed it although it was certainly not a great film. It was good but not great. Here's why.The film is set directly after World War II in Berlin. All of the Allied forces currently in the city have their own separate sector and agendas, as we quickly find out.George Clooney plays a military journalist who just set down in Berlin and who quickly stumbles upon a juicy story which ends up directly involving him, a down on her luck (or so it seems) German dame, with a past, played by Cate Blanchett, and his driver (the dame's boyfriend) played by a miscast Tobey Maguire.As you may assume, since it takes after old school film noir, there are plenty of twists and turns involving the main trio of characters and a murder investigation on the eve of the Potsdam Conference which may shake the new hope of peace down to it's feet. As the film continues more characters get drawn into the web of deceit, murder, and betrayal. Some want money, some want love, some just want out of the war ravaged country to start anew. At times you really wonder where exactly the film is going but sure enough you find yourself there and it seems to make sense.It's just that, by the time, the film reaches its' climax it isn't the rich tasty payoff you are waiting for. The rich tasty payoff we are so use to being an essential ingredient in seedy go-for-broke, every man for himself, keep your eye on the prize tradition of a great film noir. The look of the film was the most entertaining thing about it. The fade in and fade out and wipe edits along with the low lighting on black and white film really give you that "Third Man", "Casablanca", "Maltese Falcon" feel which is exactly what the filmmakers are going for. The soundtrack is played to the same tune of keeping with tradition and only adds to the great feel of these films. They pull it off with gusto making a movie that deserves to be seen in a swampy theater filled with smoke on flickering on an old TV set on a warm summers night.My love for those films and that film going experience really made me biased when it came to liking this film. I liked the way it was made and the way it looked and how I felt watching it, more than the plot of the film itself which was shaky at times but still entertaining overall.All in all, not a film homage to the likes of "Grindhouse" but still a lot of fun for those fans of film noir and classic movie making.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS***You get a headache watching "The Good German" not just because of its confusing and mindless story but worst of all its super-high contrast and at the same time overly washed out black and white photography, this gives what's meant by film-noir a whole new meaning. It's July 1945 and the eve of the historic Podsdam Conference between the leaders of the big three, the USA UK &amp; USSR, of the allies who's combination of mighty armies navies and air forces defeated Nazi Germany. Capt. Jake Geismer, George Clooney, is sent by his news agency to war-torn and divided Berlin to report on it.Geismer getting a young GI to drive him around the city later finds out that his driver Cpl.Patrick Tully, Tobey McGuire, is having an affair with his old flame back in the prewar days Lena Brandt, Cate Blanchett. Lena is living off the good will and tender mercies, as well as occasionally putting out for them, of the troops both American &amp; Soviet in the battered city. Wanting desperately to get out of Germany and immigrate to either Britain or the United States Lena will do anything to achieve that but there's one hitch. Her husband Emil, Christian Olsen, is wanted by both the Amercans and Soviets and, even though he's reported to have been killed in the war, and she's the only one who can lead them to him if he's alive.Tully realizes just how important his mistress', Lena Brandt, husband is when he's he goes to Lena's dingy apartment and is attacked and has his arm broken by what seems to be an officer of the US OSS. The attacker repeatedly asks Tully, between blows, where is Emile Brandt! Trying to play both ends of the gun barrel to his advantage Tully goes to see Soviet chief of security at Podsdam Gen. Sikorsky, Ravil Isyanov, to offer Emile, whom he really doesn't have, up to him for 200,000 marks. Later Tully is found floating in the river outside Potsdam with a bullet in his back and 100,000 marks stuffed in his pockets.The movie touches on the US military in the person of a Captain Bernie, Leland Orser, being obsessed in finding and bringing to justice with a rope around their necks. We find out later that's just a cover on the US high commands part, to the great disappointment of Bernie, in that the both US military and intelligence services, in cahoots with the War and State Department back home, are only interested in getting the brains of the Nazi rocket project and not caring at all if they committed war crimes or not! So long as they can help the US in overtaking or surpassing the Soviet Union, a friend in war now an enemy in peace time, in rocketry that will undoubtedly be the decisive weapon in winning a future world war.Nobody, or no sides, wins in the movie with only Lena really coming out ahead by getting a naive Capt. Geismer to ferry her out of the country without realizing only when it was too late that she herself had a lot of explaining to do to both the US military in Berlin,in Tully's murder, as well.****SPOILERS**** It's soon revealed that Lena cooperated with the Nazis during the war that lead to the arrest and deportation, and possible deaths, of some dozen Jews whom she, who's Jewish herself, ratted out to the Gestapo in order to save her own neck.Geismer is about the only person that you feel any sympathy for in the entire movie. The poor and confused man is so fixated with his former lover Lena that he risks his life over and over again and thus getting the living hell beaten out of him from both sides,his own American soldiers as well as members of the Red Army. In the end Geismer is to find out that he was used and made to look like a pasty and sucker by Lena who left him twisting in the wind and looking like a complete fool as the movie "The Good German" mercifully, for both Geismer and the movie audience, finally ended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Black and White Movie with a Story that is Anything but Black and White</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Viewers are split on reaction to Steven Soderbergh's experimental THE GOOD German and for good reason. The theatrical and cinematic qualities of this film noir are stunning, creating not only a flashback to the 1940s films but to the period of the 1940s in postwar Europe. The story is rich in suspense, visual surprises, and intrigue, and manages to unfold a complex tale involving many characters in a manner that keeps the viewer guessing about the outcome until the final image fades. But the film takes a hefty does of patience to appreciate.Potsdam conference, 1945 in decimated Berlin is the scene. Capt. Jacob 'Jake' Geismer (George Clooney) arrives to observe and report on the conference and is assigned a driver named Tully (Tobey Maguire), a fast talking, manipulative opportunist who loves post-war Berlin for the easy money it allows a doofus like him to make. Tully happens to have a lover, the mysterious Lena Brandt (Cate Blanchett), who he is trying to assist in escaping from Germany. As luck would have it Lena had been a previous lover of Jake in his prior time in Berlin. The action begins when the Russians, the British, and the Americans reveal their attempt to locate rocket scientist Emil Brandt, Lena's husband who she declares has been long dead. A murder occurs, espionage takes over and the film runs its cat and mouse chase for the discovery of the real Emil Brandt and the secrets his capture represent at this crucial junction in time - the Potsdam Conference.The characters in the film come close to being caricatures: Ravil Isyanov as the main Russian figure, Beau Bridges and Jack Thompson as the main American figures, Robin Weigert as the requisite good prostitute/stripper roommate of Lena, Tony Curran representing the British presence, and Don Pugsley as the German evil presence that ties the whole story together. Blanchett is her usual splendid self, adding a true sense of mystery and allure to her multifaceted role, George Clooney is on target as Jake, and Tobey Maguire manages to get on our nerves as the nerdy but clever Tully. The pleasure in this film comes from Soderbergh's mastery of the medium not only as director but as cinematographer, and by Thomas Newman's period perfect score as orchestrated by the immensely talented Thomas Pasatieri fleshes out the film's effect.Knowing that public and critical reaction is split, the film is a good evening of adventure: every viewer will elect which side of the critique to follow.

		<fullReview>A good story is everything in a film. The acting, direction, even photography can be forgiven if the film tells a good story. This film has a good story, and I enjoyed it, but while watching it, I was wondering if it was based on something that actually happened or not. This makes a big difference to me. I had to look it up in the Wikipedia to find out. Maybe I should have done this before watching the film. The write up on the DVD cover should have made it clear that it is based on a work of fiction. As film noir, it is less than average, which is why I gave it a 7 out of 10 rating. I did appreciate the gesture. The film was shot in color and transformed to black and white so it would mix with the real life news clips of the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Looks wonderful, but is not engaging</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was going to say that "The Good German" is very much a curio for the director Steven Soderbergh, but to say that would have been utter nonsense because his entire career has been varied, unpredictable and contrary. And mostly good."The Good German" is a WWII thriller/melodrama with a twist in that it is shot in nearly exactly the same style as a film made in the 1940's. (I say nearly exactly, because the sex, violence and language would definitely have been nixed by the movie guardians at the time.) So, you get beautiful black and white photography, an overblown strings and horn soundtrack, typical, almost clunky stock footage of the Berlin of the time, back projection when characters are travelling in cars, etc.... And it looks absolutely wonderful. A real triumph of the cinematographer's art. It really looks like a movie transported from the 1940's. It was a stroke of genius casting George Clooney and Cate Blanchett because Clooney looks like a 40's matinée idol and Blanchett looks like a 40's femme fatale. Strong performances by them both, as well as Tobey Maguire who is truly sneaky and loathsome (think Robert Walker in "Strangers On A Train").But... "The Good German" is not an engaging film. Boring? No, maybe that's not the right word, but it didn't grab me. Maybe it was because, except for the Barman, there was not one sympathetic character in the entire movie. Blanchett's character is so cold, so distant, so aloof, that I couldn't get a handle on why Clooney's character was so obsessed with her. If there had been hints of warmth under that exterior I would have felt differently.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Good German is atrocious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Good German in all it's conceptual presence and as a film would have been jeered off the screen in 48. It's a turgid and convoluted story in post war Berlin about US and Russian double dealing during the Potsdam Conference as the two emerging super powers jockey for position in the upcoming cold war. Against this backdrop we follow the confusing past and present of three pawns in this deadly game with worldwide implications.George Clooney is Jake Geismer a military journalist assigned to the cover the conference. His driver Tully (Toby Maguire) is waist deep in the black market and coincidentally keeping Jake's ex-Berlin squeeze (Kate Blanchett) who has secrets of her own that could ruin her and reveal information that the American Government is trying to cover up. See where this is going? Steven Soderbergh's attempt at retro film-making serves no purpose other than making a 40's Lang, Curtiz, forgery with the same tools. The confusing storyline (touches of Third Man, Chinatown, Casablanca) is borrowed jumbled and naive. Werner Von Braun was welcomed here with open arms and this expose of government skulduggery is neither novel or revealing. Clooney is his usual dull self as he stalks both hovel and halls of power to get at the truth. He is Tyrone Power without the talent though he does manage to have remarkable recuperative powers after being soundly pummeled three times throughout the course of the film. Kate Blanchett with a touch of Dietrich impersonator is all gloom and Fassbinder and the chemistry between her and Clooney is diluted. Toby Maguire is terribly miscast as Tully. A role that calls for a certain street savvy, Maguire doesn't have the look and his squeaky adolescent accent is pure high school senior.One time Indy phenom Soderbergh took Hollywood by storm with his debut film Sex Lies and Videotape twenty years ago. Since then he has proved himself to be one of the businesses slicker directors with solid audience appeal. His Ocean's franchise allows him to take stabs at noncommercial and experimental ventures like Bubble and this. I'm not certain what's worse. His KIA furniture movies or his artistic flights of fancy. Either way he should be embarrassed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dark Night in Post War Germany</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From out of the many dark pages of post war Germany, arrives this film concerning the mad scramble for "Spoils" of the war. Though all the allies who beat the German War machine claim they fought for "Peace and Freedom" , no one buys it. Instead within this Black and white film, we find an assortment of characters who represent the state of fear in the wet streets of Berlin. Here we have, Jack Thompson as Congressman Breimer, John Roeder who plays the General and George Clooney as Jake Geismer, with Tobey Maguire as corporal Tully and finally Cate Blanchett as Lena Brandt. The director has gone through a lot of trouble to "SET" the stage as if one were back in the 1940's. What is fascinating and totally surprising is Maguires's role. He is incredible as the sadistic and opportunist solider out for the fast buck, contrary to Clooney's newsman who appears to be lacking the ability to defend himself. He plays a wimp who it seems every adversary can whip. A good film non the less. ***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's ambition exceeds it's reach.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the biggest disappointments of my life. I was expecting this film to be a masterpiece, and it couldn't have been further from it. The film tries to be an homage to the 40's noirs but ends up being a carbon-copy of half and shitting all over the other half. None of the characters or actors even seem to belong in a noir, except for Blanchett who is absolutely exceptional. Her accent is pitch-perfect. I was very excited to see Tobey Maguire, who I feel is a very capable actor, in a role that will hopefully diversify himself from Spiderman. However, he couldn't have been more miscast. The film couldn't be less engaging, and it expects you to follow every tiny detail. Of course if you lose attention for a second, it can shine a bright light on a certain piece of paper so that you know what they're talking about when they bring it up a minute later. Speaking of minutes, there is no way to care for the characters when every two minutes it's switching to a completely different scene. Clooney, who I've always felt is a good actor, seems like he's as bored as the audience is. He just drags himself along the film, not caring if the audience hears him or knows what he's talking about. He's obviously going for a Bogart/Grant/Stewart mashup, but ends up falling into his charming, smug normal self half of the time he's on screen. As I said, the film couldn't be less engaging which leads to it being completely dull and just annoying. The cuts are constant, and after the first ten minutes become tedious and unbearable.Before you even know what the film is talking about, one of the main characters dies, and you're apparently supposed to care about since they made the effort to dramatically pause on the character's face and throw in some ridiculously loud score piece. The quality of the film is incredibly poor, but that's because (since it was an homage to the 40's) they didn't use any equipment that was made after the 40's. I really never thought anyone could be more pretentious than Tarantino, but it looks like Soderbergh and Clooney have that covered. I guess it could have been an innovative idea, but it just came across as arrogant, showy and unnecessary. However big of a disappointment the film was though, the lighting and cinematography are some of the best of the decade and Blanchett is absolutely brilliant in a role practically made for her. But still, one of the largest disappointments I've faced my entire life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who said film noir was dead? No one told the Coen Brothers when they did the Man who wasn't There and apparently no one told Steven Soderberg either. Clooney is excellent, as usual, as the main protagonist (since he gets beat up all the time, kinda hard to call him the hero) and Blanchett is superb, as always, as the femme mystique, holding a closet full of dark secrets. This film has all the twists and curves of a good 40s thriller yet updated with the raw language and explicit sex unavailable to the actors in the 40s. The face plate reviewer laments the "dirty talk" but don't think for a moment that Bogart, Mitchum or Lancaster would have hesitated for a second to be more graphic if the chance had been afforded. Anyway, it works and the action is continuous, albeit not at the pace of a video game. The camera angles are straight on and a little less trying than the contortions that Orson Welles often put us through. As cinema the scenario is rich with wonderful shots of the omnipresent detritus of postwar Berlin. It's a city destroyed, conquered yet defiant and this is reflected in the tough survival of these remarkable women who did what they had to to survive. The dialogue is sparse with shadowed scenes of people pursuing people. Everywhere is destruction and depravity, yet we evaluate retrospectively from our seat after the cold war. Jeff Bridges and Tobey Maguire add to the intrigue with small but significant roles. All in all, this a damn good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Good German is an attempt to produce a film-noir, with all its oppressive tension. It almost succeeds. Right from the Warner logo at the very-very beginning, I thought I was about to watch something made in the 1940s, but with a certain political / social realism found in more modern films. As the film progressed, however, I realized that it was not a true film-noir. The acting is great, especially with regards to Cate Blanchett, who excellently portrays the classic femme-fatal, and George Clooney, the typical naive American who gets in over his head. In fact, it is the acting which makes this movie worth watching, despite its somewhat erratic plot. Although well-written, dialogs in The Good German seem to lack that film-noir spontaneity and cleverness. The Good German is worth watching, but for film-noir buffs, it's better to go for the real thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cate Blanchett's husband (Emile Brandt) served in the SS as a secretary to a rocket scientist (Franz Bettman.) At first you think that the Americans and Russians want him so he can help develop their rocket programs. In reality, Emile Brandt wants to tell the truth about Bettman's war crimes, which would scuttle any chance for Bettman to help the American rocket program. This sets the stage for conflict between American prosecutors (e.g. Bernie Teitel) who want to prosecute war criminals and American generals and politicians who want to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles. In the end, the generals and politicians win out.The bad guys (e.g. Lt Schaeffer, Congressman Breimer and General Muller) arrange for Clooney to come into contact with his ex-lover Lena Brandt (Cate Blanchett) by pairing him with motor pool driver Tully (Toby Maguire) who is her pimp. They hope that Clooney will help them uncover where Lena Brandt is hiding her husband.Amusingly, Clooney gets his head kicked in about 14 times in this movie. Even Tobey Maguire knocks him around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Critics have been unjustifiably hard on Steven Soderbergh's stylized film on Post-WWII Berlin. Most criticism has noted a weak plot while remaining very positive on the look of the film. And without a doubt the film is beautiful. It is stylization at its best. And not Coen brother's fashion surreal-retro-stylization, this is authentic. Soderbergh, who usually works as his own cinematographer and editor under pseudonyms, has made this film so perfectly stylized it could have easily been a 40's Billy Wilder film (sans-multiple witticisms). The over-exposed, harsh black and white is beautiful, stark and ominous. Some of the best retro-cinematography in years.The plot has been unfairly criticized. The adaptation is not what an audience would expect from a film about the sectioned post-WWII Berlin. While using the war, rising tensions between the U.S. and Russia, and the damage, and cost of Nazi led Germany; it remains set on smaller things, human relationships. The plot is more in the realm of Bergman or Fellini. It begins fast paced, seeming to foreshadow a film about treason, the coming US/Russian battles, but it becomes more engaging and surprising as it changes its focus onto issues of trust, how politics affect out everyday reality. It will surprise your expectations, and if the audience isn't ready for that the film will feel flat as a war piece.I do not mean to assert that 'The Good German' is perfect, it is flawed and sometimes scattered. But it's major flaw is, well, let's give it a name to help describe it. We'll call this flaw 'Tobey Maguire.' Fortunately. His overly enraged and seemingly unmotivated character is knocked off by the thirty-minute mark, when the film begins to become most interesting. (Weird coincidence, hmmm) Though, I do feel for Maguire, he is cursed with the Matthew Broderick disease. It was first discovered in the mid-90's when audiences continued to mistake Broderick characters for Ferris Bueller, then becoming awe-stricken when they realized the Matthew Broderick can't age.Clooney and Blanchett are great; Soderbergh's direction is at its best. (You know those increasingly rare moments when you forget he directed 'Erin Brockovich' or 'Ocean's Eleven' and its bastard children). Don't expect 'All Quiet on the Western Front' and you'll love this film for it's synthesis of paced late-60's Italian plots and the looks of 40's-50's American noirs.

		<shortDescription>Deeply Flawed Homage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Soderbergh and his usual gang team up to try and create some kind of post-modern mirror on all those dark and atmospheric movies of the 1940s. The whole thing looks spectacular: the cinematography, production design and score all successfully contribute to the illusion that we're watching a movie straight out of 1942. Soderbergh's talents as a director, cinematographer and editor are all on show, but he doesn't seem to have shared his creative notes with screenwriter Paul Attanasio. The screenplay, clearly aping 'Casablanca', involves a mysterious woman using a former lover to procure exit papers from a repressive war-torn city. But the similarities end there, forcing us to ask if Attansio has ever actually watched a movie from the golden age of Hollywood. Where is the witty banter, the humor, the comedy? 'Casablanca' wasn't all Nazis, adultery, and brooding passion in the shadows. It was the nervous ticks of Peter Lorre, the dangerous good-humor of Sidney Greenstreet, the affectionate charisma of Claude Rains. There is a distinct lack of humor in 'The Good German', and humorless individuals are difficult to relate to and makes for unengaging characters. Soderbergh and Attansio are clearly attempting to create some kind of revisionist post-modern version of 'Casablanca', making the point that war and its aftermath are ugly and morally ambiguous, highlighting the inherent dishonesty in the old-fashioned feel-good war movies. But whatever their intentions, they fall flat. 'The Good German', while visually arresting, is a dour and humorless drudge that makes us realize just how good those original movies were.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Challenging questions about good vs. evil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe that evil and good are separated by clear individual choices. So does Jacob Geismar, the main character of Steven Soderbergh's film "The Good German." By the film's conclusion, both Jake and myself are left speechless for long moments. The realization that evil can be granted so much power by society that goodness is eclipsed is a stunner. The good German in question is Lena Brandt. Lena is a beautiful Jewish woman who claims the heart of correspondent Geismar. Like Berlin itself, Lena has been both a victim and a perpetrator. Like many who survived the Holocaust, she has had to make difficult choices. Are those choices excused by her victim-hood? The film, shot in a grainy black and white that blends with newsreels of the period, is an homage to the tough-guy cinematic detectives played so well by Bogart. If you are a Bogart fan, you'll like watching "The Good German." On that level, it is an enjoyable film.The themes are meant to disturb however. The horrors visited upon mankind by the technological might of Nazi Germany did not end with the occupation. New horrors awaited the world as the Russians and Americans grabbed up the German scientists who could provide the rocket science to deliver nuclear warheads, opening all humanity to new fears presaged by the Blitz experience suffered by Londoners.What happens when an entire society is preempted by evil forces? Can any one individual survive such forces without becoming tainted by evil? These aren't easy questions and the answers provided by "The Good German" might leave you stunned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Film Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I go further, let's get it out up front that I love the '40s noir style, both in film and literature. "The Good German" captures that style perfectly, including a Casablanca-esquire closing scene at an airport, black &amp; white film, and the use of a 1.33:1 "Academy" aspect ratio. For me, it all workedI thought that George Clooney was perfectly cast, as was the always marvelous Kate Blanchett. Squint your eyes and you can see Bogie and Ingrid Bergman. I was particularly impressed by Blanchett's mysterious beauty with a dark secret, maybe more than one. By the way, the always amazing Robin Weigert (Calamity Jane in Deadwood) as the hooker, Hannelore, blew me away. She created a remarkably interesting character in very little screen time. As usual, she was virtually unrecognizable.This movie is not for the unwary. It is a dark exploration of the ambiguous nature of the choices the United States had to make after Germany surrendered in 1945 as to whether to punish the war criminals among Germany's rocket scientists or conceal their crimes and give them a pass in order that they could come to work for us. At times, therefore, the movie is a little hard to take. Still, it presents mature subject matter for viewers who are not afraid of being required to think and are willing to forego a Hollywood happy ending. Highest recommendations for film noir buffs, but those who are not may think less of it than I do -- 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I consider George Clooney, Cate Blanchett and Tobey Maguire three of the greatest stars of our time. Which makes it somewhat strange to see them in "The Good German". I thought that this was a fairly good movie, but I couldn't really tell whether the movie was simply paying homage to "Casablanca" or trying to imitate it. I felt that the movie's strength was showing what went on behind the scenes in post-war Berlin. Truman, Churchill and Stalin arrived claiming that they had no expansionist plans, when they in reality aimed to totally carve up Europe for the next forty years. And all the while, a future war was clearly brewing between the US and USSR. Not to mention the intrigue that the movie portrays.So, I think that the movie is mostly good for that. It can't emulate the spirit of old-time film-making, but offers a chilling account of geopolitics, just like Clooney's previous movie "Syriana".PS: Last year saw the release of "The Good German" and "The Good Shepherd", so David Letterman said that 2007 will see the release of "The Good German Shepherd".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To review their own sins seems to be the actual tendency in Hollywood these days, probably if we analyze the current world order and the unpopular that has become the first power, we could understand this revisionism.Movies like "The Good German" touch a little bit a dark episode about the end of "wwII", black &amp; white motion, humid and dark places show us an American army corrupted by misery and dealing with people as objects. This movie is very far away from productions like "Saving Private Ryan" and "Iwo Jima". Wherever you look in this micro universe you can see the worst things of human nature: Greed, lust, contrary to the image of "World Police of Justice". we can see a bunch of really good characters who plays rats fighting for an old cheese, everyone for a different and a selfish reason.For sure isn't a girly movie, a blockbuster or an action thriller, but at least is a true sight of the human condition, in spite of that ,"The Good German" is a good movie not just because of its excellent cast that includes George Clooney, and Tobey McGuire, it's because is successful to making us feel this imperfect human beings as real persons with a valid ethical code.A truly son of "Film Noir".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Soderberg attempts to re-imagine the iconic noir films of the 1940's with "The Good German." With the old fashioned music score from Thomas Newman and the evocative black-and-white cinematography, he scores in spades. Unfortunately there are some frustrating elements that keep the film from becoming a perfect send-up of those classics.The acting from Clooney and Blanchett are spot on for the time period the film invokes. Blanchett has received some flack for her thick German accent, and Clooney ridiculed for being wooden, but the styles fit for what Soderbergh was after. Sadly, for the first twenty minutes of the film, Soderbergh allows Tobey Maguire (poorly cast here) to go gonzo in a vain attempt by the non-actor to show he can do more than stare vapidly at the camera or appear all smarmy and misty eyed.Soderbergh also makes the mistake of utilizing two of the worst elements of films from that time period: unnecessary voice-overs and stock footage to explain plot points when the screenwriter ran out of ideas or the producers cut back on the budget. Oddly, he also infuses a very modern use of sex and violence (though very brief) and profanity (seemingly for comic relief).Overall, despite some of the distractions, the plot is often engrossing, and as stylish throw-back entertainment designed for the pleasure of movie buffs longing for the days of WWII era noir, the film makes the grade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish but unnecessary spy thriller throwback</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Soderbergh tries his luck at noir-style mystery with decidedly mixed results. Stylistically, The Good German is a worthy homage to old espionage, emulating the black and white contrast with a seductive finesse. Soderbergh does employ a few questionable usages of stock footage, but generally his post-Nazi, war torn Berlin set design proves a fascinating subject to shoot in this light. Soon enough however, it becomes apparent this concentrated aesthetic value holds sway over an unfulfilled script. As we all know what we are getting into by the film's unique retro presentation, expecting far-flung plot-lines to compliment any seedy or smoky stereotypes came with the cards, but too often it feels like this project rode out some of those detective clichés past the point of forgiveness. You end up with a script that works simply when it wants to, subtly exploiting it's genre integrity with many misguided scenes that feel unbalanced.Most actors do their part to mimic the apparent tone the film was going for, but a few poor casting choices take a bite out of the authenticity. Mainly, it is Tobey Maguire who wrecks some of the foreground with his modern irrelevance. George Clooney and Cate Blanchett are fine as the other main characters, but Maguire's (thankfully quick) presence added nothing to the stylish datedness, rather taking away some authenticity away. Blanchett meanwhile, continues her streak of amazing performances, and seems like the only one who knew how to sell this one to audiences.By the time the heavily convoluted (but powerfully bittersweet) conclusion roles around, too many side characters, emerging like clockwork, will have cluttered most attempts at taking this at face value, but if one can find it in their cinematic heart to indulge in the stylistic and thematic stereotypical excess, the indulgence certainly has it's merits . The Good German may too often walk a line between serious thriller, artful homage, and perhaps even subtle parody to be taken as dramatically as it wants to, but in the hands of the always competent-at-least Soderbergh, viewers are ensured that this flawed project is at least a worthy one-time view.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite what many critics and audiences have thought, I enjoyed the film's homage to the grainy black and white of the 1940s. It isn't just that which makes it so fun. It's also the talent and wit behind the film's recognition of the structural formula of 1940s films. The film is indeed dead on in its impression of cinema of the time. One reason I think many people may have found it silly is because of its allowance of contemporary cinematic characteristics, namely Tobey Maguire's exclaimed profanity. And maybe those who found the film slow or dull are spoiled by modern plot structure. Today, American films move faster and thrillers, such as this, have more violence and action. This in itself is a testament to the film. It is beneficial to what the film says. It is proof that moviegoers of now have changed so much from those of yesterday.Despite any drawbacks the film may bear because of its gimmick, I am partial to the George Clooney-Steven Soderbergh collaboration. They are perhaps one of the great consistencies of contemporary American films. No matter what kind of film they are making, whether it be a subtle small-scale film with something to say or a glossy Hollywood popcorn entertainment, they always know exactly what kind of movie they are making and completely commit. I believe that every one of the movies they have made together have been some of the greatest of our time, even their critically and commercially unsuccessful version of Solaris. Soderbergh alone has a very unique, subtle, and incredibly crafty and imaginative style and Clooney, though hardly a versatile actor, is a very memorable and charismatic one, who maintains presence even in the midst of a hurricane, I imagine.The Good German is another film that rush-hour American audiences perhaps aren't ready for, due to its old-fashioned and heartfeltly idealistic sensibilities and intentions, which shine across each and every Clooney-Soderbergh outing. However, I believe, as with any misunderstood film, that time will be kinder to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Bad, But Disappointingly Derivative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Good German" might perhaps be an interesting film for those who know nothing about the Second World War and its aftermath, but there is nothing new here for anyone else. Is there anything that any movie could possibly reveal about the war and the depravity on all sides? If not, what's the point? In fact, this movie has no point, and looks like nothing more than a director's ego trip. It's not a bad movie, but neither is it more than just a good way to spend two hours in a movie house."The Good German" is less a movie about the war than it is a movie about movies about the war. "Casablanca" has already been done, so why do it again? You should know that this movie is filmed entirely in black &amp; white, almost as if to imply that had director Steven Soderburgh had been making movies in the 40's he could have ranked up there with the best directors of that era. Well, it ain't so; Soderburgh is no Orson Wells.The acting in this film is nothing special, either. I usually love Kate Blanchett, but here she displays all the acting range of a turnip. She gets to show nothing more than an enigmatic smile and gorgeous cheek bones. George Clooney never has had any acting range that I can detect. He is what he is, so his performance here is no better or worse than any other role he's ever played. As is the case with so many celebrity actors, Clooney always plays himself, so at least he's consistent. Toby Maguire's character, on the other hand, was somewhat more developed than that of the two main protagonists, but unfortunately for him, the second he's on the screen I could think of no one but Radar O'Reilly. Who knows, maybe that's part of Soderburgh's "homage", too.I'm glad I saw this movie, but I certainly won't go out of my way to it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The War brought out some very interesting moral questions, some of which are hinted at in the classic-looking film. Was the use of the atomic bomb moral? Did the average German bear some measure of guilt for letting the Holocaust happen? And, most importantly, was it right for America to hide the sins of the German scientists to gain their knowledge? That is the key question running throughout the film.Fans of classic film - those who love Casablanca, The Third Man, or A Foreign Affair - will appreciate the references to those films in the look and feel of this one.Fans of George Clooney and Cate Blanchett will be thrilled at their performance, especially Blanchett's. Fans of Tobey Maguire may be shock at his anti-hero, but he really played the part well.The look and feel of Steven Soderbergh's homage is brilliant, and the music of Thomas Newman made this an extremely enjoyable experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Soderbergh revives noir, very literally. Many reviews complain that he captured the look and feel but not the compelling stories of the time. I would suggest that this weird trip back to noir, 1940s technique &amp; film conventions and the War would benefit, not if it recaptured the past, but if it was less mired there. I can imagine why people would want to play these parts. I can even imagine why a director would want to revisit noir. I just can't imagine why they thought audiences would want to see it. Exactly what did this team imagine a WW2 story with time-warpy visuals would do for audiences in 2006? Seems like the obvious thing would be to draw parallels to the current war, but even that obvious point is missed in this complex, never compelling movie.The narrative is unfathomable. Facile Jake (Clooney) is rapt over chilly Blanchett, who is hiding (or not hiding - Thanks lousy script!) the fact that her absent husband was a Nazi. At long last when the husband finally shows up, he's so poorly cast that he delivers all the impact of a Gerber daisy. Soderbergh can't decide who should narrate, so everybody does. The narration is just one more layer of meaninglessness. At one point Clooney asks "Why did she want to leave Germany?" (Oh, I don't know George, maybe because it's the desperate, ruined place you've just showed us for 40 minutes?). At the one hour fifteen minute mark Kate heads for a secret hideout and asks, in narration, "Why didn't Jake (Clooney) follow me?" I just rolled my eyes. The concept of the "secret" hideout is given an early burial in this movie. The characters are so regularly surprised at their secret hideouts that you just assume that everyone knows everything except the audience. If the plot involved any of these locations remaining secret, it didn't register.It's over-scripted. These characters talk so much I'm surprised there's any oxygen let in Berlin. They tease out so much dialog about so little that it's hard to believe anyone doesn't know everything that's going on after 15 minutes. Any five minutes of the movie is competent, but all the 5-minute segments together just add up to a jumble; a texture of incoherence. Since it has no forward momentum, the prospect of seeing who lives, who dies and who gets out of Germany just does not hold any interest. It never reaches the quality of two dozen post-War noir movies that already exist from the 40s. As it failed to engage me, I looked it up on Rotten Tomatoes and was not exactly surprised to see it received a 35 percent rating. Its chilly, baroque plot just has no meaning for contemporary viewers; the movie has no impact on contemporary ideas; and the characters have no impact on each other. It reminds me of Soderbergh's Kafka, another exercise in style.Although viewers congratulate themselves for catching the Casablanca references at the end, The Third Man is more the template for the film's wholesale appropriations. And go watch The Big Lift (w/ Montgomery Clift - one of many movies Soderbergh is ripping off) for the original version of this story of an untrustable love in post-war Berlin. When you tire of watching Clooney getting his ass kicked in this, turn it off and get Lars von Trier's little-seen, hallucinogenic 'Zentropa.' It similarly follows the exploits of a naive, hapless American who arrives in Germany during the occupation to help get to the bottom of things, and gets a schooling. That IS worth your interest. You'll never figure it out, and you may hate it, but it will haunt you. And at least it imposes some intertextuality between the timeframes; and tosses some knowing artifice and technique into the mix.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much has been made about how Steven Soderbergh shot this film with old cameras and lighting equipment to achieve a modern day take on grainy high contrast black and white retro cinematography. But to expect some type of homage to old Hollywood classics like Casablanca and The Third Man and Chinatown would miss the point. The Good German rather obviously alludes to all those films, but is not interested in creating sympathetic characters or wallowing in hardboiled unrequited romance. Soderbergh is crafting an anti-classic, a film that looks and feels like those old movies but stands them on their head to mock their underlying sentimentality. In a way it sort of reminds me of a humorless cousin of Robert Altman's revisionist take on Raymond Chandler's The Long Goodbye, in which Elliot Gould reinvents tough guy Philip Marlow as a sort of wisecracking goofball who gets beaten up all the time. George Clooney's performance in The Good German seems off somehow until you realize that he embodies not so much a charismatic leading man as a blustery dumbbell who's letting himself be taken for a ride despite repeated (and accurate) admonitions from everyone in the movie that he's being an idiot. If, say, Brian De Palma had made this movie the acting and plot would have been so over the top and campy that it would have been hard to miss the intentional irony (The Black Dahlia), but Soderbergh goes to such great lengths to make his film look feel and move like an older film that one is tempted to keep looking for that cornball emotional payoff at the end that just isn't going to happen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not that I desperately disliked this film, it's just that i've seen it all before. I'm a huge film noir fan and I generally take Steven Soderberg's name attached to a project as a good thing. So it's fair to say I was expecting quite a bit from this film.Two of my favourite films are Casablanca and The Third Man and judging by this film it's the favourite films of Steven Soderberg &amp; Paul Attanasio. The film isn't bad and it is fairly enjoyable but only if you haven't seen either of these aforementioned classics before.I would liken the experience to going to one of those 'Classics For Kids' music recitals where they play classical music from well known adverts. People enjoy the performance and it encourages them to listen to more classical music. That's how this film was for me.It should probably come with a final shot saying 'If you enjoyed this picture, you might also enjoy these titles....' Judging the film purely on its own its pretty decent. It's hard to judge the film on its own merits when so much of it borrows from other films, from the soft focus shots of Cate Blanchett to the dialogue 'you should never have come back to Berlin'.Clooney is as watchable as ever, good solid performance but you can't help but feel he's doing Soderberg a favour. Blanchett seems to be playing Marlene Dietrich for the entire film and Beau Bridges plays Beau Bridges. Tobey Maguire however just winds me up, I don't understand the Hollywood A-listing of Maguire. None of his performances have ever enthralled me, this is no different.To sum up, if you've never seen any film noir before then give it a go. If you love your classic,moody black and white thrillers, give it a miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film in the Noir tradition, but much, much more.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came to this film in January 2007, well after its commercial release. The expectation I had of this film was that it was a retro Noir piece; an attempt to recreate a Noir film. I was prepared to be disappointed by a gimmicky film.Well, it certainly is Noir, but that is only a classification of the technique and genre of the film. That the director utilized the Noir camera to shoot this film was an excellent choice, and I believe that approach very much enhanced the finished product.The film is a morality piece. Among the best, if not the best, morality piece I have ever seen. The film manages to examine both the microcosm and the macrocosm with no deference to either one; something that has rarely been accomplished in film.The film's acting is excellent across the board, something that has been lacking in most films for many years. The plot is concise and quickly involves the viewer. It has been many years since I have left an American film and became more moved about the subject matter with each passing day. I have not been this moved by an American film since "Francis;" and Francis was based on a real character.Cate Blanchett has earned herself a place in my heart with her performance. I would compare her screen strength to Jane Greer's performance in "Out of the Past." In fact, the required depth of her character, which she portrays flawlessly, gives her performance an edge that has rarely been seen in any film.I treasure my list of favorites very selfishly, and am predisposed not to enter a new film on that list. But this film, with the potential mine field it faced by having been shot in an "old style" has earned a place on that list. On that list are such films as "On the Waterfront," "America, America," "Auntie Mame," "The Third Man," "Little Big Man," "8 ?," "The Open City," "The Thin Man," "Le Gentleman d'Epsom," "Night at the Opera," "The Misfits"- and only several dozen more of that caliber.There will be, I am sure, many who will dismiss this film as a try to recreate something that should be left to the past. But as one who treasures Noir, to see the genre brought to life and used to confront a larger than life subject matter is thrilling. Whether this film is as authentically Noir as the "The Killers," "The Big Heat," "Roadhouse," or any number of Noir classics is irrelevant. "The Good German" takes Noir to a new place. Noir has always examined the psyche of its characters, and occasionally the morality of the situation in which the characters have been placed, but rarely if ever has Noir been used to examine society as a whole.I would be very surprised if this film does not bring forth a spurt of neo Noir films. I can only hope that they have the depth, good writing, good camera work, good acting and directing that this film has.I plane to re-watch this film several more times now that I have found it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen this movie before. It was made 60 years ago and it's call "Casablanca." It has the same plot line. There is no difference between the two except for the cities! Here I thought I was walking into something interesting. I walked in about five minutes late and felt lost. Then I realized, even if I had seen the first five minutes, it still wouldn't have made any sense! Toby McGuire's acting was way too pushed and didn't feel natural for him. He's Peter Parker, not some angry sex driven solider, cast him in an appropriate role next time. And don't get me wrong, I love George Cloony, but this role didn't fit him at all! The random places that he would end up in were amazing! Just so happening to walk outside all casual, and find the body of his chauffuer, yeah right. The plot lost me with all of the fake twists and turns, and at the end, I still wasn't sure if they wanted Lena's husband or not! The technical make of the film was nice. There were, of course, a few inconsistencies, but overall, a very beautifully made film. The lighting reflected what film noir was in it's glory.

		<fullReview>The first images of the movie are quite intriguing and seducing (in a manner of speaking) : they're some black and white footages of post WWII Berlin, shot by Billy Wilder, that gives a sort of Rosselini's "Germania Anno Zero" touch to this opening. Then, we watch the arrival of a war reporter (Clooney), that comes to cover the signature of the Potsdam treaty in this desolation world. After this neo-realism touch, it's the all universe of the "film noir" that emerges on screen, and that won't leave it during the all movie. The "film noir" of the 40's will defines its all aesthetically codes (that means we'll have a black and white movie with a certain mannerism in the way actors play, different points of view in off voices, that every scenes are shoot in LA studio, and that the script will suffer from all kind of useless complications...) and all its themes (we'll see the disillusion of an idealist character in front of a corrupt world, a femme fatal, that manipulates the men who try to save her, etc...).This is quite amusing for a little while but it rapidly becomes a little boring, when the experimental concept of the movie is understood . But then it becomes quite annoying, when Soderbergh tries to transform his nostalgic style exercise (wich could have been the equivalent of Kaurismaki's "Juha" - a silent and black and white movie filmed in the 20's style, but in 1999 !!! - for the 40's period) in a message movie. Soderbergh is certainly a talented experimental director, which can really be cool and fun, as his "Ocean" series shows it, but he becomes really uncool, academical and heavy as soon as he tries to give a meaning and a sens to his frames (I know I won't have many friends by saying this, but I think "Erin Brockovich" or "Traffic" fits really well this category - please, don't say that my review is not useful !!!). So, this dense movie is always torn between its nostalgic cinematography and a cynical and brutal tone that denounces the contradiction of our modern world, and to me, this tension doesn't really brings anything new or original.In fact, as soon as the movie become a statement about the complicated faces of our world, where nothing is black or white but gray (that's certainly the true color of the movie), where every action hides a moral ambiguity, I was already beginning to fall asleep, wanting to go home, in order to watch "Casablanca", "Touch of evil" or "The big sleep" again.</fullReview>

George Clooney's correspondent, Jake Geismer, is ready to do anything to help his married former lover. Trouble is, nobody makes movies like this anymore either, so difficult is it to find dialogue that can replicate an idealism and world weariness that Bogey and Bergman easily did.Steven Soderbergh uses all authentic techniques to recreate the look of The Third Man and Casablanca, among many 40's noirish post-war intrigue films. All his lenses are fixed, CGI takes a vacation, process shots are easily noticed, and booms might show anytime for a lack of wireless recording. So good is his re-creation that he forgot to infuse his leads with enough character to make me care. In fact, so intent is the director on re-creation that he forgot creation is the essence of successful art.It's all style, 40's style, and the actors sometimes elicit laughter as they force their characters into the same style, awkwardly and artificially. A little sense of humor could have changed this mediocre piece of nostalgia into a first-rate parody that takes noir to the next level in the inevitable cycle of genres. Just take a look at the laughably imitative last scene in the airport, if you remember Michael Curtiz's tense, ironic ending to Casablanca. Claude Reins, where are you when we need you? They don't make them like this anymore, they never did, and they shouldn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Synthetic NoirThursday, December 14, 7:00pm The Guild 45thSet in post-war Berlin on the eve of the August 1945 Potsdam Conference, 'The Good German' stars George Clooney as Captain Jacob 'Jake' Geismer, an Army correspondent who becomes entangled in the murder investigation of his driver Tully (Tobey Maguire), and the real truth behind Lena (Cate Blanchett), a beautiful femme fatale. Despite director Steven Soderbergh's use of vintage optics and sound equipment, his earnest attempt to recreate the look and feel of nineteen forties film noir is nothing more than a well schooled exercise in technique. Blanchett (almost always exceptional) strains to summarize the noir heroine, while intentionally blown out contrast, a black and white image filmed on color stock (sorry guys, it just doesn't look right) and every obvious noir cliché, right down to a DC-3 on the airport tarmac with it's engines running in the final scene, serve only as distractions to an already threadbare, forgettable story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Good German' not that good a film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The gritty black-and-white cinematography suggests a film noir revisit, but that's as compelling as this cross between "Casablanca" and "Chinatown" manages to achieve.With its homage to 1940s bleak, complete with washout scenes and clipped dialogue, director Stephen Soderbergh is obviously respectful of the era, but the script, adapted by Paul Attanasio, leaves much to be desired.After all, is this an indictment on the German people; an accusation of collusion against the victorious Allied powers (who took whatever Nazi scientist and technician for their own, no matter what they may have done during the war); or is it just an old-fashioned murder mystery? The film cannot seem to decide what it wants to be."The Good German" takes place in post-war Berlin, and focuses on correspondent Jake Geismer (George Clooney). Evidently, he works for the lefty magazine The New Republic (I didn't know that publication was around in WWII or if it was considered progressive at the time, but I digress).He is accompanied by a seedy driver, Cpl. Tully (Tobey Maguire) and nothing is as it seems.Tully is ultimately murdered, and Jake, unable to get press credentials to cover the July, 1945 Potsdam Conference (with Truman, Churchill and Stalin), begins to investigate some seedy goings-on.It turns out that Tully was living with a German prostitute, Lena (Cate Blanchett), a woman Jake knew before the war. The Russians and Americans want her husband, Emil, because of his work on the V-2 rocket program; but she claims he's dead.Blancett ? with an icy cool Dietrich-like manner ? steals the picture, and she may end up with another Oscar nomination for her efforts. Clooney, on the other hand, spends most of the film getting the crap beat out of him (every Republican's fantasy, eh?).Despite repeated attempts to reach the intrigue bar set by the much superior Carol Reed picture, "The Third Man" (1950), "The Good German" never matches it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great period piece with various cinematic nods</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an enjoyable period piece that is well cast and edited. Cate Blanchett and George Clooney bring the golden age of Hollywood back to the screen with each film they are in. I very much enjoyed seeing the original documentaries from the time edited into the live action. This is not a flashy film, but the editors should have some raves. The film evokes other classics set in this era, including Rainer Werner Fassbinder's The Marriage of Maria Braun, without detracting from the tension of the plot. Not campy not comedic and manages to entertain while puncturing some of the 1950s propaganda, especially with the Tully character. I had no idea of the plot on this film so was pleasantly surprised by the twists.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw The Good German last night and was totally surprised. The critics have been blasting this movie consistently so I was expecting a well intentioned movie but not a good movie. What I saw was not only a well intentioned movie but a GREAT movie! I wonder if the critics were shown the correct movie??? Nothing that I have read corresponds with what I saw last night.What I saw was a beautifully filmed and acted film that does capture the "old days" of film. The story was a wonderful surprise. It is rare when a movie adapted from a book is as good as the book. In this case, the screenplay is BETTER than the book. I won't spoil too much, but I will say that major plots were changed from the book, for the better. Do not hesitate to go to see this movie. I wouldn't wait for the DVD because seeing The Good German on the big screen is quite a wonderful experience.</fullReview>

The history that exists in Berlin alone is just an extra additive to this wonderfully filmed movie. Very unique way to film the movie. Being only 21, I have not really experienced the entire black and white movie phase therefore this is was very different for me. I really enjoyed it. I was also extremely impressed with Blanchett's performance. She really stole the show from the other A-List actors. Overall, I really enjoyed viewing this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We'll Always Have Berlin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Always the cameraman first, director Steven Soderbergh plays homage to the films of the 30's and 40's (especially "Casablanca") with this black and white telling of Joseph Kanon's novel.Soderbergh is really the star here as his use of fixed camera and boom mic's combined with stunning lighting provide some insight into what film-making of that era and this era combined would be. As in the past, the B&amp;W does more for some actors than others. George Clooney looks good (big surprise there) and Tobey Maguire looks impish and goofy. As a matter of fact, as fun as it is to see Batman and Spider-Man on camera together, Maguire played his character so over the top, that I was actually relieved at his road traveled.Proving to be a near reincarnation of Marlene Dietrich or Greta Garbo, Cate Blanchett really shines here as the misguided heroine. Although she has few actual lines of dialogue, her "look" is so wonderful, it matters little. I kept waiting for her to break out in a song while in the tavern.Decent support work provided the rarely seen Beau Bridges and veteran Jack Thompson are a nice touch and the actual news footage of the war parade and the summit with Truman, Stalin and Churchill is more than a bit creepy.The only thing preventing the film from a higher rating is the almost lame, near boring story. We never connect with Clooney or Blanchett and feel like cheering when Maguire's lines mercifully end. A bit more of the Bridges character and an earlier explanation of Blanchett's motivation would have gone a long way in drawing the audience in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak script and terrible faux-noir cinematography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Classic film noir has a crisp, high-contrast look. "The Good German" has gauzy, soft-focus cinematography that would be more appropriate in a perfume commercial. The mushy images and consistently overexposed highlights make the film hard on the eyes and a chore to watch.The poor cinematography might be tolerable if the script were worthwhile. Unfortunately, the script is even worse than the photography. The story plods from one uninteresting plot point to another with no sense of momentum. The acting is nothing special, either -- not that anyone could save such an ugly, badly written film.The obvious comparison is to Jacques Tourneur's "Berlin Express," a 1948 noir set in post-war Berlin. Tourneur's film is one of his weaker efforts, but it's a minor masterpiece compared to Soderbergh's failed pseudo-noir.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Good German is a good noir film, that tries to be like the old noir films, instead of only being inspired by them. The few touches that were not possible then (sexual scenes and swearing) are understandable, though they are also obvious clues that the movie is quite modern.I have not read the book of which this is based, but it does seem to be a story that lends itself perfectly to the film genre. Cate Blanchett's character is a great femme fatale, Clooney's journalist great as the wounded man against everyone, etc. And the world war 2 backdrop lends itself fine, as it is the era where the noir movies were made. So as a film noir project, this is a good one.The story itself is at times interesting, but I often found myself losing a bit interest. Much of the actual investigating happens off screen, which is it bad, as it was the most fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's 1945 Berlin. The city is occupied by the Allies but Japan is still fighting on. American military correspondent Jake Geismer (George Clooney) arrives to cover the upcoming Potsdam peace conference. Tully (Tobey Maguire) is assigned to be his driver. Tully is happy to be working in the motor pool where he can deal in the black market. Lena (Cate Blanchett) is sleeping with him in the hopes of getting out of Germany. Tully gets beaten up by someone looking for Emil Brandt. Lena reveals that Emil is her presumed-dead husband. Jake is shocked to see Lena who was his stringer in pre-war Berlin. General Sikorsky and the Soviets are also looking for Emil. Tully does a deal and ends up dead with a belt filled with money in the Russian zone.This Steven Soderbergh film is done entirely in black and white. It references back to the noir espionage films. The first half is interesting although Tobey Maguire's death does throw it off. He was the protagonist until he's not. There is a few layers of mysteries to Lena but the final layer is less compelling than Soderbergh thinks it is. There are some interesting things happening in this movie but the second half stumbles in a muddle of less-than-compelling reveals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very stylish homage to film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Soderbergh's directorial debut, Sex, Lies &amp; Videotape instantly marked him as one to watch, but unfortunately, he later proved to be a very much hit-and-miss filmmaker. He has made some great movies (like Traffic, Erin Brockovich, maybe Ocean's Eleven) and some atrocious ones (like Full Frontal or The Informant!), as well.The Good German is one of his better efforts and it's definitely worth a watch, if for nothing else than the astonishingly faithful recreation of the film noir style of the 1940s and the beautiful black-and-white cinematography (Soderbergh's own work under a false name). I honestly feel the cinematography should have been nominated for an Academy Award. Thanks to the amazing lighting and make-up, Cate Blanchett looks jaw-droppingly beautiful in this one (and very noir-ish).A word of caution, however: despite what the theatrical poster suggests, this is not a romantic movie like Casablanca, rather a blend between American film noir and the Italian neorealism of the 1940s. The tone is quite somber and the characters are not likable heroes, which is appropriate since the film is about how war twists people inside out (that aspect is masterfully conveyed through Tobey Maguire's genuinely chilling character), how it compromises our moral integrity and blurs the line between good and evil. It's about what people would do in order to survive such horrendous times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It happens sometimes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As it happened many times in film history, a film made by great artists, written from a book based on historical events, is ending in a tasteless pudding. Steven Soderbergh made many good films, often a tribute to many genres like "film noir", science fiction, cops and robbers, etc. We're having a nice cast in this film, and none of them should be proud of the result. It's tough not liking Clooney and Blanchett. and here, they are a strange couple. Probably because their relation in the story started before the Second World War, and we don't know much of it. It's not helping to try to understand where their love affair is fitting in all this complex historical scheme. Here, I guess the problem is the screenplay, based on Joseph Kanon's novel which counts more than 500 pages. It's complicated to make a story in a film lasting 105 minutes. The music is nice, the cinematography all in black and white is also very beautiful. But when the film is ending, you just try to figure out what went wrong. Apart the screenplay, we should also ask why choosing Blanchett to play this character. Her German husband seems too young for her, her accent is not credible. And her eyes are covered with dark lenses, which are giving the actress a strange look, like if she's not feeling well. Maybe she did. It's not completely bad, but after watching it, it's easy to understand why it was a commercial flop, probably explaining why Clooney and Soderbergh had to make "Ocean's 13".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film starts out with dramatic music on the ruins of post-war Berlin. Jake Geismar (George Clooney) has just arrived in Berlin. His story quickly gets entwined with Lena (Cate Blanchett), a former lover, and Tully (Tobey Maguire), his driver. Tully works in the black market and has a relationship with Lena, who is now a prostitute. Through Tully, Geismar finds Lena again. Tully is busy trying to get Lena out of Berlin, who herself is busy trying to protect her husband Emil. The occupying powers are seeking Emil, as he was an officer in the military with important information. In part due to this, Tully's attempt to get Lena out of Berlin fails and Tully ends up murdered. Geismar discovers this and spends his time trying to ensure Lena's safety and that she, too, can get out of Berlin. He and Lena turn over Emil but are betrayed and Emil is murdered. Geismar is still able to get Lena out of Berlin but learns that she, like many others, was involved in war crimes.I really like the film noir. I like the camera work that plays with light and shadows. I also enjoyed the detective/crime story so common in the genre. This is pretty simple wording, but it's really easy to get into the story and excitement in this type of film-making. It was pointed out that the language was somewhat vulgar, and that there was too much sex for a REAL film noir. I find these sorts of things perhaps a little cheap due to their lack of authenticity, but Clooney, Maguire, and Blanchett really pulled the thing together; it was nice to see modern actors in an older style of film. I also throughly enjoyed the setting in post-war Berlin. This adds a good deal of excitement. I recommend this film, though I'm sure fans of quality cinema will appreciate more than most.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Soderbergh's homage to Casablanca and The Third Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Soderbergh attempts to recapture 1945 Hollywood with the use of black and white film, studio sets, dramatic music, and camera techniques used back then in "The Good German," a 2006 film starring George Clooney, Cate Blanchett and Jeff Bridges.In 1945, a journalist, Jake Geismer, arrives to cover the Potsdam conference. He's assigned a driver, Corporal Tully (Toby Maguire) who deals in the black market and is trying to get his girlfriend Lena (Blanchett), now a prostitute, out of Berlin. When he finds out that interested parties want to find Lena's husband, Emil Brandt, he claims to be able to turn him over for a price. Meanwhile, Lena tells Tully that Emil is dead. It doesn't matter to Tully - by the time anyone realizes he really doesn't have him, they'll be in London with lots of money.It turns out that Jake, who lived in Berlin previously, knows Lena and in fact was going to try to find her. It doesn't take him long to figure out that he was assigned Tully on purpose, and the Americans want something from Lena. He gets different stories, but which is the truth? That he was secretary to Franz Bettmann (based on German scientist Arthur Rudolph), whom the Americans are taking under their protection in order to have him work for their rocket program, and Bettmann wants him along? Or is it that he has paperwork they want to get their hands on? Lena isn't being totally honest with Jake, and she wasn't honest with Tully. But she's very honest about what she wants: to get out of Berlin...without her husband.Actually not a bad film that didn't make any money. Soderbergh pays tribute to Casablanca, particularly at the end of the film, and the novel by Joseph Kanon contains elements of The Third Man and Casablanca.I liked the black and white and the moody lighting and camera-work, all of which were done the way they were in 1945. We're so used to seeing old films in black and white, that it's almost as if history is in black and white and easier to buy when it's filmed that way. Crazy but true.Cate Blanchett turns in another excellent performance as Lena, a complicated woman with plenty to hide, but who is a survivor in every sense of the word. George Clooney to me was Tyrone Power incarnate, and he does a good job as a confused man who can't tell the players without a scorecard and can't trust anyone.As for the title, "The Good German" - just who is the good German? Lena refers to her husband as "a good German" because he wants to tell what he knows and restore Germany to the way it was before Hitler. Or is Bettmann the good German because he's useful to the U.S.? And what about the fact that the U.S. harbored scientists and other useful people who were in fact war criminals? It seems like a lot of people have secrets.All in all, while not entirely successful, a very interesting step back, telling an old-fashioned story in an old-fashioned way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A book, a movie and the good German, who is it, between Casablanca, The Man in Between and Germany anno zero. Berlin, July, 1945. Journalist Jake Geismer arrives to cover the Potsdam conference, issued a captain's uniform for easier passage. He also wants to find Lena, now a prostitute desperate to get out of Berlin. He discovers that the driver he's assigned, Corporal Tully, is Lena's keeper. As everyone, she too has something to sell. In exchange a 'Persilschein' to get out of Berlin. It is her (hidden) dead husband, the scientist Emil Brandt, a member in the Bettman/von Braun, who has the evidence of what happened at Dora. He the valuable, dangerous witness, valuable for the Russian and American but also dangerous. The story in the movie is told by Tully, Jake and by Lena, the desperate Jewish wife of a former SS officer. She killed Tully; he came too near the truth. Her plan is to leave Berlin without her SS-husband. At one point she remind Jake of her past: "I'm a Nzi myself. It's true Heil Hitler. No, not a Nazi. None of us. Just something to join, like a sport club. How could you love someone for all those years and not know them? Did you ever love a Nazi? How about a Jew. A Nazi and a Jew both, better yet. I survived." "What happened to the rest of the family?" Jake asks. "They got send to the camps. Everyone. My mother, uncles, cousins. Everyone dead. As the wife of a SS-man I was exempt. Jewess is not a Jew. That's the way they used to put it. And at the end no one was exempt." In the ending scene, ? la Casablanca she tells him: "There where not so many. You are right. So when they caught me, I turned that to my advantage. I used the skills you taught me. When I worked for you, for the newspaper. Watch, observe. The stupid risks they would take. Lunch at Aschinger's. Just to remind themselves they where still human. I found 12. I turned over 12 people over to the Gestapo. That's how I survived. It was all to survive. Everything. Now you know the last piece in your puzzle." Everybody was, is still and will be involved of what Berlin happens.Greed reach for a part of the cake. The critics are not good. The reason? Perhaps that not only the scapegoat Germany for the ununderstandable wound Auschwitz forced everybody to be part of skandalon. The Judenrat, the lenabrandts as the 'greifers', the men behind Hitler (not to bomb the railway lines to Auschwitz). After WW II, Germany at the edge of suicide the survivors survive by whatever they can reach at. Not to forget Emil in Germanny anno zero, helping his father, the waste-over, to die. Himself committing suicide. He, the German, had not as Erich in the book, a greiffers child, a Jake and Lena and a Dr Rosen. In the center of 'Me, myself &amp; I' the heroine of temps noir, femme fatale Lena Brandt, surviving. Why this and not the books ending?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A heavy laden revisit to old film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The director wishes to recreate a long lost genre with this film. Using a smaller film ratio rather than a full cinema widescreen view, old style lighting, fixed cameras and filming in black &amp; white, this all hankers back to the glory days of the film noir, in particular classics like "The Third Man".Let's be honest, few of us are really experts in the genre. It's sadly old hat for too many who let it pass them by. Films like "The Third Man" are really compulsory for film lovers, and it's great to see homages made to it. However, this film doesn't succeed.The plot of this film is convoluted to say the least, and takes us on a journey as our main man finds that his re-acquaintance in post-WW2 Berlin with an old flame is no mere coincidence. Add in politics, murder, mystery &amp; intrigue and you have one tricky story. You'll follow the plot enough but for some reason I just found it all too uninteresting at the end. I can't finger it, maybe I couldn't empathise with the characters (despite some good acting by Clooney &amp; Blanchett). Just not sure about it.It's overall far from emulating the best of the old school movies, and it's quite disappointing. Never makes the impression you'd hope despite interesting themes (greed, realpolitik, survival, love etc). Not one I'll likely be looking back on to view again sadly. Hopefully, others will try again in this genre for better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Good German" is the first modern film I have seen filmed in black and white, and as such, is interesting in and of itself. It also has a good cast. But the plot is disappointing.It's basically a remake of "The Third Man" but wasn't nearly as well done or convincing. There were also touches in this movie which were reminiscent of "Casablanca" and "Judgement At Nuremberg" inviting obvious comparisons and almost inevitably leading to disappointment (at least for audience members who have seen the original versions.) This film is decidedly noir and may appeal to fans of film noir; it may also somewhat accurately depict what it was like in Berlin shortly after the end of WWII; but it fails to connect a modern audience with that hardscrabble world the way "Charlotte Gray" did. It would have been a better film if it had something more to portray than human degradation.While it's true that things are not always what they seem, a good movie takes situations like that and turns them into much more than what they seemed to be at first glance. "The Good German" never achieves that distinction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I worry about director Steven Soderbergh. He's trying too hard to come up with "something different." New gimmicks do not a great film make. He's done phenomenal work in the past, including TRAFFIC and The OCEAN'S resurgence (i.e., OCEAN'S ELEVEN, etc.). These are straightforward stories with characters we can grasp, laugh at, or worry about. But then he stretches too far and comes up with EROS, SOLARIS (which wasn't too bad), and the bottom rung BUBBLE.Attempting to capture some of that ancient Hollywood gold, Soderbergh puts up THE GOOD German, a black and white feature in the vein of CASABLANCA. But any resemblance to the former film ends with the lack of technicolor. Given a chop-shop style script, the success of the movie hung on the uncharacteristic style more than the acting, dialogue, or story. The unfortunate part about it is that it doesn't utilize the compelling narrative in which the film is based upon, the novel by Joseph Kanon.The Good German, that term, is meant to denote a German who may have had ties to Nazi-ism but who's record was cleaned up (on paper) so that they could be exported from the country without the threat of being accused of war crimes. Never did this essential element come through on film. What did, though, was a mish-mash of scenes that seemed strung together without regard to story-flow nor character portrayal. We never care for ? or understand the motivations of ? any of these people.The star is George Clooney (GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK) as Jacob "Jake" Geismer, a journalist sent to Berlin for the post-WWII Potsdam conference. Once there, we quickly learn that he's been here before. In fact, he was involved with a lovely (but married) German named Lena Brandt (Cate Blanchett, BABEL). Lena is now involved with Corporal Patrick Tully (Tobey Maguire, THE ICE STORM) who also happens to be Jake's back-stabbing driver. Is this all coincidence? Jake soon finds out that Lena's supposedly dead husband may have important documents those at the Potsdam conference want to keep quiet (i.e., destroy). When Tully turns up dead, the heat hits Jake full-on, sparking up his naturally inquisitive journalist mind. Everyone has an agenda and wants something from each other.And that's about it...The looping of intrigue is nothing new to cinema, but it can be done correctly if the acting and story are entertaining. You won't find that here. The characters/actors are wooden at best, which is quite a surprise considering the high-caliber cast. Lacking this, one would hope to find a pearl of success somewhere within the script. Not so. Again, it has a haphazard feel with poor fluidity.In the end, it is the filming technique and in-you-face style that stands out over anything of substance. If you really want to know what a Good German is, read Kanon's novel and skip Soderbergh's interpretation.</fullReview>

Its main feature is the attempt to recreate the classic cinema of the 40s and 50s, with a spy story and romance, and an argument rather than linear (no flashbacks, although it is interesting as the story changes depending on who the account ).Technically the film is impeccable: everything is very well recreated the sets (Berlin in ruins), costumes, and you really get the feeling of being in a movie from before, with the addition that the actors are current, and characters are more expressive than those of that time (good and bad) are just survivors, many of them highly questionable morality.If "The Good German" had been shot in 1950, now would be a classic. All that is criticized, the pursuit of technical perfection, the formalism above history is due to excessive purism critics as trying to copy masterpieces like "The Third Man" and "Casablanca" is a very difficult task. The script is good, the soundtrack too, and the performances are very good, especially that of Cate Blanchett.The end is an undisguised tribute to a great classic of this genre, is not wasted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Documents, documents, who's got the documents?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Soderbergh's black-and-white paean to movies past, a stylized but internally confused and grossly miscast homage to WWII-era Welles and Curtiz. In 1945 Berlin, a war correspondent from the U.S. is reunited by chance with an old flame, a Jewish German who is now the wife of a highly sought-after former SS officer once involved in the V-2 rocket program at Camp Dora. Paul Attanasio's adaptation of the novel by Joseph Kanon is filled with murder, war criminals, cover-ups, and secret documents--a scenario so convoluted as to be almost amusing (though the slow pacing mitigates that). George Clooney is so lightweight a screen-presence that nothing he says or does holds any conviction; he is completely without range, and his dealings with thuggish driver Tobey Maguire (painfully miscast) and smoky ex-lover Cate Blanchett are plodding. Blanchett's Lena is in need of a visa to leave the country, causing Clooney's Geismar to trade her husband's writings to the Army in exchange for her flight and 'de-Nazification'; this leads to a farewell bit at the airport that is (rather wonderfully) reminiscent of the finale to "Casablanca". Unfortunately, the characters haven't built up our sympathies, and the dialogue just isn't there in terms of a gripping narrative, to warrant much more than a passing interest in the action. Soderbergh uses stock footage to create a world around his cast, and the atmosphere is occasionally striking, but the modern talk (with lots of "f-you's") seems crassly out of step with what we're experiencing viscerally, and the glorification of the old Warner Bros. war-staples becomes merely window-dressing. A huge disappointment at the box-office, and for good reason: the picture struggles to come to life without ever attaining a heart. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modern day 'film noir' set in and around post-war Berlin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Good German" is a black and white film, done closely in the traditional film noir style. In its editing it mixes real archival film with fictional footage made for this movie, and it does it very well. At times it is hard to tell which we are watching.The star is George Clooney as Jake Geismer, a correspondent who comes to Berlin because of the Potsdam conference, where USA, Russia, and Britain were to meet and draw up post-war boundaries.But things start to go awry right away with Tobey Maguire as Tully, an enlisted man who was assigned as his driver. While driver assignments usually are random, Jake eventually finds out that Tully was assigned to him for a reason. They were looking for a key Nazi German soldier and they hoped Jake and Tully would lead them to him. Jake years earlier, and Tully now, had relationships with Lena.Australian Cate Blanchett is superb as Lena Brandt, a German woman who now makes ends meet as a part-time prostitute. Blanchett is not particularly pretty and her mannish looks fit her role perfectly here, as does her fabricated German accent. As it turns out, it is her husband, Emil Brandt, that they are looking for. Even though he was reported dead 6 months ago, he was believed to still be alive.Clooney and the cast are all good here, it is a very enjoyable film noir mystery.SPOILERS: Emil Brandt was the "good German." He was the assistant to a Nazi who was responsible for thousands of deaths of Jews, by transporting them in a truck into which the exhaust was piped, so upon arrival they were all dead. The Americans and Allies wanted Brandt so that he could be a witness to the crimes, while the Germans wanted him dead. In a scene near the end, when it looked like Brandt would make it to safety, he is hunted down in a crowd and murdered. But Lena manages to escape Berlin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For some reason I did not feel that George Clooney, (John Geismer) belonged in this role, he just said his lines and did what was expected of him and that was that as far as his performance.On the other hand, Cate Blanchett, (Lena Brandt) put herself in her role as a woman who had to keep alive under the Nazi rule in Berlin and then when Germany was divided with Russia it became even harder for her to leave Germany Her former lover years ago was John Geismer, who once again started a relationship even though he found out her husband was still alive and was a scientist who worked on the rockets that bombed London England during WW II. John Geismer did everything that he could to find a way to get her out of the country, but Lena had another boyfriend who was trying to do the same thing. This period of time was during the Potsdam Meeting between the U.S., Britain and Russia leaders, Harry Truman was President of the United States during this period of time in history.This film has many twists and turns and some very dark secrets that are not revealed until the very end of the film.</fullReview>

In trying to get in contact with his old love he will try to resolve a murder and will discover many things that will surprise him.If you are a fan of film noir movies you have to watch "the good German"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Good German 9-15-08I love black and white cinematography. If well executed it can be arguably more beautiful than anything shot in color. Suffice to say that The Good German was like a wet dream to a black and white nut like yours truly. Its contrasty look was absolutely gorgeous from beginning to end. But even the most beautiful of films cant survive on look alone...there has to be something more. In the story department TGG is a rather effective exercise in genre. That genre being in part mystery. Like any good mystery the plot keeps itself just enough steps ahead of you to stay interesting. The pacing of said narrative is to my way of thinking elegant which can at times be dull...this would be the films only downfall. It has trouble keeping you fully invested in it as the characters seem a bit generic. Criticisms of style over substance come to mind but at the end of the day this is a good flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a thriller in style, maybe too much style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I like in director Steven Soderbergh's work is that one cannot expect from him a film without surprises. Although his stories are sometimes quite on the line of the usual Hollywood stuff, the way he is bringing them too screen is in most cases surprising. Even if the results are mixed many times, they are also interesting in most cases.This is the case in 'The Goog German' as well. Steven Soderbergh takes the post-war Berlin story in the novel by Joseph Kannon about a journalist caught in the Web of war crimes investigations, spying intrigues and romantic relationships and brings it to screen in a 40s cinema style, matching the image with the subject. What results is a very catching effect, and I really liked the documentary like rendition of the city, one of the best I have ever seen on screen.Acting is well helped especially by the fabulous Cate Blanchett who fits well in the overall atmosphere and has a screen quality close to a Ingrid Bergman or Katherine Hepburn. George Clooney comes close, and the rest of the cast does a good job. The main problem of the film is however the story telling. While focusing on the style of the film Soderbergh seems to have forgotten to make the story smooth and and simple, by imitating the ambiguity of the characters played 60 years ago by a Bogart we end by not being sure what each character on the screens means to be. The story seems confusing and as viewers we end by admiring what we see on screen but caring less about the story or the fate of the characters. And this is eventually a failure for a film that tries to be too much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the post-war Berlin, military reporter Jake Geismer (Oscar-Winner:George Clooney) goes back to the country for the peace negotiations between the Allied Powers. He finds himself in a murder investigation, when his driver Tully (Tobey Maguire) found dead in the Postdam conference grounds. He finds out that his former driver was involved with his former lover/prostitute Lena Brandt (Oscar-Winner:Cate Blanchett). Which Jake used Lena for spying during the NAZI invasion in the past. Which Tully and Lena were involved in the black market. But before Tully was murder, he was looking for Lena's husband (Christian Oliver). Who was former SS officer for the German scientist Franz Bettmann, who is a famous weapons engineer. Which Tully was looking for him for $100,000 German Reichsmarks for the Germans. Which Tully was planning to rip-off from the German General Sikorsky (Ravil Isyanov). Which Lena was telling Tully that her former husband is dead. But Jake doesn't believe that his former girlfriend is telling the truth, especially when Jake finds himself in a conspiracy when the American and German military are searching for the same man.Directed by Steven Soderbergh (The Ocean's Trilogy, Erin Brockovich, Out of Sight) made an interesting thriller that is set in the mid 1940's. Soderbergh captures the filming style of the 1940's, which is almost looks like an old film on purpose. The cast does an good job with the roles, especially Blanchett who looks great in Black &amp; White. Who certainly recalls the classy actresses of that era. While the premise is intriguing, the story could have been more complex or more suspenseful. Soderbergh's work like most of his films, there's more style than substance.DVD has an sharp Pan &amp; Scan (1.33:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. There's no bonus features on this DVD. Since the feature was shot in a aspect ratio of 1.66:1 format. The director decided for the feature to be presented in Full Frame instead to capture the look of cinema in the old days. One of my favorite moments watching this movie was Maguire's performance, which he was effectively cast against type. I wish his character lasted a little longer before he getting killed. Clooney's performance is solid as usual, especially in the films that the actor worked with the director before and after."The Good German" will probably found an cult audience on DVD, since it had mixed reactions from film critics and it was performed poorly at the box office. It's a good movie and it's entertaining for the mature audiences. For all it's flaws, it is still worth a look. Good Oscar-Nominated music score by Thomas Newman (American Beauty, The Green Mile, The Shawshank Redemption) are one of the highlights. Soderbergh also edited and photographed the film under different names. Based on a novel by Joseph Kanon. Screenplay by Paul Attansio (Disclosure, Donnie Brasco, Sphere). (*** ?/*****).</fullReview>

Despite the fact I extremely dislike the smarmy George Clooney, and am not at all pleased with the gee golly acting of Toby McGuire, they put in some great performances here. A twisted tale of dead bodies and international cover ups during post war German occupation. The Soviets and Americans are in a race to steal the Nazi's greatest scientific minds and exploit them for their own gains. Toss in a secret a German woman has, or more specifically her presumed dead husband has about one scientist in particular, and you have a nifty little number in the tradition of Orson Welles greatest film The Third Man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Keeping the feel of the forties intact</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the ostensible seriousness of the subject matter, Soderberg's loving homage to black-and-white forties' war-time film noir was made, one assumes, with his tongue lodged very firmly in his cheek. I can't vouchsafe for the seriousness of Joseph Kanon's original novel but Paul Attanasio's witty, oblique screenplay plays fast and loose with the material so that, sex and violence notwithstanding, what we have is very much a pastiche. It is also marvellous, a film-buff's delight as well as being something of a technical marvel. Not content to simply recreate the feel of a forties' movie, Soderberg used no equipment in the filming that wouldn't have been available to a director of the period, filling in backgrounds with back projection and using good old-fashioned wipes in the editing. And whether or not it was his choice of camera as much as his decision to use black-and-white, the film looks extraordinary. (Soderberg was the DOP, as 'Peter Andrews', as well as the editor).The story is convoluted and full of red herrings; people are not necessarily what they seem and mid-way through you realize the plot, such as it is, isn't what matters. Cliché piles upon cliché only for Soderberg to pull the rug from under us. This is a man having fun, playing with our expectations and reveling in the whole process of making movies. In this respect, the film sits midway between his experimental 'art-house' movies and commercial ventures such as "Traffic" and the "Oceans" franchise, though its audience is more likely to come from the former camp.And finally a word for the players. If George Clooney is too quick to play 'straight' and hence miss the point, both Cate Blanchett and Tobey Maguire have a field day, subverting the traditional roles of femme fatale and potential villain. Blanchett, especially, is a wonder. With her big wide eyes and Dietrich-like pout, she slinks through the film as to the manor born. She even manages to evoke pathos in the midst of pastiche, consolidating her position as one of the best actresses working anywhere in the movies today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Good German" - An exercise in film nostalgia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Good German" is a film noir ? not a neo-noir or a modern interpretation of a noir but a classic film noir. The only aspects that distinguish it from the noirs of the forties and fifties are the occasional swear words and the recognisable faces of George Clooney, Tobey Maguire and Cate Blanchett.Director Soderbergh has used classic techniques and equipment, inter-cutting newsreel footage with scenes shot on the back lot. Back projection helps create post-war Berlin in southern California. All this makes for an interesting experiment; and I would be interested to know what in particular Soderbergh found difficult filming in this manner; but does it make for an interesting film? The resulting film certainly proves to be a watchable noir. It features all the classic elements ? a convoluted plot full of double crossing villains, a femme fatale and a protagonist lost in a rapidly changing world. The plot of Americans and Russians engaging in a clandestine struggle to reap the benefits of Nazi Germany's rocket scientists in 1945 Berlin is fantastic noir material ? and one that would have been largely impossible to make in the forties due to political considerations.The main let down in the film is the performances. For all his talents Clooney is no Bogart and there is little chemistry between Cate Blanchett and himself. The supporting cast also fails to make the same impact as the great character actors managed in the classic film noirs.Soderbergh does succeed in creating an enjoyable noir but also one that aficionados will find derivative and lacking in some areas whilst modern audiences are likely to find the film dated. The result is a film that is a nostalgic oddity but not essential viewing.7/10 ? Good but not great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A bit of a dud.This Steven Soderbergh experiment tries to recreate the tone and look of WWII cinema and all of those films noir that used the war as a backdrop for stories of foreign intrigue and dirty dealings. He films everything in crisp black and white and uses a square aspect ratio, the same ratio that films were shot in prior to the invention of CinemaScope. But the movie doesn't really work, because Soderbergh doesn't pay enough attention to telling his story. The whole film is sluggishly paced and the screenplay is muddled. I enjoyed the look of the film, but that only takes one so far.George Clooney looks bored in the role of our hero, a part Humphrey Bogart might have played back in the day, and Cate Blanchett gets the Marlene Dietrich role, complete with guttural German accent. Tobey Maguire is woefully miscast as an unbalanced American G.I., and his death early into the film is rather welcome. Can anyone take Maguire seriously playing anything other than a pimply teenager? Soderbergh doesn't take his experiment far enough. Too much of this film feels contemporary, like the acting styles and the profanity and violence that pepper the screenplay. Soderbergh even gets the opening titles wrong. Only Cate Blanchett, whose performance reminded me of Alida Valli's in "The Third Man," and Thomas Newman, who blankets the entire film in an atmospheric score, succeed in truly working in the appropriate styles. Otherwise, we just get a modern-day movie filmed in black and white, and not even a very good movie, leaving one to wonder what exactly was the point of Soderbergh's exercise to begin with? Intentionally paying homage to "Casablanca" at the film's finale serves only to highlight how far away from that movie this movie is.Grade: C</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While this may have seemed like an interesting experiment on paper ? to be shot in black-and-white and in the defunct Academy (1.33:1) aspect ratio thus duplicating the classical feel of film noir ? all this effort was then nullified by the necessity to incorporate modern elements into the fray in the form of bouts of sex and violence and a surplus of foul language! The general tone of the film is clearly inspired by THE THIRD MAN (1949; with its backdrop of war-torn buildings and a major sequence set in the sewer), the rekindled romance and bittersweet airport finale by CASABLANCA (1942), and the high-ranking conspiracy by CHINATOWN (1974; like Jack Nicholson in that most definitive of modern noirs, George Clooney here even sports a prominent wound for a good part of the running time!). Clooney isn't bad, ditto leading lady Cate Blanchett ? even if her character is an uneasy amalgam of all three heroines of the films mentioned above (Alida Valli, Ingrid Bergman and Faye Dunaway), plus an affected but inevitable Marlene Dietrich accent; Tobey Maguire's role proves to be all-too-brief and a red herring to boot. Soderbergh's own cinematography (under his regular alias of Peter Andrews) is undeniably evocative but, unfortunately, the central mystery isn't particularly absorbing ? not helped by a snail's pace and ill-defined characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good German-Collective Guilt &amp; Guilt for this Tedious Film **1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bombed out Germany after World War 11 provides the action for this film dealing with deceit all around us.Toby McGuire, as the chauffeur for journalist Jacob Geismar, (George Clooney) is horribly miscast. He is far too young for the part and appears as though he should jump back into the spider man series. Now seen on film as a young smoker, he blows smoke like a chimney stack and it's depressing to see him and Clooney puffing away like there is no tomorrow. True, the film takes place in the 1940s when people really didn't know about the hazards of smoking, but something has to be done now about smoking in film. Even Humphrey Bogart and Bette Davis would have to admit that.The big surprise in the film is Cate Blanchett as some sort of mystery woman. She desperately tries to imitate Marlene Dietrich and in her farewell scene, she walks to the plane with the bag under her arm in the same exact way that Ingrid Bergman did so in the memorable "Casablanca." Blanchett is up to her neck in duplicity but she speaks in an extremely low voice in a performance that's not one of her best.The film deals with the extremes that the U.S. government would go through to bring someone who committed atrocities to the U.S. due to his knowledge of atomic warfare.The film becomes muddled towards the end as we wonder what's really going on with the Blanchett character.The cinematography is excellent. The backdrop scenes dealing with the Potsdam Conference in July, 1945 are well done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me state the reasons I liked &amp; and sort of recommend this film.1. It was made in Black &amp; White. &amp; shown in the same size screen as used in 1945.2. It was made on the studio sound stages and back lot.3. The sound was clear &amp; distinct as they used overhead mikes like they did in '1945,4. This film takes place in Berlin in 1945, using archival background footage &amp; CGI to its full advantage, I felt I was actually in Berlin in the ruins of buildings where the action is taking place.5. Due to the fact we are no longer under the restrictive production code that was in place in 1945, There is some modern language &amp; a somewhat vivid sex scene. This is all to the good. If they were allowed to have such scenes in 1945, many films would have been much more realistic.Cate Blanchette sells her body in this film, back in 1945 she would of been a dancer or a singer in a sleazy bar.6, Tobey Maguire----our favorite SPIDERMAN is rather a shady character here.All the above are reasons to see the movie.NOW for the other side of the coin.The plot &amp; story is second rate &amp;^ would have been second rate in 1945. We have 3 big names in the cast GEORGE CLOONEY, CATE BLANCHETTE &amp; TOBEY MAGUIRE.. In 1945 they would not have cast this tired old tale with big names,Second tier actors would have been cast in the leads,ALSO (SPOILER ALERT) I doubt if they would kill the Toby Maquire character off so early in the film.,His role was very interesting to say the least &amp; deserved more screen time.There was a lack of chemistry in the scenes with Clooney &amp; Blanchette, as if they were in 2 different movies.Overall I give this a borderline plus rating.Ratings *** (out of 4) 82 points (out of 100) IMDb 7 (out of 19)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't always like Stephen Soderbergh's films, but 'The Good German' in an interesting movie, a 1940s-set thriller made using the technology of that era. But the film exploits a lot of non-technical film know-how acquired over the last 60 years, and if this movie really had been made in 1945, it would have been outstanding. As it is, it's atmospheric, and George Clooney (quite a one dimensional actor, in my opinion) is actually well suited to his role as the often baffled hero, but the plot never really catches fire. Still, it's a distinctive echo of the movies of another era, and quite distinctively different from most movies of its own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth a watch, but don't hold your breath for an amazing plot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>War Films are usually something I don't enjoy watching, (an exception to this being Empire of the Sun) not because it upsets me, it's just that most of them are rather gratuitous or very Americanised. I my self would much rather sit down and watch a War documentary because then you're learning about history from the facts, not taking in something that may or may not have happened and not being sure if it's fact or fiction based on fact. But that is just me.The Good German, while showcasing some amazing acting talent, like the always wonderful Cate Blanchett, it fell flat on one major point - plot. It's not that I was expecting this to be some huge war epic, but I did want some meat within the plot, something to really get my teeth into so to speak.I kept expecting and indeed hoping for some big revelation or occurrence, but in the end although it happened in an exciting way, sadly it really was quite a boring story.It has to be said also, that George Clooney was pretty average in his performance. His character seemed to have little to no substance and I found my self wishing that Tobey McGuire's character of Tully was around for more of the film, if only because at least he has a little more personality.One thing I did enjoy about The Good German was the old footage of Berlin meshed in with the new black and white footage. I think it would've mostly been filmed in a studio, and by making it black and white they not only achieved an authentic 40's feel to it, but were also able to save money by not having to make sets that resembled a war ravaged post WWII Berlin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Style suffocates substance in this movie. I can't imagine why Stephen Soderbergh thought telling this story in a style that is essentially visual pastiche would help his work in any way at all. As far as I was concerned, he succeeded merely in undermining the efforts of his mostly excellent cast, especially Cate Blanchett, who is breathtakingly good. Notable work, too, from Christian Oliver, Ravil Isaynov and, inventively cast against type, Tobey Maguire. Clooney I'm not so sure about: his lightweight persona isn't useful here. His presence, though, brings to mind another recent black-and-white movie, his own Good Night and Good Luck, where the photography was used to much better purpose.The script drips out its revelations in a fairly clunky manner, giving the impression of being over-compressed.There are, however, a number of atmospheric sequences, and one definitely thrilling mini-chase towards the end, but on the whole, a disappointing effort, only really worthwhile for seeing another of Blanchett's magnificent transformations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although the story is line is clever, this film is too busy with self-conscious aping of 1940's cinematography as a vehicle for cynical moral relativism. None of the three sub-plots are adequately established or concluded. Replete with cliché portrayals of Americans in uniform or power as corrupt and ineffectual, "The Good German" is yet another one-dimensional self-loathing screed from Hollywood, which have become as predictable as Chinese Communist Opera.Blanchette provides a convincing performance as the woman destroyed by choosing survival, Magiure almost pulls off morphing Spiderman into a GI scrounger, but Clooney is clueless trying to play an adult of the "greatest generation." The "f**k" laced dialog meets HBO standards for expletives per minute, but is distracting and false. The rating "sexual content" refers to three brief scenes that are soft-core porn.The black and white shooting is amateurish -- too dark and too stark. The "homage" to Casablanca is only in the props and setting, twisted into a sneering inversion of original's dramatic sense.If you're looking a Film Noir suspense story set in post-war Europe that deals with moral ambiguity and shows mastery of black and white film, get the "The Third Man" and leave this stinker on the shelf.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Characters all too eager to blurt out their secrets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most annoying thing about this stagy, hard-to-follow espionage film is that, half a dozen times in the story, various unsavory characters are quizzed by Clooney (in the role of an investigative journalist) and simply volunteer to him -- blurt out, in fact -- reams of information they would more likely want to keep secret. I suppose this helps advance the plot, but I suspect that in the original novel these crucial pieces of exposition are not offered up so easily, so conveniently, and so implausibly. // Another suspicion: that the reason Clooney was attracted to this project was that it puts America (and Americans) in a bad light, as a morally compromised nation so eager to get our hands on top Nazi scientists -- before the Soviets could so so -- that we blithely sold the Eastern Europeans down the river and even committed murder to stifle reports of the Nazis' crimes. (We did, in truth, welcome former Nazi scientists, with some misgivings; like it or not, it was the pragmatic thing to do at the time, and it helped us compete with the Russians in the space race; and they, of course, had former Nazis of their own. The rest -- about selling out the Poles, etc., as payment to the Soviets for acquiring these scientists -- is pernicious nonsense.) The fact that there's not a single genuinely sympathetic character in this film, and that the Americans are the least sympathetic of all, may have made it appealing to Clooney, but for this viewer it made watching "The Good German" a pretty dreary couple of hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had seen very mixed reviews for this film, from reviewers who seemed to be saying that they did not really understand what the film was trying to say. I do wonder sometimes whether reviewers have actually seen the piece about which they are writing. The "look" of the film was completely convincing and evoked accurately the horrendous conditions in Berlin at the end of World War II. I wasn't sure about the casting of George Cluney, but the rest of the acting was very plausible. Most importantly, it presented the viewer with evidence of the timeless moral dilemma "when does a mature compromise, become a moral sell-out?" Worked through at both the international, national and personal level this should have forced any viewer to ponder long and hard about how they would have behaved in such circumstances and what the appropriate judicial response should be. I would recommend this film, provided that you are prepared to think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly a Masterpiece! !! Stunning Drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Good German is a complex film that deserves a much higher rating that its being given on this forum. Soderberghs attention to history is so evident throughout this film. Cate Blanchett studied many of the great German actress ,Marlene Dietrich in particular, and it shows in her performance, her mannerisms and body language are spot on. Her character Lena Brandt has survived the devastation of the War, but her soul has been transformed in many ways. What we're following is a once passionate women that in her own personal struggle for survival, forged ties with the dark side ,just to have an existence at all, in a country that's in utter desperation and ruin. George Clooneys performance is commendable and his character is classic film noir. The recreation of postwar Berlin is fabulous and the black and white film does it wonders, as do the 1940's style cameras this film was shot in. There are many plot twists and turns and it makes for a great story. A must see film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Casablanca-lite couldn't have opened at a worse time because the Original totally Brilliant Casablanca is still playing in its Digitally Remastered version so it's all too easy to compare the two. It's difficult to figure out why it's so DARK all the time; Casablanca was nothing if not well-lit and the outdoor scenes looked as if the sun really did shine in daytime. With this one I kept thinking I was watching a third or fourth generation print that had been through the wringer one too many times. The references are everywhere, from Cate Blanchett and Toby McGuire coming on like Marlene Dietrich and John Lund in Wilder's A Foreign Affair - also set in post-war Berlin - to Cate Blanchett needing to get her husband and herself out of Berlin and running into old flame George Clooney and the audacious rip-off of the airport scene in Casablanca.I can see the attraction of attempting to make a forties film sixty years later and I for one would be sympathetic to such a notion but this is dire and deserves to disappear without trace.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an admitted yet feeble attempt at recreating the movie style of Casablanca (the best film ever made). It is really clunky and the acting of George Clooney is dreadful. Note the signature Clooney head turn when his character hears something he doesn't like. It is the same move made by the caveman in the GEICO commercials when he sees the ad making fun of how simpleminded cavemen are. It is also shameful how Turner Classic Movies has been hyping the movie all month. Hmmm?..The lighting is particularly poor -- films in 1942 were in black &amp; white, not for artistic reasons, but because that was the technology of the day. Trying to recreate that in 2006 is the same as trying to get people to recreate the 19th century, they know there is something better and don't deal well with the deprivation. The lighting and film angles do more to parody the film it claims to be trying to emulate. It's an insult.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really surprised by this movie and enjoyed it a great deal more than I thought I would after seeing the review in our local paper. I must admit that I am interested in Germany just after the second war and resigned myself to seeing a movie that would at least cover interesting material and little else. I am not a great fan of George Clooney but I do feel that he is capable of good work. The story about Frau Brandt and her husband was very fascinating and I felt that the atmosphere of Berlin in 1945 was woven in to the story quite well. The cinematography was very good just by itself. As for the choice that Frau Brandt makes to survive the war: I found it repugnant but who knows what I or others might have done in the same situation. This was a very enjoyable movie for 2 hours on a snowy Sunday afternoon. I look forward to seeing it again when it comes out on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen a lot of movie critics comparing this film with Casablanca or Chinatown or whatever film they really really found absolutely exceptional when they were young and not sarcastic and grumpy people. Of course you will reach a negative conclusion when you compare any film with a classic masterpiece.I can say myself that I am kind of bored of the whole black and white approach. A 'noir' film doesn't mean it has a lot of black in it people!! But the film itself was good. Tobey Maguire makes a good role, as intense and it is short. Cate Blachett makes the whole movie, while George Clooney is a dogooder plagued by curiosity and who will play the roles of both narrator and favourite pawn.The subject is rather intricate, it swirls around the interests of jews, Germans, nazi-hunters, SS, Russians, Americans and George Clooney (as a country of his own :)) The film does tend to get tedious at times, while getting intense and confusing next, but if you have the mood to watch a film that is in the same time based on a novel (so no too idiotic Hollywood script), filmed in a somewhat innovative way (by copying very old ways, hmm), acted rather well and that also has a point, some extra information about those times that you won't find in history books, then this is the film for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Loved it! While this movie is not based on any particular story, there are universal truths in this film. No one does anything for free and every man ( and woman)has his or her price. It paints a stark portrait of the lives of regular German in the months following the cessation of hostilities. It also gives us a glimpse into the profit many countries receive in return for rebuilding war torn countries. This film is as relevant in today's conflicts as it was in the days following Germany's surrender. If you know your WWII history you will find this to be a delightful film with great performances. Loved the set dressing and all the period work. Hats off to the set dec and props team! Everything from the uniforms to the damaged buildings was meticulously recreated. the Black and White treatment only added to the atmosphere. This is the best kind of film making. When actors with the kind of influence that George Clooney have a say in what projects get made, this is the result. Fabulous. See it! :) Diane</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mystery in post-world war 2 Germany</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say that I was disappointed in The Good German. I think the director did a nice job of creating a certain black and white style, reminiscent of old era movies. But I think he did too many things way too similar to some well-known classics. And this makes The Good German look like as if it is trying to be a black and white classic from old times and not an original in its own account. It makes the audience remember those other movies and you automatically associate The Good German with those other movies (that is, if you have seen them).George Clooney plays an American officer Captain Jake who comes to post-war Germany and runs into his old flame Lena Brandt (Cate Blanchett). Soon, we find out that everybody (Russians and Americans) are after Lena's husband, Emil Brandt. According to her wife Lena, Emil is already dead. Captain Jake gets involved in the search for Emil Brandt and discovers some important facts.I was also disappointed in the story. Either there were some unexplained things, some inconsistencies or I missed very important points because at the end I could not make sense of some things. George Clooney's character Jake, for some strange reason, never carries a gun. He is also a terrible fighter, he always gets beaten up. I honestly cannot think of one scene where he actually came out as the winner. No gun, no fighting skills - he is not your regular hero.I also think Tobey Maguire was wrongly cast for this one. He is suited for roles where he is the nice, decent guy (He was perfect in Seabiscuit, The Cider House Rules and Wonder Boys) but he is so out of his element in this one. The only good thing about this movie, in my opinion, is Cate Blanchett. She is one of the finest actors in our time and she is a pleasure to watch. Her charisma on the screen is undeniable. And she makes a damn good German. She is just full of talent (see her also in Babel and The Notes on a Scandal).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Complex plot line but watchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A gumshoe story set in a desolate, immediate post-war Berlin rather than the more usual sunny and prosperous L.A. From the first frame the film mimics the look-and-feel of a 1940's movie. After Tully (Tobey Maguire) picks up Jake Geismer (George Clooney) at Berlin Airport a wipe signals the transition to the next scene driving through the bomb-shattered streets of Berlin. CGI makes anything look real. So the obvious choice to dispense with green- screening in favour of a projected backdrop of grainy film must be deliberate. All of which gives an ambiance of a 1940's movie, besides a sense of time and place. Some scenes, however, don't observe the sensitivities of the 1940 ? anal sex most notably. Being a detective story the plot line is inevitably murky and enigmatic. Coupling this with a love triangle makes the plot line more complex still. Yet, it remains sufficiently comprehensible to be intriguing rather than baffling. That said, it's no lazy watch, you need to pay attention and make mental note of what's happening. Performances are good all round. Tobey Maguire's portrayal of Tully, the baby-faced GI who knows everything, is polished and initially stands out the most because he plays such a brash character compared to the rest of the cast. George Clooney comes over as world-weary and worldly wise ? a sharp contrast to Tully. Except when Geismer stumbles across Lena Brandt (Cate Blanchett) the old flame he's been looking for. The best line in the film is spoken by an extra. Geismer is watching two youths at the water's edge playing with a model boat. The unnamed officer walks up from behind and comments, 'kids, two months ago they were shooting at us.' This sort of thing throughout sustains the film's sense of time and place. The Good German is a nice piece of teamwork that pulls together the screenplay, cinematography, acting, et al to make a very watchable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>impressive recreation of mid-'40s filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing you have to say about The Good German is, this movie completely nails the look and style. It's not just a movie with a 1940s- era look, it's a movie with a specific *mid-to-late* 1940s look, that period between the lush, deep blacks of early '40s movies like Casablanca and the more washed out black and white of the early fifties. It doesn't just have a '40s look, but the look of an exceptionally well- filmed '40s movie. The score is even more dead-on; I would challenge anyone to differentiate this musically from the scores of the period.Some people here are complaining that it's not true to form because there's some swearing and sex, but I see no need to make a movie that is indistinguishable in every detail from an old movie. If not for the Hayes code, movies back then would have had sex and swearing, so the movie is quite true to the film making artists of the period.Performances are quite good. Cate Blanchett successfully goes for the world weary quality of Dietrich and Garbo, while Tobey Maguire's Tully is a wonderfully realized character who would best be described as a "piece of work." George Clooney is good, and his movie-star looks make him the perfect choice for the part, but while Blanchett and Maguire seem to really want to catch the cadences of the period, Clooney plays Clooney the way he always plays Clooney, and it doesn't quite fit. But that's a quibble.The twisty story is intriguing, and plays with the moral gray areas that were also popping up in late '40s movies, particularly in film noir, but it's a little too convoluted, with a few too many characters and some continuity jumps. But overall I knew what was going on and who the main players were.If you've watched as many old movies as I have, you really need to see this one, just because it's the most perfect retro recreation since Far From Heaven.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The What of Whom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Designed to resemble film noirs from the 1940s, "The Good German" is a somewhat interesting experiment by director Steven Soderbergh. Loosely divided into 3 sections, each with its own narrator, the film stars Cate Blanchett as a German Jew who's attempting to protect her husband from both American and Russian forces. Set in 1945, when the Soviet Union and the United States were busy carving up a recently surrendered Germany, the film watches as Blanchett uses her feminine wiles to strike up various deals with American and Russian officials. Why? As her husband is a renowned rocket scientist, both sides want him for their rocket programs, programs which will form the bedrock of Cold War posturing. And if they cant have him? Well, then he's better off dead. Blanchett does her best to prevent this.With her high cheekbones and porcelain skin, Blanchett's cast because of her resemblance to Hollywood sirens of old. Alongside her is actor George Clooney, who's rocking a Cary Grant face and a bottle full of smug. "Cassablanca", "The Third Man", "A Foreign Affair", "Germany Year Zero" and various old noirs (and neorealist films) are Soderbergh's chief influences. Much of his film's first act consists of heavy-handed stylistic attempts to evoke films of the era. These include lots of dutch angles, wipes, canted shots, noir lighting, old Hollywood aspect ratios, and "traditional" blocking/mise-en-scene. While this initially lends the film an overly busy, overly desperate tone, things eventually settle down somewhat to become something a bit more gentle and introspective. For fans of old noirs, the film ably evokes a certain nostalgia. But that's all it does. It's a rushed, slight film, which is frustrating considering the potentially heavy subject matter at hand.7.9/10 ? Better to ditch the homages and take things a bit more seriously. Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Berlin is not Chinatown, and The Good German is not The Third Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, they tried to recreate a classic film noir, but they missed.They fell short in most all departments: casting, acting, directing, script, dialogue, editing and music. In each case, there are what I call "awkward" moments. These are when I the viewer grow restless in my chair at an obvious error in the movie. This can be anything from a line that awkwardly presents unnecessary history, or an actress who is smiling while she admits the major sin of her past, or a line straight out of Chinatown, or a setup straight out of Casablanca, or the coincidences of people being at critical locations at critical times for no known reasons, or a black marketeer who was miscast and unconvincing, or having three different narrators, or having an unconvincing Congressman appearing at the start and finish like two pieces of white bread on a sandwich.It's very hard to get involved with the plight of a former SS secretary and his wife when we know so little about them. We do not meet the critical person until the end. Documents appear and disappear, we know not where.The movie is pretty much a mess.The script was under par, and that doomed the whole effort. It is hard for the director to generate mystery, suspense and a subtext with a faulty script. There were some good moments of revelation, mainly when Clooney puts two and two together and lets it be known. But somehow it's not Bogart. Somehow the timing is off. The effort falls flat. All that awkwardness drags it down.Ultimately, it's a disappointment for anyone who expected a well-wrought film noir. All the ingredients are present, but the cake that came out of the oven fell quite flat, I'm sorry to say.</fullReview>

His jeep driver is Corporal Tully (Tobey Maguire) a charming small-town American that is charming as he is ruthless...corrupt and a player in the black market. Everything and everyone has a price. Jake is not too concerned with Tully's activities, but is concerned about his girlfriend Lena(Cate Blanchett), his former secretary and lover. When Tully is found floating dead in the river with a major amount of German money in his pocket and near the peace conference site...his secrets lead to those of Lena's and this leads to Russian, German and American authorities all scrambling for damning information. The answers are in the shadowy rubble of war-torn Berlin.Filmed in glorious Black &amp; White and blended well with newsreel sequences. Scenery and acting are impressive.

		<shortDescription>Gloomy and involving film-noir homage from Soderbergh, who moves away from upbeat and attractive crime films, and into this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On one hand, you might recommend, or indeed speak highly of The Good German, on the grounds that in terms of genre film-making, it very much does the job. It might be thought of similarly to comedy: provide the viewer with the accredited number of laughs they desire and they might pass you; or with the erotic thriller: give the audience some cheesy one liners, a tale of deception and some badly lit sex scenes, and they won't complain. It might even apply to big, loud action films: provide the audience member with the right amount of explosions and enjoyable sequences of action and they'll grant you a pass. When we think of the genre of film-noir, maybe we don't necessarily jump to these conclusions. Maybe that suggests an acceptance, perhaps a subconscious one, but an appreciation for film-noir and that it is a notch above these other genres; stylistically and aesthetically thus most people, it would seem, come to expect much more from.Of course, we all want to garner as much as possible out of a film, regardless of genre. For me, The Good German offered enough by way of study, narrative and the development of its characters and how each of them react to a certain situation. The Good German made me feel; it made me connect with the characters on display and I very much got a kick out of director Soderbergh's fascination with the genre. The film itself covers an array of rather colourful people in a black and white, dank and worn out post-Second World War Berlin, Germany. The three major players are Jake Geismer (Clooney), an American war correspondent in Berlin specifically there to follow the Potsdam conference; Tully (Maguire), a young and loose American solider posted there as well as Lena Brandt (Blanchett), the femme fatale archetype who is the wife of a missing ex-SS officer named Emil Brandt (Oliver), an individual still hunted by Soviet and American forces.The Good German unfolds at the same time of what is essentially a power struggle in the form of The Potsdam Conference, a bringing together of the most powerful of heads from the world's leading nations and allowing discussions, theories and problem solving simmer. As the film plays out under a banner of peace and coming together as order is desperately attempted to be re-established within the conference centres, lies; deceit; murder and, to a fair degree, war are the order of the day on the streets of Berlin and within the confines of the respective setting. Jake aptly sums it up when he exclaims he knew who the enemy were during the war, because "they were the ones shooting at me." Here, everyone may be in Berlin for a seemingly collative reason, but the ingredients that force tempers and feelings of honour to wane are very much present.As an homage to noir, Soderbergh throws in just about everything you'd expect in the genre: narration; a lonely and somewhat hapless lead and a lead that walks along the fine line of keeping in the good books of both the law and order and of the more menacing figures of the setting. There is narration, a labyrinth of a narrative and a stylistic manipulation of light while the fact it's in black and white works nicely in the film's favour. The film is initially narrated by the character of Tully, somebody who is brash and overly confident despite the distinct mood the film carries in retrospect to its setting and the downbeat tone regarding the ambiguity of the future of the city of Berlin.When the switch in voice-over occurs from Tully to Geismer following the completion of Tully's little involvement, it offers a distinct forewarning when the voice-overs once again shift,albeit briefly, to another character; this time of Lena. Here, it feels, we are led to think that Geismer's involvement in the piece is coming to an end and the necessity of his character is wearing out. If we presume Lena to embody any necessary femme fatale conventions, then we might presume murder and betrayal to be among them and one or two of them might well occur in the near future. There is a possibility at this point in the film Geisemer will be the victim, which instills a distinct shock to the system and adds a new sense fore boding to the piece.Even as a post-war space, the film carries a sense of dread and of danger; that the war may be over but the egos, the lying, the feelings of guilt and general deception remain. And Soderbergh loves his material; this is light years away from sexy, colourful and 'fun' crime as displayed in his rather inept at times Ocean's trilogy, while Clooney's character's injury to his ear is wonderfully reminiscent to that of Jack Nicholson's in Chinatown ? their initials and Christian names; J.G. and Jake, respectively, are even the same. While never feeling like a pastiche of any sort, The Good German delivers on a level of story telling, cinematography and a grounded series of cause and effect moments that sew together to produce something quite interesting; if it were a comedy, it would have been funny enough without directly offending anyone and if it were an action film, it would've had just the right number of set pieces but with substance alike.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From director Steven Soderbergh (Sex, Lies, and Videotape, Erin Brockovich), I had heard about this film literally for the leading actor, and I might have heard someone say it was alright, so I put it to the test. Basically set in Berlin, Germany, 1945, just after peace has been agree to end World War II, journalist Jake Geismer (George Clooney) has arrived to cover the Potsdam conference. Wearing a captain's uniform allows him easier access, but he is also looking for his old flame Lena Brandt (Cate Blanchett), now a prostitute wanting to get out of Berlin. His driver, cheerfully but secretly sadistic Corporal Tully (Tobey Maguire), Jake discovers keeps Lena to himself, and he beats up anyone that crosses him, including Lena. When Jake finds Tully's body dead and washed up in the Potsdam waters, he is the only one who seems to want to solve the murder crime. While the U.S. authorities are finding suspect Nazis for trial, and they are also looking with the Russians for German rocket scientists, Lena with some secrets of her own tries to get more involved in things, until she of course leaves Germany in the end. Also starring Beau Bridges as Colonel Muller, Tony Curran as Danny, Leland Orser as Bernie, Jack Thompson as Congressman Breimer, Christian Oliver as Emil Brandt, David Willis as Franz Bettmann and Don Pugsley as Gunther. Clooney and Blanchett together are reasonably good as the couple divided by secrets and the dead body, and Maguire in his brief time was really good. But I didn't understand everything going, I just enjoyed the 1940s style filmmaking, i.e. black and white, scrolling backgrounds, and that made it alright period romantic drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Music for Thomas Newman. Okay!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Casablanca, often referred to as timeless, is always approachable, embraceable and enjoyable. Steven Soderbergh's 2006 black-and-white effort, The Good German, is the anti- Casablanca.That's not to say The Good German isn't a good film. It is. While The Good German ? like most other films ? doesn't approach that 1942 gem, it shares many characteristics with Michael Curtiz's classic, right up to its closing shot. In Soderbergh's hands, The Good German takes the opposite approach to plot development, setting, musical score and, most especially and importantly, characterization. Though the end product isn't nearly as successful as Casablanca, it is thought-provoking.The proceedings are familiar: competing governments try to get the upper hand in the game of global domination, while a lone voice for truth peels away layer upon layer of lies, uncovering some frightening details of broadly important and deeply personal matters."The Good German" is classic film noir with a post-ratings board, 21st-century twist ? sex, violence and language in an explicit way, mostly confined to the first half of the film. Here, director Soderbergh, who won the Academy Award for 2000's Traffic, uses foreshadowing to warn viewers they're in for a distinctly disturbing ride.A completely gutted Berlin after V-E Day serves as the appropriate backdrop for decaying character interaction, while Thomas Newman's Oscar-nominated musical score captures the bleak, brutal world being picked over and re-created by American, British and Soviet scavengers of rank and privilege.But the performances of the magnificent Cate Blanchett and George Clooney are most rewarding.Think about Bogart and Bergman in Casablanca, then imagine those characters in an even-more Bizarro World, and you'll have a general idea of the on-screen relationship between Blanchett and Clooney. There is no chemistry between the duo. And there isn't supposed to be. Blanchett is carrying some heavy, important baggage in both plot and theme; she's as appropriately hollow as any of the buildings in the background, her throaty delivery at perfect pitch. Clooney, meanwhile, plays the patsy well. Together, they smolder ? never ignite ? among whispers of what might have been. Soderbergh seems capable, not quite fluent, in this style. Yet he understands and relays to the viewer this idea: choice may seem a black-and-white proposition, but the outcome of such decisions seldom reaches a clear-cut conclusion.</fullReview>

But what Soderberg is doing is only an average forties film, therefore making quite limited. George Clooney I was a little disappointed in. His acting is very hesitant and he looks like he is hesitating between being forties or not therefore resulting in an empty and hesitant performance, It also seems that he tries to imitate an average actor of the forties but what he does not seem to understand is that there were some very good actors in the forties: Bogar, Grant. Cate Blanchett is more sexy than ever before and she does a splendid job at acting well but just well enough for an actress of the forties. Definitely the best actress of today. she has to get an academy award. Toby Maguire also does a very good performance, mixing the stereotype of the asshole war opportunist and pimp with the young rebel stereotype. However, he does not have the talent of Blanchett and, unlike her, he acts too well for a forties actor. Also deserves a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Gimmick, Not A Movie (Possible Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this movie, partially because of a sibling telling me about the book it was based on. I haven't read the book, so my expectations were not based on anything. I started watching the movie and it seemed interesting: George Clooney sarcastically dealing with a good-natured goof Patrick Tully (Tobey Maguire) for a driver. I thought, "OK, these two will investigate/partner up to find out the mystery behind the story and it will be funny but also suspenseful and good." Instead, it turned into crap really quickly. Tully is an unseemly character? But why? What is his motivation for doing that? What is anyone's motivation is this movie? Why is George Clooney's character without a gun (I know they were trying to make him like a film noir lead, but I would think he would learn to have a gun at some point). The movie is just a gimmick to show a B&amp;W movie but with foul language and nudity and violence. I left half-way through it because it wasn't getting any better. I came back to see the husband of Cate Blanchett (Lena)'s character get found by Lena, get killed and thinking that this was where the movie would end. Instead, it messed around for about five minutes only to rip off Casablanca at the end.If you get a chance, check out the book because it was actually better than this (or at least from the premise I was told and some of what I heard, it sounded more compelling). Someone should tell Steven Soderbergh and his screenwriter to re-read the book or better yet, actually like the source materials he's basing the movie on. Only a few people could do movies on books that stray from it and still be good (M.A.S.H., Catch-22, The Shining for examples). This wasn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Chinatown" crossed with "Casablanca"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More than most movies, "The Good German" places itself in the center of a dialogue with other films?it wants to comment on, and change our impression of, Hollywood's World War II-era romantic melodramas. But unfortunately, though it connects to lots of other movies, it doesn't connect enough to the real world and to the viewer's emotions. It's an intriguing, but ultimately airless, cinematic exercise."The Good German"'s first point of reference is that beloved warhorse of wartime melodrama, "Casablanca." Its frequent allusions to that movie?including a gleefully profane rewrite of Bogart's "Of all the gin joints?" line?point up the sentimentality and unreality of 1940s Hollywood. The first half-hour of "The Good German" seems designed to shock you with swearing and violence, especially Tobey Maguire's performance as a thoroughly despicable young man. Fortunately, this adolescent desire to shock and mock subsides as the plot thickens.In 1945, American journalist Jake Geismar (George Clooney) goes to Berlin to report on the Potsdam Peace Conference and gets caught up in an intrigue involving murder, atomic scientists, and his former lover Lena Brandt (Cate Blanchett). But Clooney might just as well be playing another, more famous movie Jake: Jake Gittes from "Chinatown." Both of these men initially appear cool, smart, and competent, then confront a malevolent bureaucracy and realize their full powerlessness. Their investigations make things worse instead of better. Both even spend a large portion of the movie with a bandaged face. When I watched "Chinatown" last summer, I doubted that a major studio or director would make a movie with an ending that bleak nowadays. "The Good German" has proved me wrong: if anything, its ending is even more depressing. In "Chinatown," what's at stake is merely the water supply/livelihood of some California farmers. In "The Good German," the stakes come down to the Holocaust and the invention of the atomic bomb. Pretty downbeat stuff.So I understand what "The Good German" is trying to do: apply "Chinatown"'s revisionist treatment to a "Casablanca"-style wartime melodrama. However, that is not to say that the strategy works. "The Good German" is much less affecting than either of these two films, because its characters feel like constructs instead of living people. Lena has just too many secrets to be credible as an actual human?she's not a character, she's a metaphor for The German People. And even though Maguire's character Tully is viscerally hateful, it also feels like he's meant to prove a cynical point about how vile American "Greatest Generation" soldiers were in real life. In the end, "The Good German" is more concerned with proving its points than with providing the entertainment that its inspirations do.One reason I watched "The Good German," despite its negative reception, was for the visual pleasure of seeing some good-looking contemporary movie stars shot in good-looking black-and-white. However, even this aspect of the movie disappoints. The black-and-white cinematography isn't nearly as lush and smooth as it is in real films from the 1940s?the shadows seem too dark and obtrusive, the whites too blaring. (For better recent black-and- white cinematography, see Clooney's "Good Night and Good Luck.") The movie's attempts to incorporate vintage documentary footage also fail, because while the new footage at least tries for studio-era elegance, the vintage footage is raw and grainy. The transitions are jarring?like switching between "Double Indemnity" and "The Bicycle Thief."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Soderbergh's Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many of the low score crits here reveal more about the level of intellect and understanding of cinema history than they do of this film. One can only laugh at the guy from NYC bemoaning the lack of anyone 'to cheer for' and pity the person who described the cinematography as 'poor'. I think the point they're missing is a blindingly obvious one: that Soderbergh has gone hell for leather at making a 1940s film noir fully aware of all - or rather, almost all - the strengths and weaknesses that are going to accrue from that. He has perfectly understood and re-created the genre. Thus, to criticise the mannered, stage acting is to open your mouth about a subject when you weren't at the lecture; to comment on the newspaper article when you haven't even read it. What Soderbergh has produced here is arguably a masterpiece of lovingly crafted pastiche and yet, being from the modern age he has been able to ? and has the taste and intelligence to ? create something that is beyond pastiche. Note how he reins in the melodrama of the period to give the movie a more realistic texture: He allows the characters to talk more realistically to each other than is the norm by allowing the use of profanity (though there is not enough casual profanity for perfect naturalism) and to let in the daylight of sexual realism. However, his noirish values prevent the film being as bleak as a more naturalistic approach would have required. The Berlin of 1945 was much more desperate than this, the poverty of its people heartbreaking and inhuman. This, however, does not mean we should criticise the film for its lack of naturalism: such a film would have been almost unbearably bleak. Further, if Soderbergh had tried to show us Berlin '45 truly in the raw, it would be a different movie: it wouldn't be noir. To his credit we do see some of the poverty: the food lines and other forms of the material deprivation of a bombed out city. Within the confines of the genre, he has made the effort to show the uninitiated a line drawing at least of Berlin at the end of the Second World War. To criticise the visual aesthetic of The Good German is bizarre. Perhaps such critics are not fond of monochrome. The cinematography is actually masterful, the sets a triumph bordering on the miraculous. Berlin's destruction is there in front of us in every frame. The only problem is that far from being hard on the eye, many, many shots here work as high art. Some, like a shot of a car arriving at a building at night with its headlight shining like otherworldly stars are out and out ravishing; a daylight pull away rostrum shot to reveal an applauding audience unaware of the skulduggery in their midst and its exiting perpetrator is sheer brilliance. Noir, visually, is all about contrast, about shadows and revelatory, illuminating light. Soderbergh's understanding of this is flawless. The Good German is a visual feast. The problem, however, is that the more sumptuous the viewing, the further away from naturalism we get. And it terms of Berlin at this time, the further you move from truth to untruth. Perhaps one should be telling Steven that we should have seen some vermin every couple of minutes or so. But even so: the dark and light of noir is essentially to create and highlight the drama taking place between characters and to create atmosphere. You can't have the visual benefit of the monochrome of true noir without losing emotional truth. In terms of acting criticisms of Clooney and Blanchett are facile and idiotic. Clooney is a faultless noir lead male for modern times. Strikingly handsome, possessor of a voice like strong continental coffee laced with something stronger and is perfectly capable of rendering emotional resonance. He has a magnificent presence few actors on both sides of The Pond could have matched here. If you don't think his emotional range isn't broad enough here, then you don't understand the genre. His performance was a perfect rendition of the American noir actor of the period and that, is exactly what Soderbergh wanted. He Jacob is a Steady Eddie, adept and persistent at digging out the story's truth. I very much enjoyed the presentation of a male lead absorbing pain rather than dishing it out in historically expected cartoon fashion. The director may simply be following the book, but I enjoyed this subversion of a noir norm very much. Soderbergh's Jacob ploughs on, dignified and knowingly world-worn in the classic manner. Blanchett is brilliant. Required to hit a Dietrichesque note, no more, no less, she nailed it in the wood: luminous, sensuous and depressed in true casual, world-weary 40s-noir fashion ? you're not supposed to believe she's one step away from the asylum or the suicide's bullet, folks. Achieving the right look, the right walk, the right physical notes is not as easy as she makes it look. Like a truly great actress, she makes it appear that any actress could do what she did, but, like Clooney, she achieved a real depth of presence on screen, something that owes far more to technique, talent and hard work ? and indeed intelligence - than luck or nature's bounty. She's a better noir lead than Bergman, creating a fuller, truer, more rounded character. In short, she was perfect - where was the Oscar nomination?In summation, this film is both a cinema history lesson and thoroughly entertaining 105 minutes of cinema. The plot is convoluted but hey ? that's noir. The acting is mannered but hey ? that's noir too. It's a noir experience from start to finish. That's the point of the movie, and it's a point that the director makes with exceptional skill and taste. Of how many Oscar nominated films and directors can one say that?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fabulous Retro-Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As of the time of my evaluation (which was a 10), some 26% of recorded viewers had given this movie a 10, and almost 18% a "1". Which clearly meant that this disturbing work was not for everyone. I think the "females under 18" (cf. demographic breakdown) have got it right, with their collective 9.3 (so says a "male over 45" (:=)). This is a masterpiece of Retro-Noir, with absolutely fantastic cinematography, great score, gripping storyline with step-by-step resolutions, and solid all-round performances from the cast, though the only genuinely Oscar-worthy efforts are by Blanchett and Weigert. Why then so many "1's" or even "3's" and "4's'? As to the latter, I suspect it's plain idiosyncrasy: to criticize "The Good German" because it "reminds one of other films" is akin to dismissing "Chinatown" because of "The Big Sleep" or "Platoon" because of "Apocalypse Now". The numerous "1's" are a more delicate matter, probably due to overblown political correctness on the part of older viewers. Cate Blanchett is a potent "femme fatale", a most original motivational study by film noir standards. But her character's crimes coupled to her film identity are simply too heavy for some people of a prior generation to swallow. There's nothing to be done here, I'm afraid. There were indeed such Lenas, and denial won't make them go away.</fullReview>

Filmmaker Steven Soderbergh's ambitious but adequate attempt to make a WWII ?era remake of "Casablanca" meets "The Third Man" neo-noir melodrama has more misses than hits but a game cast of powerhouse acting by Clooney as an American journalist who heads to Germany in the dawning days of the war to cover the Potsdam treaty but becomes embroiled in a complex web of deceit involving his old flame Blanchett (channeling Ingrid Bergman and Greta Garbo with a dash of Marlene Deitrich) and his weasel driver Maguire hip-deep in the black market. Filmed in lavish black and white (actually in color and processed technically as b&amp;w), Soderbergh ? who also trade markedly shot &amp; edited under pseudonyms ? does his best but Paul Attanasio's screenplay adaptation of Joseph Kanon's novel doesn't make it easy to follow what should be a basic potboiler entertainment boilerplate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The good copy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Soderbergh's Good German is perfect in period black and white, not just made to look like a film of the Forties superficially but shot like one, with similar cameras and lighting and angles and processing, all of which is rather nice (this director's learning experiences are instructive for us as well as him, and never a waste), but this emphasis on style overwhelms and distracts from the somewhat slackly paced story, which leans on period or pseudo-period noir, detective stories, themselves perhaps second hand if brilliant, like Polanski's Chinatown, or kitsch classic, like Casablanca, which Good German's last scene blatantly mimics. Obviously The Third Man was held in mind (an impossible model to equal), though this plot takes place in Berlin, not Vienna, at the time of the Potsdam Conference, with Truman, Churchill, and Stalin nearby?but as in The Third Man's Vienna, everybody is in for a fix and covering up. It's the old world style, and the Americans are there to rehabilitate the Nazis as well as execute some of them, and Truman's line about our not being interested in business but in people's freedom is heavily ironic in the context. Much is nice in this movie. But the comparison with The Third Man, with its simplicity and drive yet complex atmosphere can only, and constantly with one well familiar with the Carol Reed film, remind one again and again of the things this admirable effort almost inevitably lacks.Let's think about them. Though The Good German has rich decayed interiors, nests of stairways and rubble, dingy walls, the right clothes, its conventional Forties-style music is far less atmospheric than The Third Man's wonderful zither theme, which gives the movie a wonderful sense of rhythm ? if it didn't also have a wonderful sense of refrain in the dialogue itself, with its eternal harping on the quest for the evil friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles) by his na?ve old friend Harry Martins (Joseph Cotton). Where was Lime? Who was Lime really? And then, finally, Lime himself, in the most famous cameo in cinema. What could equal that as a payoff? Cate Blanchett is moodily slinky for days as the German Lorelei, her voice is right, he face is right, even her German sounds right, but she cannot hold a candle to Alida Valli, because somehow when Blanchett is a wonderful facsimile, Valli was simply the real ting; everyone in this movie is as much a facsimile as the imagery.Tobby Maguire as Tully, the thieving, maneuvering driver Tully, is rather woefully miscast. What the film needs to start out with is a Touch of Evil, to use the Wellesean phrase, and Maguire is meant to be the crookedest driver in the American military in Berlin, but he just seems eager and na?ve. Joaquin Phoenix, with his menacing energy and off-kilter look, would have been much better as in fact he was in a quite similar Milo Minderbinder type role in the forgotten Buffalo Soldiers (2001, a bad year for an exposé of American iniquity abroad). George Clooney, as Captain Jake Geismer, the New Republic journalist in army uniform come to cover the Conference but really looking for his ex-girlfriend (Blanchett) from when he worked in pre-War Berlin, is not at his best here. He takes as much of a beating, like a private dick, as he did in Syriana, and one wishes one could say the plot twists were clearer, or that their clarity was an improvement, over the murky but intensely interesting Syriana. One wishes he were effective, but his debonair can't come into play; he's just like a chess piece pushed back and forth. He's a Bogart with insufficient attitude. He's always standing or walking or bending over or falling down; he never gets to strike a pose.We know Lena wants out, and when Tully dies trying to arrange it, Jake pursues the case, with more and more of Lena's past unraveling ? too easily ? before him. The feeling that Berlin is dark and wicked and full of secrets is lost because it all spells itself out too fast.We can revel in the look of this film, even in the music, but only for so long. It lacks a pulse. But as always, Soderbergh is on to the next project. Guess what? There're four of them: Ocean's 13, Life Interrupted, Guerrilla, and The Argentine. He'd have liked working in the old Forties studio system, he's said. If he didn't have to create his own film-making factory, would he have to be so prolific?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Good Homage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Good Homage A Review of Steven Soderbergh The Good German. by Drew Morton Rating: B+ When I attended a screening of Steven Soderbergh's latest film The Good German two weeks ago at the Aero Theater in Santa Monica, Soderbergh introduced the film, which was screening on a double-bill with Casablanca, as one Michael Curtiz could have made if there lacked the Production Code. Keeping this as his objective, Soderbergh filmed the project only with equipment available in 1945 while juxiposing this style with explicit violence, nudity, and cursing. The double-bill idea was fitting; essentially, The Good German is a parallel universe version of Casablanca, which both makes the film interesting and ultimately lends it a certain hollowness. Without delving too deeply into the plot, the film begins with journalist Jake Geismer (George Clooney) arriving in Berlin to report on the peace negotiations following the immediate end of World War II. At the request of Colonel Muller (Beau Bridges), Geismer is paired up with Tully (Tobey Maguire), an American soldier who will be his escort and driver through the fragmented city. However, not long after his arrival, Geismer discovers that "things are not the way they appear to be," as Tully robs him and beats him following the discovery that Tully is both dating his former flame, Lena (Cate Blanchett) and is involved with the black market. Not long after, an American service man turns up dead and Geismer finds himself both in the middle of a murder mystery and within the remnants of his relationship with Lena. The film finds itself so massively indebt towards the superior films of Curtiz and Carol Reed that one senses an overcomplicated plot as a means of compensation. However, as labyrinthine as the plot becomes, the film is almost solely about its noir style and the actors inhabiting the gritty streets of Berlin, which looks strikingly similar to the streets of Reed's The Third Man. Aesthetically, Soderbergh's black and white photography, credited under his pseudonym Peter Andrews, and the production design by his regular collaborator Phillip Messina, essentially stands as its own character and will probably bear fruits come award time. Soderbergh's Berlin is beautifully haunting, amazingly constructed out of Hollywood backlots and found footage, full of images that linger in the viewer's mind. Mise-en-scene aside, the film's main attraction is its stars. Clooney takes a mildly-startling turn as Geismer who, while he shares Clooney's charm and sex appeal, completely lacks any physical empowerment. While not as ineffectual as his character in Stephen Gaghan's Syriana, Clooney is beaten probably six or seven times throughout the film and during the climax, is almost frighteningly useless. Sensing this early in the film after ambushed by Tully, Geismer seemingly comes to the conclusion that in order to overcome such obstacles, he must rely both on his charms and power of observation. Blachett, taking the role of Lena, makes the most of her cold-hearted moll, who finds herself sinking into prostitution to survive. The supporting players, most notably Leland Orser turn as Geismer's old friend and Deadwood's Robin Weigert as Lena's "roommate" are also noteworthy. Conversely, it is Maguire's gear-shifting performance that stands out as one of the most problematic characteristics of the film. Due to his fame as Peter Parker, Maguire comes off as being sorely miscast in the role of the sadistic Tully. His teenaged looks and boyish voice mocks the delivery of his dialogue to a somewhat comical end. However, at the same time, his boyish charm makes the horrible violence he inflicts much more terrifying. Performances aside, at the end of the film the viewer is left with a bittersweet taste on their cinematic pallet. On one hand, one has just watched a successful and entertaining homage while, on the other hand, all they have watched are a blend of superior films channeled through the interesting notion of "what if there hadn't been a Hays code?" The Good German is Casablanca, literally right down to the last moments. Is this a good thing? Well, the film is not nearly as flat as Van Sant's remake of Psycho, but it does lack both the innovation of a Tarantino homage and substance of greater Soderbergh films, be it a genre homage like Out of Sight or experiment along the lines of Bubble. Drew Morton is a graduate student at UCLA in Film Studies/Critical Studies department. He is presenting a paper entitled "Twin Cinema: The False Binary of 'Hollywood' and 'Independent' within the films of Steven Soderbergh" at the annual conference of the Society of Cinema and Media Studies in March.

		<shortDescription>The Dummkopf-bedeviled German</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Believable period decor, urban post-war detailing, B&amp;W shots set up to mimic 1940s camera work ? and especially Cate Blanchett's fine, shadowy lineaments and her credible spoken German ? these may save unsuspecting viewers from a pernicious slide into the Quagmire of Despond.Until mid-movie, that is. The dull tenterhooks on which I was to writhe from that point forward proved ineffectual against mind fog. It thickened with each random plot twist. My finger inched toward, but never found, Fast-forward, Pause or Self-Immolate.It were as though the low light and the absence of color had leached timing and savoir-faire from the The Good German set. (Blanchett, however, apparently knew to wear light- and color-fast threads that prevented her aura from dimming.)But why did Soderbergh and Attanasio not huddle behind camera, where they might improvise a remedial script? Had they heeded their roiling instincts prompting them to demur, the rewrite they'd have produced on the fly might have gone down as one of the most inspired saves in the annals of film.Would it have been so difficult, for example, to have had Tobey Maguire dismembered in the first ten minutes after carelessly stepping on live unexploded ordnance? His demise would have been supremely satisfying ? and not all that gory in fifty-some shades of grey.Rejiggering The Good German would have required a bit more finagling than that, though nothing too fancy. The percussive force of the deus ex machina Maguire explosion could have thrust Clooney backward into a rubble pit, leaving him dazed and blessedly mute. Whatever acting talents his fans impute to him would only have been heightened by a 90- minute stint of pantomime.The wispy plot line of The Good German is tangled beyond the ability of most mortals to unknot. Viewers would have had fewer misgivings about the writers if Clooney had played an aphasiac. What ever is he trying to tell us? we'd have wondered. Instead, puzzlement gnawed: Why does this cuddlesome cipher keep striving to come off as gauche, vacuous and witless?Clooney's overacting flame-out ? one can think of B&amp;W screwball comedies with more subtle leads ? ensured that the film's deficiencies would scorch its assets. That need not have been so. Few would publicly deny that Clooney has the range needed to play a speechless war casualty. Had he been thus retasked, Soderbergh's strained attempts at cinematic authenticity would not have stood out so starkly.Even a dumb Clooney, however, ought to have known better than to let his character be written into a fumbling, gratuitous "tribute" to Casablanca toward the end. But ? surprise! ? he acquiesced. That aesthetic insult proved to be the film's coup de grâce.Finally, mercifully, as the credits began rolling by, my arms slowly unwrapped and allowed my head to rise and inhale freely again.Even if someone just gave birth to you, life's too short. You'd be better off spending two hours at the Lotto machine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This picture could have been so much better than it turned out. I was hoping for a good spy picture, and it started out like a possible "Third Man" type story. It was a black-and-white movie set in WWII and with a good cast. I am sorry to report it did not live up to expectations.The main problem was that, like Kate Blanchett's character, it lacked a heart and a reason to root for someone, anyone. In fact, it was a collection of nasty, unattractive people played by charismatic actors in thankless roles. I thought it captured the post-war cynicism and skepticism between the two superpowers, and the incipient rivalry that was to become the cold war, but it needed more character involvement - maybe they shouldn't have killed off Beekman, or gotten more mileage out of Brandt, or used Beau Bridges in more scenes. He and Clooney played well off each other, as they did in "The Descendants". In any case, it wasn't compelling or absorbing enough to merit a higher rating. It was like a 'B' picture that ran too long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The (established) critics are wrong!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Go to the reviews before you see this movie and you'll be missing the experience of seeing it with an open mind.The movie opened only in limited distribution and made just over $5 million we are told. That's another proof that it sucked, or so they have you believe.It's all style they say, George Clooney's role doesn't fit a film noir because he doesn't wisecrack, doesn't have enough flair.Well, it certainly is style. Soderbergh used a number of unusual techniques to produce the look of Berlin in the summer of 1945, just months after the Fuhrer did himself in at the bunker. He shot in color, his edits were turned around in just a few days. So good was the look that the archival footage blends perfectly.He knew what he wanted and got it. The city (or back lots if you will) is magnificent, as good or better than Vienna in "The Thin Man." The shots are framed with such precision that we are to somehow fault him for being too stylistic? Nonsense! And while Clooney isn't Bogart (who is?), this film works like "The Thin Man." It is story and plot, twists and turns and the need of an outsider, previously an insider, to know the truth. I found it mesmerizing.And as Orson Welles steals "The Thin Man," so too does Cate Blanchett steal this film. Her strength is magnificent. Her compromises are accepted as survival, even those she won't reveal until she's on her way to safety. She is courageous, protecting a man she no longer loves, and yet despicable for what she does as well. A true noir heroine, well played.Here's a good test of whether you might like this film. If you think the Coen Brothers' "The Man Who Wasn't There" is just a stylistic ripoff of the forties, you won't like "The Good German." But I'm willing to wager a stylish fedora or, on this case, an American military dress cap, that if you like that tour-d'-force, you'll love this one.There's an underlying thematic sucker punch carried by this film. My guess is a lot of American cinema fans don't like being told that post-War we became the bad guys too.Search the reviews and perhaps all is lost, for you'll find the naysayers and not the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an impressive war movie that scores big in every way. The direction, acting, cinematography and editing are superb, with an abundance of beautifully composed classic noir scenes full of menace and intrigue reminiscent of the Third Man.Steven Soderbergh continues to demonstrate why he is one the greatest directors of our era, eliciting terrific performances from the entire cast. But the cinematography is what makes this movie stand out as a new classic, with highly effective dramatic lighting and stylistic close-ups of the stars. George Clooney delivers a convincing performance as a decent but naive American officer in postwar Berlin who finds himself trapped in a deadly web of lies, deception and betrayal. Cate Blanchett exudes star quality as the femme fatale in one of the best performances of her career, fully inhabiting the role of a Jewish prostitute with a dark past and dire secrets. Terrific acting reminiscent of the great Marlene Dietrich, with a pitch perfect German accent and the ice cold persona of someone who has been traumatized by the unspeakable horrors of war.The dialog is sharp and the musical score is edgy. This movie is an outstanding tribute to the genre and worth adding to your collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>too old fashioned for today's audience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No wonder I never heard of this movie before I saw it on cable. It's modeled after movies from the 40s, which is good if you like older movies. However, I don't care for them, so I didn't really find this film very appealing. It was hard to pay attention because it moves slowly and there is little action and no stunts. I agree that Cate Blanchett played her role well and her accent sounded genuine. What I could understand from the film was that her husband, whom was on the lamb, was wanted by the Russians and Americans to help find someone. She lied and said he was dead. The Americans bring in Jake, a detective, who knows Lena to try to find her husband. Jake is also trying to solve the murder of Tully, I'm still not sure why he was killed.FINAL VERDICT: I didn't like it and anyone with a short attention span will hate this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We Turned It Off After 15 Minutes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since we pulled the plug after 15 minutes I really should give this film a Zero, but the lowest rating here is 1.Couldn't care less for any of the characters seen during our viewing time. Didn't want to waste anymore time waiting for the plot or film to develop.The music track was completely out of place, and should have been silent during certain scenes, but relentlessly continued.The film tried hard to mimic a genre with it's black and white look, but missed the mark widely. This picture is nowhere near the quality of George Clooney's other black &amp; white film about the radio host during the McCarthy hearings, which was quite good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"At least during the war you could tell who the bad guys were. They were the ones shooting at you." ? George Clooney's character This is a very grim little movie. Everyone is stepping over piles of rubble and living in partially bombed out buildings in 1947 Berlin.It's done in black and white using all the techniques filmmakers used in the 1940s. You'll feel you're watching an actual 1940s movie ? except it's almost entirely devoid of glamor or anything nice to look at (which filmmakers back then knew was essential to the movie-going experience).Clooney is good -- yet not sexy. In fact the movie is devoid of any feeling except "My God what an awful time we're all having!" Cate Blanchett is quite good, seeming a bit like Marlene Dietrich in certain close-ups. Tobey Maguire is cast against type and having a good time.If you're looking to have some fun at this movie, you can start counting the 1940s film conventions Soderbergh experiments with. Or count the allusions to "Casablanca" (a much more satisfying and engaging film.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Soderberg</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I entered the screening of this film with high expectations. How could this cast, this director and this writer not deliver? For the first 45 minutes I tried to understand where the complex plot was going, and continued to believe that this could be a terrific film. Then I started to look at my watch. By the hour mark it was sadly clear that the entire enterprise was going to add up to disaster. The characters are thin and stereotyped. The underlying story is small and has no current day resonance. But finally, it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. One character appears to be living in a subterranean hideout, then in the next scene suddenly can be found lurking in the balcony of an opera, for no apparent reason. Clooney's character is a journalist, but never does a bit of work. His overpowering love for the hooker with a heart of stone, Blanchette, is inexplicable. And the great reveal on which the plot turns is a bore. The film is reverential and deferential to old World War 2 movies and film noir, while never working as either. Why would stars sign on to this sorry script? I presume they wanted to work with Soderberg. But a good portion of the time, this director absorbs himself with arty-farty nonsense. This film attempts to be high brow, but that just makes it all the worse. It's intellectual pretensions make the bad writing and paucity of emotion or ideas all the more pathetic. Someone needs to shake Soderberg and tell him that as paintings are flat, and sculpture three dimensional, film has an inherent nature: it is a mass medium. The great works like The Godfather or Rules of the Game, are complex and deep, but most of all, they are entertaining. No one drags out any more to a lousy multi-plex and puts down ten bucks or more to be bored, talked down to and left puzzled. The audience I saw it with sat in stunned silence as the lights came up, astonished the film should have so little to offer. This is not even worth a DVD rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I've seen the film and have a mixed reaction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I should say that I am a fan of the book. The film uses the events of the book only as a loose guideline and contains many differences, most significantly in the very meaning of the title. SPOILER AHEAD! In the book her husband was a "good German" in the sense that he was loyal to the Fatherland. Not so in the film. Also, the Kate Blanchett character seems to be a composite of two characters in the book, assuming the guilt for a horrible crime that is actually committed by another character entirely in the novel.The film is stylish, affecting all the trimmings of a '40s style melodrama; i.e. Franz Waxman-like score (though not nearly as good or emotional) and the black and white photography is quite good but not Casablanca. Speaking of Casablanca, there are many attempts to if not parody (this is hardly a comedy) than to offer homage, none more obvious than a scene on the tarmac where the lovers part with the twin prop plane behind them. It is shot exactly as in Casablanca. Kate even wears a hat reminiscent of the one worn by Ingrid in the original. According to the screenwriter, there was the definite intention to keep the classic style of the period but use modern language. So if you ever longed to hear Rick and Ilsa talk dirty this is the film for you. One last note - the film uses three narrators as it goes along, switching points of view. While this breaks all the rules (one narrator is soon dead)it does not take you out of the movie. The performances are all good, though Clooney seems a little stiffer than usual, the role not offering him an awful lot of range, at least as written in the screenplay. All in all, this is an interesting but highly flawed film which I doubt will garner much Oscar attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pathetic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i notice that previous IMDb reviewers make comparisons with "Casablanca", "The third Man" and even "Psycho" and it is very ridiculous as they were great movie classics and this one is pathetic.I firmly believe that historical films especially about the Second World War are extremely important and are even still relevant today. Today's film audience and market will take to important historical films but they did not with this one.The movie show plot description above is clearly lifted from the Internet Movie Data base but for the sake of this review, I will repeat that it is set in Post war Germany and gives a fictitious scenario concerning the Potsdam Conference and the search of Nazi scientists by the American Armed forces. The film is far from historically accurate and of course, George Clooney again selects a screenplay that attempts to discredit America.Cate Blanchette appears as the German Prostitute and love interest of George Clooney and her acting is boring and awkward. Strangely enough Cate Blanchett is a dead ringer fro the former head of the Nazi Gestapo Reinhart Heydrich. As Cate Blanchett is partial to plating male roles due to her heavyset masculine features and monotone voice, she should play Gestapo General Reinhardt Heydrich and use her family wealth to seed funds for the film as she did with her very forgettable career.I note a film was recently release called the "The good Shepherd" maybe Cate could call the Autobiography of General Reinhart Heindrich with her in the leading role, "The Good German Shepherd".Give this film a miss unless you like masculine women, Cate Blanchett or phony Mediterranean intellectuals like Clooney.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>another black and white movie, why not color?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If it wasn't black and white I would have voted 9 instead of 7. I like how the Russians were acting and the roles overall were great. Cate was awesome, I wouldn't say the same about Tobey, I mean he is playing a character of a tough careless man, that doesn't suit him at all, he can't hide the caring from his eyes, so the role wasn't quiet the best. George is always good, that is probably the first movie that he put some acting effort into it, and that is the only aspect that didn't suit him, he should have stayed himself, he does better being himself, I mean to my opinion he is one of the rare non-acting actor or in another word real actor, in that movie he wasn't himself much, he was more the character. Overall it is a fantastic movie, a must see, I would hope to see it in color one day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hope the movie does well (great cast, fine director), but I can't recommend it: After seeing a great preview of the film, 3 of us were really disappointed with the (entire) film itself. The problem starts with the plot - the movie needs to explain more upfront why the sought-after person is so important to post-war peace (or war?). Its a very important point, and without it I was trying to figure out why the heck this woman was so important to find, and moreover why was her missing husband even more important to the U.S. Without that information a murder, a lot of official hang wringing, threats, visits to a mysterious shop, and meetings in the shadows were all left without too much of a real storyline meaning for me. I also thought the movie was over-scored and disappointed that it continued in B&amp;W throughout after the opening scenes. I had assumed it would blossom into color. I guess this is meant to be a classic post-WWII spy mystery in bombed-out Berlin, noir, but we need to know why, sooner, to care about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly bad film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this at an industry screening where security people sent by Warner Brothers went through bags looking for recording devices. After suffering through this poor excuse for a feature film I wondered why anyone would ever worry about the film being pirated. It's a real stinker from start to finish.First of all, it was shot in B &amp; W which didn't bother me as such. But what did bother me was the fact that whoever was the DP on this turkey, didn't have a clue as to how to properly light and expose B &amp; W negative. Who knows? maybe it's a lost art. To make matters even worse, the print suffered from some type of chemical stain that appeared in the center of the frame. It sort of came and would then return with a vengeance. Does anyone look at these prints to make sure they're OK? The plot was overly complex. Much to do about nothing. This meant the long awaited revelation was nothing much at all. In other words, a big letdown.George Clooney was OK as was Cate Blanchett, but the goofball who played Tully came across as some bad high school reject. Doesn't anyone know how to cast a film these days? That said, the best thing about the film was Thomas Newman's music score. Had it not been part of the film and instead some turgid score been in its place, I'd have walked out early.The only other good thing was with the exception of having to pay for parking, the movie was free.</fullReview>
