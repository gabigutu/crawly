		<shortDescription>Bu?uel continues to impress with this surrealistic, violent comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The master of surrealistic cinema, Luis Bu?uel, changed his approach to the bourgeoisie after "Tristana", and his last three films are all comic and prevail through a mixture of pure surrealism, extreme irony and the one consistent theme of Bu?uel's auteurship- hatred of the ruling classes."Le Fantôme de la Liberté" is perhaps Bu?uel's least accessible work since his first two films, "Un Chien Andalou" and "L' Age d' Or". It is a thematic continuation of "Le Charme Discret de la Bourgeoisie", where the seven protagonists just couldn't finish, or even start, a meal. This is a strong metaphor for Bu?uel's view that the bourgeoisie is a dying class, and that not even a violent revolution is needed to remove the bourgeoisie from power and wealth. They are perfectly capable of doing so themselves, through their indulgence in pathetic etiquette and decaying sense of morality. "Le Fantôme" is not funnier than "Le Charme", but it is harder to understand, and this is exactly what Bu?uel and Carri?re wanted after the success of "Le Charme" at the previous Academy Awards. In "Le Fantôme", not even the characters are consistent throughout the film. This film is like a relay, where one member of the ruling class passes the stick to the next, and never comes back to the vision of the audience. They just leave, like Bu?uel wanted them to, perhaps, but in this film is an important factor because it confirms Bu?uel's non-human view of the people of this class. His was a collective hatred, and this film reflects his collective view of the bourgeoisie. The film contains absurd, surreal incidents, like priests playing cards while smoking and drinking, parents reacting to postcards of famous buildings given their daughter by a stranger as they were obscene and a writer killing tens of people from his sniping-position at the roof of a building. The writer is found not guilty, and the continuing mix-up of characters, two actors competing for one role makes for a very confusing narrative. Or maybe the "story" is just a mockery of traditional storytelling in film. Resnais and Robbe-Grillet made "Last Year in Marienbad" just to prove that telling stories is a bourgeois thing and not necessary for modernist or revolutionary cinema.This film is actually based on a painting by Francisco José de Goya called "El Tres de Mayo" (The three in Mayo), and "Le Fantôme" starts with a short episode of how Bu?uel depicts the incidents during the Napoleon Wars. But it's the theme of Goya's painting that Bu?uel is concerned with, and this film is more than a mockery of the bourgeoisie, it is also an attack on communist doctrine which all over the world only seems to take from the people what is was supposed to give to the people: Freedom, and also an attack on leftist defeatism. The glorification of the defeat is perhaps the modern Left's biggest problem, which only leads to a move away from power. "Down with freedom!", Bu?uel's revolutionaries shout- and the firing squads start firing at the dying revolutionaries.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>question what you've always taken for granted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bu?uel seems to be even more brilliant without the screenplays by Salvador Dali (un Chien Andalou, l'Age d'or, both 1930). Of course Jean-Claude Carriere is not a small name either, but Bu?uel must be the great mind behind this masterpiece. Fantome seems to take off right from the premises of 'Le Voie lactee' (1969), as people seem to move in mysterious ways and mysterious things happen to them, there sometimes even seems to be time-traveling. Anything can happen along the way. But whereto leads the way? Who knows the direction and if so, does that direction make sense and to whom?Yes, this film raises a lot of questions and that must be Bu?uel's greatest power: question what you've always taken for granted. In any way, Bu?uel continues his 'unrestricted creativeness' as someone on IMDb named it. Absurd, bizarre, subversive, anti-clericism, magic realism, surrealism, sophistry, you name it! Everything is in here. He seems to have returned to the experimental years (1929, 1930) completely. He probably thought he could get away with that because Charme discret de la bourgeoisie (1972) won an Academy Award for best foreign picture and Bu?uel figured that everybody would be going to see this film, no matter how off the wall it was.In Voie Lactee is a heated conversation between a catholic and a Jesuit about personal freedom that comes to a mysterious compromise when the Jesuit exclaims: 'Ma liberte est un fantom!' That is worked out here in Fantome de la liberte for a wider audience, in that we don't have to know much about the differences between catholics and Jesuits to be able to understand what's going on. Well, maybe most of the time. The other part it is just plain fun to watch and get your world turned upside down (That's why Catch-22 (Nichols, 1970) is my personal favourite film).Cinematographer Edmond Richard (Charme discret de la bourgeoisie 1972, Cet obscure object du desir 1977) who should have won an Academy Award for 'Le Proces' (Welles, 1963) demonstrates that he can collaborate with Bu?uel fabulously in Bu?uel's last three films. Still I feel I'm missing the point of this film by a long shot. But that just gives me a reason to see it again soon! For now I'm just very thankful that someone recommended this to me.10 points out of 10 :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surrealism at its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Bu?uel's greatest films. Scene after scene arguments are used as beautiful excuses to subvert reality and attack established and hypocritical institutions with acute humor and surrealist means. If you have a taste for surrealism and absurd humor (i.e. Monty Python, Marx Bros., etc.) this movie cannot be recommended enough.One small correction: the sniper is not sentenced to death but to capital punishment which results in something altogether different from death (and far more sarcastic).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"On a flimsy ground of reality, imagination spins out and waves new patterns."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This excellent collection of satirical vignettes is my kind of movie - crazy, dark and comical, it goes any direction it wants and does not follow any rules. When we try to grasp for the meaning, it is like a ghost, a phantom that "leaves us with a wisp of vapor in our hands" and disappears - very much like the liberty, the freedom the humans try to find but instead could only see its phantom disappearing. The film follows many characters on its way shifting effortlessly and playfully from the central ones to the minor ones making minor ones the central and going back and forth from one time period to another. It opens in Toledo during the Napoleonic occupation then jumps to the modern day Paris. It could've gone anywhere and introduced me to any character - it still would've been enormously interesting because it was made by the master who had never lost his curiosity, his inquisitive mind, his memory that consisted of the strange and amazing images, his sense of humor, his childhood dreams, his fantasies, dark and shining and who was able to throw them all on the screen like no one ever was able or will be able to do. To understand Bunuel completely would be as impossible as to catch the Phantom of Liberty - he will be always one of the best and unsolved mysteries in the Art of Cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Liberty is a phantom and Bunuel shows why</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one the great comedies but it's not really a laugh out loud satire. The series of barely interlocking sketches really break down your senses of what you expect from movies. My favorite bits are when a little girl goes along with her parents to the police station to report that she has been missing for some time and when the military is brought into a zoo to keep the people away from the animals. The look on the face of an ostrich almost seems to be one of relief. People can read deeply into the messages of the stories or can just be taken for the fun (one might almost say hip) paradoxes of society. I think Bunuel wants to show that complete freedom is impossible because even if you are willing to detach from everybody and everything, you still have your own inner-nature to answer to. **** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The great Bunuel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can one say after watching "The phantom of liberty"? if you want to make films of your own, you can only be jealous with the power of Bu?uel at directing the most simple everyday situations with a surrealist twist without thinking twice and flicking an eye. his hatred of the bourgeoisie is evident here even much more in then in his masterpiece "The discreet charm...". and the reason is: in that film there was a plot, a reason, a context which within things were happening, and the viewer could relate to things that happened earlier in the film. but in this picture there is no line, not one story, but stories that don't even intertwine with one another. just a collection of fragments, some strange, some funny, some totally impossible.The freedom that Bunuel takes upon himself is backened with a lot of responsibility. one has to be responsible and not losing the viewer. but this freedom is exactly the same that he had as an artist while making "Un chien andalou", or "Archibaldo de la cruz". it's just that this time there is an attack at yet another bourgeoisie item: order. stories claim order. so is the ruling class.So Bunuel and Carriere decided to attack the order of storytelling itself. it's a very tricky business to do on film, but if you understand the way dream works, no problem. let's go straight ahead. and so much fun is promised.Just like any other Bunuel film, there are no special effects, no overwhelming shots, no camera or editing tricks. just an attack, there is no other way calling this, on reality of the mind, of the eye and of order of things. it is only when you release yourself from social rules that are false, fake and immoral, you can become free again. only when you see your fellow man and his suffering, you can become moral. only when you cry against social injustice, you can justify the revolution of humanity against greed and the wars it inflicted us into. if you'll keep on crying "death to freedom", you are in danger of becoming one of them bourgeois guys. and it's so easy, my god...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Delicious Surrealistic Satire to the Moral and Costumes of the Society, to the Family and to the Church</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Through many episodes with some linking points since 1808 in Toledo (Spain) to the present days in France, Bunuel presents a delicious surrealistic satire to the moral and costumes of the hypocrite society, to the family values and to the church. I liked very much some parts, like, for example, the hypocrisy of the priests in a hotel, praying for the health of the father of a guest in a moment, and drinking and playing cards like gangsters in the next moment. The bourgeoisie family sat on toilets in the dining room and producing crap while having a conversation is fantastic, reflecting his opinion about the dominating class. The little girl that "vanished" for her parents is a great critics to the behavior of most families. The hypocrisy of the justice, reflected in the segment of the sniper. It is amazing the interpretations each segment offers to the viewer through the symbolism of Bunuel. However, this movie is recommend for very specific audiences. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "O Fantasma da Liberdade" ("The Phantom of the Liberty")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bunuel walks a razor line between comedy and tragedy, coming out with few marks as always</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Luis Bunuel's final film from an original screenplay (by him and collaborator Jean-Claude Carriere), The Phantom of Liberty, befuddled me so much more than the other Bunuel films I've seen that I had to turn it off after twenty minutes, thinking I'd get back to it at some point. I finally did, and it turns out to be maybe not one of Bunuel's absolute best, but it has many memorable moments in his twilight years as a surrealist master. The strange thing is about this film, and I've come to realize it more after seeing Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie again recently (my favorite feature length film of his), is that there is such a line that is walked, like a tightrope walker holding an elephant in one hand and a thumbnail in the other, that one wonders whether this should be taken totally seriously or just with the general hysteria and (crucially) absurdism that laces much of Bunuel's work in his post Mexico period. Sometimes, much like with The Exterminating Angel, it's a little frustrating, even once one understands that having no structure to the film is the point. For example, in one of the segments that make up the film's loose structure, a woman is visiting a group of Priests out in a house on the outskirts. Much of this sequence is rather serious, dealing with a young man's lusting for an older woman, the rousings and thoughts of the old priests...and then it suddenly, finally, breaks up the tension with an S&amp;M gag! This is very tricky ground that Bunuel covers in the film, and for the most part he ends up pulling it off. At times I wondered if a film like this would work in other hands. It wouldn't; there's a sense of pacing that makes the film seem rather serious, but (as it says on the back of the original video box) it owes as much to Monty Python as it does to the old-school 20's surrealism that got Bunuel up off his feet and into the cinema scene. Sometimes I laughed cause I felt terribly uncomfortable, other times because there was a real pay-off. But in reality, the Phantom of Liberty is the kind of film where many times you just stare and go 'huh, what'? And I mean that as a compliment.By the way, the film also has two other interesting factors to note, one about an "infamous" scene that did leave me laughing hard, and another more of historical note. The scene where the rich people sit around the table, toilets as their seats, pants down, doing their business, is true absurdism at a peak of intelligence. The other note is that if you wonder if this structure has ever been repeated or expounded upon, Richard Linklater's first film Slacker comes closest, though with a much different tone and style of comedy. Here, we get the upper class, religion, old-time armed forces (gotta love that statue slap the guard in the 19th century segment), and the struggle between keeping with dreams or reality, or both. This is the kind of film that almost puts me off with its irreverence, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't stunned and amazed by the audaciousness as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Liberty is a concept by which we measure our laws..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although Bunuel was to make one more film,"cet obscur objet du désir" ,"phantom of liberty" would remain his testament,his last sigh ,to mention the title of his memoirs.The key to the movie is the segment dealing with the naughty gendarmes,the sociology teacher and Margaret Mead's books.Law must not be taken for granted,it depends on where and when you live.Something which would seem unbearable to us is nothing but natural to other human beings.The whole movie walks this fine line,being built around this very concept.It is Bunuel's most accessible movie and it's completely mad,which is fine with me.Its construction is not unlike Max Ophuls's "la ronde" (1950) as a new character provides the connection between the segments.It's not really free-form ,in the sense of the nouvelle vague ,nothing Godardesque here and anyway,Bunuel possessed something Jean-Luc will never have:humor.And the screenplay displays care and respect for the audience.One should point out Jean-Claude Carri?re's importance in Bunuel's last works in France.In "discreet charm of the bourgeoisie" ,humor which was latent in the former works (the dogs in "Viridiana" ;the pineapple in "Nazarin" ) came to the fore."Phantom" is probably not as strong as the previous work:it's sometimes uneven and some segments (the old aunt and her nephew)drag on.But most of the times,it's a delight.Bunuel's usual targets ,the Church and the Army are both given a rough ride .But social conventions ,"normality" are too.A bevy of great actors take us to a magical mystery tour (Bunuel's regret was that too many movies lack mystery) Here he focused on the secret of the passage of the night hours ,wherever the action takes place ,in Brialy's and Vitti's bedroom or the inn where the guests are weird to say the least (the scenes in the inn recall those of "la voie lactée,1969).And the ostrich in the couple's room ,we find it back at the zoo,for the finale,when repression rises.When we bury our head in the sand ,French people call it "ostrish politics"! Bunuel was a great man.Everything he did is crying to be watched.When the movie was released,probably upset by the huge commercial success ,some critics called it "Bunuel' s holiday homework".Time proved them wrong.In 2005,"phantom" is solid as a rock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Dissolution of Form and Function</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Luis Bunuel's "Le Phantôme de la liberté" is a movie whose episodes are only loosely connected, because the watcher is a part of the society whose liberty and freedom is a phantom. Moreover, it is man who watches this movie that also creates the story ? not on the screen, of course, but in her or his mind. This is a movie that does never go out of your mind.The clue scene is in the episode where Margaret Mead's books are mentioned. And in fact, since this movie deals with liberty and with persons of very different cultural, religious and aesthetic backgrounds, it is a sociological movie. It was Mead who gave the direction to the late cybernetician Heinz von Foerster's (1911-2002) work: Second-order cybernetics. It is called "second order" because this theory has an environment in which subject and object have a space of liberty. Only in such an environment-based logic it is possible to reflect to oneself. And this is exactly what happened in Bunel's core-scene: The teacher speaks to his students that laws have exceptions because they are depending on man, and man is depending on evolution. Therefore, there can be no laws at all, because they also stay and fall with evolution. And if they are no laws at all, then they are no causal relations. And if there are no causal relations, then form and function vanish, exactly like in Bunuel's movie. But the most important point is that this conclusion is reflected in the movie itself. The teacher who makes this self-reflection moreover has much in common with Bunuel, so for example, when he criticizes the standard level of human life in Spain ? as Bunuel did in an interview.Another interesting point is that the physician's name is Dr. Pasolini. Bunuel's movie was released in 1974, thus just at the time when Pier Paolo Pasolini started to film his last work "Salo", in which (amongst many other marvelous events) there is the famous or infamous scene where people are forced to eat faeces. But faeces play an important role in Bunuel's "Phantom of Liberty" (so the English title of this movie), too: The teacher explains his friends how many kilograms of faeces a human produces daily, and since there are so and so many billions of people on this world, this makes so and so many tons of faeces per year. Then, the teacher has lunch in the restroom (one of the most famous scenes of this movie). And finally, in his regular bar, the teacher explains the girl who resembles to his sister that this sister died because her intestines exploded. This three-times occurrence of faeces, the mentioning of Pasolini and the insight that form and function must abolish only because of human evolution leads the critical watcher to a conclusion about the sociology of human life that is not too far away form that of Pasolini: All mankind is able to produce is faeces.Although Bunuel made one more movie ("Cet obscur object du désir", in 1977), he considered the "Pantom of Libery" his testament. Pasolini's testament was the "Salo". Bunuel still lived nine more years after his "Phantom", Pasolini was killed shortly after the postproduction of "Salo". Pasolini was radical and consistent, Bunuel still had kept his sense of humor (the "Phantom" ranges under "comedy", at least officially). Perhaps in the end, it was the humor that let Bunuel alive, while its absence killed Pasolini. Or was Bunuel's humor gallows humor? He drank himself to death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bonkers brilliance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the first 'surreal' films that I have seen. Phantom of Liberty for the most part is quite a normal film with a structured narrative and some quite well defined characters What makes it brilliant is the fact that one minute, its just a normal film and then a scene where a family sit at a table on toilet seats is thrown at us. Followed by each family member coming to another room to eat on their own. Distorting reality. Weird! Some parts of the film are so absurd they are funny. Such as an early scene where some parents look at pictures and deem them 'disgusting' when they are just pictures of buildings. Its very strange and humorous in general.The are minimal cuts in the camera work, shots flow together nicely. For example a two shot may not cut to an over the shoulder shot, but just adjust to it. A technique which I liked.I found this film to be quite oddly lit. Is often dark and light is used kind of sparingly. Odd, as the film sometimes almost looks like shades of grey through its darkness.I'm guessing that the criterion version is the way to go, I saw a version taped from TV about 6 years ago, which was at times fuzzy and grainy. Anyway, to sum up. A mad film that defies logic, is funny, shocking and engaging to the last perfect frame. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A deliciously magnificent potpourri of irrational vignettes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This wondrous and admirable picture begins with Napoleon's troops invading Toledo, Spain in 1808, where a group (including Bunuel) are facing a firing squad. Then an officer tries to kiss a stone statue lady, and is struck by an adjacent statue's arm. The film then moves to present day France, and a man giving postcards to children, who he tells, don't show them to adults. You see the postcards contain the shocking images of structural landmarks. The short stories begin and disappear quickly, with one of the characters exiting a scene, and leading off into another different location. The viewer doesn't have long to think, and is suddenly thrown into a new unusual episode. Other memorable scenes include one where guests sit on toilets at a dinner table, then ask to go to a small cubicle to eat on their own. One where a sniper shoots many people, and when tried in court and found guilty, is sentenced to death. His handcuffs are then removed by police, who shake his hand, and outside a gathering of people ask for his autograph. My favourite scene is when a couple are told to go to their daughter's school, because she has vanished. They arrive there and find her in class, the school register is read out, and she replies, then they take her to the police station. The police sergeant then questions the young girl about her height, weight, and so on, then calls an officer in and tells him to look all over the city for this girl, the officer then replies "Can I take her with me?". Marvellous. It is all quite superb. It would be unfair to describe all the scenes, you really have to see this picture and allow them all to soak into you, preferably after several viewings of the film. A picture made with utter abandon and liberty. Classic Bunuel. One of his very best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horrendous mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose there are a number of ways that this film could be defended, and while it's not my place or purpose to anticipate all of them, I will guess that the first line of attack is to say "you didn't understand it" or the second if that failed would be "you are politically pre-disposed to dislike this film." So I just wanted to establish right away, not so much that I necessarily "understood" the film, but that I consider one of the film's greatest weaknesses to be the fact that it must be intellectualized in order for value to be derived. There is a constant filter between the audience and the film, caused by the film's all too transparent surrealist technique.I suppose a good example would be the scene with the people sitting around a table, each on an individual toilet doing his/her business. One man retires from the table to go to the seclusion of a small compartment to eat. The audience is immediately taken out of the film while an intellectual process takes place by which the audience member will analyze what he's seen and figure out its "meaning". Which is pretty easy to discern I suppose, as he's basically talking about the arbitrary nature of social convention, which seems to be part of a larger critique of social manners and behavior. The entire movie is full of "clever" skits like this.... sadly this scene seems to actually be considered a highlight of the film. It's not unintelligent necessarily, and I can see that Bunuel has a "point" -- but the film has very little or no actual cinematic value. The film's humor is not very appealing to me, there are no sustained characters, and the cinematography is reminiscent of a Jess Franco movie.Bunuel apparently thinks that his social satire -- such as it is -- will sustain the entire film despite the lack of story and logic. But even satire has its own internal logic, whereas this film does nothing but debunk and present evidence for various ideas that should already by painfully obvious to most thinking people while providing nothing in the way of an alternative value structure. It's thoroughly deconstructionist and I just do not believe that process has much intrinsic value. I found myself sitting through so much garbage -- for example sustained shots of a bird's head looking at the camera -- that would need to be deciphered or translated through a mental process before they would have any value at all, that's what I'm trying to say.There's a whole section of the film where there is a search for a "missing" girl -- even though the girl is right there in front of the parents and police. Yes, the scenes made me think about the fact that some people out there somewhere -- presumably aristocratic folks who the director and writer dislike -- probably don't pay much attention to their children even though they would probably throw a fit if the child was gone. But what a painfully drawn-out and pretentious way to make such a statement!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of Luis Bunuel's most free-form and purely Surrealist films, consisting of a series of only vaguely related episodes - most famously, the dinner party scene where people sit on lavatories round a dinner table on, occasionally retiring to a little room to eat.Luis Bunuel said, "Chance governs all things; necessity, which is far from having the same purity, comes only later. If I have a soft spot for any one of my movies, it would be for The Phantom of Liberty, because it tries to work out just this theme." I know I am in the minority, but I do not quite see the appeal of Bunuel's later films. I love his early work, such as "Age d'Or" and "un Chien Andalou", but the later more political films... I do not necessary appreciate them. This one and its partner, "Discreet Charm", I just cannot identify with... maybe a second viewing?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Phantom of Liberty-Questioning Society</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had me deeply questioning society and what we believe to be our social norms. Luis Bu?uel did a fantastic job of asking very controversial questions. Why do we do the things that we do? What in our culture makes us believe that one thing is right and normal, while the other is barbaric? And in a completely different culture it could be just the opposite. We formulate opinions and judge circumstances based on where we grew up, our race, our family values, our education-but what made those judgments and opinions right or justifiable? Who decided one day that this is the way it's going to be? For example why is it considered heinous to discuss normal bodily functions? Why in our society today do we believe that a woman having more than one partner makes her promiscuous, but a man having more than partner is completely normal? The moment our conscious mind becomes aware, our brains our completely bombarded with the ideas, opinions, and thoughts of the society we are surrounded with. We begin to form our moral guidelines based on what is believed to be our 'social norms', when really these norms are just a perception of human reality. There is actually no such thing as 'right' or 'wrong'. We make up what we believe to be right or wrong based on how we where raised and what affected us through out our lives. And every culture has completely different views on what is considered socially acceptable or not, which proves that it's all perception of the mind. These thoughts and ideas where implemented many years ago and carried on throughout history, changing with time and new generations but still having remnants of the past. Bu?uel captured this concept incredibly in this film, weaving through each story and shocking his audience into asking themselves these very questions. He wanted to show us that society is what we created it to be, the rules the norms, all of it is just what we perceive to be acceptable or not. My favorite example of this in the movie was the Dinner Scene. They are all upper class, civilized and seemingly respectable members of society, casually enjoying reliving themselves all together. When the daughter asks to eat food, and the mother hushes her saying she shouldn't speak like that at the table, it made me really think. Bu?uel makes a strong point with this scene. What if it had been the other way around? What if we thought eating should be done in private, and reliving ourselves should be the social event. It's all what we make of it, and that's why I truly enjoyed this movie. It made me question what we recognize to be civil and barbaric, and why we believe it to be so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this last night, prepared for (as it was described to me) 'an attack on societal rituals and storytelling itself'.Instead, I found myself falling asleep.I'm someone who likes a wide variety of movies. Foreign films, surreal films, transgressive films: love 'em. But they have to be done well. The Phantom Of Liberty isn't. If it's an attack on anything, it's the most timid, polite attack I've ever seen. It doesn't say anything original and it doesn't even say it loudly enough to cover up that fact.Also, its supposed themes don't come across. There's not enough happening in the movie to hang them on! The content of this film is stretched nylon-thin. Scenes are padded out to agonizing length; either taking too long with the setup or belaboring the point to new frontiers in redundancy. Supposedly, Luis Bu?uel and Jean-Claude Carri?re wrote the film by telling each other last night's dreams. Someone should have informed them that nothing in the world is more boring to have to sit through. If this movie meant a lot to Bu?uel, that's great. But he failed at conveying why these ideas should be important to me also.But there are bright spots. A few good ideas and punchlines. But as I was watching, I realized exactly what this movie really is: IT'S A MONTY PYTHON EPISODE WITH GLACIAL PACING. Am I wrong? Think of all the movie's cleverest, most surreal ideas; aren't they exactly the sort of things the Pythons would think up? The dirty photos, the gambling monks, the toilet table, the missing girl, the celebrity sniper? The difference is, they would have either added more material instead of just presenting the premise and then doing nothing clever with it, or they'd have made the joke without lingering on the punchline until it was dead and buried. And the kicker is, they were doing this same material four years earlier!Is this what it takes to make art-house critics fawn over lowbrow humor? Add eighty minutes of tedium?There's a certain class of films which I detest: ones that coast by on name recognition. If you watch a boring movie and assume that there must have been some deep, deep meaning going on that you didn't catch, because obviously the director is such a genius, you're letting them get away with a lazy film. They might indeed have had deep layers of meaning, sure. But if the cues to them are so vague that the audience has to go sift through books and articles to have someone else explain it to them, it's the same as if the director had said nothing at all. Because if a movie is vague enough that the audience can't hope to even get a *feel* for the meaning as they're watching it, then that's a movie so vague that anyone can slap their own intellectual-sounding analysis onto it and look real smart. Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, and sometimes a movie with indecipherable meaning just isn't made very well. If you think I'm wrong then why aren't you defending Zak Snyder's Sucker Punch?Luis Bu?uel, I accuse you of the worst crime a surrealist can commit: being dull.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here is a film where I can understand that those who love Surrealism will see this as a masterpiece. However, although I find The Phantom of Liberty to be funny, I could simply not watch this over and over again. This isn't to say it is a bad film. However, it is like an absurd piece of art that you will either love or hate. I can only appreciate it for the fact that it did make me stop and think about the socially constructed world we live in. When something has the ability to question why is it we do things a certain way, credit must be given. The problem I have with this is that Bunuel appears to have made a movie where his social satire carries throughout a movie with no real purpose. This for me makes it a little tedious to sit through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is your perception your reality?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before seeing this film, I had no previous exposure to "Surrealist" cinema, or even heard of Luis Bu?uel. "Phantom of Liberty" is comprised of several tableaux each linked together by the underlying idea of freedom. It addresses the absurdity of social conventions, questions cultural taboos like monogamy, and exposes the innuendos and criticisms of the Catholic school system?to name a few. It's incredible how a film can bring to your consciousness so much that lay within your subconscious. In the beginning of the film, a middle- aged man gives two young girls some photographs. Instinctively, I thought, 'He's a pedophile,' when in actuality he had given them postcards of French architecture. Bunuel addresses what we have all been conditioned to feel as a result of our societal and cultural influences.I enjoyed this movie mainly because of the surrealistic elements. The direction, the acting, and the stories were all meaningful, I was entertained throughout. See it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Philosophical and Psychological Questions Explored</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After experiencing, "The Phantom of Liberty," I have grown to really appreciate Luis Bunuel's film-making approach. His ability to make us question reality and the validity of certain societal conceptions through use of satirical surrealism is pure genius. What really resonated with me was the way Bunuel was able to manipulate my emotions to thinking one way, where really he was trying to open my eyes to a world of completely different justifications and possibilities. The notion that society has a moral structure and a rigid set of beliefs concerning what is right and what is wrong is essentially flawed. Bunuel is completely exploiting this flaw and smacking us in the face with this reality. And the irony behind the whole thing is that he is exposing this reality through the usage of surrealism. I'm not so sure anymore where the line is drawn between surrealism and reality. This is just one of the many philosophical and psychological questions that this film leads me to ask myself, and it's absolutely fascinating. The vignette about the disappearing child had to be one of my favorite statements throughout the movie. So many times children feel as though they are not being listened too; that their opinion isn't being heard. I can remember a situation in elementary school where I had been sent to the principal's office for really no justifiable reason. I explained my side of the story with logical rational, and it seemed to be completely overlooked in an almost arrogant way. As a child, the emotions that you feel during these types of situations lead you believe that you are not worthy of a voice. Most adults aren't conscious of this psychology, and Bunuel effectively exposed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Subtext galore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no continuous story here in the traditional sense, rather around ten short episodes that are linked by a character that has a supporting role in one episode, only to become the protagonist in the next. This pattern is followed throughout the entire movie.This in itself should be enough to tickle your interest. If it is not, there is more, much more. A recurring theme of freedom carries throughout, but the way it is portrayed and dealt with from episode to episode is strikingly different. In some, ultimate freedom is tackled head-on, in others ? it is complexly layered and provokes thought.Each episode deals with a social institution, some more than one. By the end, our so called freedom is seriously attacked, because social, moral, and religious labels do not allow us to really be free. The brilliance of Luis Bu?uel, the director, lies in the subtlety of those attacks. In fact, they are so subtle, that they do not seem like attacks. Perhaps it is because we are the ones who end up making those attacks, those judgments. With every episode, it is as if he looks at us until our eyes meet then points to the door; we have no choice but to walk thorough them and come out different.On the surface, the stories are fairly easy to follow, however, they are drowning in subtext. In one episode religious monks play poker; they wager an assortment of different religious artifacts. In another, a physician offers a cigarette to a patient whom he had just diagnosed with cancer; Teacher calls parents to let them know their child is missing, who in turn inform the police ? but the child is in front of them the whole time; The army is utilizing their military might to hunt down a fox; People eat dinner in the bathroom, by themselves, while gathering around the living-room table to collectively defecate, etc.While we are led to question just how free we truly are, Bu?uel does not provide us with answers. Because the stories are related to real life, and because of the amount of subtext in them, they encourage thought like very few movies. If you are watching the movie in company, no doubt, get ready for some serious discussion. This movie will continue to be timeless, if not for its original narrative and structure, then simply because of its relevance in today's society.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Twisted Tyranny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "Phantom of Liberty", Luis Bu?uel uses the juxtaposition of elements to provoke a shocking and believable experience. By creating a shadow of a doubt it is easy for viewers to expect the unexpected and create a perversion of reality. As we make assumptions as spectators, Bunuel seems to beg the question: "What would you actually do with freedom?" if given the chance. I would define "Phantom of Liberty" as being structurally groundbreaking in terms of tabloi or episode construction. By allowing segments to be pieced together, Bunuel creates a unique fusion of scenes that blend together in order to form one complete underlying message. The narrative is constantly being manipulated which inevitably tarnishes what little logic remains in this absurdist world of reversals. There is a scene between two statues that tells a story within a story about the Napoleonic Invasion and how the phrase "down with liberty, long live chains" came to be a prominent underlying message within this surrealistic movie. There are instances of disbelief that suspend the viewer's mind by creating the illusion of reality and twisting it to become a extensive plot of twisted ideals. For instance, at the beginning of the movie we scene is set of a man at a playground watching two young girls go down a slide and then offering them various pictures of what is eventually revealed to be different historical monuments with sexual connotations but nonetheless harmless. Then there is the case of the missing girl which has demonstrates the underlying criticism of institutional and social norms. Bunuel truly embodied the surrealist objective in a whimsically creative and twisted way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Phantom of Liberty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Phantom of Liberty was directed by Luis Bu?uel and is an anti institutional surrealistic movie. Luis Bu?uel's episodic approach to this film makes it very entertaining; also many scenes are very Pythonesque-like in style.What makes this film special is that there is not one major main protagonist; instead we get to follow a lot of different people around. Once the camera has locked-on to one character, we get to follow him/her until they interact with someone else whom eventually will carry the story forward from there. In that way we get to experience several episodes, which all deals with the world in a completely different surreal aspect. This episodic approach provides a feeling of rebirth every time we are introduced to a new character.The film is full of critique against several of the fundamental institutions in society. The church is one of the first to be attacked. In the opening scene we see Napoleonic soldiers that plunder a church. They are drinking the communion wine and eating the sacramental bread. Later in the story a couple of monks swears, gambles and express gluttonous behavior thus breaking almost all of the deadly sins.Not only is the church being criticized. Bu?uel visualizes this highly dysfunctional classroom that is filled with adult police officers who act like ten year olds. They are constantly being interrupted by people coming and leaving the classroom as the teacher tries to lecture. In a few scenes before that, the military is seen hunting for foxes with a tank, clearly breaking with the purpose of the military. There is also a sniper that shoots people completely random and gets away with it, thanks to a highly questionable court system.In this film, Luis Bu?uel tries to make us question the social conventions that we all adhere to, whether we know it or not. To challenge our morals and the thoughts of what is considered right or wrong, good or bad. He tries to make us see that it is always highly subjective. The most interesting aspect of this film is that Luis Bu?uel challenges the viewer's mindset. In a playground scene, an older man is seen handing out pictures to children. As a viewer you immediately jump to the conclusion that he is a pervert. It is fascinating in how Bu?uel manage to show how quick we are to assume and stereotype. You are likely to catch yourself several times in this film, judging what you see before all the facts are in.With its highly comedic and critical views on social conventions and institutions, Phantom of Liberty is really a little piece of gold. A perfect film that provide a surrealistic reality escape which not only entertains but also invites you to question why and how we do as we do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do You Really Know About Society???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What an extraordinary film. No doubt Luis Bunuel's masterpiece about the nature of society and what is considered 'correct'. Abnormal becomes the normal and no one bothers to raise an eyebrow. The movie makes you think, is that the world we live in? Are our everyday actions really this pointless? and, What kind of lives and roles are we really playing in this world? It is perhaps most easily described as a movie where the reader thinks at the end, 'Ya this is my life, who say I can't do this, who say's I can't say that.' The best scenes in the movie come in the small hotel. Various characters we see in everyday society, like priests, businessmen,a boy with his aunt, etc. are in a way 'defying' the role they should be playing in society. This demonstration of the boy having feelings about the elder family member, the clergymen smoking and drinking, the sophisticated businessman wearing bottomless chaps, all help the films main purpose so what!! Who cares if they are doing those actions, who said that they are not fitting. The movie shows us that these molds we have of ourselves and of society are so meaningless and overstated that it gives us the idea to just be ourselves. The movie reasserts the power of just being a good human, having goals, and not be diverted or pay useless attention to these constraints society has on us. One of the best scenes in the movie, one that is to be taken in a more figurative sense demonstrating these false 'norms' we have, is the scene where people are sitting on the toilets excreting together around the table. Instead of eating together then are excreting together. When one is to eat, they go to what we know as the 'restroom' to take of that action. It is a perfect summary of the ideology of the movie. Phantom of Liberty is extremely entertaining and forces you to question your own concept of reality and freedom. It confronts human behavior and defies the rules and beliefs for which we as individuals take a stand. It is certainly a pleasurable film to watch and again, a dazzling composition.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PHANTOM OF LIBERTY ? Directed by Luis Bunuel 1974 This movie takes a surrealistic look at society and its value system. It was part of a trilogy that began with the film "The Milky Way" which won an Oscar in 1972. Phantom of Liberty uses juxtapositions to convey its story. In one instance a man is portrayed to have given a young girl some inappropriate photos. Bunuel pushes the boundaries of social morals by juxtaposing the parent's reactions of disgust against a photo of something harmless. The possible message here is that vulgarity is entirely subjective. Who is the pervert? The man at the park with the photos or the viewer who assumed they were something else?Bunuel uses logic similar to dreaming. He incorporates the subconscious as a means to make the irrational possible. In another scene a young girl's parents are searching for their daughter who is missing. Later the daughter is obviously right next to them. As the mother is being told her daughter is nowhere to be found the daughter calls out. The mother reminds the daughter of her manners for talking out of turn, and then continues to question about her daughter's disappearance. Desperately the daughter tries to let them know she is there yet she is still invisible to the adults. The absurdity of the situation is clear. The point is that although the parents may see her, the do not "see" her offering any significance in their lives. Bunuel explores the common feeling of being an ignored as a child by visually showing it in an extreme literal reality. The film continues with other absurdities that aren't so ridiculous and are even quite brilliantly portraying the hypocrisy while making the viewer contemplate one's value system. Bunuel puts these stories together with such controlled delivery. His execution was genius.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Phantom of Liberty- Similar to a Dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was an incredibly entertaining, unique and sarcastic film by Bunuel. In this film, Bunuel really captures his interest in the surreal and craziness of dreams. The movie is far from predictable as it is constantly shifting in narrative. Just as the story begins to develop on a specific story or character, it quickly switches over to a new minor character. As soon as a scene reaches its height of interest, the minor character is then developed in a new scene. Every situation we witness is even more outrageous and surreal than the other.A perfect example of the message Bunuel is trying to display takes place in the beginning of the film. A strange looking man, all alone in a park for children calls over two little girls and shows them some pictures. He then tells them they can keep the pictures as long as they do not show them to any adults. As soon as the girl goes home she hands the pictures to her mother casually and tells her that a "nice man" gave them to her. The girl's parents look at the pictures and they are completely disgusted. When we finally get a glimpse, we find out that it was nothing but images of famous landmarks. Bunuel sends us a brilliant message by doing this. As the viewers, we assume that the pictures are inappropriate or sexual, and that the man must have been a pedophile. This is Bunuels way of challenging our assumptions and in fact pointing the finger at us saying, "Who is the one with the dirty mind now?" This movie is filled with ridiculous irrationality, just like our actual dreams, and we completely buy every moment of it. This film makes us forget just for a moment what is to be considered normal, and what is to be considered strange. It makes us question, who makes the rules for our society, and why do we follow them like blind folded sheep?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bunuel is a modern Geoffrey Chaucer. It takes a special kind of person to be able to portray a whole archetype of people in the way that he does. As a member of this 21st century, (particularly a certain sick, sad, and sensitive American society. -It's a small, obscure country; don't fret if you've never heard of it) I deeply appreciate Bunuel's ability to take an unbiased, impartial moral standpoint that satirizes all of the ranging social conflicts that "The Phantom of Liberty" does. As the anti-authoritarian, anarchic, counter-culturistic person I am, Bunuel's notion of abandoning so-called "truth" struck every possible chord in my body. I loathe those who keep to the ebb and flow of their peers; rising with the tide when the sun dawns, then receding when the moon begins his nightly dance. Sorry about that...I also LOVE this filming style. It reminds me of that one "Simpsons" episode where we actually get to experience all of our beloved characters part of their day, instead of the usual immediate family members' problems...This is most apparent when we are inside the hostel the nurse takes shelter in during a rainy evening. Bunuel takes us on a ride through the house where we experience a refreshing outlook on the stigmas of churchmen, then to an interesting case of an incestuous aunt and nephew, and then to a seemingly charming couple who end up being S&amp;M enthusiasts. Anyways...this movie earned the 10 out of the allotted 10 stars possible. NBD</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Abstract Abridgement of Surprises</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Things first started going awry, Luis Bunuel joshes, when Napoleon's troops came to liberate Toledo. In the opening scenes of Bu?uel's truly anarchic comedy, The Phantom of Liberty, the military execute those who would not be liberated. "Down with freedom!" exclaims one of the condemned. It is the bellow of an overpowered society. The French and American revolutions have let freedom ring on a powerless world, and eternally the population will be incapable of depending on the totalitarian assurance of church and state.We meet characters, they face a calamity concerning madness, indiscretion, tragedy, sexual obsession, social idiocy or each said alternative, and then, when the root of the predicament is uncovered as an absurdity, the characters intersect with a fresh lot of characters we then follow. Bu?uel's camera repeatedly enters a scene with one array of characters and departs with another, a method that was used again in Slacker. This brilliant celebration of chance and insignificance has, in some sense, "a beginning, middle, and end." However it also has numerous other films with beginnings, middles, and ends streaming within it, around its sides, and plunging across it. Its heredity in the episodic structure are even more clear-cut than in the intersecting dreams in The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie.A disappearance of a little girl is reported to the police by her parents, despite that the girl is physically present though none of the adults admit to her presence, yet still able to see and speak to her. And the partly Oedipal love of the aunt and nephew at the hotel, the comparable fixation of the police commissioner for his dead sister, the gambling of religious medals by Carmelite monks, the autograph seekers swarming around the convicted (and simultaneously released) mass killer, the massacre at the city zoo?a handful of The Phantom of Liberty's nonstop, deadpan absurdities?designate how willingly the human animal preserves an existence completely opposite from its principles over and above its greatly publicized capacity for reason.It'd be outrageous to recount the "plot" of The Phantom of Liberty, because the film's an abstract abridgement of surprises. You find yourself strongly wondering what'll come next. If I tried to explain them, Bu?uel's intermingling but disjointed narratives would seem incomprehensible. Nevertheless his film is oddly eloquent; it has the delicate authenticity of a dream. Bu?uel seems to incorporate an impression of shamefaced sadomasochism in his films. His characters are often grown-ups trying to be mischievous children. His fixations are staged with such fastidious timing, with such a guffaw in spite of decency, that we must laugh.The most remarkable thing about the movie is the way Bu?uel pilots us fluently from one madcap fable to the next. We should be winded but we aren't since his editing makes everything appear to ensue with inexorable reason. Naturally it doesn't, though that's liberty's burden: If people want freedom, they shouldn't be required to trust in anything. The Phantom of Liberty is a masterpiece, a victory by a filmmaker defying virtually hopeless barriers and inconsistencies and acing them. It's extremely witty, yes, though keep in mind: With Bu?uel, you only double up when it stings.Bu?uel sensed a rational senselessness at work in human dealings. Life has no morals, and the sorts we contrive for ourselves is totally subjective. Bu?uel, moreover, never lost touch with the predominance of unconscious instincts. He was, basically, a satirist of human foolishness. At the conclusion of his life, Bu?uel had accomplished such grace in his filmmaking that he could take his ingenious pastiche on any trajectory that dawned on him, along the course of last night's dreams, visions from youth, signs of impending doom, or anywhere he cared to. It might be the frankest portrait I've ever seen of the search for truth and the simultaneous need to reject it once you've grasped it.</fullReview>

What an incredible feat. I am certainly glad that there aren't too many Bunuels out there. I don't know how often I could watch films like "The Phantom of Liberty" before it got old and uninteresting, but I'm glad that there was someone out there to accomplish what Bunuel did.

The phantom? A phantom can be sensed but it has no existence. Bunuel is trying to send us a message through his film with a surrealistic touch that the idea of freedom that we think we have does not really exist. Bunuel's film goes against symmetry and he demonstrate it to us very well through this film. Everything is the opposite of what society wants us to be like. Bunuel creates these surrealistic films to raise eyebrows and for us to ask certain questions. The film was silly, shocking, entertaining and I had a great time watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bunuel is one of my favorite film makers! He is wonderful at making you think of things that seem like everyday habits. He is brilliant in this movie, it has all his normal obsessions as a film maker-necrophilia, sexuality, religion, and the question of freedom. Freedom is honestly a funny subject. Most people in the US would say that they have "freedom". But if they were to look at it under a microscope, and pick it apart, and look at it again they would realize that they really don't have freedom. Because in reality they live under a lot of social and moral rules, that restricts freedom to its very core. This movie, is surrealism down to its very core. Everything is presented in a very realistic way that could quite possibly happen in life, if someone were willing to stand the scrutiny of the greater population. This movie is definitely not normal, it is really a bunch of shorts put together, each transition is just a character followed to another scene and can at times seem confusing; because its right when that short climax's and you are about to find out, and then it switches and you are on to the next one. Most people would probably find this frustrating and rather irritating, but its exactly the point. You don't need a climax, just a point that gets across to the audience that makes us think about it. You can not watch Bunuels' films and think about them logically, his films are made of the logic of dreams. In their own insane way, they make perfect sense. But if you try to analyze it and pick it apart, you will realized that there is nothing that makes sense and as if it almost disintegrates because you are not suppose to analyze it logically. There is a crazy scene where a man goes to sleep and all these crazy things start coming into the bed room, and he looks at the clock and it appears a few hours have gone by. But in reality it is continuous time because there were no edits in that scene, it was shot as one continuous scene. Cinematic time doesn't have to follow real time, and in most films it does not. But when it does, it is for a reason. This movie is a good example of where the directors names start to become adjectives, because the director follows the same theme in their own movies, to the point where they are recognizable and distinguishable, almost expected.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Luis Bunuel's The Phantom of Liberty is quite a hilarious surrealist film. Bunuel does an awesome job putting together episodes, in which each of them have such unique story lines to them. The most interesting scene to me would definitely have to be the relationship between the aunt and the nephew. Boy, do we get a shock here. Another quite shocking scene that we encounter right after the nephew scene is the scene in which the nephew enters a couple's room. As it turns out, the couple is a little bit on the wild side. We see the woman enter the restroom tidying up her exotic outfit, as her partner goes in right after her, releasing to the audience his bottomless trousers. While the guests are in the other room, the couple enters and the woman takes out a whip and whips her partner. Can we guess where? (Bottomless trousers?) We all get the point. If anybody wants to get a quick laugh, watch Bunuel and his cast pull off an amazing performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bunuel is amazing the idea that all of this could be real is awesome. This movie is what i would call out there. he comes up with the most twisted ideas and yet if you think about it isn't so twisted it makes perfect sense. Everything you see in this film, could possibly happen or is happening somewhere somehow. This film is brilliantly made and has great stories and the transition from one story to the next is fantastic. This film will really make you think about the idea of freedom and what you would do if you had all that freedom. At one point or another we have thought of something so bazaar and placed it realistically in our minds, we keep it in our minds of coarse, but not Bunuel, he has mixed up reality and come out with an alternate reality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a great film. Contradiction is the king and nothing is what it seems. Yet, if we analyze the reality of life The Phantom of Liberty does not seem so crazy. I will not describe what happens in the film because you need to see for yourself, but I would like to say why I like it. I love surrealism and Bunuel is the king of surrealism. He would put things together, twist them, run them through a wash machine and come out with elements that one might think would never work together, yet they make perfect sense. He would analyze ones desires, urges, thoughts, social behavior, and when we go deep to ourselves, we discover that, yes, we do have thoughts similar to what we see in his film but, most of us, we keep them to ourselves because we are afraid to voice them loud out. We are afraid that others will perceive us as crazy. Well, not Bunuel, he is not afraid of anything. He wants to go deep, and why not. Perhaps the world would be a better place if we followed Bunuel? or at list we can watch his film and forget our own life for the duration of his film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Are you sick of symmetry?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Le fantôme de la liberté is truly a unique film. That, of course, is one of Bu?uel's many gifts to the development of film grammar. Because of his innovations, he has often been copied. However, a copy is rarely, if ever, as striking as the original. In this film, he plays with more boundaries and tests our perceptions and assumptions about what is and is not proper, including the way stories are told. By linking many different scenes, characters, and short episodes together in different ways, he pokes fun at our traditions, culture, and taboos. He weaves situations together through dream-logic. Sometimes one story will be within another, and other times a character from one story meets one from another, and the camera abandons the previous story for the next. There is, to be sure, a larger story and message presented. For example, the first episode shows an execution in 1808, and the last shows a present-day riot where people are shot. There is a question being asked by comparing these two episodes. How much progress have we made over the centuries? Beyond the important points being made in this film, it is highly entertaining, funny, and aesthetic. Part of what is amusing about it is that I found myself laughing at myself after expecting something specific and finding that I was making assumptions based on my stereotypical thinking. Also, the way he strips characters down, making them all too human, is hilarious. One example of this is the scene in which the monks are gambling, smoking, and drinking. This also points out the hypocrisy of religion. I recommend this film to everyone because in it Bu?uel and Carri?re break up the routine film formula and simultaneously entertain the audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How sick you are of conventionalism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I'm sick of Symmetry" a character says in this film, and here we have one of the last works of Luis Bunuel's surrealistic fantasies that brings a story after another with a never ending that mocks the ignorance in which societies live in; It's just amazing how Bunuel exposures the conventionalism to which we are so accustomed and makes of any place a more decadent and irrational angle of the world. Comedy is just the perfect condiment that guides you and distracts you through a series of events that never have sense for the first time. Bunuel's humor is always taken to the profane as many judge, but indeed is just another evidence of how reality often times makes us uncomfortable even in our own privacy. A must see film without a doubt, it mirrors your emotions, it drives you mad, drives you sad, and challenges your morality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Phantom of Liberty challenges our notion of civilized society. Luis Bunuel gives us a series of connected yet individual little movies in one that asks questions like "why not?" or "says who?". He pokes at the little taboos we have, all the formal walls we have put up. Bunuel asks the question of why do we follow traditional social norms when we aren't even sure why they were created? Why can't a man wear butt-less chaps and have his wife whip him in front of complete strangers? Why can't we get some friends together and all defecate around a table? Why can't we love and lust after our elder aunt? Can you give a reason other than saying "because it crazy, weird, disgusting"? Those are all responses to social norms being broken, but their not real answers. This movie takes those ideas and other just as crazy, weird, and disgusting and asks "so?". He takes social norms like the social formalities, sexual taboos, religious authority, and the western justice system and turns them upside-down, just to see what happens. He even plays to audiences expectations and ideas of right and wrong. He makes us all think about our own judgments about aspects of our own life. The result is funny, confusing, and thought provoking; but over all it's crazy, weird, and disgusting. Just the way Bunuel would have wanted it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As part of our human psychology, many of us long for spontaneity and adventure in our lives. In Luis Bunuel's "Phantom of Liberty" we are awarded just that. As this film is meticulously arranged in a series of episodes, we meet a diversity of characters with no real relation to one another and are linked by chance. These scenarios are enriched with magical realism as they explore the taboos of society and are filled with dark humor. Among the variety of scenarios, one which remains the most memorable to me is the incessant of the young boy and his aunt. This scene clearly depicts the influence of our society and just how much it governs our principles of right and wrong. In America, our society has made us comfortable with the idea, and has even traveled lengths to glamorize the event of an older man with a young women i.e. Hugh Hefner and his playmates. However, when we were presented with the scene of a young man with an older woman, I noticed many of my classmates; including myself, cringe at the portrayal. In terms of incest, we also highly discourage this act, but in many cultures this is perfectly normal and acceptable in their society. Scenes like these encourage one to keep an open mind and resort from passing judgment. It is important to make our own value judgments based on what we believe rather than being governed by the norms of society. After all who is to say what is "normal" or right from wrong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So surreal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bunuel pokes fun at human society by bring up traditions and conditions of modern day life that are taken for granted as truth. This is seen in the various tableaux through out the move, 'Phantom of Liberty' or 'Spectator of Liberty'.For example, when the nurse is driving along the road to see her sick father, she is stopped by the military. They ask her if she has seen any foxes on the road. She tells them no. Next they ask her if she has seen any foxes crossing the road. She say she did not see a thing. Then the soldier tells the other soldier that there were indeed foxes because, "I had first hand information sir. Maybe it's the storm." As idiotic as this may seem, military wasting their time and money on looking for something that is not there, it is not far from truth in the real world. How much time and money did Bush spend looking for, "Weapons of mass destruction," under Saddam Hussein? In the end of the investigation nothing was found.Bunuel goes on to mock our culture and taboos when the professor attends a respectable dinner party. All seems normal until the party sits on toilets, instead of chairs, at the table. Later he goes to the bathroom alone for a meal. The professor even goes as far to say that he had to cut his trip in Spain short because, "Madrid was filed with the stench of-pardon my language-food. It was indecent." Bunuel points out the strict guide lines that we adhere to in regard to taking in energy, or nutrients and excreting waste, which are both natural bodily functions. Although this scenario may seem far fetched, one begins to question the necessity of our customs and how ridiculous they may be at times.In the scene of the sniper, it is shown how killers become famous and are set free. He is dubbed the, "Poetic Killer," by the press and has a big court hearing where he is sentenced to death. Some how he is set free to enter the general public again, signing his autograph as he exits the building, because he is now famous. This has been seen in the news. Sometimes criminals that commit heinous crimes somehow are set free and kill again.Overall, Bunuel does a incredible job of representing society's morals and cultural taboos through the actions of fictitious characters that serve as humorous symbols of our life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life's Strange Encounters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Phantom of Liberty, a French film, captures surreal images and situations with a sense of humor. In 1974, Luis Bunuelin directed this film that contains several encounters that happen amongst people by pure chance. These encounters are bizarre because they usually do not happen in real life but could possibly happen if the right circumstances were to occur. The film has no real narrative structure as it jumps from one scene to the next. Bunuel is an amazing director as he takes the audience through a dreamlike world that is so out of the ordinary. The scenes are not only funny and odd but are very clever and well structured. The acting has a powerful authentic feel, which is in stark contrast to the glamorized Hollywood acting that we are used to seeing in American films. Bunuel truly did create a world beyond the viewers' imagination.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Phantom of Liberty" is an incredibly hilarious piece that implements several tableaux to pose serious questions and makes the audience re-assess taboos. Luis Bunuel is a master of his craft, keeps the audience on their toes, and engages his viewers throughout the film.Throughout the film the audience receives a sense of Bunuel's anti-clericalism. Right away, the Eucharist is eaten as a snack, and monks are playing poker and putting their hands on a woman. From a Catholic standpoint, the movie is tough. Even after removing religion from the equation, the scenes are complete sight-gags that will make the viewer think twice and cringe.Next, Bunuel introduces us to a young man and the man's older aunt. Traditional western society does not respect a man who is in a relationship with an older woman, so it is very challenging to watch an adolescent with a MUCH older woman, and also a family member. For the audience's sake, Bunuel portrays a much younger woman's body when the nephew rips the sheet out from his aunt's clutched fingers. The question is what makes the audience cringe more: the older/younger dynamic or because they're related? Bunuel takes potty humor to the next level when the audience see the sequence of the instructor with his family squatting on toilet seats around the table. Then, the audience views the dining sequence when the man eats in private. Again, Bunuel is constantly questioning his audience and taboos and asks the audience why we cringe at the thought of going to the bathroom in public. The movie thoroughly investigates the nature of man and its part of the reason why its so funny.The scene that sticks out the most is when the little girl is declared absent from class when she is undeniably present. The police officer even questions her when he's writing down her description for goodness sake! This scene is the epitome of Bunuel's humor. It is very topical and not hard to grasp, yet it pokes the audience to relate the scene to their lives. How many kids are overlooked within schools/their own families when they're standing right before us? Obviously Bunuel drags the question to an unrealistic level, but it definitely begs the question.This movie is a must see!</fullReview>

Bunuel reflects on the moral conceptions of the middle class without taking things too seriously. Out of all the directors who've played around with Surrealism, Bunuel is the best at making his movies feel like an actual dream with enough reality to keep you guessing of what will happen next.If you are looking for intelligent entertainment that challenges Hollywood's typical storyline you won't be let down.

		<shortDescription>Truly Surreal and Irrationally Rational</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was Luis Bunuel's final and most personal work, which he completed while he was in his 70's. Bunuel was always interested in the surreal and dreams, "Phantom of Liberty" especially. The movie constantly shifts in narrative, beginning to develop some story or character and suddenly switching to another minor character as the scene peaks in interest; the minor character is then developed in a new scene. Each situation is more ridiculous and surreal than the one before it. One of the early scenes in the movie is a creepy looking man in a park who shows some pictures to little girls and tells them not to show any adults. When the girl's parents find the pictures they are disgusted to find images of famous landmarks. It challenges our assumptions in a brilliant way; the viewer assumes that the pictures are inappropriate and sexual in nature and that the man in the trench coat at the park is a pedophile, when in reality the pictures are of buildings and landmarks. My favorite is the "dinner scene" where people sit defecating together at a table and individually excuse themselves to privately eat in a little "bathroom." When a little girl at the table tells her mom that she is hungry, her mom warns her not to talk like that at the table.The movie is filled with the sort of irrationality that is completely rational. It's strange, twisted dream logic that shouldn't make sense, yet it does (like the little girl who is simultaneously lost and sitting right next to her parents, who politely ignore her while worrying about the whereabouts of their daughter). And yet to Bunuel, these things are completely real; dreams and fantasies are a part of our individual realities, so why shouldn't they be portrayed in movies? This movie is a lot of fun and is a truly surreal experience.</fullReview>

How surrealistic!!" Fantôme de la liberté IS NOT one of those films.It is a taut piece of work where every set up, every punch-line, every reveal is precise and calculated. Every storyline weaves into each other seamlessly, and though each of these characters could take up a full film themselves, their individual story lines feel resolved and complete. Luis Bu?uel has precisely constructed a work that preys on our society's monotony, while at the same time pointing out the insanity that lies within all of us.What moved me the most was how, after basically watching movies since I was born, I realized just how programmed I was to the standard structure of film narrative that each transition by Bu?uel struck even more drastically than the last.Some would say that you should watch the movie being open for anything; I disagree. I say, watch the movie with every notion and every expectation that you bring to any movie you see; it only makes the movie that much more meaningful.</fullReview>

With a series of rather poignant episodes drawing from a sniper killing dozens of people to a search for a girl with her constantly present, it continues to take constant sideways turns and always delivers the unexpected. In addition, it does a terrific job on questioning social etiquette with one memorable episode containing a dinner table where people sit on toilets, then later eat in complete isolation and privacy.On top of all this it is infused with very cleverly placed comedic lines that, adding to the effect, are completely and utterly at home in this movie.

		<fullReview>Bunuel's "Phantom of Liberty" is absurd. Everything about it makes me scratch my head and think "what the hell?". But, this is precisely what Bunuel wants. He is the master of surrealism, and Phantom of Liberty proves it.The main idea I took from this movie is that reality itself is absurd. Everything we accept in our day to day life is just as ridiculous as the scene where an emu walks into a couple's bedroom. I'm reminded of the concept of the butterfly effect, where the flapping of a butterfly wing may cause a hurricane somewhere else in the world. Bunuel shows ( such as the scene where people defecate in public at a dinner table but eat in private ) that if just one thing in a culture had gone differently, the unreal would become the norm. If you think long enough about any cultural norm, you begin to wonder "who the hell came up with that? ". My favorite scene in the film is where a professor stands in front of a class of french police officers. These officers engage in immature pranks and taunt their professor. As I watched it, I began to think "is this much different from what police officers actually do?". I can easily imagine many cops joining the force not because of some moral duty to society, but just so they can continue to play cops and robbers into their adulthood. Bunuel forces us to look at the institution of law and question if it actually works. Police brutality perhaps is nothing more than a school bully enacting his cruelty on the weaker kids at the playground. However, I'm certain most of us would rather have our personal security in the hands of a bully than say the little glasses wearing kid who has asthma... but is it really that much better?Bunuel's Phantom of Liberty shows us that our reality is just as crazy as Bunuel's surrealist ideas.</fullReview>

The integration of unexpected shifts ? sometimes cinematic, and self-described as "surreal" are the foundation for films that matter to me. It is just that I feel his concerns are trivial, that the focus on a critique of society with the critique being as flawed, as superficial.There is one quality of this film in particular that I would like to recommend: the seamless continuity across many episodes and characters. I don't know if it originated with him, but it is now widely used to escape the constraints of a single character and give us larger long form.It allows humor and puzzlement to be spread as comment.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was I.B.Singer who said "Of course I believe in freedom and free will. I have to believe in them. I have no choice." No doubt Bunuel was predestined to make this pointless film about Liberty. It consists of a daisy chain of disconnected, or tenuously connected, episodes that merge into each other in an accidental and meaningless manner. The popular American word is "segue", a musical word, often linked with "seamlessly". I can't remember hearing any music in this film, however. Was there any ? Its only logic is its illogicality, which gets tiresome, if you think about it. It isn't necessary to think about it though, as each episode is fairly interesting on its own, and you wonder what he'll dream up next. The net result, unfortunately, is a feeling of vacuity. The ultimate sensation is one of dissatisfaction.Senselessness is the aesthetic blight of the last century, ever since Duchamp presented us with his fountain in 1917, voted the most significant work of art of the last 100 years. Some people see The Phantom of Liberty as the ultimate motion picture. The bird at the end is not an ostrich: it's a rhea.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***User-reviewer Claudio Carvalho ("A Delicious Surrealistic Satire to the Moral and Costumes of the Society, to the Family and to the Church", Claudio Carvalho from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 5 May 2005) has interesting comments. Also, Hasosch ("The Dissolution of Form and Function", hasosch from United States, 19 July 2007) takes a stab at interpreting it.***"Phantom Liberty (1974, Luis Bu?uel)," a surreal comment on the ruling class, is a curious, occasionally very disturbing work arranged with quality. Seemingly a nearly random series of absurd and/or awkward moments, it makes much more sense when one does not seek a linear narrative. Some cinema scholars have noted the connections it makes with the work of Italy's Pier Paolo Pasolini, who was at the time a contemporary of Bu?uel's in film surrealism. (Bu?uel has a character named Doctor Pasolini. Unfortunately for art house cinema fans, the highly provocative Pasolini was tragically murdered in 1975.) "Phantom Liberty" contains some ideas which can be enjoyed by many people. One of the most popular moments is when concerned parents seek help from French authorities for their missing daughter, while she is sitting nearby (and the adults all interact with her). Also, a poet-turned-sniper, initially witnessed inside a tower committing a horrific massacre of unsuspecting, random adults at street level, is subsequently tried in a formal court of law. Once the sentence of death has been delivered with stern finality by the judge, the poet-sniper is promptly freed, congratulated and treated like a major celebrity.There are also scenes that are consciously disturbing. We open with French troops executing Spanish civilians in 1808. (One of the victims is Bu?uel.) Later, a young nephew seeks to fulfill his sexual urges with his considerably older, virginal Aunt. There is also the justifiably famous scene where a ruling class family meet at a large table not to dine, but to sit on and use toilets. The actors play this singularly bizarre moment straight, as if they were appearing in a mainstream movie. Some religious people will also likely find offensive the way a group of middle-aged monks relax in the evening. First, they meet to pray with an attractive woman (of the same age) in her bedroom. Later, the monks and the woman are observed playing poker like card sharks, smoking like chimneys and calling some cards "virgins." The partying monks will conclude their evening by witnessing an S &amp; M session.Speaking of the latter, Italian siren Adriana Asti appears in two especially erotic scenes. We see her early on as a stunning, head- turning dominatrix. Later, she is a pianist performing a Brahms piano concerto liberated from the confines of all her clothing. (Warning: Please don't drive or operate heavy machinery while watching Asti seemingly tickling the ivories in her birthday suit.) Bu?uel uses the naked pianist at the right time to keep the viewer interested. If one wishes to make sense of the chaotic narrative, try applying the visuals of a scene with the dialogue of the scene that follows. Doing so takes some effort, but the payoff is uncovering Bu?uel's true nature, which is far more conservative than he is generally perceived.At the film's conclusion, the French police commissioner--played by two actors simultaneously?is considering a brutal military assault on the general public watching animals at the local zoo. Throughout, Bu?uel seems to be drawing comparisons between the ruling class and the animals in captivity. This idea lends some explanation for the family on toilets scene and the other scatological moments. Bu?uel is narrowing the gap between humans and animals in defiance of the behavioral norms that most people associate with an evolved species. While not for everyone, "Phantom Liberty" should be seen by cinephiles who understand surrealism often comments on life more directly than traditional narratives do. While it seems perfectly mad to many, Bu?uel's effort here is just as not much more insane than the news horror story we are being exposed to daily.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Indian View</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this film long back, at first I found it funny, experimental and surrealist. After such a long period I am writing a review for this film because something I found funny in film is a reality in Indian Culture. Especially the scene at dining table where all guests are sitting on the toilet and having a discussion whereas when a guest is hungry he goes to a secluded chamber. I found it funny, especially the first part. In India, people go together for emptying their bowls early in the morning, they chat together while sitting for latrine which is a communal thing. No one is ashamed of whereas 'Eating' is also a communal habit; dining together and going out for latrine is a culture still existing in India. It is not a taboo. But slowly due to awareness in public that one should not sit outside in open for latrine, so people are becoming aware and this practice is fading away. The government is taking initiative to build common toilets in villages. Over all the movie symbolizes many things which might be a practice in other part of the world. But in the current society when the film was made by Luis Bunuel, he might be braking a social &amp; cultural tradition in his own country.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're not familiar with surrealism, this is a must watch as its 100% concentrated surrealism will keep you entertained and confused throughout the entire movie.This was my first Bunuel movie so I didn't know what I was expecting but certainly not this. The movie was organized in episodes or tableaux's. Every episode continues after one another and contain their own essence and message. They question the concept of reality. what is reality? is it what you make of it? how was it establish? who made the rules? My favorite tableaux has to be the scene where the family switched the role of the bathroom and dining room. It completely took me off guard, I was pleasantly surprised. And that's when I truly understood surrealism. To me, that scene was the definition in surrealism. why do we do the things the way we do?This is was a brilliant movie and I will surely watch every one of sir Bunuel's movies. This was my gateway to surrealism. Hopefully, it's yours too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unless you're already a Bunuel fan, it's pretty much guaranteed that you have never seen a film like this before. A series of vignettes loosely connected by re-appearing characters, The Phantom of Liberty upends your expectations ? or confirms your most cynical fears ? in a constantly evolving, surprising way. This isn't a serious movie, exactly, but it addresses serious issues: taboos about sex and proper social behavior; individual freedom and the needs of the community; corruption and authority.It is tempting to describe some of my favorite scenes, but The Phantom of Liberty is best seen without expectations. Suffice to say that Bunuel is a master filmmaker, very much at home in the Surrealist genre, and if you choose to pop this film into your DVD player you will have a very interesting evening. Won the Top Foreign Film award from the National Board of Review in 1974; no doubt it was far too peculiar for Oscar consideration.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review for The Phantom of Liberty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was no joke. Literally. I was completely lost the first time i had seen it. Before i was the kind of film lover who would just see film simply just to enjoy and didn't expect to really get anything out of it, may be educationally but surely not this level of intellectual outcome. The Phantom of Liberty, after explained and discussed in class by an excellent professor, i came to appreciate this film, and understand what it was trying to convey. I got so much out of this film. It had helped me to see a different side of the situation and be curious about things, the world and the people around me and to ask the what if question. I also like that it show the idea that life is full of random chances that we might encounter one day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>definite head-scratcher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first viewing, this is a movie that will be difficult to understand. Luis Bunuel's surrealist masterpiece is by no means an easy film to digest for Western audiences. It is seemingly disjointed, schizophrenic and unclear, but do not let that prevent you from viewing it. It will leave you thinking, if not anything else.In a series of stories that appear to have nothing to do with each other, we are being taken on a tale that is attempting to prove to the audience what happens when society has unrestricted freedom. The film in itself is a treatise on this type of freedom ? the way it is filmed and constructed is meant to be without conventional restraints. In that sense, it is a definitive work of meta-fiction. Every scene in this story is meant to challenge conventional thinking and what we perceive to be societal norms. Bunuel, with each scene and character, is challenging the form of story in film itself. Where one scene and character(s) start and seemingly end with no clear conclusion, another ones starts by the actions of a character and carries over into an entirely different scene and set of circumstance. It's like a mix of Inception, which I won't claim to understand, and films like Crash and Babel ? where stories and characters all interact with each other. What makes Phantom of Liberty so unique is that there is no standard ending. The characters we see don't always have finite conclusions to their stories. Often times, they just go off-screen and never appear again. But their message and the social commentary/implications of the scene and character has already been made. There is no need to connect to the characters to figure out the intentions/meaning or to be spurred to dig deeper about the implications of the random stories ? Bunuel makes more of a commentary on society in a 15 minute scene with five random characters thrown together in a seemingly absurd situation than some directors do in their entire careers over multiple films. Not everyone will understand it, or get it, or appreciate it, but it is the undisputed masterpiece of the surrealistic genre. I personally give this film a 6 or 7 when it comes to entertainment value, but it is near perfect in its innovation and style.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great mind opening experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To begin, I had the opportunity to watch this movie as a student in a foreign film studies class. The professor literally spoke nothing of this film and just said to watch. Then the roller coaster I rode was amazing. Every scene just kept slapping me in different directions putting me in a state of exciting confusion. I understood nothing during my first watch. There was an ending scene where the director gave the audience just an ostrich looking towards the distance while gunshots rang in the background. We had a weekend gap before the professor gave us some context in the movie but that whole weekend just had me thinking. Wondering daily what the movie meant to the point where I lectured all my friends on it looking for something, a window of clarity. Then the day came and then he explained the movies point, to open the audience to the ideas that complete freedom can be dangerous and that you shouldn't take everything at face value, in a sense, question everything. This started a domino effect on the past memories of my life. In particular one English teacher that I had for three years in high school. His teaching methods were very different. He would break random pointing sticks and toss markers at the board, as well as slapping on random desk through out the class period. This caused me to just disregard him as crazy. When I saw this movie a second time it literally just brought me back to the class, and it answered the questions I never knew I had. This professor showed us a story that explained Plato's allegory of the cave. To those who aren't familiar with it, in summary, prisoners are chained up in a cave facing a wall for their entire lives. Behind them is a torch that reflected the shadows of those who passed by and for them, all they knew were the sounds of commotion and the images of the shadows. They knew nothing more. One day, a prisoner manages to escape the cave and witnesses the world. Sees buildings and people and society. To him its something amazing and never ever before seen. The only problem is when he comes back to tell the other prisoners but they just see him as crazy. Talking about things that to them seems impossible. This movie did that to me. It helped me escape my cave. After I saw this movie I began to see things differently and approach my decisions in life with more confidence because really, things aren't as big or as hard as our minds have been hardwired to believe they are. This movie made me feel free by the end of it. Made my doubts that I had in high school seem okay. It even inspired me to write some new stories to maybe make films about one day based on the ideas I had that society would see as just a teenager being a teenager. I am really proud to be human with ideas and just view points, and now I just flip things and look at them in different perspectives. I feel this movie exemplifies what it means to be an artist. Showing the world in ways that are not always the norm, which to me is a great from of expression. This movie has greatly opened my mind and I recommend it to any one in confusing times in their life. I really wish I had seen this movie earlier because it really just gave my weird teenage years of doubt purpose and meaning. I finally feel okay to be myself and express my art in the way I choose. In my acting and filming I am not afraid of my opinions anymore, and Im not afraid to break the rules in the art world. I am finally out of the cave.. and loving every minute of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bu?uel's surrealist comedy masterpiece pairs dream-logic with unconventional story-telling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching The Phantom of Liberty is unlike any other film-watching experience. Bu?uel presents a series of seemingly unrelated vignettes woven together by mere chance or coincidence. Just as Bu?uel develops a character beyond their name or title, he whisks the viewer away to focus on another character and their experience. The film not only employs dream-logic through its surrealist mise en scéne, the film also has the pacing of a dream. Like the series of half- remembered dreams we have each night, each vignette leaves a vague impression of itself after its viewing; not to be consciously understood, yet its presence can be felt with each following scene. While there are core thematic ideas woven throughout the film regarding political and social satire, on first viewing it is hard not to get lost in the dreamy surreality of real-life that Bu?uel so eloquently portrays in his 1974 masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Phantom of Liberty is an unusual film one that does not really "fit in" with the rest of the crowd, but that is what makes it brilliant. This Film was certainly mind boggling as I found it interesting on how Luis Bu?uel formed a smooth link from one scene to the next. The way the film was laid out was not the only unusual thing about it, but also the way each scene was portrayed everything you would see was out of the ordinary . I sat there thinking to myself , "what is going on here?" it was as if this was filmed in a parallel universe were people lived by different rules we are not accustomed to. From having the dead calling the living, the use of the bathroom was a dining table experience shared with others, and where being sentenced to death would result in in freedom and fame. Sure the scenes certainly sound unbelievable somehow that is where Bu?uel worked his magic. As he not only allowed me to flow easily from scene to scene, but also in a way took me away from reality stopped me from asking all these questions , and just allowed me to accept what was going on and go with it . It gave me a view of possible "why not" situations in life that one can imagine . I really enjoyed this film and I'm looking forward to finding others like it in the near future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review of Phantom of Liberty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The tableaux of the serial killing poet is incredibly disturbing, especially in the times that we live in today where mass shootings have become a bi-weekly ordeal. The serial killer has absolute power to use his sniper rifle and shoot whoever he pleases in the unsuspecting community below. Bunuel seems to be using him as a metaphor for questioning the inevitability of human nature. Yes, we all want freedom. However, too much freedom might lead us to the same path of corruption, power struggle and oppression. Without some sort of set of rules, morals, and ethics, what kind of human being would emerge? Are we sure that we are inherently good? Where would 'absolute freedom' lead us to, as an individual and a society? These questions reveal a terrifying answer for me. I thought about what the world would be like if there were no consequences. That is what we mean by absolute freedom, right? We are free to do as we please with no restrictions from another individual or group. There are no laws or institutions telling me what is legal and illegal, what will be shown on my credit report, or what I have to inform my prospective employer. If there were no consequences, what would my actions be? Are my actions because in result of social conventions and legalities or because of my own inherent ethical and moral code? If I were absolutely free, would I be the dutiful citizen briskly crossing the street inside the lines of a crosswalk to get to work on time or would I be the rebellious poet taking advantage of my freedom and doing as I please? Am I compliant out of fear of consequence (legally and socially) or are my choices organic and thus meaning I am inherently good? The answer is impossible to know. I cannot imagine a world without social conventions, rules, expectations, consequences, and morality. I would like to think of myself as a good person, but I also know there have been plenty of times when I have wanted to cheat the system, and would do so if I wouldn't get caught (getting out of jury duty for example). The latter is troublesome for me. If the inclination is there, what makes me think it is not possible for me to end up just like the serial killer if there was such a world of 'Absolute Freedom'? In several tableaux, I found judgment and/or objectivity to be a common theme. I often watch a film with too many pretenses or form opinions before I ever know the context. It is a quality I am not proud of and am working on improving. However, with 'Phantom of Liberty', Bunuel refuses the viewer the opportunity to judge. He forces you to have an open mind and thus accept the world he has created.He does this in many ways. For one, the way he tells the story is, at first, very jarring, perplexing, and borderline frustrating. We are accustomed to following a protagonist and/or an antagonist with whom we as an audience are allotted an entire hour and a half to critique, over-analyze, and connect or disconnect with. Yet Bunuel gives us exactly the opposite. Each tableaux brings a fresh new group of characters and setting in which we have no previous relationship with. We are not allowed to create relationships with these characters - there is no time to! Thus, we are forced to watch objectively and with this objectivity we can interpret Bunuel's message.The surrealistic elements he ads to scenes seemed to be another effort to force me to open my eyes and see outside the box. For example, the husband who we assume is dreaming about an ostrich in his room, only later to realize it is real. In the hotel, the monks playing poker, the Spanish couple dancing, and the businessman in ass-less chaps. Once I accepted these plausibilities, I was free to explore what Bunuel was trying to say.Bunuel even dedicates an entire tableaux to the idea of judgment with the scene of the dinner party in which the family defecates at the table and eats in the bathroom. Had Bunuel not already established in the previous stories that he was taking me for a ride and I have to think outside of what I am used to, I would have missed the entire point. I would have assumed this scene at face value was simply a parody. Luckily, Bunuel had well-equipped me for this scene (I was already watching objectively) and I was ready to accept it and find its deeper meaning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film filled with twists on the norm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Phantom of Liberty is one of the most "different" movies I have ever seen in a while. It is definitely not one of those movies that are linear and have one main story line. There are more than ten different stories going on, some relating to each other, in which I found each have some kind of quality that would express the opposite of what we would be social norms or normal at all. An example would be a scene in which a family is sitting together at the dining room table, each of them sitting on a toilet seat. Instead of eating at the dinner table, the social norm seems to be to release your bowels and to excuse yourself to the restroom when you are hungry. I feel that Luis Bu?uel was trying to question social norms and make the point that what is the difference really between eating and releasing your bowels when they are both just a process of your body getting energy through food. The movie seems to continue to question social norms with a fascinating twist to each story that is told in the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Welcome to the topsy-turvy world of Luis Bu?uel! In the video introduction to The Phantom of Liberty, screenwriter Jean-Claude Carri?re noted that he and Director Luis Bu?uel set out with the premise of presenting the audience with a series of stories (tableaux) and then, just as each story gets interesting, ending the story, and moving on to another story. Such a premise for a movie could be a disaster but under the masterful direction and writing of Bu?uel and Carri?re, the end result is brilliant.More than just turning traditional story telling on its head and making us examine our expectations of storytelling, the filmmaker turns social mores, customs and taboos on their head and make us examine our expectations of such societal constructs.The tableaux flows easily from one to another and never appear disjointed, leaving us free to become immersed in Bunuel's whimsical, farcical, touching, and provocative topsy-turvy world.</fullReview>

As uncomfortable as you might feel and as strange as it all may seem, Bu?uel puts you in that position for a reason. Why is it wrong for a nephew to love his much older aunt? Why is this man being treated like a celebrity and given freedom when he has gun down innocents? Why was the head of the police losing his mind and why was he still allowed to make decisions?

I then began to analyze why I thought it was "gross" and then realized that there's a double standard there. Also in that world it's probably perfectly acceptable for an older women to be with a younger man but it's probably quite disgusting for an older man to be with a younger women.

		<shortDescription>Phantom of freedom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine a world where all the rules of social conduct were flip flopped and then thrown out the window. A world in which murderers are hailed as celebrities. A world where age is nothing but a number and 'aunt' is nothing but a title. One in which it's perceivable to be woken up by an ostrich and to have your mailman deliver your mail straight to your bed. A world in which monks drink alcohol and police officers behave like school children. A world in which parents act as if their children are invisible and people sit around a table to talk about defecation. Is this starting to sound familiar? Luis Bunuel gives us a peek at what absolute freedom looks like and it is incredibly too similar to our own world. Killers become household names and movies are made about their lives while their innocent victims remain nameless and faceless. Hugh Hefner is an idol to men all over the world because he is constantly surrounded by women young enough to be his great grandchildren. Incest is all too common in many countries around the world, something the professor at the police academy tried to explain. Sexual taboos are so prevalent that there are entire websites and organizations dedicated to them. Religious figures breaking boundaries are not something unheard of, neither is the concept of police officers acting childish and petty. Also, parents have been ignoring their children since the beginning of time. A phantom of liberty provides a little window for all to look through and see what absolute freedom looks like and its repercussions. It explores taboos and subjects that people are generally uncomfortable about. It addresses concepts and actions that one culture may praise while another may call barbaric. Because of Bunuel's background and what was going on in Spain at the time, he became obsessed with the concept of freedom. That's why freedom is such a prevalent theme in this movie. This movie really makes you take a good look at the world around you. It's a visual form of satire.</fullReview>

It really made me feel that I was leaving it while it was been played, but also it goes beyond reality because in the scenes what the characters where doing was something unexpected, weird, not normal, or perhaps disrespectful if someone sees it that way. Moreover, we're not used to lived that way. We see the world differently and we manage personal y private things differently. In fact what really catch my attention was the scene where they all sit together to "eat". It wasn't really like that, it was the opposite, they suppose to eat instead of doing their needs. That really make laugh in a way because I can't imagine myself doing that. In other hand, The phantom of Liberty was really a piece of art even thought it got me kind of confuse. This is a film where you can start asking question to yourself and building all this thoughts and ideas. This is where you can see a real director, art and high level of thinking of Bu?uel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Phantom of Liberty is a movie that needs to be watched cold turkey. Meaning, no introduction, no gist of whats going to happen, just nothing. This was the way I came to watch it and honestly I am thankful for that. Not knowing at all what I was getting into made the irony of it all more real. So in order to keep the element of surprise, I'll try not to say much. The reality in this movie is an alternate one but Bu?uel gets us to imagine how easily the tables could've been turned. In this feature, Bu?uel does a magnificent job at getting you to say "how ridiculous!" and then say "why not?". He gets you to question society by asking "why exactly are things the way they are?" without saying "the world as we know it is wrong". I love this movie for how refreshing it was to see something different for a change and would definitely recommend this to anyone.</fullReview>

One question that I can't help but to wonder is if Bu?uel's social commentary is lost on the vast majority of viewers, then is he really being effective as a filmmaker and a communicator? I think that a film should stand on its own and speak for itself. A film that needs to be explained by a third party is an example of ineffective filmmaking.An example of this would be the scene in which the ostrich walks into the bedroom. While watching it, I was thinking, "Wow, that sure is strange. What a strange filmmaker." It is doubtful, however, that Bu?uel's purpose for including the ostrich scene is to convey that he is a strange filmmaker. Is it a commentary at all, unless people are able to understand and reflect upon that commentary? A "social commentary" implies that people (on the receiving end) can understand and take in, or reject, to reflect upon, to agree, to disagree, to debate, and above all, to react to. Is it still a social commentary if (most) people are unable to do this without having it "translated" to them by a third party? I tend to think that it is not. It is the filmmaker's job to make his film clear, and to make his points. A filmmaker who does not do this, in my opinion, is an ineffective one. I am a little torn here because some great films do not have a specific message, or even a story. An example would be the films of Stan Brakhage, such as Dog Star Man. However this film is not like those films. It is not abstract, and indeed, it does contain an embedded social commentary. On the other hand, Bunuel does use "dream logic" quite effectively. His bizarre situations are made even more remarkable and outrageous simply by the lack of reactions of the characters in the scenes. They act as if nothing is amiss at all, whereas we, as the audience, are screaming "But look! Look! And ostrich just walked into your bedroom! Can't you see it? What are you going to do about it?" And in Bunuel's films, the characters do nothing, bringing to light our own reactions of protest, through contrast with the reactions of the characters in the films. Our reactions are even bigger and deeper because the characters in the film who we expect to react like us, do not. That said, once the themes have been uncovered, the commentary is incredibly sharp, and profound. However, another issue I have with The Phantom of Liberty is that it is very disjointed. It comes off as scattered. Bunuel makes so many different points that he fails to make even one very effective one. Among many the many themes are the questioning of social norms, hypocrisy of adults toward children, and snap judgments we make about people and situations that may not always prove true. Also covered are parents not "hearing" their children (and the differing values between the generational gap). The Phantom of Liberty raises questions about social and sexual taboos, and double standards and expectations we have for men vs. women. If our minds are considered to be boxed in by social norms ingrained in us since childhood, Bunuel at least calls attention to the box that binds us, making it visible. Although he doesn't go so far as to say that we should do away completely with these social constructs, only that we should be aware of them and their implications. A military instructor tells his students: "There's a good deal of talk about changing our morals. Some people are even calling for a general upheaval. But the consequences of such a disturbance could prove intolerable, even horrifying." Then he goes into a sequence illustrating this point (the infamous sequence with the toilets at the dinner table).If there is one main theme to this film (which is doubtful), it is this: "...the aim of laws is to maintain social order. Naturally, they're subject to change from one country to another, from one age to another. In fact, they are merely conventions. The same goes for customs and morals."Bunuel resorts to absurd situations and extremes to shock us into seeing the absurdity of our own social codes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can you imagine living in a society where killers are praised, people talk while sitting on toilets and eat in a cubic room, policemen don't know what they are doing, priests smoke and drink, and teachers are teased? The director uses a surrealistic touch to describe such absurd things I just mentioned. In The Phantom of Liberty, dark humor and sarcasm are widely applied to mock the middle class. The director boldly pictures an upside down world. Everything the audience believes in is challenged and overturned in this movie. As you know, the film was released in 1974, exactly 30 years ago. Honestly speaking by looking at today's world, things created in the movie could actually happen in real life. For instance, everyone openly talks about drugs. Many teenagers think it is okay and cool to drink underage. Child abuses are reported all around the world. People's conceptions have aggressively changed during the past thirty years. In the movie a boy falls in love with his aunt, which is considered unacceptable back then, but nowadays people may see it as true love. What I want to say is that people should really take time to think about what are things that we must hold on to and what are ideas we would like to pass on our next generation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bunuel's "Phantom of Liberty" is a satirical comedy; the type of absurdist comedy that forces you to see things differently. Once you watch this film you may notice yourself laughing at things you probably shouldn't: murder, dysfunctional families, crimes, hit men... when you think you understand what's going on in the film, Bunuel pulls something out of nowhere leaving you with your head cocked to the side thinking, "What did I just see here?". It does baffle me, the way he effortlessly connects each sequence despite the fact that each story has nothing to do with the previous. In one scene, a hit-man decided to start shooting at Civilians in a crowded public place- He has no worries because he is living the ideal: absolute freedom.. Bunuel gives us this idea of freedom, how it inhibits moralities and the sets of rules we live by. I was trying to fathom the increasingly twisted "plot" until I realized that there is no plot. You can either see it as some crazy comedy or look deeper and find the hidden message. Bunuel is showing us things that we find morally wrong(in his seemingly twisted way) from another perspective. What would have to be my favorite scene is when a family dines in private and excretes their feces as a family. It goes to show: one man's civilized ways could be another culture's barbaric ways.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Phantom of Liberty clearly made me question myself which was Luis Bu?uel's purpose. This film was purely surrealism because weird and unexpected things that happen, things that somehow could happen in the real world. When watching this film at first I couldn't understand what was going on because of the tableaux style but then it was like if I was in it and experiencing the unknown world of it. It made me question how and why a certain character was acting this way and why Luis Bu?uel chose this style to film it. It kicked in when thinking of the traditions I have learned from both Latin and American culture and how "normal" people act and do things. Am I doing the right things or am I making a fool out of myself? I don't know. Maybe I will never know. There are many traditions around the world and one of these events in this film could be normal to other people in different countries.</fullReview>

The way the characters portray these figures of authority or ones that we treat with respect or idolize aren't really who they seem. Some even murder and abuse power and yet we still view them differently with entitlement and gratitude.

		<shortDescription>A work of art that keeps you thinking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching The Phantom Liberty directed by Luis Bunel, I was shocked and surprised and didn't really know what to think. What and why questions were echoing in my head. Once I got through the shocked state of mind, I was able to let my mind ponder on the many ideas that were brought up in the film. Although presented in a very strange and artistic way, the messages were clear and relatable even though the film is going on 40 years old. The message of, "who are we to know what is right and wrong,' is prevalent through the whole movie. The Phantom Liberty is entertaining and will keep you guessing through the whole thing. It can be watched with careful eyes or you can just watch it for what it is, both ways are enjoyable. The film is visually pleasing while also having larger and deeper meanings hidden in the absurd scenarios. Treating serial killers like celebrities, suppression of children's voices, sexuality and what really is right or wrong is questioned in a comedic way that leaves the viewer puzzled but wanting more. What is to be loved about The Phantom Liberty is the way it makes you think for hours, or even days after you're finished watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This isn't your typical everyday movie. At first, I really didn't understand the film at all but after watching a few episodes within the film, I started to understand the meaning behind it. In my opinion, this movie does a strangely great job at making you question why we do the things that we do. Whether it is socially acceptable acts to dinner table etiquette to cultural biases on whom it is okay to date to the corrupt and disturbing way of how we treat criminals. This is the first movie that I have seen that is divided into different episodes that all convey the same borderline message. This movie is definitely different, but in a good way. Not only does it get you to think of the things you do and the reasoning in why you act in certain ways but more importantly it gets you to question why you do it. Imagine if the things we do today weren't socially acceptable and everything was just the opposite. That's how this film made me feel. Luis Bu?uel does an amazing job at showing the audience this. This film also helps people to question the way they are living and helps them to make a change in their life. Overall, it's a very different movie but it's a great one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deeper than humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The phantom of liberty may seem obscure without any type of context, but for those who understand the underlying meanings of the film than you can appreciate the hidden message. Bunuel uses really open ended surrealism and symbolism to communicate and very direct theme. The film uses distinct imagery to emphasize the fragile line of reality which many find funny. The film does a good job as working to be a metaphor in a form which was new and is still rarely ever used. Without a background in what was going on in France at the time this movie probably couldn't be understood completely, but certain themes shine and are universal. The movie has two very powerful messages of conflicting and disproportionate amounts of freedom along with the absurdity of tradition. When a man decides that he wants to utilize his freedom for murder we see what happens with too much freedom. Then we see a family also perform a tradition much dinner just with deification leading to the questioning of traditional family meals. This movie has powerful themes that are creatively executed. It also manages to consistently capture your attention through humor and allows a cushion to hide the "medicine" in the candy. The vibrant colors that flow between the outfits of the characters and the set allow for your eyes to never get to bored, and the interesting choice of camera angles adds another element into many of the themes. This is an amazing and ground breaking social commentary with only minor faults.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Phantom of Liberty, Luis Bunuel explored outside of the old traditional ways of cinema and steps into a world of surrealism. A surreal world where a family sits at a dining table with toilets as seats, a young man trying to have sexual relations with his older aunt, or priests smoking, drinking, and gambling. At first, this film may not make sense at all to most audiences. I had to watch it twice to understand the concept better. I still haven't quite grasped the entire idea. However, this idea of using surrealism and absurd humor to question reality and to remind viewers the real meaning of freedom is a great method to get the hopes of people up during a dark time like the Spanish Civil War. This interesting film has caught my attention and I will watch it for a third time to understand the overall concept better. I would advise most viewers to do the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At First Glance it may seem Peculiar....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... But Luis Bu?uel's movie The Phantom of Liberty should not be taken quite literally. This movie is the height of Bu?uel's surrealistic genius, showing us that although these absurd things seem very out of the ordinary, they very well could have been the norm in society today.We see an example when the family and friends sit at the table to defecate together, and then excuse themselves to go eat in a private quarters. At first we may laugh, but we don't immediately think that this could have happened to our society, someone could have come along and said that this is the norm and this is how we should go about our eating (in private) and defecation (in public). This can be applied to other things, one culture's absurdity is another's nobility. We tend to think that other culture's ideas of beauty, whether it's an extended lip or cross eyed, is weird while we have our own weird practices that we don't think twice about, braces and breast augmentationIn the film Bu?uel also shows the problems with absolute freedom. In the scene where the sniper kills random people, we see freedom exerted to the extreme. This man is not tied down to any obligations and can just simply decide to assassinate someone on the street because it is his own free will. The whole idea of the movie is that freedom is good, but not absolute freedom, as we see in the opening scene where they say "Down with freedom" before getting killed by the firing squad.Lastly, Bu?uel deals with another idea of societal norms. When we see the grandmother and the nephew in an intimate relationship, it makes us cringe, yet we don't think why not let it be. We have such great societal norms and stigmas put onto our society that we intrude on everything from gay marriage to (in this case) incest. Who are we to judge when we have our own vices that we keep secret.Bu?uel really opens your eyes through his use of surrealism, there are many examples of his amazing hidden symbolism throughout the film that show us that this movie is not just some weird film, but a deeper film with a strong message to convey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Provocative Masterpiece, pushing the boundaries of comfort and the norm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In all honesty, I am one of those people who revel in all that lies under the umbrella of the extreme (e.g. horror, suspense, drama, etc.). I am also, in my opinion, a very open-minded person. But when i first watched this movie, I didn't know whether or not I could sit through this movie without judging each tableaux for it's bizarre and, otherwise, provocative scenes. Each section starts off like an everyday occurrence but candidly develops into a scene that would happen in an opposite world. Instead of aversion to these somewhat "taboo" incidents, the characters/society have a nonchalant and even accepting attitude towards them. It had me thinking "what if?" What if our lives were that of those in the movie? What if their norms were ours? What if we had lived all our lives believing what they believed? The answer is, we already do (in a way of, of course). The world consists of more than just the western civilizations and cultures. Every society has it's cultures that has it's subcultures that has it's own set of rules and beliefs that may be taboo to another group of people's. The brilliant director, Luis Bu?uel, captures this relativism in a simple yet surreal depiction of events. Through his almost dreamlike but viable depictions, the audience is forced into seeing the situations in a different and hopefully more enlightening perspective. I am one of the people in the audience that were bewildered at first, but through a series of thought processes and fruitful discussions I can decidedly say that I was provoked into seeing the thread of freedom throughout the film that shed more light on "taboos" and moral conventions.Overall, sprinkled with light humor and the bizarre, "The Phantom of Liberty" is a successful surrealist film that achieves in provoking the intellectual minds of the audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why not?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thought that went across my mind while watching this movie was "it's like an opposite world". I've seen this movie 3 times and it always strikes me. Bunuel definitely questions what is and what is not normal, and that is what I like about him. I always respect people that are not afraid to question things, explore, disagree, go their own way.The movie is very unusual and at first you will be a little bit shocked by what you see, but after a while you will probably start thinking "why not?" Why a 75 year old man dating an 18 year old girl is considered normal, but a young man dating a 70 year old woman is socially disapproved? Why can't an ostrich walk across your bedroom at night? Why should we eat with people at the table and go to the restrooms on our own? What if we do it the opposite way? Why not?The film doesn't really have a plot line, it's more like several different sequences that all together show us that naturally there is no such thing like "normal", or "not normal" , these concepts were created by people and cultures. " The Phantom of Liberty" really makes you open your mind and think wider. This is real art! Bunuel is an incredible director, the movie is weird, but it's beautifully weird, very french. And only extremely talented people like him can make such an unusual movie work. The film really stands out. Bunuel has his own easily-recognizable style and I think "The Phantom of Liberty" is a perfect example of it. If you haven't seen any of his movies before WATCH THEM, and I would recommend to start with this one.Bunuel is not just a filmmaker, he is a real artist.</fullReview>

However, "The Phantom of Liberty" had my mind going in all sorts of different directions. I liked what Luis Bunuel did to this movie. He showed us that even the strangest events/experiences could happen to anyone and anything. For example, in the movie, Luis Bunuel had a scene where there was a high school boy that was in love "intimately" with his aunt. Most people would not be physically attracted to their family members. Nonetheless, he made us realize that it could still happen.In my honest opinion, at first this movie made me feel disgusted; because of all the strange events that were taking place. To me, it seemed like it was unbelievable and not real. But towards the end of the movie, I realized that those events were realistic and could eventually happen.

		<fullReview>Luis Bu?uel redefines Surrealism in his 1974 mind boggling flick "The Phantom of Liberty". The film unfolds like a storybook, with each section (or "Tableaux") seamlessly flowing into the next like a slippery raft river ride, challenging the viewer's perceptions at each turn. "The Phantom of Liberty" is a film that will challenge every aspect of your understanding of society, while at the same time reinforcing it, which is as such with the second tableaux: the "Killer Poet". Throughout this film you will find yourself questioning societal taboos, moral obligations, ideals and freedoms, as well as our connection with one another and the rest of the world.Bu?uel sets out to redefine reality in "The Phantom of Liberty". Why is the world the way it is? "Not sure, but why couldn't it be this way?" Bu?uel would respond. "Why did this happen on screen?" we could ask as an audience, in which you could almost hear Bu?uel rebuttal "Why couldn't it have happened this way?" Bu?uel shows us the world as it is today if we opened our eyes and see it clearer, the things we ignore or don't pay attention to, and also how life could be. This is what is hilarious and also shockingly terrifying about "The Phantom of Liberty", is that everything represented in Bu?uel's mosaic of "What ifs?" could have happened, or even more horrifying, is already happening in western society.Granted, as much as this film is a roller coaster ride and a must see for any aspiring film aficionado, this film is very demanding intellectually. To truly appreciate this labyrinth of a film, one will need three bags of popcorn, a clear Saturday, and their thinking cap on standby. If such movie watching experience of this caliber is appealing to you, "The Phantom of Liberty" may be the film for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching The Phantom of Liberty, I felt very confused and was left speechless. I did not know what to make of what I had seen. The only information I left the film with was a series of questions. Why was there an ostrich at the end? Why was the French army looking for foxes in the countryside? How could a sniper be acquitted and hailed as a celebrity? But these questions are what should be taken away from this surrealist film because they lead to the bigger picture. The main purpose of this film is to show that it doesn't really matter why the French army is searching for foxes or what an ostrich symbolizes but rather the fact that you questioned it. Why do we question these things? What does that say about us, our society and value system? The film is riddled with inconceivable ideas and taboos that say more about us than the ideas and taboos themselves. This film was made to make a statement about who we are. Ironic, considering this film feels as if it has no conclusive identity or plot after watching it. But the Phantom of Liberty is not just a random film. Bunuel knew exactly what he was doing by cleverly orchestrating the links between stories leading to this film's purpose. He exposes hypocrisy and the true nature of freedom asking the question: do we know what freedom entails? To understand this film as a whole is an impossible goal, but to understand each scene and question our own value system and reaction is very achievable. This film is not exactly my style but I greatly respect Bunuel and his philosophical reasoning in making this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True surrealism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is far from what you'd expect going into any movie. Rather than having one single plot, it tells several different, yet VERY simple episodes. Each episode loosely connects to the one before or after it. Next to nothing can be going on, but is directed in such a fashion, that it keeps you entertained until you find out what's really going on. You can stop and think about these and say that none of it is plausible, then simply be shut down by the idea that everything in this movie could happen, and a lot of what we see is a more literal interoperation of our own cultural biases. Each episode has trademark examples of surrealism that only such a talented director could pull off. Any film fan that's seen other Bu?uel films would watch this, and just know it's his. It's a true example of how forms of art, especially movies, are not bound by logic, which has truly paved the way for several other great directors with booming careers today (Edgar Wright, for example). If you walk into this movie, ready to judge everything "weird" about it, you'll find a lot to complain about. Honestly, that's your problem though. When you open your mind to the idea that rational logic is out the window here, and really stop to pay attention to what each episode is telling you, nothing will keep you from enjoying this movie. Open-mindedness and paying attention are what will make you truly appreciate the talent of this cast and director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Phantom of Liberty doesn't follow a story or a character but rather follows a series of episodes involving characters in routine situations that might seem abnormal to the average person.Luis Bunuel takes storytelling in cinema and literally breaks down the walls of what we as a society deem as abnormal and make it seem normal or vice versa. One example is a scene where a group of monks are praying with a woman and then the next shot shows them gambling with holy items. Each specific episode has a specific message that Bunuel is trying to convey and for the most part it definitely reaches the audience but at the same time it can also be mentally exhausting.The best way to describe way Phantom of Liberty is that it literally breaks down our idea of common sense and it makes the audience rebuild our idea of what is normal or why we think of certain things as normal or abnormal.Phantom of Liberty is an experience unlike any other cinema that I personally have ever experienced. Would I watch it twice in a row? Absolutely not, because I found it to be mentally exhausting not because I hated it, but because it literally broke down everything I thought was normal and by the end of the film I had to make sure I wasn't on drugs. Yet I would definitely watch it again because Phantom of Liberty is a film that must be watched over and over in order for it to be fully understood.

		<shortDescription>If total freedom is attainable...Can we really handle it? The brilliance behind Bunuel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Bunuel's film begins to unravel, the viewer starts to become aware that this is not a typical movie. Bunuel's genius behind "The Phantom of Liberty" is how he composes multiple episodes of people's lives and strings them together throughout the course of the film. What makes this movie stand out is the continual moments of surrealism, where Bunuel proves to the viewer how something that surely makes us gasp, is simply a norm to the people in the film. Not only do you get a glimpse of what it's like to see several lives of average people in France, but also each episode intensifies what it means to be free, and what humanity would look like if there was total freedom. The taboo's with sex and religion shown through these dark and sometimes comical episodes point out the hypocrisies in our society and humanity. Showing the paradoxical lifestyles of the many characters often make the viewer, who can be considered as "normal," shocked by the absurdity within the episode. On the contrary, every character in the scene acts as though whatever was happening is 100% "normal" for them. These situations perfectly exemplify what Bunuel was trying to do, which was ultimately to show the relativism in our world of how something that can be totally bizarre and ridiculous to you, may be the daily routine for someone elsewhere. Likewise, Bunuel perfectly juxtaposed what a "typical" society is in his film, allowing the viewer to open their eyes and see the world differently than what he/she may define it as. Even though the film is full of irrational logic, everything he presents to the audience are experiences that could happen in anyone's life; this idea defined as surrealism parallels what life could be like if you lived in a dream world for example, where there are infinite possibilities for anything to happen. All of this raises the question of why people react to situations the way they do in society, and additionally who are they to judge other people's lives and their decisions? It is this very question that conflicts with humanity's desire for total freedom, and what happens when you attain total freedom. Nonetheless, it is the evident truth that total freedom can only lead to being consumed by the phantom of liberty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Banuel examines the taboos of every day life through an exploration of surrealism and Spanish poetic realism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me, The Phantom of Liberty seems to heavily focus on the ideas and themes of the chance and mystery of everyday life. This notion is portrayed throughout the film through the use of film technique and Banuel's apparent criticism against established social standards. For example, it is noted that there are many moments with a lack of sound or music. However, this lack of sound aids in conveying to the viewer a sense of authenticity. The idea of authenticity is important because in all the episodes, the plot seems to focus on a taboo character or situation that may be hard for most viewers to apply and relate to their actual lives; therefore, the authenticity the lack of music score demonstrates, helps to convey Banuel's point of view. Additionally, in the episode where there are guests staying in a hotel, The Hatter and his assistant invite the nephew, the monks, and a nurse into their room for what seems like a friendly get together and drinks. However, this suddenly takes a dramatic turn when The Hatter and his assistant began to perform dominatrix type acts right in front of their guests. This is an example of Banuel portraying a sexual taboo, however, in a manner that is not demeaning, but rather examining the mystery, authenticity, and actually very common action of defying social norms.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The challenging lack of a narrative center doesn't prevent this film from having a great deal to say about the modern world and its ambivalent grasp of freedom. The man is shooting people in the city building. Bunuel's most uninhibited venture though audacious and satisfying my Bunuel pangs, lacks a bite or enough charm to appeal to the masses. The Phantom of Liberty moves with great confidence and comfort. Odd that such a wicked film should feel comfortable, but there you have it. That's Bunuel. A tour de force, a triumph by a director confronting almost impossible complications and contradictions and mastering them. It's very funny, all right, but remember: With Bu?uel, you only laugh when it hurts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>represents the idealistic liberty as nothing but a ghost in this cursed world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another mind-heaving creation from the mastermind of surrealism, Luis Bunuel. He skillfully applies his surrealistic technique to deride the ghastly condition of family bond, religion, power, social class, education, jurisdiction in this present age. The movie is divided into several stories that leap from one to another with a side character of the previous tale.The movie opens with the mischief of Napoleon's troops making the mass- killings and perversion. Later with the scene, where an adult man secretly gives two girls some pictures, Bunuel plays our spoiled psychology to make us think him as a pedophile giving some nude snaps to the children. But soon those are found as just some landscape pictures :p Religion and churches are cleverly mocked while the priests start gambling and drinking just after saying prayers. A droll occurs when some military men in tank stop cars on the road and ask for foxes; but soon symbolically the vicious fox appears in stuffed form in the hotel room where the incestuous affair between aunt-nephew takes place.The most remarkable weird scene of the movie is that people attend a potty (!) party by sitting on commodes around a dining table and taking their dinner separately in a little room like toilet!!! Through this, Bunuel jeeringly sneers at the upper class's dinner party where they usually express their affectation. In addition, the search of a 'missing girl' in front of the 'missing girl'; Doctor's offering cigarette to the cancer patient---add not only the comical elements; but also a sarcastic pinch to our unnoticed nonsensical notions. In a section, a psycho serial killer, though sentenced to death, grants freedom from the court and gets followed by autograph-takers!!! This is a vivid satire to the vulnerable jurisdiction system and laws.The film vaguely ends at a zoo typifying human's 'so-called' liberty in the cage with animals. In a nutshell, Bunuel, with tons of mockeries, represents the idealistic liberty as nothing but a ghost in this cursed world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Luis Bu?uel incredible mind on "THE PHANTON OF LIBERTY". The linking of story's trough the film and unidirectional plot. Bu?uel plays with people expectations with the ironic ideas, getting out of the normal with surrealism to attack, and criticize the social and hypocrites ideas that people holds, for example, the scene of the frail when " they are in the room drinking , smoking and playing cards and betting everything they have". He critics ironically the church as frail oleo do get out of the routine and do other things out of the normal other than read the bible. Another example the scene of the sniper shooting people randomly, interprets ate that scene as showing respect to animals and other living things. Also playing with the audience spectation, in the scene when shows the good shape of a nude lady. And so on examples of surrealist. This is a great film. New wave filmmakers should learn from this kind of movies and apply it now days.</fullReview>

All the events seemed to surreal to be possible until I fully understood the definition of surrealism. As such, this movie constantly left my mind in a state of WTF?!?, and for that I congratulate it. It somewhat spoke to me the idea that it is impossible to expect the unexpected, and that any decisions in real life have a chance of something truly surreal occurring. That said, because of the surrealness of this film, I never had any idea what direction it would go in, and thus found myself confused and intrigued simultaneously. It also leaves me thinking that maybe everything is just a random series of events.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is as provocative as it is surprisingly delightful. The series of absurd surrealist vignettes are framed in such a way that teases and entices the viewer where conventionally disturbing scenarios are balanced by a sense of humor and an aesthetic that creates a world where it feels to "safe" to be "unsafe." Even when one reaches a point where the unexpected becomes expected the specificity of the director's choices allows the audience the space and the freedom to make connections (or not) as one pleases similar to reacting to a dream while dreaming. While the film breaks moral and social barriers, the choices of which ones are broken and the execution of those subversive moments on screen left me with a lasting impression of the universality of the surrealist value of liberating oneself through the means of good old dark humor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie. I feel like this movie follows the train of thought of a person with ADD. For example, one scene is of a doctor's office, and after a short interaction with the nurse, the camera follows her home. The story is constantly changing, each sub-plot having its own theme. These smooth transitions make it a smooth, unsynchronized movie.The description of those movie would be very close to a dream. Dreams are collections of thoughts, fragments, ideas, and concrete objects. Bu?uel's film shows moments in time which have filled with hidden messages which can be heavy or subliminal. His goal was to instill doubt in his audience, and allow us to contemplate our everyday behavior and environment. He achieves this through pure surrealism. Surrealism itself is a form that collides with order. This film has many instances that go against or compete with the government and other institutions (one including the Police).What I appreciated about Bu?uel's work, was its ease of watching. A person is able to relax and enjoy his art but also find very deep meaning in it. This is the kind of film that can be watched several times and be seen a different way each time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has an interesting message about society. Even though the movie misleads the audience to different outcomes of situations, it explains humanity in a true aspect. People are sinners, even though society tries to cover up many peoples' sins and portray a certain aspect of humanity. This movie shows how society is wrong. People are bound to do mistakes. So Bunuel takes this vision into a different level in the movie. He tries to lead the audience into how society sees or wants to see people. How people should act. Then he just cuts this vision in half and puts a scene like soldiers drinking in a church to show the reality of life. Then he starts to bump this up on different levels and show the opposite of how people act in society. Therefore, this film becomes controversial of the images or clips he puts into the film. He puts a lot of extreme clips such as a young boy trying to seduce an older woman. This is not common in society, but this is what Bunuel really wants to show in his film. And I like this because it makes a person think of what is acceptable and why.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, I was confused with this film at first because I wasn't expecting this type of humor to be in such a film. From the scene where the little girl shows her parents pictures of landmarks and architecture and they react as if she showed them porn or something really explicit. That scene let me know what type of film to expect. At times, I laughed because of the absurdness of the certain scenes.Like the scene where the rich people are sitting around the dinner table, toilets as their seats, pants down, trying to have an intelligent conversation. Maybe that scene was symbolizing the rubbish that rich people, politicians, etc believe or say while sitting on their "throne." What I loved most about this film was the ability to have surrealism but break it up with humor. Bunuel pulls off breaking the tension with random but meaningful visuals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is nonsensical in order to make certain points that are wind up being common sense like using a sniper to randomly kill people to perhaps show the extreme case of having unlimited freedom which is dangerous, but anyone would already know that. The movie does have some pretty funny parts such as the priests drinking, smoking, and gambling and it helps with diversification. The shots taken in the business districts makes you wonder if the pedestrians where any real. If so, then Bunuel was willing to go relatively far with his films like having to go through with permits and regulations since it is in the middle of the city and where his production could of potentially interfered with the regular activities of the public. The film brings humor, wonder, and weirdness instead of being too plain like how it could of been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surrealism at its best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Phantom of Liberty, directed by Luis Bu?uel, is a film that plays with the viewers' mind. Its surrealistic surprise captivates the audience while questioning its significance. Scenes of the alleged missing girl, the monks' card game, the army's hunt for foxes, the doctor's diagnosis, the dinner table, and the serial killer all establish Bu?uel's purpose of degrading institutions. In his mind, institutions are depicted to create order and disposition among people, but ultimately it cages us in a state of utter limitations and restrictions. We have dreams that unconsciously reveal our hopes and our needs. In order to be happy, we need to free ourselves from the state of control. Be bold, do things at random, and live on the edge. Happiness will only be found this way.In the film, the mere coincidental meetings between the characters also affect the narration. One can't help but wonder what would happen if a character didn't encounter another or missed each other by a second or two? Would things play out differently? Would the future ultimately diverge? Questions like these haunt us by such a masterpiece. Although every aspect is exaggerated, the film truly captures the essence of life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thought Provoking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You might find yourself completely lost with this film, without having a good understanding of what Surrealism is about and being completely open to it's unconventional form. Surrealism is about exploring the bizarreness of the dream-state and finding the logic within it. It's goal is to defy your expectations of what you know to be normal and rational. It's meant be purely thought provoking. I personally have extremely bizarre dreams; from my brother being the Joker and trying to kill me with chopsticks to me waking up in the middle of a forest as the Pancake Princess and having a grandiose pancake feast. And of course when having these dreams, EVERYTHING and ANYTHING is believable and makes sense (just like any other dream). It's only when we wake up that we immediately try to rationalize our dreams, which brings us to see it as completely illogical. So again, when watching this movie you must find the logic within it just as you do when your dreaming. You must take it for what it is, be completely open and accepting of it, and not try to rationalize it (because it's not meant to be rational), and you must continue to ask yourself: If I were dreaming this would it make sense? (The answer is yes.)To me this movie's ultimate goal is to get the audience to be totally open minded and throw all societal rules out the window. There's no other way to watch this movie than to be COMPLETELY open minded and willing to let go of what you think, and what society has taught you, to be rational. Surrealism was ultimately a political and philosophical movement meant to change it's society and its institutions. In history the ultimate set backs during times of revolution was the unwillingness to change, to be more open minded, to let go of what is normal. A good example might be women's rights; at some point in time the idea that women should have no say in politic's, and should remain homemakers was completely rational. It took a long and challenging movement to break down this idea that society labeled as rational and normal, and make people more open minded to the idea of men and women being equal. Today we look back on history and have trouble imagining women not having the right to vote, something that was completely accepted then. Same goes for the obvious example of slavery, and today a similar challenge would be gay rights. Phantom of Liberty reminds us to not simply accept everything society tells us is normal.Regardless, this movie has been on my minded ever since I've watched it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surreal, well done, and significant in my own understanding of film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILER ALERT*** Whilst viewing the film for the first time, I truly didn't comprehend what I had just watched. The camera was nice, the color nice as well, the scenery also delightful, however the actual elements that later effected me I quite honestly didn't catch until the second viewing I did alone. For example, the dinner scene the camera serves as a window into the film yes, but it makes me feel as though I'm present in the film which is something I don't feel often in film or at least easily. Also the meaning behind a scene that one may deem meaningless required a bit of thought on the viewers part which is something I love. I don't enjoy film that screams at you, this is a subtle yet effective tool Bunuel has used and worked phenomenal on me. I must say its not for everyone in my humble opinion but the second viewing is a must as far as I'm concerned and an open mind as well. The film has moved me to only further analyze scenarios and seek meaning in somethings my typical American viewing experience may not allow me to see. Definitely surrealist to the core.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film truly brought out the definition of surrealism to me. At times I truly found some aspects of the movie to be quite random to the point of confusion, but as the movie progressed I could see Bu?uel's purpose to show how unrelated events can coincidentally be linked to one another. I also felt as though the film could be open to interpretation to different people and that Bu?uel purposefully made it complex in order to maintain ambiguity. I was quite anxious throughout most of the film because I'm so used to knowing exactly what's going on and the purpose, like most Hollywood movies. However, this film allowed me to broaden my perspective and perhaps allow me to give other movies that have a similar style a chance. Abandoning my own prejudice for such style, this film in particular has made me do so and by providing me with a spectacular visual set as well as some rather fascinating/twisted scenes.</fullReview>

The each scene has an impact on the viewer as if we're walking towards film fun house of some sort, going to scene to scene as if it was a different room. Mr. Bunuel does a great job of making sure its not taking a joke but serious as these random events came into play. Example Instead of feeling disgusted or push to make a fart joke when the 6 people dine at the table with the toilet seats, we as the audience are intrigued and soon ourselves finding this more normal within every minute. The Cinematography is also extremely well done especially how the facial expressions were received and every hidden reveal wasn't hidden at the least.Overall, a great film to watch if you want to question everything that is right in society.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To review The Phantom of Liberty, one must not criticize its plot or its characters; otherwise, your mind will turn to puddy and your thoughts will melt to pieces. Rather, one must review this film as what it is; surrealism."The Phantom of Liberty", directed by Luis Bunuel, is the paradigm of surrealist films. To review, these are the qualities that a surrealist film should possess: 1) Dark, savage humor 2) Sexual fantasy 3) Personal subjective peculiar visions of experience 4) Satric preoccupation with the church 5) Random vignettes that hold deeper themes and morals 6) Expecting the expected and getting the unexpectedI could list surrealist qualities for days, but I will choose not to. Lets review how Bunuel showed us these surrealist characteristicsFor sexual fantasy and satiric pre-occupation of the church, Luis bundles both together a hilarious scene of unorthodox and downright raunchy bizarreness. As four monks are sitting in a hotel room, instead of praying on the floor or reading the bible, they are doing the polar opposite; smoking, drinking, and gambling. Meanwhile, a man and woman are participating in a BDSM fetish where a beautiful female whips her lovers butt. This scene is pure surrealism. Expectations are crushed. The characters have no relation to each other before or after the scene. Lastly, viewers take the scene as their own peculiar vision of experience, and the freedom of the seemingly random scene opens their brain and drives questions into their neurological software. Yet, more importantly, there is a deeper meaning here than monks doing the polar opposite of their assumed jobs, and a female and man doing the unthinkable BDSM in front of them. The deeper meaning is that their freedom and doing what we do not expect them to do makes us think. Bunuel is intentionally trying to get his viewers to question what they see and wonder if is truly absurd. In fact, Bunuel is trying to crush the ideas of expectations and prove to viewers that the mind will be opened if it disregards stereotypes and preconceived notions about particular races, groups, and people. The film also does an excellent job in stirring up the viewers emotions; while watching the film, you are both angry but curious -- moreso a curious anger, that you do not have the answers to the questions and bizarre sequences. For instance, when a man sits on top of a building and shoots people, you are dumbfounded as to why he is doing such a thing -- mostly because he has never been in the film up until this point and your expectation of him seeming more important is crushed. Instead, you must dive deeper into his facial expressions and actions and try to understand who is. Yet, in the act of doing so, you always self-reflect and realize your own assumptions about this man -- that although he is killing people -- maybe there is more to him than you do not know. After he is captured, the audience never seems him again and we are left wondering, and emotionally disturbed yet puzzled, as to who this man is and what drove him to the killings. Was it an overabundance of freedom? Was it insanity? Is Bunuel just trying to anger us by dismantling every scene into a flurry of vignettes irrelevant to the past and future scenes?Surrealism at its core is an excellent ideology; forget expectations, stereotypes, or assumptions and just search for answers. In the Phantom of Liberty, every scene is a new chance for the average viewer to deconstruct their expectations and being to "expect the unexpected". And the deeper the viewer digs into the irrationality of the Phantom of Liberty world, the deeper the viewer digs into themselves and truly questions who they are and the world they live in. Only the medium of film and a director as brilliant as Luis Bunuel are capable of carving out the freedom and intelligence of the human spirit.Watch it without knowing the plot -- because the plot does not matter. Instead, break down your expectations and ask yourself the question -- what is a pipe?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found Bunuel's surrealist views in "The Phantom of Liberty" to be quite entertaining. At first I was thrown off by the juxtapositions, but as I began to see and learn Bunuel's style with storytelling, I found myself kicking back and laughing with the odd characters and their unusual situations. I really enjoyed how this film frees the audience from our rational ways of thinking and instead invites us into the dream-like state. At times I did feel a bit disturbed by his dark humor (especially the sexual fantasies), but overall I applaud him for creating something different and emotionally shocking. Bunuel was not afraid to go the strange situations that many people think about, but never dare say. I do wish however that Bunuel would have connected the stories together with one single character or would have created a better connection (link) between each incident; I felt the story needed a clearer structure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film had many amazing points to it, filled with twists and turns and no one really knows what is going to happen next. Coming from an amateur film analyzer, I believe that this movie is a great reflection of the films made in that era and the Surrealist movement. There was a lot of dark humor within the film, making fun of how we live our daily lives. For example, when the child was "missing" and they couldn't find her even though she was standing right there, it was very symbolic of how in modern days, people are disregarding their children and aren't listening to them even though they are standing right beside them. Also, a lot of sexual fantasy occurs in the film as well, which is common in Surrealist films. For example, when the nurse stops at the hotel for the night, she is invited into one of the other travelers' rooms, along with the monks who were staying there that night as well. In their room, the traveler and his accomplice proceed to have sadomasochist actions while they have people watching them. The man repeated that he wanted the monks to watch while this was happening, making his sexual fantasy known. Another example is of the nephew and his elderly aunt who want to have sex with each other. The aunt says she is a virgin and when her body is shown, it is of a much younger woman. Anyways, this still elaborates on the young man's sexual desire of having intercourse with his aunt. As for my point of view of this movie, I loved how the movie was so bizarre and there was no way of telling what was going to happen next. The images in the film are just out of this world and I don't think that anyone could have thought of these things as well as Bunuel did. I would strongly recommend this movie to anyone and more people need to see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bunuel's comedic view of the human kind.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was most definitely one that pulled the brain in many directions. Should we as the viewers try and decipher every meaning of every vignette, or is it meant to be viewed as a literal comedy about the behavior of humans? As I learned in my college film class before viewing the film, Bunuel wanted to reveal in a strange spirit of sympathy the comedy of the human condition, which can only be achieved through great precision and detail. I feel Bunuel did a fantastic job of doing so. This film was so rapid in its transition from story to story and character to character, it left me wondering the deeper meaning behind each vignette. Surrealist film makers believed that things that could not happen in real life were possible in cinema, so what was Bunuel's reasoning behind something as random as an emu emerging from the door while a man was unable to sleep? The reaction of the man was not quite what someone would have in real life, so these details made me as a person think about my own reactions to events in my life. It didn't spark my emotions as much as it did my thoughts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lost and loving every minute of it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Luis Bunuel, Where o where did you come from? I feel like I just took a big strip of acid, sat back, and got lost in my wildest imagination. This is a great great example of Surrealism at its finest. I finally figured out what it meant to be a surrealist after watching this film. From the beginning your not so sure where things are headed, but soon realize, where things are headed is the least of things to be thinking about. Jumping from on story, from one social class, from one activity to another, Luis Bunuel amazes. Im not so sure I could explain this movie to you in much more than just a must watch. I love how he questions the status quo in almost every shot in this film. If you really think about it, if this is the way that we grew up we would consider this normal. I know for me personally i will never be able to watch another movie quite the same, heck for that matter Im not sure if ill ever be able to think the same. Such an experience, you almost cant even consider this as just watching a movie. It made me feel so alive and free from the society norms. I will forever be in debt to my film teacher and Mr. Bunuel for giving a novice film watcher (never had seen a foreign film until this year) and turning me into someone who will always question a good movie in comparison to something like this which tears you all over the feeling spectrum. Wonderful!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Series of uncalled events</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bunuel has really outdone himself in "The Phantom of Liberty" where he ranges a wide variety of uncalled events in this particular piece. Bunuel cleverly toys around with our expectations as he attempts to foreshadow our presumptions through the humor portrayed in the film.My favorite part is when the Nanny takes the children to the park and they run into our modern day man who we would see as a "pedophile", giving the children candy and secret pictures. The humor in this is widely entertainment as we believe the pictures to be in negative connotation when in reality they consist of french architecture.In other words, Bunuel shows many aspects of paradoxical and radical clips that put this movie together in a brilliant way. His ability to give so many different meanings in each scene is what makes his work in "Phantom of Liberty" so phenomenal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Search For Truth Within Multiple Tablos</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Luis Bunuel, "Phantom of Liberty" is a film that shows things that are possible but yet, highly unlikely. In the beginning of the movie, Napoleon's troops invade Spain and upon execution, the people cry out "long live chains". It sets the tone of the picture, insinuating that 'if this is what freedom is like, I'd rather be living in chains.' They're multiple tablos in the film that connect through one another. Bunuel made films that were political and cultural, this one taking place in France... Both of which are seen in "Phantom of Liberty". Through each individual story, the metaphors become the meaning. A French girl at a park is given pictures by a mistaken sexual predator. Turns out the pictures were only of historic landmarks. Her parents, act disgusted when they see them. Later on in the movie, the same girl goes missing. While her parents are filing the missing report, she is standing right beside them. Another tablo features a young man and his older aunts lust for one another. At a hotel, she unveils her body and Bunuel tricks you into thinking you're going to see a chest of an elderly women. However, he purposely uses a double to fool you. Finally, there's a sniper who goes on a killing streak, only to be found guilty and then viewed as a celebrity, having to sign autographs.What this film means to me cannot be easily written to your understanding. It truly is one of a kind for how thought provoking it is. It will impact each viewer differently and mainly for me, Bunuel struck a chord of cultural relativism-how we few certain acts within our society and whether or not there's any justice/truth in it. It's almost as if the director is making fun of us, trying to tell us something we've never heard before. From that standpoint, this film taught me to be more open in cinema in general.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Phantom of Liberty" is a film that wittingly uses opposition and dry humor to create a mockery of the social, political, and religious customs we share as a society.Our innate but na?ve expectations are continually proved wrong throughout the film, such as when we imagine the monks leading a proper and chaste life, who instead take secular pleasure in unholy activities such as smoking, drinking, and gambling which is astonishing yet humorous. Another thwarted assumption is when the Nephew tears away the sheets from his aunt's body revealing a youthful appearance instead of the unappealing aged body we were expecting, thus shamefully revealing our obsession and fear with physical degradation that inevitably occurs with maturity. Additionally, when we see the academy of police officers in training, we perceive it as an institution of discipline and sensibility; we tend to have a higher moral standard for those in power of us. These students however, are easily reduced to devious giggles and childish schemes that they play out on their frustrated professor. The sarcasm in the scene is rampant, ridiculing society for putting our faith in a governing body that is no more flawless and ethical than us.We have made our own rules for social etiquette and are stubborn and steadfast in our concrete opinions. Certain actions are considered to be decent and proper, while other simply cannot be tolerated openly. Bunuel turns this ideology upside down by presenting us with the distinctive dinner table scene. With the social conventions reversed, eating has become a private affair and subject of taboo, while defecating in public has become the absent-minded norm.The most disconcerting scene is when the sniper starts casually shooting out of high-rise building at his own will. What's terrifying about that notion, is that it could be freely exercised by anyone and anywhere. Even more disturbing is the result of the trial, with the shooter not only walking away cleared of any wrongdoing but also being asked for his autograph, his notoriety culminating him into a pseudo-celebrity. Although our first reaction is to shout injustice the irony is upsettingly familiar, directly reflecting the hypocrisy of today's media crime darlings.Ultimately, the film is a fun and entertaining testimony that reminds us of our faults, biases, and the curious concept of the human condition.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bu?uel's brilliant success in comedic satire of bourgeois society</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Phantom of Liberty" is an intelligent and entertaining exploration of western society's idiosyncratic social behavior. The obscurely humorous nature with which it tackles scenarios we encounter in daily life gives us the opportunity to lightheartedly look at some of the norms of western society and confront the thought-processes behind them - as we ask ourselves what value these norms possess. In this movie we challenge rituals with alternate "possible" scenarios (for example, a scene described by the professor of a police academy to his class where house guests meet to defecate, rather than eat around a table), confront blatant hypocrisy (monks drinking, smoking and gambling with religious tokens after admonishing a flamenco dancer for being too frivolous) and consider a reality in which we have too much freedom (a sniper targeting random people in the streets). We can use the film to look into, and laugh at, bourgeois society ? and ask ourselves why we do the things we do, as we contrast Bu?uel's reality to our own. Bu?uel gives us an incredibly creative and thought-provoking journey into surrealism with this movie of a "day in the life" of ordinary people in unusual circumstances. He is a genius of the seemingly nonsensical. This movie is a must-see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This will leave you thinking, and rethinking, what is really "right" and "wrong". Bunuel does a great job of of forcing you to second guess yourself.Let's take the "pedifile" character, for example. When you first see him, his clothing and mannerisms, you just want to jump on the screen and save the children from a man who looks like he do nothing but harm them. He even hands them, what seems to be, some grotesque pictures. When the child bring the photographs home to the parents, they are nothing, but historical French buildings. What our corrupt minds make us think is, this guy is giving these children some sort of inappropriate pictures. This scene then goes on to play with our minds even more, when the parents become aroused by the pictures. Is this a double standard? Yes, but we seem to have those everywhere in our society. This is one of many scenes in this film that make us re-asses how we portray certain circumstances without really knowing whats going on.I also very much one particular part in the scene with the nephew and elder aunt. Just as you start to feel wrong about the situation of incest, they cut to a body of a young woman. Not only does this make you second guess what "beauty" real are is, but you are forced to realize that what you may perceive as "beautiful" is probably the opposite for other cultures in the world.What is acceptable and what is truly wrong? You will ask yourself this throughout the entire film.</fullReview>

What i mean by this is dog could be cat and cat could be called dog, or someone could say to 2+2= fish. This is what was shown at the dinner table where they went to the restroom as if they were eating dinner and they would eat privately and go into a room by there selves. what if jeans were worn on your torso and shirts were worn on your bottom this movie really had me thinking.Emotionally i was affected with humor and some what confusion. It was funny how the parents were looking for there kid but she was standing right next to them and it wasn't like they just completely ignored her, because when the daughter spoke the parents would answer back. Such as when the parents asked the teacher how could you lose there daughter and the daughter would say mommy I'm here, which was also kind of confusing. I thought the most confusing part of the movie was when the chief of police got a phone call from his dead sister and went to go see her and there was a phone on the side of the coffin. Another confusing part is when there were two chief of police, i really didn't understand that part, but overall i really liked the movie and wouldn't mind seeing it a couple of more times so that i can understand some of the parts i was confused about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I were to be drawn by a cartoon animator, my character would constantly have a light bulb magically appear over its head indicating epiphanies. I have them all of the time. Throughout the movie, The Phantom of Liberty as directed by Luis Bunuel, I found that light bulb becoming comfortably rested atop my head and not leaving. Even though the concepts and taboos brought to light in the movie are not new or revolutionary, the way in which they are portrayed is for lack of better description, thought-provoking. Instead of giving away plot points; I am instead going to describe the overall feeling that I got from the movie in chronological progression. A good portion of the film brought attention to sexual taboos. These things just aren't talked about candidly and in the open. I have a feeling that no one in their conscious mind would admit to having strange sexual desires. The question arises, what is strange? Why is strange? Who is strange? What makes strange, strange? Those were the questions that I had to ask myself repeatedly throughout the piece. Without that lens, I would not appreciated any of it and my mind would have discarded everything as nonsense. I believe that Bunuel's whole intention was to spark those provoking types of thoughts and to realize what cultural relativism actually is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Phantom of Liberty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Phantom of Liberty is great movie that will make you think a lot about the rules and expectations that we have in society. It is also brings to light the many judgments and moral codes that we press upon others. I watched this in my film class and I was very shocked by the way people reacted to the tableau about the older aunt and younger nephew in the hotel room. Many people seemed to think that she was too old for him and that their relationship was gross. Yet, if it was an older man with a young girl, which is very common in society, they may have not felt the same way. I did not think she looked that old, plus he was clearly interested in her, so it is not like he was being forced to do anything he didn't want to. This was a great example of how people judge age and moral beliefs, which became very apparent in my class. There are also many surrealist moments in the film that are funny and entertaining. Although each tableau is really interesting, creative and unique, I would have liked to see each tableau connect to each other more to form more of a storyline. It can be a little difficult to follow some of the tableau, since there are many, and the lack of a cohesive story can make it a little boring. Still, this film made me think about many of my own beliefs and how I place value on things.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film, The Phantom of Liberty was not at all what I expected. The director did a great job of showing the audience how to see things differently or with a different set of eyes. I noticed how the tabaleu with the missing little girl seemed silly and exaggerated, but at the same time very true. We make our own children invisible, we hush them up and set them aside while "grown-ups" interact with one another. Making the metaphor literal, the children are there but they're not there. Another tabaleu that stuck out to me was the soldiers eating the host. Yes, the host is food or wafers to be exact, but being Catholic I cringed at the sight of them eating it like it was nothing special. I recommend seeing this movie if you want to see how our everyday freedoms become surreal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A collection of short stories is one of my favorite form of literature. The book The Dubliners by James Joyce is a perfect example and one of my favorites. This being said I have rarely been able to find a film that is a truly captivating collection of stories. There have been a few but they a re truly different stories do not flow as seamlessly as The Phantom of Liberty. Luis Bunuel's choice to have the main character from one story interact with the main character of the next story is filmmaking originality at its finest. It gives a collection of random entertaining stories that flow together perfectly. This with the combined fact that, like many have said before me, The Phantom of Liberty is surrealism at its finest. That having been said I would be lying if I were to say when the movie ended I knew exactly what I had seen. I had to go back and remember each short story and work out in my head what the story was trying show or explain to me. When completing this i found a great appreciation for the film I saw. I also fell in love with how the film made me feel. The Phantom of Liberty is a film that truly makes you think, question, and explore. A quality that is very rare among the films coming out currently. A film that makes you think and explore what it means is one to be treasured.</fullReview>

I love that this is a film that basically calls everyone out on their biased attitudes and double standards. The themes presented are definitely relevant today, considering that constructs such as sexism and "homophobia" are still a thing. I am forever enamored with Luis Bu?uel's work, and I believe this to be one of his best. The metaphors in the film are refreshing and humorous to a certain degree. I truly appreciate how much The Phantom of Liberty relates to current times; people may claim that society has progressed, but I hold the firm belief that there is definitely room for improvement.

Why do we react to police officers as if they are flawless? What makes adults more significant than children? If we don't ask these questions are we just mindless zombies? Are we being silly by believing that Democracy is a better form of Government for a certain people who do not want a government to begin with? Or are we just silly for believing that is why our country is occupying another country? I think that is what Bunuel is saying, if we don't question why we do everything then we may be doing something that is completely backwards.</fullReview>

That if we deify something seen as taboo we are not going to drop dead. That it is okay to question something and to ask why it is like that or why we should be doing that. I felt like that was taking place when the men were munching on the wafers when they are usually used for mass. Or the scene where they dine privately but use the toilet like it was a family diner. Even the extreme when incest is brought up, or how we expect her body to be old and wrinkly.it shows how we generalize many things such as the part when we think the man talking the little girl, that also gives here an envelope and candy, as a pedophile. Why do we think like that now and why is are mind trained to see people as threats.The hotel scene is perfect for showing that we might view somethings as wrong but then are completely different behinds closed doors. The fathers playing cards and betting with religious symbols.Why do only support thing or act a certain way in public, shouldn't we be doing something for what it is and not to impress or satisfy others.</fullReview>

In Bunuel's The Phantom of Liberty, you follow characters and switch stories with each person it focuses on. This type of movie makes you think about cultural relativism. The importance of this film is the overall tone. Even though you move from situation to situation it has the same sort of drama in each one. They begin with a bit of information. Then move into their problem and how odd it truly is. Each individual focus has its comedic relief and then its downfall. Right as you get into the story unraveling before you, its focus shifts to a minor character in that story line. It was a very interesting way of portraying different stories.

		<shortDescription>The Reflection of One's Self</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To make a movie like The Phantom of Liberty, the director has to be exceptionally brave and beyond organized in his own thoughts. The movie almost felt like a satire mocking everyday etiquette and morals, which have become so strongly embedded in our every day lives that we do not even question why using a bathroom is a private act, and eating is a social act. Both acts give joy to human body, so why we do not have public bathroom stations for socializing or partying? What Luis Bunuel is trying to show through his movie is that people are too stuck in their created standards of behavioral norms and morals. Some people get so deeply involved in being sophisticated and well behaved that by the end of the day they are nothing more than just public clowns. Why do people expect well educated men and women to restrict themselves in public more than the ordinary factory workers? Why should students in a police academy be serious and well behaved? Why would we think that a police officer has to always be serious with his or her emotions strictly under control? These and more questions can be drawn from The Phantom of Liberty, of which some have been discussed in the movie too. Probably not everyone could find patience for this movie because it has almost been made from a combination of short films, which have got a lot of details, and for some it might be a little too overwhelming. It is important to remember that this movie is a reflection of ourselves, and can be related to human kind no matter which year it would be watched in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Surrealism makes you think, does it not? If surrealism doesn't make you think, you've got to re-examine what you see this world to be. That aside, Bunuels' "Phantom of Liberty" executes this "make you think" persuasion with ease.Bunuel challenged what I thought I knew society to be time and time again over 90 or so minutes in ways that I never thought anyone would, but I was not surprised anyone did.From the awkward "dinner table" moments, to the weird sexual nature of this film, I thought I knew all the rules. Growing up in middle-class America, I have thought to myself time and time again over the years, "man, I could write a rule-book to society." Bunuel doesn't just challenge that belief of mine. He rips it right out of my brain and throws it in my face. Many directors have tried to emulate a surrealist approach effectively. It usually comes off as contrived or cheesy. "The Phantom of Liberty" is effectively an engaging film and an introspective one. This film is not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting and unique.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Luis Bunuel does a great job in portraying a surrealistic approach with a hidden meaning. The movie goes about showing things that could possibly occur in real life but are unexpected due to social standards. The point of The Phantom of Liberty is to convey why we have certain standards and values, one of which is why we judge a book by its cover. He wanted to break social order and approached this idea in a strange yet smart way, with going about one story to another. What made the movie so unique was that it did not center around a set of characters but quickly moved on from one person to the next. The plots or "tableaus" Bunuel shows us are treated in a fast timely manner but their meaning affects us in a huge way. The movie made me wonder as to why we have certain values; why do we go about judging a man as a pedophile because he is simply talking to a young girl? Why do we see certain things as right for adults yet wrong for kids? How invisible are children to their parents? Putting it into a simpler way, why do we see our standards and values as the right things and not the other way around? Yes the movie is too absurd at times but that is what makes it so interesting. I enjoyed watching as each story that came across was even stranger than the previous one.</fullReview>

It is funny yet serious how the way we dress, the roles we play or the job we have can have an effect on how others treat us or the access we can have to sources.

		<shortDescription>Thought provoking absurdity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Phantom of Liberty" makes clear how Surrealism can be a very effective genre to convey a message. Bunuel's Surrealism employs absurdity to present his messages. Whether it is two adults secretly endulging in postcards of French architecture, monks playing poker with religious symbols, parents that have "lost" their daughter while she talks to them, or a sniper gunning down innocent bystanders, who is convicted but released right after. It is this metaphorical absurdity that makes one think about what is seen. In fact, Bunuel forces you to think about what you see and you can't help but analyze. He touches upon a lot of topics, such as the meaning of liberty, social hypocrisy, appearance versus reality, incest, social etiquette and the thin veneer that outsiders put on someone's credibility. It is the way that Bunuel presents these topics, namely by placing these entities in the realm of absurdity, that he makes us think about them. By making the normal abnormal and making abnormal occurrences normal we are forced to think about the material at hand; Bunuel wants us to reevaluate our actions and thought processes and the paradigms that those are based upon. I believe that Bunuel's main message is to think of what we do in certain situations and ask ourselves if we shouldn't update our paradigms. This message is clear, but what Bunuel is exactly trying to say in certain tableaux is not always clear. The social hypocrisy of the two parents endulging in the photographs behind closed doors is obvious, and so is the message of freedom that the soldiers give off in the opening tableau: if this is the freedom that you're giving us, then keep it. But what is the message of the man that shoots all those people, consequently gets convicted, but walks? Does Bunuel want us to evaluate flaws in the justice system? Out of discussion came that Bunuel is out to show a man that has total freedom and even though he's convicted stays a free man. Bunuel wants us to evaluate the concept of freedom. The shooter is completely free, but is that the liberty that we want? The former question is rhetorical, but what freedom do we want exactly? Again, we need to constantly evaluate our paradigms. That is the main message I got from this movie. And if you don't understand what topic Bunuel is trying to address in a certain tableau, at least he has made you think about what you're seeing. "The Phantom of Liberty" is a movie that is an ongoing thought process that makes it a fun movie to watch and at times intellectually challenging, which increases the fun actually.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a breakthrough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the weirdest movie with lot of humors. With the style to keep creating the environment to mislead everybody, Luis Bunuel humorously expressed his ideas and, on some level, complains to us. The filming style is somehow a stunt to me as I don't really get the whole story at all.As the film seem has no main story or characters but all different stories are connecting via different person traveling from scene to scene. Although I don't like the story as it is not actually considered a story at all to me, I do feel the fun within the transition. The phantom of liberty, to some extend, reminds me of the movie "Babel." Similarly, "Babel" contains a few different stories connecting with a bullet. Compared to "The Phantom of liberty," "Babel" is a movie that makes more sense to me.In this movie, the parts that I like would be the humorous manner to show audience the ideas of Luis. With the crazy ideas like the sniper scene or the sexual scene in the hotel, Luis has changed the normal manner to express surrealism. Also, the ideas such as the policemen making fun with the professors or the opposite usage of dinning and using the restroom, somehow seemingly remind me of a question, "at what time and what reason, why we are following the same rule since the day we were born?" Although I am not hoping to use the toilet together at the dinner table, this indeed should not be a wrong thing to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hidden meanings in a surrealistic world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Luis Bunuel does an excellent job of working with hidden meanings in the long and somewhat complicated The Phantom of Liberty. It is surrealistic, which further helps with conveying hidden meanings, undertones and metaphors. The most interesting aspects, besides the obvious absurdity of everything that happens, is that it follows one persons story and then smoothly goes over to a new person as this one enters the first ones story - complicated, yes, but definitely interesting. We get to see everything from a lost daughter and a famous sniper to an absurd dinner and an incestuous relationship. The movie conveys the message of how sick some of our social codes, standards and values are. The most interesting aspect of the movie might however be the fact that Bunuel does (without our knowledge) involve the viewers, making us ashamed for what we do, see and assume during the movie. This is an excellent way to further show us that it is us, the viewers, the people in our society today, that creates the absurdities that is going on in our modern society every day. Besides being a bit complicated, The Phantom of Liberty is and excellent movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Monty Python without the Monty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If Monty Python had its hands on this script, you would have a series of hilarious, yet poignant skits done with over-the-top characters and, probably, silly accents, making you laugh out loud, but possibly causing you to miss the socio-political commentary within. It's easy to skip over the deeper meaning when you are rolling on the floor with laughter. But it would be brilliant. As it is, Bu?uel's Phantom of Liberty is still brilliant, but in a far more subdued way. The characters are played straight. Despite some parts being quite funny, there is no attempt whatsoever to play the comedy. The director simply shows you these absurd situations in a very direct light. In doing so, the viewer can't help but reflect on the arbitrariness of certain cultural norms and the absurdities that surround us in every day life. The scenes of this film are only loosely connected and there is no overall plot. In that sense, it reminded me of Richard Linklater's Slacker, (which was released 17 years later, but I saw first). The story will be moving along quite normally, when the camera decides to abandon that storyline and instead follow someone whom you thought was a very secondary character, whose story then becomes the focus. It's almost as if the cameraman and director became bored with the protagonist and decided to follow someone else. In the beginning, there is a frustration with being dragged from one scene to the next without any resolve of the previous scenes. But once that is let go of, and the larger implications and artistry of the picture become more apparent, the viewer can happily enjoy the surrealist ride. After all, how many stories do we pass by every day without acknowledgment? The thousands of people on the street we barely notice, the grocery clerk, the waiter, the ticket taker at the parking kiosk, all have their own story. It reminds me of a Stephen Wright stand-up bit in which he goes up to another table at a restaurant and rants "I am not just background for your life!" Each segment in this film is heavy with unspoken questions and commentaries all its own. (spoiler) In one, a sniper goes about killing people at random from the top of a building. After he is arrested and brought to trial, where he is sentenced to death, he is treated like a hero, a celebrity. This isn't too far off from reality, is it? And after all, he is just expressing his freedom. If he is truly free, why can't he go about killing at random? Jean Jacques Rousseau would have a lot to say about this particular scene, which perhaps most clearly demonstrates that liberty really is a phantom. In another, a little girl is decided to be missing and the authorities are notified, even though she is physically present and even interacts with the other characters in the scene. How often did we feel that same invisibility when we were young, or perhaps even still do as adults? Not to mention, the unnecessary bureaucratic hoops we are made to jump through to accomplish anything government related is really brought to the fore in this scene. And the scene with the commodes? Well, you'll have to see the movie.I recommend this film. I hope it opens up some minds and makes the viewer question the conventions and habits (or maybe appreciate them more, or both) of this odd human species we are.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's just put it out there, this movie is insane. That said, insanity is good. Insanity challenges us to believe in things we aren't supposed to because society tells you so. While a bit too confusing at times, and hard to follow, that is perhaps its main attraction. It isn't possible to review a surrealistic film without dissecting it by chapters. My personal favorite was when the girl's parents were called in at school because their daughter was missing only to find out she was with them the whole time. The parents kept shutting her up as they listened to the professor talk to them about her missing. The plot thickens and they go to the Police Dpt with their daughter to file her missing. It is hysterical and yet exquisitely irreverent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the first Luis Bunuel film I have seen and it certainly will not be the last. Each set of circumstance are lightly touched upon before twisting into a new scenario with an equal everyday vibe yet with a new set of surrealist injections. What makes this film so wonderful to me is how each mundane situation takes a very unexpected turn to a humorous situation; I was constantly waiting for the next muse from Bunuel and crew. The wonderfully entertaining sarcasm and witty plugs that some viewer might not catch make this film remind me of Monty Python style with a more passive and less obvious link between the surrealism and the average middle class life. Cultural relativism is pressed in this film as everything is truly relative to one's culture, let alone oneself, in this big strange realm we call life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoying the breaking social rules</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While watching this movie, it is hard to not laugh at certain points, because some things are just too absurd to grasp if you compare it to real life. How funny it is, the ways we have structured our society, the walls has closed in on us that we hardly can move without breaking a social rule or two. I used to be ashamed when I was younger when my friends were goofing around in public, then I came to realize I don't really care. I wonder if they are still goofing around now when we are adults. The illusions of being an adult, that you should behave, talk and do things in certain ways. I guess some people just realize that it's fake and silly, and then become a happier person. They connect with themselves and find out what they really want from life, as an individual. More free (within legal boundaries of course). Too many people wake up later in life I believe, wondering what they have been doing, realizing that they are really not that happy. Abruptly changing things in their lives, having life crisis, the one's you read about in the magazines. Like waking up from a coma. I guess it is hard to break lose from when friends and family are following the path that ought to be followed. You will perhaps be treated as an outsider? The thing is that people don't realize is that no matter how "different" you are, there are others just like you out there. You are never alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I want to start out by saying what I really loved about this film. I love the surrealism. What I appreciate the most is the director's creativity and use of transition shots and his setups. I love that he can take a simple subject matter and twist your thoughts swaying it towards another meaning taken out of context. I think a lot of people do this in reality, we think we hear something and our imagination takes us to the worst case scenario.The cinematography is fantastic. I love the colors and the beautiful shots leading us from one scene to the next.I'm sure what I'm about to say next is going to have Bu?uel fans throwing cyber tomatoes at me. The first few story lines I was totally engaged in and felt like "Ha... there's a laugh at me for thinking that's what it was." Classic example would be the little girl with the photos. I felt very bored very quickly with this movie, mainly because I didn't feel connected to any of the characters nor did I feel satisfied with any of the story arcs reaching a denouement. I'm am certain I will have someone comment on this review saying, "How can you not see the artistic value in this movie." I assure you that I see a lot of artistic value and pure genius of the filmmaker's vision for the movie and with that I cannot argue. For me, I tend to like stories that have a beginning, middle and end. I was left unsatisfied with the ending of this movie. Just not my cup of tea.</fullReview>

Luis Bu?uel's mind is certainly one of the most brilliant of world cinema. This great Spanish filmmaker clutter whole idea of the real world through dreams, animals, and disruption of ordinary time.Customs, moral codes, ancestor, logic and behavior patterns are broken with impeccable cold blood. Perhaps to intend us, to convince us, that we can live another different world, just rearranging the basis. That enormous show how we support and build our normal behavior.The opening scene is a Goya painting and finishing with an incredible ostrich trying to hide from us in a zoo.

		<fullReview>Totally mind boggling film, with many different scenarios, time periods, many of which seem unrelated to one another. However, they're all linked to one another. Very difficult film to walk away from for a bathroom or water break, as one can easily become lost and not know what's going on. This film basically pokes fun at society and it's character, and our ability to quickly judge and misinterpret certain situations. It definitely has a huge comedic element and one can lose track with it's humor, and miss any subliminal message the director was trying to convey. There are some jaw dropping instances with mild bathroom humor, some sexual s&amp;m role play scenes, that at first appear just for fun, and can be shocking in a comedic way to certain audiences, but overall the film was a huge eye opener at least for me, the s&amp;m scene for one, the man participating in it, was also the last I would have expected to engage in it, that scene was "don't judge a book by it's cover" respectively. Some scenes can be raunchy but definitely humorous, but it at least he keeps you engaged in the movie. Very diverse cast, background..it's worth a watch at best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bunuel's surrealistic approach may leave some people confused and/or frustrated. I believe that his message is that "we", as people from all different societies, socioeconomic status, cultural backgrounds, and religious beliefs, are bound by our society's social norms. Bunuel takes these "norms" and somewhat literally, shits on them. He is saying that to truly be free, we must also be free of prejudice, the idea of barbarism vs. civilization, and free from sexual boundaries. Though, as many of us know, this will probably never happen, it is a bold statement, but one that the world is not yet prepared to undergo. Aside from the underlying meaning, I found this film to be quite humorous and enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Phantom of The Liberty" is incredible movie with interesting and engaging parts. From the opening shot you might think that the movie will be about Napoleon's army invading the Spain. But as we see later, movie switches many many times.From the first moment Luis Bunuel and "Phantom of The Liberty" shows us details that talk about freedom that Napoleon was supposed to bring to Spain. Unfortunately that was not the case. The ides of freedom are perfectly delivered through speech, visual and sound components of the first scenes. When the Spanish man is about to be shot screams "Long live chains" we get the idea of people opposing Napoleon.Through out the whole movie, unexpected things kept happening. My favorite part of the film was, the part in the Hotel, with the girl from previous part and with few priests. From the beginning of that part when I saw priests I thought this will be more slow part of the film. But then unexpected thing happened, they all tarted playing cards betting their relics.In sum up I can say that the movie left good impression, it was amusing, entertaining and funny at most of the parts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Surrealism is the movie equivalent of the storytelling of a first grader, the plot goes backwards forwards and changes as frequently as their freshly soiled underpants. The Phantom of Liberty was full of soiled underpants, with every sketch changing often enough to give a viewer a taste of a new story. Each story has a main character whom it follows, and we see as a side character from the previous scene. There is nothing wrong with this formula, in fact Monty Python had done it all the time. The real problem was that its attempts to be funny were just kind of lame. I laughed while watching that movie as many times as I have watching nearly an entire season of "That 70s Show." If you were as cynical and pessimistic as I am, then you are correct in guessing, maybe once. The movie doesn't really deserve a score either, because Surrealism is about as silly as it will get, and it really depends on tastes. Personally I don't look for themes in every detail, I just take it at face value.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Phantom of Liberty", directed by Luis Bunuel, deals with social values and the frustration these bring along in many ways. The plot switches from dream visions to reality which makes the movie a mind blowing experience. Bunuel, a Surrealist, puts focus on the social conventions society lives in and how to escape them. Switching from dream illusions to reality he depicts the ways of freedom that can be achieved. By doing so, Bunuel manages it to be playful and funny, yet the movie depicts serious examples of freedom. It seems these examples are totally random and not connected to one another which gives the viewer enough room for interpretation and own thoughts about what real freedom is about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Luis Bunuel places the elements of this film to take us to another perspective of seeing life. While this film surely portrays a rather unusual side to the normal living of people through a series of episodes, Bunuel does not try to show or express a form of anarchy within the film,in order to let the film speak for itself as we see the life's of these characters play out amongst us. As the film shows us how freedom can be taken for granted and used to interpret the abnormal to normal actions of our common society, we are also mocked by the context of the scenes. As we assume the worst in specific details for example on the second scene, we quickly assume that the mysterious creepy looking man who gives pictures to the little girls is a bad man, only to find out later that they were nice pictures of landscapes and nature. Bunuel makes us see that we as a society have this idea or mentality to always assume the worst in people. As the film continues onto the third scene, we are shown how we seem to portray the educated, nicely dressed individual more warmly and less mysterious. Only to get schocked when this man is mentally crazy. Throughout the film, we get a hidden message in order to demonstrate the surrealism of our society. A great film that simply tries to show us that all of the scenes in the film can possibly happen in real life. It makes us question the why of our way of living. Bunuel overall challenges our minds with this interesting film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There were some memorable scenes in this film which make one question everyday bourgeois reality, book-ended by the episodes of the French firing squad in 1808 and the unseen riot (perhaps portending massacre). It is almost imperceptible how the scenes are linked together, but a higher understanding of logic as well as the subconscious is at play and it is masterful. I'm currently reading the book "Thinking, Fast and Slow," a theory of cognition by Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahnman, and I see many of Kahnman's examples of how we fool ourselves illustrated in the film. For example, being primed for one type of association, certain areas of our brain are activated, as in the postcard scene, and then our expectations played with. The film does then naturally lead us to question our daily life and whether there isn't something surreal about things we do every day and take for granted. The arbitrariness of it makes for a possibility of freedom, yet we can also see the critique of unlimited freedom. This is everyone's dilemma, and it's not clear the film gives us any easy answers other than to examine life for ourselves. The prospects of social or revolutionary change do not seem optimistic. I feel there is much more to this film than I can glean on one viewing and I will definitely be watching it again to think about it some more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bunuel tackles this topic in his film The Phantom of Liberty. If you don't already know Bunuel is the father of surrealism and this film is no exception to his surrealist traits. Strange things such as the mailman delivering the mail to you at three o'clock in the morning in your bedroom are not unusual occurrences in the Phantom of Liberty. Made of shorts episodes called Tableaux, Bunuel addresses the quintessential question of what would we do with that freedom if we had it, in addition to addressing social issues. To me the movie initially seemed to be a funny comedy that Bunule had made for fun, but I soon began to realize that these funny Tableaux had lots of meaning. The most memorable one was a group of soldiers driving an armored tank down the street trying to locate a fox. When the soldiers come across the lady and ask her if she had seen a fox I busrt out with laughter not realizing the meaning behind the hilarious encounter. Upon Further view I was able to see that Bunuel was criticizing the things we dangerously do as humans. Sometimes we look so hard , we actually create an absurd conflict over noting. The soldiers in the tank were a metaphor for people searching for things that aren't there. I feel that humans we tend to create illusions that arnt necessarily there. I felt as if Bunuel were telling us that by doing this we're creating a dangerous situation in which we search for something that we will never find. Furthermore the movies made me feel embarrassed of all the preconceived notions I had about things. In a scene where a man meets two girls at a playground, gives them pictures and tells them not to tell their parents I instantly knew the guy was a pervert showing nude pictures of himself to the children. However when we actually see the pictures are famous landmarks Bunuel is letting us know through his comical way that we as people have been programmed by society to be judgmental and come to conclusions without getting a proper understanding of the situation. This made me question myself and caused me to think deep about what our preconceived notions.</fullReview>

It presents the idea of what one person will do with unlimited freedom, which in this case the sniper ends up killing the poets at his own will.

This was only the second of his movies which I had seen in a film class, and I was amazed at how he is able to capture the absurdity of life without making it overly absurd and still managing to maintain somewhat of a serious tone to it. What I want to mean by this is that he allows the audience to see that many of the things we think of as proper and normal are often very absurd and that even the way in which we tend to judge people right away because of the cultural notions that we have been raised with can be quite exaggerated and absurd. And yet, though he shows this absurdity, he does not put a comical tone to it. More than that, he places a rather incredulous feel to it so that we can see for ourselves what our "manners" and views might look like to other people. Therefore, he sets up this movie in a way in which we will not put ourselves as spectators of what we are seeing, but rather even as the characters themselves. Many of the tableus that I saw in this film, for example, left me thinking about how often I judge people for things that even I do. More than that, it made me put myself into the shoes of these characters and let me feel what they would be thinking. This made me even more aware of the way in which we see ourselves.Bunuel, more than anything, lets us analyze ourselves, our actions and our thoughts through his movies. For me, it was an eye opener to how judging we can be simply because we do not open ourselves up to learning about other cultures and learning to understand that we are not all the same. We all have different beliefs and different ways to do things, but that does not mean that just because what we do and think is different, we are right and they are wrong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Our funny weird society</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Really enjoyed this film! Luis Bunuel really did a great job at going through our everyday life and making fun of how weird we can be. Every tableaux was filled with unexpected surrealist scenes that made us the audience laugh, or shriek with horror. Two extremes that made the film that much more interesting, for example the scene when the young boy uncovers his old aunt! I'm sure I heard a few laughs because I don't think anyone expected that coming. Another was when the "missing girl" was there the whole time, Bunuel did an amazing job at expressing how we sometimes shun people around us. The scene that really stood out was the shooter scene, especially that court part of it. Because I knew it would probably had a twist I thought oh he's probably going to end up free, then when then the judge read "guilty" and then said "deth penalty" but which actually meant your free to go? I thought wow, it's a fact of nature we are ALL going to die, so why do judges say free to go? When we're actually free to go die, because at the end we all do. So it was really interesting to me how Bunuel interpreted that idea.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dream Sequence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bu?uel's "Phantom of Liberty" is nothing more than a dream sequence into reality. In the film, we meet characters quite rapidly, in which they confront some kind of crisis, in which each character is connected through the other in some unique way. I must say, Bu?uel has this style to thrust us into another characters life?as soon as we were getting accustomed with the first; he doesn't give us the time to hang around...and examine each one thoroughly. Bu?uel's unique belief that cinema has its own time..that it doesn't tend to show normally, definitely added some kind of spice to the film...it kept the audience questioning the scenarios...over and over. But through the thick and thin of this movie, one comes to realize its masterful creation, and its conveyance of only artistic wakening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Phantom of Liberty, a great film that raises many questions about society and shows how hypocrite the world is as we say one thing and do another. It states that the world is repressed by the many taboos of society but it also questions what we would do with absolute freedom. Many actions in this film goes contrary to how people normally react. This film wants the audience to forget about the way we've been seeing things and to question what would happen if we reacted a different way. It also wants us to be aware of conventions we take for granted.A great film that has humor and reflection combined. I enjoyed this film very much, and I would recommend it to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Phantom of Liberty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you look up the word "surrealism" I bet the name Luis Bunuel will pop up. Luis Bunuel directed the Phantom of Liberty. In this movie, Bunuel does not have a direct plot, but used a series of episodes (called a tableaux) to describe different characters in different scenarios. From the statue hitting a French soldier to people sitting on toilets at chairs This movie caught me off guard but made me laugh like I never laughed before. What I liked about the movie was how Bunuel combined both humor and surrealism to make the movie very vividly and the way we, as human beings, tend to believe. If you like comedy, then this is the movie for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It was very funny with a lot of underlying symbolism. It brought up many questions. I thought it was clever how Bunuel led you somewhere, just to let you know you had no idea what was going on. This really pointed out the flaws of perception and expectations people have. For example the pictures given to the little girl in the beginning. I think it was the fact the older man told her not to show adults the pictures that raised a red flag in my mind. However, to say I was shocked to see pictures of monuments, would be an understatement. Bunuel also humorously shows the relativity of proper etiquette, in the scene where the dinner party is really a communal, bathroom, in which it is inappropriate to talk about being hungry. These are just a few examples of the provoking and funny ways Bunuel brings about underlying issues. The film left me thinking about things in a different way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Phantom of Liberty is a moving and fun film to share with friends. Beware of all the interesting events that will occur, because of the many lives and events that transpire as the camera moves from one person to another, while continually following them through their day. It is like watching a game of freeze tag and everyone gets a turn. The series of episodes, also called Tableau are so funny I will have to watch this movie again. I would suggest that the idea of doing whatever you want, is highly represented in this film so hold on to your seat and open your mind.This film gives you permission to be silly, funny and inventive, just don't try any of this at home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"What would we do with absolute freedom?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With this movie, Luis Bunuel once again criticizes our society - in this case, our taboos and freedom. His movie consists of a series of episodes and follows a series of characters. Each tableau deals with the same question: What would we do with absolute freedom.With a combination of humor and surrealism, he criticizes our morals and our attitude toward different topics such as religion and freedom.His scenes include a young boy who is in love with his old aunt and wants to see her naked (where Bunuel plays with our expectations/imagination and reveals her to have a young and beautiful body); two girls who get approached by an old man who gives them pictures as a present and asks them not to show them to anyone. We follow the story of one of the girls, who does give them to her parents - who act shocked when seeing the pictures (when we get to see them, we realize that they do not as we expected show inappropriate things, but only famous French buildings such as the Sacre-Coeur). In another scene he makes fun of our habits and rules concerning the dinner table and the bathroom, and converts them into the opposite - people are sitting together on toilets, and excuse themselves to go do the unspeakable - eat. Other characters he uses for his critique are a girl who is overseen by a teacher and ends up being reported as lost while even being present at the police station, under everyone's nose, a poet killer who randomly kills people from his windows and ends up being sentenced to death by law - but is prominently asked for his autograph by the people outside. The movie ends with the police officers planning to kill everyone in the protest outside: with the protesters screaming "Down with Liberty".This movie is an interesting and unique experience. Not only is it special in the way it tells many different stories, but also the content is original and oftentimes funny. Bunuel makes us laugh about our own morals, depicting them as the exact opposite.Through his movie he shows us that: if you were to follow anyone, you would get an equally surreal story. Not for no reason does the movie start with the line "If this is what freedom is we want our chains back." It makes you think about the values and morals we have, and raises the question if we could even handle it if we had no restrictions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surrealism and Luis Bu?uel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Phantom of Liberty, in essence, is not a single film in the traditional sense, as Bu?uel moves away from cinematic convention by breaking the rules of filmmaking. Thus, the principal distinction from other films is that Bu?uel draws the audience's attention to the film by presenting an idea that he slowly makes more interesting by introducing additional details that build up the intrigue. However, when the intrigue enters the climax he simply leaves the story where it become most stimulating. At this point, he starts over with another less interesting story that moves forward with new intrigue that once again intensifies, and as before he tosses away the intrigue by starting over. Each moment in the film surrounds a surreal element that causes a conflict as a result. These moments seem dreamlike, but with enough reality to keep the audience guessing of what will happen next. For example, there is a man who tries to go to sleep and is visited by an enormous rooster, and a postman who delivers a letter. Later, the man visits a doctor, as he found the night extremely disturbing to which the doctor responds that he must see a psychoanalyst. To convince the doctor the man shows the letter that he received from the postman that visited him during the night in his bedroom. Cleverly, Bu?uel displays the workings of the surreal in the subconscious, as he let reality converge with dream. This surrealist take by Bu?uel on the extremes of freedom is one that will not be forgotten since it offers a unique perception of contemporary society.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What I really enjoyed about this film was how it caught me off guard at many points. There were several times where I thought I knew what was happening or going to happen, only to have something completely different occur.A specific example of this was at the start of the film when there is a gentleman who gives photos to two little girls. Up until the moment the photos are actually revealed, I honestly thought that they were dirty pictures and that the man was a pervert. Another example is when there was a table set for people to use the toilet together. What made it even more ridiculous was when it showed the man getting up to go eat dinner in a small private room.I guess what all this is really showing is how ridiculous our own expectations are. We can only see part of the story, and yet we insist on believing that what we know is what is right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Phantom of liberty seems to play a trick on my mind, but in a good sense, its surrealism comes off believable. The artist (Bunuel),questions society, figuratively through his film and in return,I would hope, would want his audience to take a step back and say to themselves or ,others "I wonder what I would do if I had that much freedom." after watching, I questioned a lot of things society tries to hide, and what I would do if life gave me so much freedom to do whatever I wanted with no consequence, or anyone to answer to. Not leaving out that this film was quite humorous and it played with paradoxes in certain scenes, it touched on a lot of serious points involved in the real world at the time, and even today. I deeply appreciate this film and the artist who created it. Kudos.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the Phantom of Liberty offers a distillation of Bu?uel himself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Luis Bunuel creates an episodic film that takes you the audience from character to character and from event to event. You even see animals walking through a man's bedroom, soldiers conducting military exercises in an inhabited area, a missing girl stands before her parents even as they ineffectively attempt to determine her whereabouts, and an assassin is found guilty, then applauded and led to freedom. They don't get much more surreal than that. Its an interesting movie that makes you think about your morals and striations that society put on people making them taboo. And how at times people are blinded by people in power and badges, titles and what not that we forget that their human and make mistakes. Its truly an interesting movie that breaks down what being a human is and what society does to who we are and how powerful it can be to either break a person to build one. The director is also in the film an opens as a friar (Bunuel) is put in front of the firing squad and is a victims .The movie is In French with English subtitles. Visually The Phantom of Liberty offers something like a stroll through an art museum's section with surrealism, which suggests that Luis Bu?uel is not simply a film director trying to tell a story in the traditional sense. Through Bu?uel's direction the audience can experience a plasticity in the manner the film moves along, but it is idiosyncratic in contrasts to the other cinematic geniuses such as Kurosawa, Fellini, and Bergman among others. It is the peculiarity of Bu?uel that makes him unique, as he did not try to do what has already been made. Instead he took the step into the unexplored and brought back from the deepest corners of the human psyche several experiences that none have ever been able to match. Thus, the Phantom of Liberty offers a distillation of Bu?uel himself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really good movie, I enjoyed how Luis Bunuel makes his movies in tableaux and each is really interesting as well. Although some of the scenes were a little odd or we can say with some kind of surrealism we notice that some of the odd rare events that happen in the movie happen in the film but could also happen in real life, for example, on of the tableaux one of the protagonist is in bed then suddenly animals start to appear out of no where in his bedroom, this could be an example of an event that would be extremely rare to happen but might happen which made me think that what Bunuel might try convey to his audience is that life is unexpected and full of surprises that we are not fully aware of. Phantoms of Liberty is a great movie overall, what makes it especially good is that when the camera shifts to many characters whole forgetting about the actors before he/she encounters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Phantom Of Liberty" is a treat for the anyone who watches this film because it shows a different side to everything that people experience in everyday life. For Luis Bunuel cinema has its own logic and laws. What one perceives in everyday life is only because such perception was created by some people and to this day it continues. However Luis Bunuel plays with the audience and fools the expectations. To not spoil the movie one should be brief about the film and what it is trying to convey though I will say it is a huge treat and mind boggling film. For me it opened my eyes to a new way of thinking about a lot of issues that people face today. I am very grateful I had a chance to see this film.

		<fullReview>This film is unlike any other film I have seen before. It was very interesting to see how many people are connected without even knowing it. Each tableau showed how one person somehow interacted with another and then we got to follow the lives of a new person. I also got to see that despite someone's appearance everyone has their own problems going on in their life. The surrealism was humorous to me and made me think. In one specific tableau, a teacher and parents are looking for a "lost child" even though she was right there before their eyes. It was funny because they would speak to her but think she was missing. This shows that adults sometimes can neglect children and their presence. It made me think about all the times that I have seen parents disregard their children. Each tableau had a meaning of its own but the movie as a whole showed me that although unlimited freedom seems fantastic, ultimately it can lead to horrible situations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Humor Is The Best Teacher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Luis Bu?uel's masterful satire on modern freedom and everyday rituals is both comedic and absurd. It provides example upon example of modern conventions turned on their ends and suggests them as ordinary occurrence. This brilliant use of context is humorous for the most part but implies the need to evaluate the societal customs and formalities as arbitrary and often times ridiculous when taken out of its comfort zone. One particular scene that switches the polite protocol of going to the bathroom and eating at the dining room table make "The Phantom Of Liberty" a must watch. Elsewhere a shooter in a high rise fires upon innocent citizens. The injection of such occurrences provides a gateway for further discussion on the real value of freedom. It asks for us to question, what freedoms we really have and how we make up our days. As society becomes more insular and normal activities are taken for granted, it seems easier for stereotypes and prejudices to take hold providing for greater application to modern society. For example, a great scene of a man handing pictures to a pair of young girls at a playground immediately triggers a sense of panic in viewers, assuming the worst that they would be of something lewd. Similarly, the reactions of the children's parents are as expected, the result being the firing of the nanny and dismissal of the children. Such a scene underscores Buneul's questioning of modern society and its practices and asks the viewers, are you really free? Or is it an illusion?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Phantom of Liberty is an episodic film that focuses different narratives.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Phantom of Liberty is a great episodic film by Luis Bunuel. Since there are several episodes, I'll talk about the 2nd episode. We see a man in the park that hands over some pictures to the little girls and asks them not to tell anyone about the pictures. Automatically we, the audience assume that the guy is a pervert. The little girl goes home and shows the pictures to her parents and that's when we realize that the pictures are nothing but postcards of French tourist attractions. As a result, the nanny gets fired! There's some twisted humor in this episode and all the other episodes. Bunuel raises questions about us and our everyday lives. Do we really make decisions for our norms, standards, habits or are they already dictated to us? And if so by whom? The Phantom of Liberty is a great film that questions everything and makes us look at things, things that are considered "NORMAL" in a different way and ask ourselves why do we even do it to begin with! He doesn't suggest answers but he does for sure make us question routines and normality. These are all great issues and subject matters for any individual to ask him/herself. It's as if we all live in a society that tells us what to do, what to wear, what to say, what to think... but when do we get to think for ourselves? I love how he approaches all these serious subject matters in a funny and interesting way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Easily one of the most unconventional films I've seen. In Luis Bu?uel's The Phantom of Liberty you are asked to question everyday customs that are universally accepted and almost never questioned. The amazing thing about this film isn't just the specific social constructs Bunuel presents to us, it is the way in which he does it. The Phantom of Liberty does not have A linear plot. It is made up of multiple tableaux or French episodes some of which are based on Bunuel's own life experiences and are all linked by a character from a previous vignette.The subject matter is vast and although there is light humor it's not quite a comedy. There really isn't a singular category to try to fit this movie into, it defies categorization. It deserves to be seen and appreciated for what it is though, which is an honest and interesting portrait of humans and what is considered "normal". It's as relevant as it was almost 40 years ago.</fullReview>

The movie is easy to fallow however the actors and the situations are changing all the time, so we never known how it is going to end. Who has knowledge about Bunuel and his works, knows that in his mind it is reality. For instance: looking for the "lost girl" at the police, when the girl sits there, the toilets besides the chair at the kitchen table etc.The movie made me think about human rights and freedom, how we think we are not controlled by anyone, however: it is not true. We are surrounded with rules and people who control our life. Is freedom just illusion? Who knows. Don't try to find any logics in this movie, just enjoy it.

		<fullReview>I was not really a fan of the film although I don't think it was all bad because it is definitely a surrealism movie that brought up really good meaning of the real life. The movie itself reflects on our everyday life. Luis Bu?uel criticize religions, the bourgeois society and the norms and morals of society in this movie. It also shows that we expect things to be in certain ways, but Bu?uel shows us that the society does not have to be all black and white. He use humor to show us that. I did not like that movie have so many tableaux which is a french word for the episodes in movies. Although every episode had an important message. One tableaux shows that we people past judgment to fast on things and each other. Bu?uel is making fun of us, because I thought and I bet the audience thought it was nasty pictures the parents was looking at. Another episode is the young man and the old lady scene. What this episode say is the idea of a young man and an old lady together gives us "shivering". The reason why is because we has an image of how a relationship is suppose to "be". The fact that people are saying that age do not matter between two people people that love each other. Then why do we get "chills" when we see young people together with old people? In our society when old people are together with young people we instantly think they are together for the goodness of money and we have a hard time believing that they are in love. It is because we have an image of how things are supposed to be in our society. In the same scene we get to see the naked lady body and we the audience expected her body to be all wrinkled but it wasn't, which is typical Bu?uel to make fun of us. The classroom episode with the police officers acting like a bunch of children and teasing the teacher is a also an important scene. When you think about this scene and trying to connect with our every day life is that as soon as we see police officers we immediately give them respect. But when you see how they behave in the classroom like children teasing the teacher your respect for them lowers. And for them to have a bigger supervisor watching them is ridiculous. It's like; do we put our safety and trust in these kids"? One of my favorite episode that I think Bu?uel did a great job, sending a message is the "Lost girl" episode. The message that he is trying to point out is that, as a child we feel ignored and invisible by our parents. The episode with the commissioner of Police make us ask ourselves. How can this man that is supposed to be the chief of protection, a possible lunatic that talks to his dead sister be a good role model to our society? When both men say they are commissioner of Police. This reflect on our society's political. What makes a politician a politician? They all pretend because who is really telling the truth? Politicians is telling people what they want to hear. That is what I think Bu?uel is trying to tell us. According to Bu?uel cinema should not necessary avoid the physical world of reality. That is why most of his movie are critical towards the middle class morality and mocking religions. This movie made be see things as it really is in real life. There is definitely a truth in what Bu?uel is showing us. Our society, culture creates a picture of what we think is right and wrong that thing is suppose to be like this and that but Bu?uel shows us that we need to think outside the box and explore our freedom more. On the other hand have more freedom and exploring it could also create chaos. But I do agree with Bu?uel that we should have at least a more open minded illusion of liberty, freedom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a bold example of the social commentary Bu?uel's films are known for. The film is not a linear narrative, but instead a collection of situations that lend themselves to social satire. The sketches are connected by multiple transient characters who at some point cross paths, allowing the director to resume following one, and start following another. The antics on screen gradually escalate in eccentricity as the film progresses, leaving you to guess how the current scene could possibly be outdone by the next.The key to understanding and appreciating this movie is accepting the fact that it is a surreal film. The best scenes are irrational in nature, but hysterically entertaining if you allow yourself to enjoy it. However, if you are the hypercritical type, this film will be best enjoyed in the company of equally hypercritical friends, and access to an endless supply of alcohol.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best satires of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Luis Bu?uel is one of my favorite directors of all time and this movie stands out as one of his best offerings. This movie is reminiscent of Slackers, for those of you who hate watching older movies. It takes several characters, it follows them for a while but in a certain point of the story the camera will follow a different character and you'll forget the one you were following before, capiche? This is a social satire about the idea behind the word freedom and how Bu?uel suggest we actually need some rules to follow through life if we don't want to live inside a zoo.The way the director plays with our minds is superb. He always makes you think the contrary of what's happening on screen. For example in the first tableaux we know a guy, that can be a very nice guy, but the audience, giving the circumstances of how he's introduced, think he's a pedophile. We don't give the guy the benefit of the doubt, and this is one of the aspects why Bu?uel is so great doing what he does in this movie, he makes us judge, he makes us think about the nastiest things you could think about, he makes us go deep inside our brains. Not only that but the sexual innuendos in this movie are really direct and powerful, and it not hesitate to put a critique on the church and the people behind it (all about the gambler monks).This movie depicts society as is and it tears it apart, we are all sometimes so hypocrite we don't feel we're behaving that way. Sometimes we all like to be spanked in our bedrooms by our significant other, maybe you know someone that feels sexual attraction for an uncle or you have plenty of friends who wear Ed Gein's or Charles Manson's t-shirts just because they think they are "cool". A lot of people like to do all this and more, but nobody talks about it.To me the best scene involves toilet seats and a dinner table, you'll be speechless. Another sequence that got me was the one involving a sniper and how he becomes this media darling after he shoots several innocent people on the streets without any reason at all. If you're tired of Tom Cruise and his great hair saving the world, go and rent this wonderful piece of cinema and make your grey matter a favor.PS: You won't see cathedral photos the same way never again after you watch Phantom Of Liberty, trust me! PS2: If you like horror movies the last tableaux will delight you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the genius Surrealist films of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Phantom of Liberty is a genius Surrealist film that uncovers deeper truths seeded in society. This movie questions what freedom is and if we truly had it, what would we do with it? This film takes shots a normal conventions of society that we ourselves have never questioned. In a genius fashion he takes shots at court systems, police force, and doctors. This movies message is simple, it questions our society and how we make up ourselves day in and day out. Our conventions of privacy, dinner, and sexual innuendos are all put to the test in this film. Bunuel is a genius in his craft and in this film he makes no exception. This film even made me question what I do everyday. The things I submit to everyday and I realize I am not truly free. As to what I would do with true freedom though, I do not know. The Surrealist approach of this film made the message subtle and very clear for anyone to understand. A real triumph by Luis Bunuel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Personally, i found this movie hilarious. I believe a lot of this director's ideas were stolen by some of the American comedic directors during that time. Im not going to specify as i do like those directors as well. This movie shows that some film directors are true observers of their own species. Not only do i believe Bunuel is an extremely intelligent guy but i also believe that he pushed the limits of contemporary cinema with his take on the modern person's mentality. This is truly a game changer and made me appreciate foreign films much more in terms of their comedic appeal. I would recommend to people who like dark humor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very well done movie, not too much nonsense just the right amount. Bunuel likes to talk about our society and what it depends on, without much judgment he makes fun of everything and everyone. This movie just shows everyday life with a little twist, WHAT IF. This shows that reality and dreams can become one, which is crazy this life or this life, no one truly knows. Every episode in this movie as no real reason but still has its main point when you think or even discuss the episodes. He he questioning reality, what it made me think of was,is this life real? or will tonight be real... Every episode is funny and unexpected either like a dream or just crazy. Surealism i usually am not a fan of but this was made with perfect details for every episodes. The main question is: who decided fat people are ugly. who said school is important. WHO SAID WE HAVE TO FALLOW SOCIETY and the stupidness of the life we are meant to live.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think I love Bunuel. At least I certainly loved this movie. It was incredibly amusing and upbeat while all the while making some tremendously profound points about the social norms we abide by without really knowing why. The film suggests the hypocrisy in and ludacrisy inherent to relationships, sex, politics, table manners, religion, parenting. What makes this movie genius(happens to be what makes a lot of movies genius)is its subtlety. Bunuel is not shoving anything down our throats. He simply exposes. And that leaves us as audience members to be open and to receive without feeling like opinions are being forced upon us. The movie is the height of surrealism, but it is not dizzying surrealism. Bunuel's style is fresh, clean and efficient. Very easy movie to watch, very entertaining in a smart non-mind-numbing kind of way. A bonus, this film is so loaded that I feel as though I could watch it again and again and keep getting more out of it. Excellent excellent stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Luis Bunuel is an amazing director, this movie is not only entertaining, but makes you think and it challenges you. This not your typical movie, this movie follows many main characters and challenges you to think about what is happening, then completely fools you with something else. Bunuel who is a Surrealist film maker, knows how to tie everything and make you think that some thing can happen even though they are very unlikely to do so, but you go along with it, without questioning it. In other words this is a very random movie. There is not set plot to it, it starts out by telling a story about the Spanish being conquered by Napoleon in the 17th century, the goes to "modern day" France. It was gives you a theme of that people have been programmed to think a certain way. He then goes out and tries to play with this notion in this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Stunning Composition of Comedic Darkeness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first glance this film is Bunuel's masterpiece of surrealist comedy. Many of the scenes link together fluidly making the viewing experience all the more enjoyable for the audience. Bunuel's use of secondary characters to tie the film together creates the illusion of a a sort of of "six-degrees-of separation"effect on the audience. Though thoroughly surreal and mystifying, this film never creates the impression if being intelligible; we accept its nonsense whole-heartedly and with a good laugh. With all of its surrealism it is amazing to note just how easy Bunuel allows the viewer to use his/her imagination. None of the characters are particularly developed, they act more as archetypes or models for certain people in society. Because of this facet, the viewer can add his/her own experience to the story. Most interestingly, despite the comedic elements of the film, this film also showcases the darker aspects of society and exposes the hypocrisy of pre-conceived notions and norms of society. Many of the scenarios presented show a dark side of human nature and the perversion of human thought: whether is murder or the way that humans conceive the idea of modesty and so-called "appropriateness." Bunuel does a wonderful job in trying to bring this hypocrisy forward through a hilariously funny medium.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is not your ordinary film you would catch every weekend, but we can definitely relate to these events by encountering them in our daily lives. This film doesn't follow it's basic movie pattern beginning, middle and end, but skips from one scene to the other. During the film it has you wondering and asking questions to why are they're doing what they're doing and what does that have to do with what just happened? Eventually you begin to experience that this film doesn't go much with what is being shown to us the audience. Bu?uel was very artistic and open minded making each scene by illustrating every detail there needs to be captured.This film was humorous for its unique scenes. I strongly felt the connection between each scene with our everyday life situations. Without giving too much away, what was shown in each scene were at times dramatic or silly because we don't really imagine or experience them as we did in the film. I enjoyed it and this director is very thoughtful and creative with his illusions and imagination. To add, there wasn't really a soundtrack in the background but didn't need one because the actors actions made us feel what was needed to get out; straight to the point.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bunuel's spin on cultural relativism in "The Phantom of Liberty" really shows the "what if"'s in our everyday lives. It rises questions of why we are the way we are (i.e. passing judgments to certain situations or people, stereotyping, jumping to conclusions). Answer - it's what our society what has taught us to be looked up, or down, upon. The different episodes makes the audience laugh or snicker a bit because they think, "When would this happen? It's IMPOSSIBLE!" Bunuel's message is that these occurrences ARE possible and they can happen any time."The Phantom of Liberty" makes me think of the United States' society in the present day and how strong their judgment is and quickly establishing certain things as wrong or right. If whatever someone does is looked as as wrong or unreal, you are quickly badly judged, and vice versa. This film really makes you think of the craziest things that could possibly happen to you in your life, and the scary ability that those events can occur in anyone's everyday life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bunuel's warning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "The Phantom of Liberty", the Surrealist Spanish filmmaker Bunuel takes the public in a hectic ride during which protagonists keep emerging. In his "absurd", yet clever, methods of character presentation, Bunuel tricks the audience by demonstrating how easily we are deceived by appearance. Thus, Bunuel warns society about the "irrational" tendency of classifying individuals according to their social status or behavior. For instance, because he is without kids on a playground, the man giving pictures to the children is instantly considered ?by the audience, sample of society ?as a pedophile. This scene, like many other scenes in the film, makes us conscious of our paranoiac reactions when events contradict our cultural norms. The film shows us society's own absurdity through scenes such as the trial of the sniper; the killer is worshiped by people who, not only are fascinated by him because he's now famous but also seem oblivious to the horrors he's committed. Also, Bunuel makes a comment about society's tendency to respect, without questioning, people at the top of the hierarchy; the cops and the commissioner are treated differently from ordinary people, however their actions show that they are unworthy of power, let alone respect. Bunuel also depicts the relationship between family members; human contact is undermined by manners and rules. Thus, the mother who "loses" her daughter spends more time blaming the nanny and making sure the police does the "right thing" than she does worrying about her child. Indeed, the parent telling her daughter, "tais toi quand les adultes parlent" or "don't speak when adult talk", when the latter is trying to show her presence, seems more preoccupied with good manners than with palpable reality. The Spanish filmmaker presents an uncomfortable symbol to the French public with Goya's "Third of May" portraying the execution of unarmed Spanish men by French soldiers; the filmmaker decides to place the tableau in a commissariat as to remind the proud French forces of their predecessor's doings. We can also sense tensions between Spanish and French when the sadomasochist decides to invite everyone in his bedroom except the Spanish couple ?whose presence would have been more appropriate than the priests'. Bunuel's original plot construction, orchestrating a myriad of characters, makes the point that anyone has a story; the filmmaker warns us about assumptions when facing institutions or leaders. In his ultimate warning, Bunuel ends his film with a psycho commissioner who, like Napoleon before him, takes advantage of his rank to utilize his power ?supported by blind obedience- to suppress other people. "The Fanthom of Liberty" provides today's viewer with insights about our present society; a society increasingly dominated by institutions and engineered by social codes all undermining human qualities.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life is surreal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I saw Le Fantôme de la Liberté my only real knowledge and experience of Luis Bu?uel was based on Un Chien Andalou (1929), a movie done in collaboration with Salvador Dali. Although I don't think the two movies should necessarily be compared, I think a few observations are called for: Un Chien Andalou isn't a film that needs to be understood and it should be even more appreciated for its visual accomplishments, however, like Le Fantôme de la Liberté, Un Chien Andalou is a movie that provokes thought. Both movies are making comments on society. But above all, you can easily see that the roots of "Bu?uel-esque" surrealism are already there in Un Chien Andalou.Watching Le Fantôme de la Liberté I felt some scenes went straight over my head, but on the other hand, I think that was exactly what Bu?uel was aiming at; he is forcing the viewer to wake up and make them use their brains. And boy, what an extensive commentary on world the movie is! The film makes a mockery of conservative middle-class (when we are so used to acting and thinking in a certain way, the other ways become unorthodox), Western understanding of morale and justice (a killer becomes a celebrity), religion and its hypocrisies (priests being the voices of God one minute and abusing that voice in the next), society (the behavior of people if front of institutions) ? in fact, there aren't a whole lot of things or issues that are left alone. Bu?uel questions everything that can and should be questioned, and reminds us that nothing is ever black and white.The movies consists of short episodes, tableaux, that portray the idea that life is a completely unpredictable chain of events. Life, in itself, is a surreal journey ? you can never expect what may happen to you. Bu?uel, without ever pointing a finger, simply says that a lot of things in life are based on an artificial blue-print, so much so that we often forget that we have the choice of choosing how to live our lives. No one really dictates what we are supposed to think and how we are supposed to behave ? just as long as we remember to use our own judgment. And isn't that the absurdity of life? We don't have to follow that artificial blue-print, and yet, we tend to forget that we have a choice. We always have a choice.In a time when the film industry has no faith in viewers ability to understand movies that aren't self-explanatory, it feels really refreshing to watch movies like Bu?uel's. I know I'm going watch more of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alice in Bourgeoisland {Luis Bunuel}</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is the most closely aligned to Surrealist Manifestos, of all Bunuel's body of work. It's title is the most important element of the modern revolutionary epoch. Freedom being the essential chant of desire to the Bastille stormers of the Parisian movement in 1789. Bunuel's opening scene is the display and then animation of one of Goya's "Atrocities of War" series. The irony being that Napoleon's revolutionary armies brought a charter of Freedom to Spain by the massacre of the Spanish Nobility and leaving the Spanish peasants with no security and lethal repression and a Constitution which declared them to be free. Here, immediately the fugitive nature of freedom is illustrated. Before continuing it might be worth examining what , according to the Surreealists the positive and negative results of the French Revolution are; first of all, the creative impulse of change, and added to this, other movements for change such as Freud's "Interpretation of Dreams" offered a channel into enigmatic areas of existence like dreams. However the single most important result of the Revolution was the birth of a new class, which would supersede the old classifications and leave Humanity with only one class of citizen - THE BOURGEOIS!Bunuel's critique and analysis of this progressive and thoroughly modern phenomenon is present in most, if not all, his Cinema. The story segues into modern times as we focus on a random bourgeois family. He, an entomologist whose daughters are approached in a park, by a man in a raincoat, who offers them sweets in classic pederast fashion, and then hands them a packet of picture postcards. The parents are disgusted by the pre-revolutionary pictures of Cathedrals and antique buildings. The only picture they approve of is a modern eyesore, - a concrete parking lot. The father figure is troubled by dreams, so much so, that he consults with a medical practitioner, who advises Psychoanalysis, as "they will listen to your dreams for years".The next sketch involves a visit to a boarding-house where Bunuel in quick succession has a flamenco dancing sequence, monks that are decadent and a dominatrix in full leather uniform whipping a mad hatter in "easy access, buttocks exposing trousers".The viewer is now put through a truly Monty Pythonesque scene where a professor is instructing a class of policeman concerning the relativity of culture {he recommends reading Margaret Mead}. The professor then attends Bunuel's favorite ceremony in the Rites of Bourgeois Culture - the dinner party. The viewer is left in no doubt about Bunuel's opinion of the highest and most sacred of bourgeois conventions, the social dinner. The seating is a toilet bowl and the conversation concerns the overwhelming amount of waste each individual excretes - thus making the human being the culprit for the major volume of pollutant on our Planet.Bunuel then leads us into the quintessential failing of the bourgeois - artificiality, and loss of contact with their irrational/dream/emotional life, {Surrealism's font of creativity and sensitivity} when he offers us a sketch of how these conventions so cripple the natural ability of the human to have consistent identities {as their snobbish insecurities continually undermine the obvious and sane}. The final metaphor is the zoo where Bunuel obviously felt that our fellow mammals have more integrity and honesty than the human type, without whose presence the zoo would have no meaning at all.This movie is rich with allusion, dense with incident, faithful to Surrealist theory, redolent with all their paradox, irony and jokes. It all makes sense if you want it to. I certainly enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why I like The Phantom of Liberty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spanish Director, Luis Bu?uel created a film I truly enjoyed viewing called The Phantom of Liberty filmed and set in France, 1974. It basically uses the logic of dreams, and holds true to it. This film is Surrealistic in that it has everyday events happening in an unexpected way. There are about a dozen self-contained stories referred to as tableaux. Bu?uel weaves them together by transitioning to another story instead of a climax. The magic of this is that everyone is interesting and fun to watch.The secondary protagonist in one tableau becomes the main protagonist in the next. Everyone is a lead and they are all important. What a fantastic concept, one of making the ordinary quite fascinating. I was constantly laughing. The first tableau is a Napoleonic scene that we learn in the second tableau is being told as a story. There is a statement that "I'm sick of symmetry", and that may as well be a quote from Bu?uel himself. His film follows the logic of dreams, showing metaphors literally. Funny scenes like toilets and relieving oneself are done at a dinner table, and eating is a private, shameful thing to be done in a separate room alone. One of my favorite tableau is when a little girl 'goes missing', but is in plain sight. Her parents take her to the police station so that they can put out an all points bulletin with an accurate description of her! Bu?uel's work in this film begs the question 'why?' Why do we hold some things acceptable, while others are abhorrent? Some of the characters appear later on, a police Commissioner in particular is shown in many different ways. At times he's a buffoon without his badge, others he's completely in control when he has his badge. He is at the bar with a woman trying to win her over with the sympathy ploy. He's convincing her that his sister has died. During their conversation, the bar tender picks up the phone and tells the Commissioner that it is his sister on the phone.This film did a great job of keeping me on my toes as it has so many unexpected twists and turns. I laughed out loud during the tableau where a man in at the park without any children of his own. He is watching the kids play intently and corners a couple of girls and gives them some pictures that they are to keep secret from their parents. As this interaction progresses most viewers like I did, probably assume that the content is pornographic. In actuality, the pictures turn out to be of historical landmarks and architectural art. This film constantly plays on our cultural relativism and constantly challenges our perception. I highly recommend this film to anyone because of the imaginative possibilities it opens. The idea that we are all the leads in our own story and have many interesting characteristics looming just underneath the surface, tickles my fancy. I simply loved going along for the ride. No agenda- just pure dreamlike narrative! I felt like it gave my right brain a workout and it was a genuine treat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is this for real? Nooo it is Surreal!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. The Phantom of Liberty directed by Luis Bunuel was definitely one of the strangest films I have ever seen, hence the definite use of surrealism. Bunuel goes over the top in the best way possible, jumping all over the place to capture the lives of many civilians. Who says dreams are not as important as the time we lay awake? This film is the essence of dreams, and in many ways I can relate my dreams to what is shown in this movie. The lives of many were so odd and unrealistic, but still carried its own sort of realism. When the father could not sleep but the mailman entered his room, the ostrich came in, the rooster came in; the man sat still as if nothing out of the ordinary was happening. He then goes to the doctor and is diagnosed with a fatal illness the doctor approaches it in a subtle manner, and goes to offer the man a smoke. This is not how we would think of life, who says that it couldn't just be that subtle?everything is in a rush, everything is in a panic. Why does everything have to follow certain symmetry? When a strange man at the park approached the little girls you think that he is a child molester, but he is simply giving them pictures of different landscapes. This goes to show our society means and how we are always expecting the worst. Bunuel plans a little with our minds, joking with us about how we perceive life and why we are so quick to make judgments. The use of moving from character to character, not having one exact protagonist or antagonist is an essential part of this film. It not only shows that everyone's life is a little coo-coo, but also that everyone has his or her own life than what we usually see. The nurse at the inn playing cards with the priests, and the young man and his aunt, then the naughty two characters whipping each other is something you don't get to see in every day life. It is not the norms of how we would grasp the concept. Who would think that priests are allowed to play cards, smoke, and drink? It is not in mentioned in our society that just because they are priests doesn't mean they don't each hold a life. Since the guy who starts getting whipped looks like a clean-cut businessman, and ends up being dirty, it plans along with the fact that us as a human culture are quick to judge. It also is apparent with the young guy and his aunt. It is all right for older men to be with younger women, but in this case when it is opposite we just suspect that his lover is his mother. However the pure elements of surrealism allow us to witness things that do not usually happen in physical life, but all together could actually happen. We don't expect them due to our social convictions, taboos, repressions, and fears. However Bunuel throws all those thoughts out the window to create a film so enchanting and mind boggling that people ask, what if? Everyone has probably wondered at some point in their lives, what if this happened, or what if that happened? Well great scene in this movie is bathroom scene having the bathroom as a part of everyday rituals and eating as a private matter really stuck in my mind, because who makes it apparent that we must eat in public and go to the restroom in private?no body? When the chief gets a phone call from his dead sister it also makes you think was he lying, is she really dead? His facial expression assures the fact that she is dead, but how in heavens is this happening? I am quick to judge that maybe this was a pick up line to talk to the young girl. This seems to be a dream. Then he is questioned to not be the Chief and is put in jail, once he is stripped from his badge he is nothing. Because we all hold titles in the world, and once they are gone what is left of us? This film is funny way to tug with people's emotions and thought process. The loss of the daughter is also a great moment in this film. She is lost, but yet she is still there? it makes you think: are these people dumb or are we the dumb ones for seeing her? It makes you notice that sometimes you go unnoticed. People are so into their own world that they miss what is right in front of them, and this happens to everyone. At times we feel like we are not paid attention to, and this just toys with that characteristic in a very serious manner. This whole film attaches to your imagination and plays with the fact of certain elements that would be perceived and shunned upon in modern culture, it shows a rarity that is missed in most modern films. It is a great movie to see if you want to test your dreams and thoughts, and enter a different world? a Bunuel world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not had a lot of experience watching surrealist movies, so this one was really interesting to see. The two scenes that I found most interesting were the couple in the hotel who were so inviting. I thought it was odd that they just kept inviting people in to their small room. They wanted and audience, and who doesn't want that? Its a commentary on who we are as people, we want others to share in our lives and enjoy the things that we enjoy. The other scene that sparked my interest was when everyone sat down to use the restroom. Right away I understood it to be a "what if" situation. As in what if eating a meal was a private activity instead of using the restroom. They are both activities essential to human life, so why is one more private than the other. When I watch a movie I do it to "take the trip" this movie made me wonder about things and I enjoyed that aspect of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of surrealism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bu?uel is a pure genius. Phantom of Liberty is like no other movie I have seen. It follows the stories of multiple characters and portrays surrealism in way like no other. Phantom of Liberty reminds me of a mystery because you do not know which character you will be following next or when the tableau will end. It is a creative masterpiece. No one here in Hollywood can duplicate what Bu?uel has produced.Bu?uel clearly demonstrates the difference between fantasy and surrealism. Surrealism is when things can occur in real life but we do not really expect them to happen. In Phantom of Liberty you trace different stories of surrealism. It really makes you think if you are dreaming or if this is really happening. This is not Inception people! Inception is a Hollywood film; Phantom of Liberty is a true artwork. It is all over the place, but yet everything is included in this film.During Phantom of Liberty I realized how closed minded we are. There was a scene when an older gentleman gave a little girl some postcards. The way her parents were reacting I thought it was pornography, when in fact it was just pictures of landscapes. There was another scene when a man saw a hen, mailman, and ostrich in his room. When he went to the doctor he even should the letter the mailman delivered, thinking that was proof. The way Bu?uel depicted surrealism in Phantom of Liberty is unique. At times I felt like some things were out of line.When I thought things were out of line, I then reflected back and realized they were not. We are just not used to the norm. What is the norm for others may not be the norm for us, and Phantom of Liberty proved that to me. Another thing is also proved to me was we should not quickly judge others.Phantom of Liberty shows the fine line of surrealism. Many of the tableaux could happen. It is very believable and it is a must see! You are in for a really treat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me the Phantom of liberty was a wonderful exploration into understanding the concept of surrealism. This film, which has no main protagonist to speak of or even a coherent plot plays out more like a lucid dream than a the classical films we're used to seeing. Its an abstract world where things we never expect to happen in the real world are perfectly capable of happening and do so no matter how out of place or seemingly unfitting. This film reminds of those like "Love, Actually" where you have a string of seemingly unrelated characters connected in small ways. I enjoyed this film because it was unpredictable. I find with cinema that so many films follow an archaic structure that robs the viewer of any sense of genuine surprise. However, "Phantom of Liberty" with its surrealist approached managed to not only keep me entertained, but pleasantly surprised about what lies around the bend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Surrealism in its realist form. Luis Bunuel takes us on a roller-coaster of a movie. There is no main character; no protagonist or antagonist just a continuous change of story lines and characters. My favorite part is when the man cannot sleep and the mailman enters his direct bedroom, then an ostrich enters, then a rooster enters and the man is acting as if everything is ordinary. It was a bizarre experience because surreal as the scene was it still carried its own sense of realism. The film was mostly entertainment for me. I enjoyed the scene where the young girls are approached by a middle aged man in the park who gives them pictures - we presume he has given them sexually inappropriate pictures and soon we find out they are just of landmarks but the parents still disapprove and fire the maid for allowing such a transaction and then the father gives his daughter the pictures to keep regardless. Bunel makes an interesting comment on the hypocrisy of society - the conception of taboos, social convictions, repressions and society fears are completely thrown out the window. We are shown that even though the movie makes no conventional sense it actually makes complete sense in its own way. Its unusual structure that Bunel gives "The Phantom of Liberty" - this idea of freedom and liberty links to all the small stories and string of characters altogether. It makes us viewers wonder - Could we actually handle freedom? And is it even possible to be completely free? Are we not all linked in some way or another? What is true and what is false? Bunuel makes us question the black and white beliefs - He injects imagination into the mundane human society, making us look at normality through abnormal eyes. As I said before, the movie was mostly entertainment for me but what if it was truth? Where is the line of reality and dream? There are hardly any modern movies that embrace imagination like "The Phantom of Liberty" does. The title itself almost suggests that the idea of liberty and freedom is merely a ghost and we are forever yearning for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>very unique movie if you have never seen a movie by Luis Bu?uel. He takes surreal to a whole new level taking normal day activities and turning them upside down. You see things that normally you would consider weird, different, or just plain wrong. Makes you see that so many things that we do every day can be seen in a lot of ways by changing small details. You can turn a normal dinner scene into a hilarious shot by just changing the seats at the table, or by introducing a unique animal into a different scenario not normally seen. This is a very good movie, it keeps you on the edge of your seat because your not sure where the film will take you in the next scene. It has a lot of twist and turns, very unique.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Phantom of Liberty really woke me up and made me think about how our society operates in such strange ways. Bunuel inverts everyday scenes of life and although they may seem strange to us at first we then stop and think wait why are things the way they are? Why is it that when we see a police man with a badge we get so nervous and act so respectful when very well we may have not even done anything wrong? Or why is it so wrong for a younger man to love an older woman yet the opposite situation is completely normal? This film really got me to reassess the social norms and think about how absurd some of them truly are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bunuel's funniest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Luis Bunuel's penultimate film focuses on the uncertainty of chance, as well as blending his own experiences and dreams with his surrealistic ideals. The majority of the focus centres around a hotel where a collection of bizarre characters interact and cross path to strange and sometimes hilarious outcomes. Some of the key scenes involve a sniper picking off random people from a tower window only to be congratulated for his acts, a dinner party where the group gather in the toilet for discussion and excuse themselves to eat on their own in the dining room, and a couple set up a search party for their 'missing' daughter who is with them the whole time (even helping fill out her own missing persons form).As mentioned, The Phantom Of Liberty is all about the importance of chance and the inevitability of fate. The characters exist or meet under unusual circumstances, and seem to be just go through the motions, resigned to their existence. It is also a mockery of social order, and how this collection vast array of different characters - monks, the police, the military, teachers, sexual deviants, the bourgeois, doctors - all seem to clash because of the place society has dictated they are to be. This is usually to great comic effect, and sometimes to a slightly tragic one. Mainly this is the case in a scene where a doctor hesitates to tell his patient that he is dying from cancer, and eventually tells him matter-of-factly in an almost humorous way. This scene was based on Bunuel's own experiences of being told he has a liver disorder, which he tragically died from in 1983.Bunuel's films are usually very funny, but not in the laugh-out-loud way. He usually pokes fun at the bourgeois in a cunning manner, and sets up bizarre scenes of surrealism (to the greatest effect in The Discreet Charm Of The Bourgeoisie, which in my opinion is his finest film). But he seems to be at his most free-spirited here, and the funniest moment has to be when a couple hosting a group of monks in their hotel room begin to change their clothes - the women puts on a leather dominatrix outfit, and the man reveals he is wearing arse-less pants - and commence a spanking ritual much to the monks utter horror.It may be the funniest, but it's also Bunuel's least accessible film. Obviously Bunuel was less concerned with making it easy for the audience than to express himself artistically, but I found this a hard film to completely connect with, similar to the way I felt with Peter Greenaway's A Zed And Two Noughts. Some scenes I felt didn't work - especially the scene where the couple is searching for their missing daughter. They interact with her, and the police even interview her to get a physical description. It is quite a long scene, and the joke wears thin pretty fast. That said, it's certainly one of Bunuel's more interesting films, but doesn't quite match up to his best work.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Luis Bunuel's creatively twisted film that follows multiple characters through different scenes and situations is an absurdly delicious taste of formalism that I can't get enough of. Even though I find myself with a look of complete confusion on my face, every scene I get more and more into it. The movie almost seems like scenes from a dream that have escaped the far depths of your mind. Crazy, beautiful, weird, colorful, fun and mysterious, the film's every adjective isn't enough to describe the experience you will get when you watch it for the first time. This film will either help you understand the world a little better or confuse you even more from what is real and the fact that it can do that is amazing in itself. We need more directors like Bunuel!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is a bizarre look at modern society and our customs that turns the tables on what we have come to deem "acceptable" and "unacceptable," and showing us the strange contradiction that we put ourselves in. We are shown what Society is like, rather than what we think it's like. It shows us situations that happen every day without anyone taking notice, but it presents those situations in a humorously honest way.We are shown a murderer becoming a celebrity, and as absurd as it may seem, you realize that it's exactly what we do, and we don't even realize it.We are shown a group of people at a dining table, but instead of eating they are sitting on the toilet, and take leave in order to eat. This humorous moment makes us ask just who actually came up with our customs, and who decided what is or isn't acceptable behavior.It's an entertaining surreal portrayal of our society that may just be closer to reality than most non-fiction films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually really enjoyed Luis Bunuel's, The Phantom of Liberty. I hadn't too good of an idea what to expect in a surrealism film but to my surprise, after watching it, I went home and Googled many more Bunuel films to look out for on Netflix. There is no set story in The Phantom of Liberty, it is more like a comedic series of episodes, kind of like Pulp Fiction, except none are in relation to one another. In my last review, I mentioned another director by the name of Ingmar Bergman having the ability to take advantage of our minds, but in this film, director Luis Bunuel REALLY knows how to get inside our minds. We see our expectations, thrown on the ground and stomped on. He almost mocks our perception. There is no simple way to explain one episode from this film, as I'd have a hard time attempting to do so. Of all the films we watched in my film class, this film lies in one of my top three favourite films. I am glad to have been introduced to surrealism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion Phantom of liberty is Bunuel's one of the &nbsp;most entraining movies. It is still full of his surreal games but in a contrary to "Andalusian dog" it is not pure surrealism but there is a concept behind it. Surreal &nbsp;factor becomes a key to emphasizing absurd in social and cultural mechanisms. He use surrealism &nbsp;to expose &nbsp;lies, hypocrisy and to illustrate stereotypes functioning in the system. He highlights &nbsp;burocratic nonsense... He questions of all values, negating traditions and &nbsp;conventions by &nbsp; reversing reality. He ask us a questions: how important is purity, innocence and finally if there is something like freedom ... and if so, what it is ... totally exposes the bourgeois mentality here, but at the same time questions all universal truths, valid at any culture and at any time. As an artist I am trying to be aware of being part of any systems, conventions or stereotypes. This move definitely makes the viewer be aware:)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Most Ingenious Comedies I Have Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Phantom of Liberty is probably one of the most bizarre films one could ever come across. Yet, strangely enough, it is also one of the most hilarious. When I first began watching it, I had no idea it would soon turn into one of the funniest comedies I had ever seen. The film consists of a series of short, seemingly-unrelated vignettes, which all work together into a greater theme of freedom in the modern world, and in satirizing the strange criteria the human race applies to routines in our lives to describe what is normal or just the opposite.There are several standout scenes. The "missing child" situation had me literally laughing out loud, almost uncontrollably- the absurdity of the entire sequence had an incredibly powerful effect on my sense of humor. Beneath the humor of course, writer/director Luis Bunuel has something to say about the way parents treat their children- always keeping an eye on them, while at the same time ignoring many of the things they say or do. Another brilliant "episode" is the one in which a man goes up to a random tower and starts firing on people with a sniper rifle for no discernible reason. Once again, the absolute absurdity of the situation caused me to have a hard time suppressing my laughter. The courtroom scene immediately following the senseless murders, in which the killer is treated as a celebrity, on top of being comedic, makes a strong point about the way modern society treats "famous" criminals. Other standouts are a scene in which people sit around a dining room table on toilets, a scene in which a man is diagnosed with cancer by a completely casual and unconcerned doctor, and a scene in which two parents show disgust over beautiful pictures given to their child by a man in the park. The brilliant satire is evident in every frame of this well-thought- out film, one of the few that can claim many laugh-out-loud moments and a poignant underlying meaning simultaneously. The only reason I give the film an 8, rather than a 9, is perhaps because of something that can be unavoidable for an experimental film such as this. As a result of the way the film is put together, with no central plot, there does seem to be a feeling that something is missing. It's not that I am the type to only enjoy linear story lines, but the lack of a narrative to connect all the unrelated episodes makes the film feel more like a compilation of scenes rather than one solid movie. This, however, does not take away from the ingenious comedy and carefully conceived succession of scenes. The only other Bunuel film I saw before this was the well- known Un chien andalou, but after seeing The Phantom of Liberty, I definitely plan on viewing more of his works.</fullReview>

The movie is assembled by short episodes and I specifically liked that about this movie, it was a new twist of movie making for me. The reason to why I liked it was that it kept my attention since I knew if I were to not focus I would probably miss an entirely new episode, it was almost like watching an improvising theatre act; new things are happening all the time.I like how the movie questions things we take for granted, we have specific opinions about things and we never really question the reason why we think what we think.</fullReview>

Although none of the stories are truly related, you get the same common theme of change and humor as seen through wacky metaphors which Bunuel has perfected. While mastering metaphors, Bunuel does a tremendous job of incorporating surrealism throughout the film, making the viewer dream for more magical moments. Only Bunuel could make movie full of characters with no connections to one another that result in comedic justice. The Phantom of Liberty is a twisted comedy for all to enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weird, Controversial, Funny, Entertaining. It has Everything!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this film for the first time, I was quite confused as to what I was getting myself into. However, I came to realize that Bunuel did a very good job in presenting controversial situations in which the public certainly do not accept in every day life, but would laugh away in this movie not knowing what they are fully understanding. One example would be in the episode where a sniper snipes away people to his own pleasure. I'm guessing the sniper did this act of violence to become more famous which is usually realistic in our every day lives. When you hear names such as Bin Laden or McVeigh; you right away think of terrorism. The average person would think of these people as crazy and rightfully wrong on their decisions. However, whatever their reasons for their crimes, they have achieved media success whether the criminals acknowledge it or not. Anything controversial, murder related or our of the ordinary would peak anybody's interest. They can be considered as "Celebrities" due to the fact that millions of people know of their names. I came to realize that I agree with most of Bunuel's episodes. I think it was brilliantly crafted and made. It also made me think about how everyone would react to this movie if they watched it. Would they fully understand what they are watching? Even having a "head scratching" moment over some episodes especially the one containing the police commissioner, I throughly enjoyed this movie and made me want to watch more of Bunuel's work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some friends explained the satire in this movie to me before seeing it and I had the intentions of laughing going in. However, the film was not as humorous as I though it would be in the sense that I never really found myself chuckling out loud but still one of my favorite Bunuel films of all time. It's Bunuel, obviously it is going to be a good film. This film made me want to go out and make a movie or write a script but at the same time discouraged me by just knowing I could never make anything even close to as good. As discouraging as it may be, it is so fun to watch and just observe the skill. There isn't any tricky camera work or special effects which makes this film even more respectable. In times like these when films are all about explosions and crazy camera work it is so refreshing to see a gem such as this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My idea of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hello, my name is Yoni &amp; I'm taking an international film course at Santa Monica, CA. I, by no means am any sort of film critic or movie buff nor is my major pertaining to the film industry. I'm just a student who saw a course that seemed to be different and in fact was actually interesting even though, I had a hard time at times understanding the concept of some of the films.One of the international films my class viewed and my favorite was The Phantom of Liberty directed by Luis Bunuel. One of the most unconventional and unique films I've ever seen. This film contained comedy which a nice change of pace compared to the previous films we watched. Bunuel who was a devoted surrealist, made an effort to show how sexual and violent nature is embodied in all human beings. Bunuel has a few short stories within the film that touch on all these subjects.The first story was about a gentleman in a park calling over children to show then children photos. He makes the children promise not to show these photos to anyone else including there parents. Naturally, with how the wild is today's society is especially, right away I figured the photos were X-rated because usually now a days, people that speak in that way, and speak low and secretive usually are showing something they are not suppose to or are MSNBC's " How to catch a predator". The children's nanny took them home in which the parents discovered the photos. The parents are in shock and aw while looking at these photos. It turns out, the photos are nothing more then pictures of scenery around the city. Bunuel just wanted to play off the fact that society has changed to make all of us think of the worst of the worst when a random man in park telling kids to come closer and shows them photos.Another story I enjoyed and found funny was a man visiting his doctor and the doctor tells him he's in good health and everything is fine and great. When all of a sudden, the doctor asks the patient what he was doing the following week because the doctor wanted to schedule a small operation because he has cancer. And even goes as far to offer a cigarette to his patient. This was just too outrageous. What I took from this story was the fear most men have of going to the doctor because you can feel fine and great but you go to the doctor and receive bad news and life threatening news.What makes the film great is the characters in the film are free throughout the film and it leads to a society that is very irrational. I think the fun in the film is trying to decode the meaning of each story within the film. Thank you. I will be commenting on three other films so hopefully so I won't sound too amateurish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A look at the human condition under a microscope through many pieces of separate stories</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spanish filmmaker Luis Bunuel brings us the tableaux masterpiece The Phantom of Liberty as a surrealistic look into the lives of different individuals which ultimately symbolize the human condition as a whole. Although the film contains scenes of complete absurdity and surrealism, everything that occurs could actual happen to any of us in our everyday lives- though unlikely and unexpected- almost as if we are floating through a dream. Bunuel does an excellent job hiding messages within his tableaux (or episodes) and threading together irrational logic into something beautiful that actually makes sense, and conveys a message to the audience about the state of things in the world. For example, the tableaux dealing with the "Faux" Police Chief and his counterpart. Even though we find out later that he is nothing but a phony, regular citizens on the streets respond to his fake badge like little children, just assuming he has this authority over them that makes people tremble. This is exactly like real life and people's interactions with doctors, police, and even government workers. Personally, I find Bunuel's combining of tableaux to create The Phantom of Liberty very refreshing, igniting a certain something inside that makes me want to rethink how I handle certain situations as an individual, on top of gaining a valuable perspective of how people act as a whole.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Phantom of LIberty feels like an extended episode of Monty Python's Flying Circus in which the humor is more refined and not quite as over the top. Like Monty Python (even though John Cleese was still in diapers when Bunuel began to make movies), The Phantom of Liberty serves as a platform for Bunuel to question society. This is not a coincidence considering that Bunuel started to make films in the disillusionment of a post-WWI Europe. Throughout the film, Bunuel examines societal standards as it pertains to ideas such as love, authority, and using the restroom. He forces the audience to reassess what standards they revere and consider why these standards were implemented. Ultimately, he seems to ask, "Why?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay I must admit- My first reaction to this film was, "What the hell is going on?!" This film is by far the most bizarre film I have seen yet. It is basically dozens of stories that connect from one to another with a "thinking out of the box" logic, and a dream-like way of never quite establishing a consistent story line and conclusion. Among the characters who turn up are a courteous sniper, who shoots a couple of dozen people from the top of a skyscraper and becomes a celebrity; a group of poker-playing monks, a young man that has sexual desire for his aunt, a little girl who vanishes from school but is able to join her parents as they report her missing at the police station, even though no one acknowledges her presence the whole time. All of these episodes are extreme to viewers, yet admirable because he tests our sanity and humor throughout the film.Bunuel successfully makes the audience take into serious consideration of how we came to differentiate "social norms" from "radical customs" by stylizing his film with jokes, riddles, bizarre associations, reason, and contradictions. I found this film humorously entertaining, while ridiculing the arbitrariness of social conventions.</fullReview>

In a world where the unlikely is treated as part of every day reality, and the improbable is the norm, "The Phantom of Liberty" is a brilliant film that asks questions without caring to know if answers even exist. Social commentary abounds in the film, and through humor the movie is capable of raising awareness of deep-seeded social issues. I've yet to see any other filmmaker use absurdity and surrealism in such an unfathomable and remarkable way without drifting into the realm of fantasy. Bu?el truly is a master of bringing randomness and chaos to the audience in a completely possible, believable, albeit unexpected manner. Morality, religion, the government- all social institutions remain open to the assault of doubt brought on by "The Phantom of Liberty." Crack open an icy cold can of crazy and let your imagination indulge in the implied possibilities of this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Witty take on the subject of relativism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Phantom of Liberty was certainly a unique film for me to watch. Scenarios that you wouldn't think would ever happen in real life actually happens in this movie. Bu?uel does not follow the typical conventions of a movie. We don't see a protagonist throughout the movie, but instead a bulk of characters that appear throughout episodes. Its structure is divided into episodes, where the audience is able to see a series of unconnected events. This went against my expectations as I would typically predict to revisit characters again. Not only is it structurally unconventional, the content is too. It goes against the societal norms that the audience is used to, therefore our expectations are played around with. Because of this unconventional nature of the film, I found the film humorous and entertaining. For instance, a scene is shown where guests are seated on toilets around a dinner table. They discuss about excretion whilst publicly doing so. Afterwards, one guest excuses himself and eats his meal alone in a private room. At first, I found the switch in private and public acts arbitrary, yet amusing. But why? Both eating and excreting are perfectly organic acts, however societal conventions restrict us to view such acts in an open-minded attitude. Another scene that made me question our liberty includes the episode of the serial killer. Despite his shooting rampage, he ends up being released in court. Surprisingly, as soon as he is released, citizens immediately ask for his autograph. Yet again, I found the circumstances unusual. Society delves upon murderers with injustice. On the other hand, society has a fascination with serial killers to the extent where they are considered to be celebrities. There are many documentaries on Charles Manson out there. While I found it absurd that the citizens asked for his autograph, what makes it any different from our societal views on serial killers? This made me realize that we do absurd things in society without even knowing it.Overall, I found this film interesting as it was unique from other films I've watched. Bu?uel breaks the rules but does it in a way that is appreciated, the same way that you would appreciate an abstract painting of Picasso's. The theme of relativism is important in this movie. He pokes fun at society by constructing a logic that goes against our values, which enables the audience to see the absurdity of our social norms. I learned that societal taboos are subjective and that the term "normal" differs in different cultures. While societal conventions can be absurd, we are not asked to go against them, but simply gain tolerance and mutual respect for other beliefs. This movie also made me question the subject of freedom. Historical struggles have occurred due to the fight for freedom, but what would we do if we were free of those societal conventions and expectations? Well, for those of you wondering, it's showcased in this movie. Once freedom is obtained, it can be easy to go against our moral conscious (e.g. serial killer episode), thus ruining the freedom of others. Is freedom fit for us? In my opinion, everyone has the right to be free. However, I believe that society must also have some sort of moral order to have a mutual share of freedom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Luis Bunuel loves to push envelopes and he gets away with it every time. The Phantom of Liberty is a pie in the face for everyone, and not to be taken at face value ever. He brilliantly sets up the entire movie by writing a prescription for the human race to see the other side of themselves from the bottom up, with Bunuel's absurd and brutal truths. I love how Bunuel weaves his vignettes together with certain little fetishes. He is the maestro of breaking down the walls of convention, and anything remotely routine and mundane like shining one's shoes, will be on the cutting board tomorrow. He genuinely loves to remind the human species that they are all hatched from the same slimy pond, and what they may think could never happen, has been happening all along.Life is like wearing a pair of shoes that look good and make you want to cry. Bunuel is inviting you to step out of the box and your shoes, and feel the mud between your toes.</fullReview>

However, after running time, I could understand that nonsense characters and stories have reasons.

		<shortDescription>Bunuel has done well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is all about subjectivity and perspective. Like how we the audience initially believe the "creepy guy" in the park to be some kind of pervert preying on young children, an idea only perpetuated by the parents reaction to the photos he had given their children. Only when we finally get a look at the photos do we get the social commentary. The man had given the children pictures of worldwide architectural landmarks and the parents found them perverse and obscene, although that didn't stop them from getting aroused from the photos. Another instance of Bunuel's commentary on subjective ideologies is when the family all sit down to defecate together like a social gathering, but when it comes time to ingest the food they do that in seclusion from one another. Yet again we see the theme of subjectivity portrayed most shockingly through the sniper who is just exercising his due rights and liberties, or so he believes, by picking off innocent bystanders whom he never has nor ever will meet. Even something as fantastic and life changing as liberty and freedom, when taken to it's brink can become a sick, sadistic, a maniacal tool for horrific evil. Finally, we see our societal norms and conventions challenged by the love affair between the aunt and nephew. Many viewers may be repulsed by the fact that a nephew is sleeping with his aunt, but many were disgusted primarily by the fact that by comparison she was an older women. At the end of the film i feel we are supposed to take away a more open minded approach to foreign and so called "bizzarre" customs, take a step back, a few breaths, and realize it's all subjective to your geographical, cultural, and ethical background.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Magnificent Works of Brunel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Phantom of Liberty" by Brunel is an excellent film walking in between the lines of tragedy and comedy. The movie is composed by episodes within the movie. For example, the camera would follow X then X encounters Y and then the camera would now follow Y, then Y encounters Z, then etc... I thought Brunel was clever in using this style so that it is much easier to structure it into episodes. I felt that the episodes can somehow all connect to the theme of liberty and freedom. It expresses the ultimate freedom, yet it makes us question ourselves whether we are really fit for freedom.The humor in the film was quite funny when in the second episode, the stranger, who is portrayed to the audience as a pervert, gives two girls a pack of pictures. When one of the girls (Francoise), takes the pack of pictures home and shows it to her mother, she is surprised and scolds her daughter for looking at them. Then, she shares with her husband the pack of pictures and at first, Brunel doesn't show the viewers what the pictures are exactly showing. All we can see is the reactions of the mother and father. The reactions shown to the viewers at first seems as if the pictures are sexual. Later, it shows the audience that it was just a pack of pictures showing landscapes and architectural buildings.Another humor I found in the film is in the scene when the people use the bathroom together in a large living room space and when the man goes to eat, he eats alone in a small space preferably small enough for a bathroom. It was funny because when the people walk into the house, we see a large space enough to be a dining room, but instead it has toilets implanted on the floor and then the people start to slowly pull down their pants and use the bathroom all together while conversing. There was also tragedy involved in this film. In the scene when the man goes in for a doctor visit, he finds out that he has cancer and when he returns home he doesn't tell his wife. At this scene, humor also tied in because when the man was talking to his doctor, at the end the doctor offered him cigarettes and the man slaps the doctor across the face. I thought it combined tragedy and comedy at the same time because as we find out that the man has cancer, it puts us into a serious tragic mood, but in the end the doctor asks if he wants a cigarette which makes the audience laugh to the fact that why would a doctor who just told his patient that he is diagnosed with cancer, offer a cigarette?Overall, "Phantom of Liberty" by Brunel was a film that portrayed comedy and tragedy in an excellent form.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes we accept everything that come to us. Since birth our parents tell us what to believe in and what should we do. As we grow the number of influences increase like Television, friends, parents, siblings, etc. Basically society expain to us why and what is "right" anything different is a "no-no". Not all societies are the same which means the morals and beliefs are all different but what is similar is that each society think their ways are the "best" way. As you see there are a lot of quotations and a lot sarcasm. None is different about Luis Banuel's "Phanton of Liberty". Banuel has taken what all of us think and question and put it in his movie. He had the courage to question just about everything that controls and makes us better than everyone else. Don't get me wrong Bu?uel does not say to go crazy, live with no rules he is asking us to not close our minds to our limited worlds. To not think that we are right and the rest of the world needs to see how we see it. Tolerance is all that is asked of. There is satirical humor and ironic situations but no situation is without a message.Overall the movie is really well filmed and the questioning and symbols are what make the movie truly great. The acting is not the greatest but it is not terrible but the point of this film in not only entertain but to make us question and have more tolerance to those whose morals and beliefs are different. The weird situations can leave you dumbfounded but rest assured what separates the movie from good to great is it's message.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The lives of several ordinary people interact incongruously in a surrealistic, patchwork plot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is amazing how blindly most of us live our lives. From a very early age, we are indoctrinated with the norms and customs that define our culture. If our family is religious, we attend services. If our parents were not born here, chances are we will be influenced by their native culture. Plus, we have the police, the media, and schools, who make use of our young, impressionable brains and teach us the ins and outs of society. Most of us rarely stop to question them.This movie strove to make us stop to question.It is shot in tableau form--Person X meets Person Y. They interact. Person Z comes along, and suddenly the action shifts to Y + Z. X is never seen again. This happens suddenly and often. Just like real life, it is unpredictable, and it encourages us to think outside the box and use our brains to make sense of the tangled plot.Bunuel, the director, made a point of dissecting the most ingrained mores of Western society. One of the greatest taboos in our culture is pedophilia. Most of us have a visceral disgust to its very mention--drilled into us by society from an early age. Early in the film, we see a kindly old man walking in the park. He meets two young girls, Veronique and Valerie. He takes them onto his lap and shows them "private" photos, which we assume are sexually explicit. He talks innocently to the girls, and soon leaves. Cut to Veronique's father, Henri, viewing the pictures with his wife Helene. They are not shocked or angry with the girls--but as they examine the photos more closely, they become aroused. Henri describes them as "indecent". Finally, we see the photos. They are nothing more than buildings in Milan. Bunuel delighted in subverting the audience's expectations. It shows just how paranoid we are about child exploitation--the old man's intentions were totally pure, and yet we have trouble believing this.The "plot" is chaotic and surreal. It depicts realistic but bizarre courses of action in everyday life. For example, Henri and Helene go to bed after viewing the pictures. Helene quickly dozes, while Henri is restless. During the night, we see a rooster strutting into their bedroom, then a postman, than an emu. Henri shrugs them off as if they weren't even there, and Helene never stirs. A cornerstone of surrealism is the characters' writing off of bizarre happenings as if they meant nothing. They encourage us to do the same, and realize how bizarre and arbitrary our views of the world can be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breaking Free with Bunuel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Surrealist Luis Bunuel asks us to break free of societal norms for two hours of our lives to see how it feels to be un-cuffed from our constricting social bounds. Why do we have to live the way "they" tell us to? There's a feeling of freedom being explored here, of being wild and out of the box. If eating is something we do and pooping is something that we do, why do one together over the other? The idea of joining together at a table to go to the bathroom is silly and may make us even cringe, but it's showing us in our reaction how programmed our perceptions are. It might make us giggle at first but feel ill when we see ladies join in pulling up their dresses and sitting on a toilet with their legs in a more "masculine" squat. Why do we as a general human population tend to view one thing as normal and another as repulsive? Isn't life more interesting and alive this way, Bunuel asks? If you find a statue beautiful, go ahead and kiss her if it makes you feel good! Who cares? Sadly, in reality everyone will have an opinion about it. He plays with our minds when we are shown a stranger give pictures to little kids in the park and when we see the parents reactions we automatically think they are inappropriate but they are merely pictures of landmarks. We are the ones with our minds in the gutter. Perhaps he is telling us to stop believing and allowing ourselves to be programmed by every role we see played in movies or television or even the news. We don't have to be like everyone else. Bunuel makes us want to live life according to what we can imagine like we all once did as children. The lecture the professor gives his police academy students on the relativism of laws, customs and taboos gives a clear message to what Bunuel is trying to convey. All "rules of society" and norms are not set in stone, they are relative, meaning that the world is in the eye of the beholder. Our own reality depends on how we choose to look at things, and everyone looks at things a little differently than the next person. Societal norms are just a way of controlling so many different peoples opinions on life so we can all function in society "comfortably", but is it worth losing your own unique perception and way of living?The way "The Phantom of Liberty" jumps from protagonist to protagonist without explaining why parallels this idea that maybe we don't need to give structure and norms to everything. People just do what people do, everything is not meant to be analyzed and perhaps that is where our problems arise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Society can be considered as a panel of judges that critic a person through written and unwritten rules. Whether or not people like to admit it, we all fall into that panel of judges that critic people for whatever reason. Bunuel does an amazing job at letting viewers know this and I would even venture to say that he asks viewers "Why? Does it even matter?" I feel as if he tries to tell viewers that it up to you to make meaning in your life, that they ways of society, the acceptable way to act, and the way to think and talk should not be given to you or followed by a rule book. All of these things and more should be decided by you and no one else. But this brings up the question of wouldn't this lead to chaos. Or where would reason and logic go? So as much as Bunuel pokes fun at the ways of society and how it seems so dysfunctional, he also states that it is needed in order to keep things like the sniper scene from occurring. I do have a problem with one scene though. That scene is the scene where a man is in a park where he meets to young girls and takes them away to have a conversation and give them pictures. Bunuel wants viewers to think this man is a pedophile when actually he is just a nice man who gives these girls postcards of landmarks. He pokes fun at viewers for thinking this, saying "Why is that your first thought? Why can't this man just be a nice social man?" But the reality is, or at least the way I see it, this isn't society's way of thinking, that he a pervert, but society's way of showing itself from experience. Society is a collective being and it learns through experience, which in return teaches humans. We have learned that almost 100 percent of the time a man like this isn't a good person but a pedophile. How many stories have been on the news with the exact same situation? In the end though this movie was excellent and one of the most intriguing movies I have seen. Just maybe it went too far with some of the criticism</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bunuel influences his audience to view the world and it's current set of "rules" by which to live in an entirely different light. Rather than creating one plot with one main character, Bunuel creates a few different stories, each containing their own characters and their own different conflicts and situations. Bunuel's situations cause the viewer to question whether or not there may be holes in the social order and grand scheme of things. By fashioning a film in which he almost plays the "opposite game", Bunuel brings to his audience's attention, conflicts between right and wrong and whether or not, in some instances, wrong may incidentally be right. A good film, but possibly a bit confusing.</fullReview>

The near plot less narrative seems to follow a path of least resistance: a mother scolds her daughter for carrying pornographic pictures, later revealed to be merely scenic travel postcards ("filthy!" she cries); a doctor informs a patient he has advanced lung cancer, then offers him a cigarette in sympathy; a desperate search for a missing schoolgirl ignores the fact that she's in the same room, loudly trying to get everyone's attention; and so forth. Each unrelated episode flows smoothly into the next, with no common focus besides the director's passion for demolishing social conventions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The phantom of liberty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this film was interesting because it raises important questions like what is normal? and why do we judge so much? In the phantom of liberty he asks these questions in a very humorist way but I think that what Bunuel want is for us to ask ourselves these questions in everyday life. There are so many unspoken rules about what is normal and not and if you can not follow these rules, you will be an outsider. The most interesting thing is that these social codes are not the same in different cultures and that make me think that maybe there are no logical reason for a lot of these rules. I think Bunuel tries to show us how some of these rules is everything but logical. In this film, he shows a lot of things that is very unlikely to happen but when you start thinking about it, these things are not more strange than things we experience everyday. I think all rules we have, both social and real laws is there because we want to have rules, humans want to have a structure to live by. I do not think we can handle to much freedom. Maybe we need the social rules but what I think we should really work on is our prejudices. That is what I started to think about after watching this movie. If you start thinking about it you realize how much you judge everyday. I do not think we can completely stop judging but we can defenestrate work on it and I think that is what Bunuel want us to do, just think.</fullReview>

We live in a world we where hold onto our freedoms and can act upon them in the same extreme way we see on the screen, he just put it into terms on a more intense level. Through the short captivating clips one sees of an episode, Bunuel leaves the scenes and jumps to another story just as one begins to really get caught up in the story. He allows the creativity of the own audience members thoughts to be explored and mocked in a sense, as we the audience often jump to conclusion on what is being discussed or shown on the screen. It is incredibly entertaining and gives one a different perspective on how we live our lives.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bunel seeks to break free from the norms and conventions of society. It is important to have filmmakers and artists out there willing to defy and question the rules and Bunel is one of them. It is nice to see a film that makes you think and consider life and all it's expectations, demands and rituals. Why do we behave and think the way we do continually, constantly and without much examination? Bunel sought to bring these questions to the forefront and he used his surrealist talent of the absurd to enlighten us. The last shot of The Phantom of Liberty is of the ostrich. Perhaps it is a metaphor for the myth of the ostrich who hides their heads beneath the sand and we all must raise our heads and open our eyes to examine that which is around us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Luis Bunuel's Phantom of liberty questions our idea about freedom and liberty. Well, we know that all of us want more freedom in our lives. But Luis Bunuel's point is that: How free do you want to be? Saying that, he gives us many examples of wacky, surrealistic segments which each of them leaves us just as the story gets interesting. With each segment giving us a different view of a "free world". In this film, human is looked from an ostrich's point of view, which means that we are treated equally as weird creatures who don't have any idea about life. Bunuel also makes us make decisions about each character and story, and later on, make decisions about our decisions. and then, evaluate ourselves and our values and think about our values. Saying this, this movie is more about what it reflects on the audience, rather than what its content is. With a surrealist approach, this movie is also humorous, with very few shock effects, which makes it much more interesting than many other surrealist films.</fullReview>

I like how several different people were staying at a crammed local hotel due to the bad severe weather. Each character got the chance to show their own personalities by being different. The only thing that I was kind of disturbed were the i guess the nephew and aunt relationship. The nephew pressuring his aunt to be naked was very unusual. I like how the dining room of one house shown were made like a bathroom. One crazy scene of the missing child and was child was not missing!

We can physically break the perception, but the society makes us not to do this. Have you ever thought that police officers are playing around just like kids in a classroom? But We see them as the representation of a good moral character. Maybe what we are believing is wired at least in other different cultures. Bu?uel wants us to break such unnecessary concepts. And Be free to enjoy our provided liberty. He questions the contradiction between liberty and social conceptions with physically-possible-but-commonly-impossible incidents.

Though the scenes are quite bizarre, they still manage to feel "right." The way in which they question the social order of things is like a visual manifestation and elaboration of questions I have asked myself. The contradictions Bu?uel proudly exhibits are fabulous. People have been brought up to think a certain way and expect certain things, and Bu?uel's humorous defiance of our expectations makes one think about where our expectations come from, and how legitimate they really are. And yet, everything is done with a lot of fun. "The Phantom of Liberty" is like a philosophical discussion about life and individuality and independence of thought made into a movie. I really liked it because it truly made me think about why I am the way I am. It's a good movie to see. I definitely recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bu?uel still has yet not to surprise me. I find his surrealist films putting me in one curious situation after another, and I can only wonder what went through his mind each and every time. "The Phantom of Time" exceeds our expectations of realism in a way that makes us question whether or not what he shows us can really happen. For instance, Bu?uel puts us in a world where religious folk smoke and gamble, or where a convicted serial killer becomes the center of fame to the point where attaining his autograph becomes a must for the public. For myself, a particular favorite from this film would be when the professor lectures on morals and so forth, and Bu?uel cuts to a sequence where the kitchen and bathroom swap roles ? both brilliant and comedic!Although these situations seem very unlikely, I believe Bu?uel's overall intentions are to make the point that, despite each individual's expectations in any given situation, anything is possible. In addition, most cultures differ from one another to begin with, so differences are inevitable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What would happen if the world were turned upside down? What if we were granted complete freedom to do anything we want? The answers to those questions are present in each of the 12 stories presented in this amazing film by surrealist master Luis Bu?uel.From the beginning, he plays with his audience, building up our expectations and when we think something might happen, he leaves us stunned and laughing, showing by way of absurdity and satire things we never would have thought possible because of the preconceptions we have demonstrating that we are not as free thinking and open as we thought we were. As he has done in several of his movies, Bu?uel doesn't have a narrative thread through the movie choosing instead to connect each "tableau" to the next with the introduction of a random character that becomes one of the main ones in the following scene, creating a random series of events. Also present in "Le Fantome de la Liberté" is Bu?uel's recurrent criticism of several things including the bourgeoisie (as done before in "The Secret Charm of Bourgeoisie"), the Church, police and moral beliefs, making quite clear to the viewers how much he dislikes them. This movie is a perfect example of freedom all around, from the scene where a man shoots people randomly and later is sentenced to life in jail but walks out free of the courthouse, to Bu?uel himself who has the freedom of saying whatever he wants, however he wants it and in doing so, has given us a fresh perspective. Bu?uel's camera work makes us feel that we are ghosts gliding through each moment of a very realistic dream thus achieving the surrealist's main goal of presenting a symbolic and rational dreamlike universe, making this movie a must see and one of Bu?uel's finest works.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the beginning of this film, I was not sure of what was going on. All i could do was laugh. As the film continued to the part where people sat on the table while using toilets as chair, I got the idea that it is showing how ridiculous our society is. We create rules that at time we do not follow them or we make up certain rules that when we violate them it seems like a big deal when it really isn't. For example, who said that when we ride an elevator we are supposed to face one specific way? Is facing the back part of the elevator a crime? If not, then why do people look at you as if you are some sort of weird person when you face the back or side part of the elevator? I think that this film is a great film because it helps us reflect on how we humans behave.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film made me look at cinema in a whole new way. It was something I have never seen before, from the various scenes, to the scenes that made me say wow. Some of the ideas in this film were brilliant, such as when they all sit down at the dining room except they are all toilets instead of normal chairs. This is quite comical. The part where the naked women appears to be really old, then her naked body reveals a young beautiful women said a lot to me. Emotionally, it showed me that we can't all be biased towards older women, and that they too have genuine things about them. The sniper rifle scene was also very humorous to me and scary at the same time. It made me wonder what if something like this actually happened, then the court room scene really made me laugh. It is a great film, interesting at that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie turned upside down.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is my absolute favorite foreign film. It's like watching a painting in motion with the theme of "Phantom Liberty" accented all the way through the film. This film takes us through many arbitrary bizarre episodes that are cleverly transitioned from one episode to the next. We follow every random character with their everyday life, but we are left thinking "What the hell is happening?" but it is due to that theme of "Phantom Liberty." It's almost like playing opposite day, everything is just turned topsy turvy. The movie starts off with the with a humorous insight to Napoleonic invasion in Bunuel's (director) point of view and ends with the image of the invasion with the track heard in the beginning, bringing the movie back to where it first started. This movie points out the chances people face in life and the thought of actual uncontrollable freedom, free to do whatever you want with no rules holding you back. This movie will make will make you smile and laugh, but most of all think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dramedy to remember</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In what is sure to be one of the most intriguing yet bizarre pictures to come about since the work of Fellini, Luis Bunuel directs this dramedy picture about the random incidents and moments that come about in the thought of the mind, yet somehow reflect on the hypocrisies of society and man. Told in a surreal mindset with objects and even animals that somehow come into scene, it is one of those pictures that has many meanings in one. For example, Bunuel directs a sequence in which a young girl, whom her parents are searching for and has been thought to have been kidnapped, is actually right in front of the parents. It makes absolutely no sense, but that is what is so striking about this scene as well as many in that, the girl, who is right in front of their eyes speaking with them, can't be found, thus sending these parents to act on their toes to try and find her. The film regards itself on random episodes that somehow have no connection with each other what so ever. From one scene to the next, the stories are never quite fully developed until the end, kind of like a soap opera. It is one of those types of pictures in which many different characters, with their own dilemmas, are left till the next time around to pick up where they left off in their sequence. The main quest for Bunuel is to question the morality of the characters. Why is it that society considers the idea of going to the restroom as something that has to be done in private. Who created these rules? Who created the rules that man has to be clothed in public, but can do whatever he pleases in private? Is this a moral question as to what is moral or not moral to do, or is this something that society has created as something moral? Bunuel leaves that up to his viewer to identity and question. Shot in a similar fashion as many of the Monty Python pictures, Bunuel's film is definitely more subtle, yet adventurous and hilarious at all means. It shows how surrealism doesn't always have to be dramatic, and he strays away from his start in drama, but achieves a perfect wisdom and understanding through it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no doubt that Bu?uel is a pro in intriguing and subjective thoughts embedded in the apparently senseless stories. Only a person that is thoughtful enough can do such thing with such grace and yet be so aggressive about it. Morals, expectations and the so called "rights" determined by society are well approached in an unconventional way. Plus, he is also brilliant in criticizing some past tragic events in a humorous yet effective way.The movie happens in pieces of stories that are linked through some irrelevant fact that gives it the flow to escalate with one another. How would you feel if monks smoked and plaid cards? How would you feel if you saw a relationship between a teenager and an older woman? The whole aspect of playing with expectations is somewhat disturbing because everything we see in the movie could happen. Those events would not affect anyone's life negatively, and yet, it would not have been our first thought. That only happens because we are judging sons of the Earth and we love to point fingers and name rights and wrongs. On the other hand, you can only take Bu?uel's criticism seriously to a certain level, which is exactly why I think the movie is so geniously put together. The fact that every tableaux (the little stories in the movie) give us just a hint of what's going on, for then move to a new story explains that the director does not mean to agreed people nor to judge subjects being approached, necessarily. He does though, play with our expectations on what would be the natural course of thoughts in our head and he flips them over. Looking at things from different points of view can never be harmful but it can open your eyes and brighten up some shades on our general concepts. Unless your thoughts can not go as far, then you will just think it was a waste of time maybe. The beauty of it is to watch it with no judgment whatsoever. You may think of stuff you never thought before, or you might laugh about some past memories the movie have brought up in your mind.Ultimately Phantom of Liberty really relates to the so called freedom we have. We are supposedly able to think about whatever we want, say whatever we want and act however way we want (as long as it does not interfere with the others', obviously). But how do we really feel when we face that real freedom in real life shaped around the society's morals and values? The concept of freedom just fades away behind those curtains even though they are bragged about all the time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bu?uel follows the logic of dreams in his film, The Phantom of Liberty. The Phantom of Liberty is composed of tableaux, a series of episodes, where anything can actually happen in real life. Bu?uel's ironic criticism challenges and juxtaposes the modern world. Each Tableaux tells a different story like a man laying in bed around 3am when a chicken walks in his room then the man realizes his clock is 5min ahead, where a family makes a police report about their "lost" child with the actual child describing herself. These different tableaux were at times humorous. Bu?uels cinematic style distinguish his films and shows that anything can actually happen in real life, so why not make a film about it to show these unusual events?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bu?uel's interest in surrealism shows prominently in his films. It's no surprise then to his relationship with painter Salvador Dali. My favorite feature of this movie is the seamless transition of scenes. It is a story within a story within a story within a story. Themed around an idea of exploring cultural taboos that are often taken for granted, the film depicts acts and events that are shocking specifically because they defy the norm. Yet nothing depicted could truly be argued as wrong or impossible with significant evidence. The film's lingering impression is the realization that so many things in society are ignorantly accepted as the norm and then integrally defended. There is a introspective experience resulting from ones examining their shock from each scene. What really disturbs you? Why? and what things more than others. It really does upon your eyes to your own beliefs at times. While the movies layout can be confusing at times the "big picture" is apparent. The confusing layout only makes it more interesting to re-watch and try to catch all the little nuances is social normality. While some may not enjoy the style, no one can deny it's artistic value.</fullReview>

I think Bunuel has a great taste of looking at the world in a way different than everyone else around him. This can be easily seen in the way he handles his camera. All the shots suit the significant of the story. He did a great job of showing the people of the world how biased they are. Biased in assumption that they make. Biased in judging people. even though he is delivering an important message, a lot of humorous moment in the film makes the watcher laugh as hard as they can.

You may try to connect a deeper meaning to the random objects and occurrences, such as trying to determine what the bird and the mailman in the mans room "symbolizes." Yet Bunuel did not create this film to have it be critically analyzed and torn apart in an attempt to find a deeper meaning. This film may only be appreciated for face value, only when one watches as each tableaux leads us to another and enjoys the randomness does one achieve what Bunuel intended. Bunuel did have a reason for all this madness though; he means to poke fun at society's taboos.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit, at first I didn't get this movie. It doesn't follow one character, it has random birds walking into rooms at night, and seems to be very scatter brained. But after struggling to come up with some meaning from the movie, I realized that there is wonderfully no meaning. It wasn't meant to be gotten. It just pokes fun at a lot of society's social issues with symbolic images and scenes. A couple of my favorites were the missing child, where everyone says that this little girl is missing even they she is right before their eyes, and talking to her, but they still insist that she is gone. Another one is the "dirty" pictures that they find with a teenage girl and they are reacting to the photos as if they are pornographic, even though they are pictures of cultural landmarks. All of these little scenes make up for one hilariously wicked, symbolic film. Bunuel is a genius.</fullReview>

I think what makes the "what ifs" interesting is that they are all possible, I think Bunuel did an excellent job making this surrealism film.

		<shortDescription>A Parade of Absurd Stories</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Phantom of Liberty is the ultimate ensemble movie about chance encounters and the absurdity of life. Long before Babel, Crash, Shortcuts and other movies that follow the myriad lives of characters as they intersect and affect each other, Bu?uel made this masterpiece of nonsense. But rather than using the randomness of life to preach about some vague power that holds all our lives together - like Babel and Crash do - the Spanish director shows randomness as it is: random. People meet people and stories segue into others without purpose or direction besides the need to always be wondrous, strange and humorous. No plan exists and no epiphany holds all stories together; they're just vignettes that could be ordered in any way without damaging the final effect.So what is The Phantom of Liberty about anyway? A synopsis makes no sense; suffice to say it makes fun of modern society, its last taboos, it phobias, its mores and its stupidity. A mass murderer kills people, is sentenced to death and then walks out of the court a free man, dispensing autographs to teen-aged girls; a creepy man corrupts young children with pictures of monuments; a couple reports the disappearance of their daughter, who is sitting right next to them. And so on, a lovely parade of absurdities.This movie is not taxing or even intellectually complicated; but it requires the viewer to have a dark humour and a pessimistic view of mankind. Armed with these two traits, one should have no problem enjoying The Phantom of Liberty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I started watching this movie with great expectations of deep philosophy. Twenty minutes into it, all I got out of it were discontinuous episodes. But very compelling episodes. They were bizarre but still believable, bordering on insanity.Abnormal becomes the norm and no one raises an eyebrow. Is that the world we live in? Is that our reality? Is the human experience crazy? There's one episode in the film which showcases Margaret Mead's work on intercultural relativity. Maybe that's the deep philosophy in this movie. Crazy is what you want to believe as crazy. Its all relative. Life can have very different manifestations, not all of them need to be congruous and meaningful to everyone.It could as well be a statement on the unreality of life, when people lose touch with reality of self and other. It's a surreal movie which reflects on the hypocritical nature of life in a very symbolic way.The movie anyway holds together, its irrationality and disconnectedness does not reduce its attraction. Each vignette in itself is compelling. There is fascination in watching the craziness. Perhaps that's another way in which it mirrors life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not seen anything from this famous director. This is the first film of Bunuel for me. At first, I was wondering what's all these nonsense are? At the same time I was enjoying it. The film starts with an old tale of the French Revolution,So I thought the film is on such stuff. Surely a historical or Period film. But the very next scene brings me back to today's world. Two kids got some pictures from a stranger at the park. I thought the photos must be vulgar. But they were not. Then their father saw a cock, a postman giving letter and an emu in his dream. Next morning he went to a doctor to consult. Then the story follows the secretary of the doctor. She went out to met her ill mother. She stops in an inn. There she met some odd people. A young man with his old aunt. Some monks. A couple with odd sexual passion. Next morning, the girl gave a lift to a man. The man is a teacher to some army school. He described his experience of a dinner, where people were sitting on commodes. Then a little girl is reported to be missing. But the paradox is that she is not lost at all. We find a sniper killing people. He is sentenced to death. Still he walked away out of the court room smoking a cigarette. Then the police commissioner got a call from her dead sister. Finally, there was a zoo revolt.As a first time viewer I am shocked by these kind of apparently disintegrated images. But I enjoyed the film. It was totally a new experience for me. Absurdity has its own charm.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Style of Bu?uel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Luis Bu?uel's The Phantom of Liberty brought a new profound perspective to how society views certain situations. In the film, there is one particular episode where, on an ordinary day, a man takes his gun and starts shooting randomly at people. As a result, he is caught by police and taken to court. Although the crimes he committed were obviously serious and considered second-degree murder, the judge dismisses him. As he leaves the courtroom, there is a sudden interest from the media and fans, making him a celebrity. This made me realize how society appears to repeat history many times. For instance, there are many cases on how many famous celebrity icons have been suspected for committing murder, child molestation, or statutory rape have gotten away with it. Bunuel also points the many taboos in life that appear to be private or not, such as using the bathroom. This can make one wonder to themselves why something completely natural is prohibited, or how dinner is usually a gathering and not something more private. This film breaks stereotypes and traditions of how certain things are suppose to be and shows how they appear as. Many times people are brought together by chance and everyone has their own story. In the episode where the nurse stayed at a bed-and-breakfast house due to bad weather, there came long other guests such as the incest relationship between the aunt and nephew and the S&amp;M couple. With the S&amp;M couple, there were about ten different people in that room who were complete strangers to one another(except the monks). One would have never imagined the boy was having a relationship with his aunt or that the monks were not strict on their beliefs.Bu?uel is able to poke fun at religion and education while keeping the setting realistic. There is a scene where a woman, whose father is very ill, is in her bedroom and the four monks come in to ''pray'' but they end up sticking around for smokes, poker, and alcohol. The fact that these monks were gamblers and sinned against their beliefs made the story funny. This made me realize how everyone has their own story and that even monks are just ordinary human beings who also make mistakes. Knowing the style of Bu?uel helps understand what sort of method did he use to give his actors direction. Apparently, he would turn his hearing aid off while shooting because he did not want to be bothered by any questions which made the final product of his films very authentic. The fact that a director wrote a film with no promise ending, plots that do not connect each scenario together tightly with wonderful sense of humor and imagination, makes this film a vivid masterpiece.</fullReview>

Reality is what we want it to be. The film ask us to reassess our morals, viewpoints and our self imposed rules of right and wrong, "what is freedom?" and how should it be determined? Without giving any of the story away, let me say I loved the flow of the film and how none of the story lines really pertained to the others and yet by chance the sequence of them tied together.

At times, the audience doesn't even know whom to pay attention too. As well, nothing is as it seems. There is a scene where we are sure that a strange man has given to young girls pornographic materials and we find that they are just pictures of landmarks.

It may seem funny at the time, but there are children that are treated as if they do not exist. Also how wrong is it that the physician offers a cigarette to his patient whom was just diagnosed with pulmonary cancer. These two scenes are obviously morally incorrect and yet Bu?uel did it in a very comical way. These two scenes seem like an oxy-moron.

It moves smoothly from one character to another and with a different story while going against the already established ideas as of what freedom is and the false beliefs of what liberty really is and religion. The film has a big touch of comedy such as when a child accepts some strange photographs from a man only to find out that the images aren't quite what one would expect. A nurse spends the night at an inn and meets some priests who later gamble along with her. A sniper makes his way to a skyscraper and shoots at the crowds below, only to become a celebrity, exercising the unlimited freedom he has. The film succeeds at making a point or at least questioning the rule of the norms.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Phantom of Liberty is a very interesting movie that shows that many imagery's and things that may violate a person's moral perspective. For people living in the U.S., getting a hotel room with an older relative is definitely a taboo and we reject that notion of thinking. It is wrong and immoral to do something like that; however, some other countries probably think it is perfectly okay to be dating someone that is from the same or relative from the family. We live in a vast society where the world makes up our decisions and our moral standards. A person living in the United States moral standards and ethics may be totally different than someone living in a poor country like Cambodia. Nevertheless, it does not mean that one group is right or better than the other. This movie gives us dream like imagery's that we can enjoy and experience in a different point of view. For example, having a formal meeting and sitting on a toilet seems like something out of the ordinary. Although some things may be out of proportions, eating would be another good example about an activity that is considered private or sacred thing that any person can relate. However, that notion can be wrong, where eating can be expressed publicly and so on. A good way of using our imaginations and our dream like thoughts that we can portray to a group of audience while expressing how we feel on a certain topic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this is a psychological movie which deals with subconscious. If you watch the movie as a regular movie you may miss lots of things but if you try to explain it by Freudian psychoanalysis approach you may get lots of meanings. As it is surreal, dreamlike movie, this should be the way.For example, fornication of the aunt an nephew is certainly about Oedipus complex. The "dreamer" s hidden desire which is fornication with mother reveals itself with the "dreamer" s aunt. Just after the scene when aunt tells her nephew that he can do anything that he wants, director shots on a stuffed fox for a while. It is not a coincidence. In the previous parts of the movie some soldiers with armored vehicle and guns were looking for a fox. If soldiers are looking for someone, it is not because they will give him chocolate and flowers, they look for that guy to arrest him, punish him or kill him because he is guilty. Soldiers looking for fox and the stuffed fox at the aunt-nephews wall which is expressed after the fornication, shows the "dreamer" s guiltiness in his subconscious.The ostrich entering the bedroom. Ostrich is a symbol of a problem, something it should not be. It takes place in bedroom because the "theme" of the dream is sexuality-which takes place in bedroom-. So I think this dream is about a problem or doubt about sexual life. There is also a problem about time in this dream, time goes faster than the guy thinks. I think this "dream" is about doubt or problem about pre-ejaculation. Dreamer's hidden emotions reveals themselves in this way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Luis Bunuel, a master of surrealism, is able to provide a social message of cultural relativism, challenge arbitrary norms, manifest the viewer's own perversions, and do so in an objective light. Remarkable. As the plot moves seamlessly from one character to another he does not allow the audience to grow too attached to any one of them. By incorporating dream life/ subconscious desires into a realist setting our two lives are connected. This surrealist practice allows for a peculiar, yet believable, reality which in turn challenges universally accepted practices: religion, dining habits, preconceptions of strangers, the psyche of children, and the human condition. A large concern of Bunuels is mans capability and the result of absolute freedom. His focus on the importance of both lives, dream and waking, allows him to escape time and space within the medium. The result is an objective view of a real reality that most disregard. The Phantom Of Liberty is a study of the human condition.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bunuel's "Phantom of Liberty"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Luis Bunuel is the one of the greatest movie director of Surrealism, and this movie, "Phantom of Liberty", is famous as not only Bunuel's film but also a masterpiece of Surrealism. I have watched some surrealistic movies recently and thought that this film is the best movie of Surrealism because of a lot of well polished and humorous plays. This omnibus style movie tells dream-like and strange stories which could over turn common sense. Especially, I have a liking for the stories which happened in an inn. It is possible to say that the love story of a young man and his old aunt is the foremost one which has realness than the others. Nevertheless, of course, this story is also fulfilled with Bunuel's black humor. Viewers of this film may be confused with wide-opened eyes like the ostrich which appear on the last part of the movie and has the gaggle eyes by those unrealistic and humorous stories. This movie which represents gaps of real and unreal which based on this world in any way is suitable to call the masterpiece of Surrealism.</fullReview>

At scene shooting scene which tell us that a unlimited freedom could cause this kind of trouble. The random selection which make audience feel scared that we won't know when we will be the one.Another scene which is about the invisible girl. It is reflect now days people do not really take care their children. Parents do not care their children's words. They only care what they hear from others. The director shoot this part in very technique way. By pretending this little girl is not there and actually she is there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie reminded me of two films, very loosely. The first was Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould. The second was Pulp Fiction. All three of these films are a bunch of different stories interlaced with each other where one leads to the next and so on. In Phantom, though, you quite literally never go back to the story you left. This can be very frustrating, at first. I didn't know where this was going, and I seem to appreciate consistency when I watch a film, but after awhile, it got me to stop looking for a story and look at it almost as a documentary. Like the Glenn Gould film used the music he was known for to show vignettes of his life, I could see this as Bunuel's view on many different subjects, all thrown out for public view. He conveyed his ideas in a creative, absurd and funny way, which I really enjoyed.</fullReview>

A couple things are that he thought that films did not have to follow the rules of logic. He also used a lot of religious symbols in sort of an offending way.After seeing the film, I really enjoyed it. The church and the wealthy are Bu?uel's main targets. He also presents the film to make us think 'what if what they are doing is really not that wrong?' He makes the film watcher think about what is really right and wrong and why, if wrong, is it wrong.</fullReview>

None of it makes sense, except that it makes absolute sense. By the time a little girl is reported missing by her parent, although she is manifestly with them in schoolroom and police station. All the particular scenes don't literally make sense at all. Luis Bunuel turns everything upside down but we soon realize that he describes our ridiculous life. He doesn't show his plots rashly but he makes us think over them. As a result, he uses innuendo in every single scenes that make me freak out. After watch movie, you will soon realize what they meant. In the name of liberty, how life can be abused.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Phantom of Liberty" is a movie that made me believe I was dreaming, but actually I was awake. It dove into my subconscious and enlivened something very surreal on film. Luis Bu?uel did a fine job portraying this very dream-like atmosphere on film and also containing a certain message with these portrayals. A fine moment in the film is when a sniper starts to shoot people from a tower randomly to assert that definition of freedom in the world. Also with the scene with the toilets, the question of what is normal and what isn't is brought up. It seems society already has dictated what's right and what's not, and Bu?uel is making this visible on screen to reveal that none of this is not capable of happening. The movie also is a movie of coincidence that made different characters meet others to make it flow very nicely. I was captivated throughout the film and was very interested. It is a movie that made me think of what could happen and what is really normal. Is normal really right? Or is it society telling us it is right? The film is very interesting, and I enjoyed it very much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the beginning of the film, I got really bored because when the part of a story was starting to get interesting, the whole subject of the story changed. There were so many parts to this movie that I really don't remember everything in detail, but the part that I remembered the most was the part where the part where the adults couldn't see the child that was there and the part where they were sitting down on a toilet and talking to one another, as if they're talking in the dinner table. The part where the child was "invisible" was remembered to me because it was just so odd how the child was "missing" when she was just there the whole time. So it kind of stuck to my head. The other part was remembered because it was also one of those unusual things that we don't do. It kind of made me re-think of our society in general; it seems as though we are living in the world where we are just conformed of our everyday lives, giving almost no tries. If our "privacy" was so open, just as in the film, would our society still be like this? This question constantly came into my mind while I was watching this film. I really enjoyed the film in general.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A bizarre world. Bizarre behavior, bizarre emotion, bizarre recognition. You probably would think this is way too far from the real world you live in. Do you? Then think it a little more? Is it really that far from the reality, or from what you have encountered all your life, even only once? The extremeness in this film does have its prototypes in real life. For example, the missed girl story shows that is how ignorant and mindless people can be sometimes, and the killer story mocks the complicated-but-useless social system, what a waste! Going extremely is just a way to irritate human's nerve.If you like comedy, especially the British humor, you would enjoy this film more, since they share something in common. The artists try to catch the essence of something in life, then exaggerate it, twist it, and play with it. There is no traditional plot in this movie, just a stream of sketches. Not every sketch will make you feel connected, only some. And not every person feels connected to the same sketch, because their own experience gives them different eyes and senses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bu?uel's Amusing Surrealism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "The Phantom of Liberty" you get only what the title says: illusions of freedom that can be scary, strange, humorous and unusual just like phantoms; and the only liberty presented here is the one created, written and directed by its genius Luis Bu?uel. Everything is surreal like in most of his works, the viewers need to be open minded all the time and accept everything that it's on the screen to fully appreciate the masterpiece presented in your front. There's no destination, no endings to the numerous characters presented, and to some might not have sense at all. We are introduced to characters that experience dangerous, strange, funny experiences that makes them all free of society impositions, moral structure and other restraining things. The transitions between the stories and figures is one of the most original and interesting ever presented in a motion picture of all time; first we see one character and his story, someone appears with him and from that point we start to follow the other intrusive character and this presentations goes on and on until the abrupt closure.Figures like a eccentric hatter (Michael Lonsdale) that invites four monks, a woman and a teenage to his hotel room where he is dominated and spanked by his woman in a S&amp;M fetish; a strange doctor (Adolfo Celi) that keeps saying that his patient (Jean Rochefort) is perfectly fine to later tell him that he has cancer, and offering a cigarette in the following moment; this other man and his wife trying to find out the disappearance of the daughter at school but she's right in front of them (terrific joke that in the hands of another director could be ignored, or don't have any sense of humor); these and other bizarre figures are among the figures and situations showed in a harmonic combination of humor and surrealism, yet with a serious intensity that allows to watch the film without looking for answers, or that tempestuous anxiety of finding a message in it. It makes you interested simply because the director tried to make miscellaneous vignettes of absurd situations that begins like an ordinary story, then to become a weird, funny and different story than anything that you ever seen in films. If you enjoyed or were intrigued by "Belle du Jour", "The Exterminating Angel", "Un Chien Andalou" or "L'Age Dor" and other Bu?uel works this is a great challenge for you. It's very unconventional like his other pictures but it offers more than just being a different film. It makes you ask how genius can a man be by doing such an artistic and plausible statement on the strange side of the human condition that knows how to get attention from the viewers. No other director succeed it so well in doing all of this than Bu?uel. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Luis Bu?uel's Phantom of Liberty is a one of a kind film. Its a film that questions what is known as "the norm." Like, who is to say that what we believe in is the norm? His film depicts many episodes that that are only vaguely related. So this film is not really a plot set story. It is more of many episodes all related by being surreal. One famous episode, depicts many people sitting on their toilets round a dining table as they do their business and then later on sit privately in a small room in order to eat. As if it was normal to use the restroom publicly along with other people and later eat your food in private. Another episode answers the question, can we have total freedom? It depicts a man who decides to assassinate many random people one afternoon from a tall building. Once he is caught he goes to trial and is found guilty. Right after that he is let free and signs autographs on his way out as if he were a celebrity. The funny thing is that in a way that has happened in our society with the 1970's Ted Bundy. We didn't let him free but he has become a sort of celebrity and even god-like to some people in this world. I would recommend this film, its interesting and a different experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is a Fine Line.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bu?uel is certainly not concerned with social norms and for this I applaud him. It's almost difficult to put into words the absurdities of this film, I mean that in a good way. "The Phantom of Liberty" is unlike any film I've ever seen. I was left with questions, such as "What are my own values?", "Why do I buy what society feeds me as the end all be all?", "What is my true voice and what would I do if I was totally free to express that voice?", "How would I use/abuse such freedom?"While these are questions that we all ask at one point or another, what Bu?uel does so beautifully, is that he pokes fun and makes us laugh, while making us think and look a bit deeper.Bu?uel's surreal world is a fast paced one, moving from one vignette to the next, each making it's point magnificently. While the events are seemingly unrelated, one thing is for sure...Bu?uel turns the tables on us. Among my favorites scenes, are where an old woman's naked body is revealed as that of a young lady's, unwrinkled and beautiful. Another where a couple looks at photos and we are led to believe that they are of pornographic nature, only to reveal beautiful landmarks. And most shocking of all is where friends gather around a table to use the toilet in each other's presence. Then one goes off to have a meal in the bathroom. Sounds crazy indeed. But why?? Who's to say we have it right?We instantly realize, if we allow ourselves to, that we are the perverts, we are judgmental, and perhaps even sheep...following the herd."The Phantom of Liberty" will go down as one of my favorite films of all time! Thank you Luis Bu?uel for reminding me to ask questions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is something different and very interesting style of movie making, that deserves to be seen more often than it is shown. 'The Phantom of Liberty' is a pure Surrealist film by Luis Bunuel, the movie consists of a series of only vaguely related episodes. In all the episodes we get to know one or more characters then suddenly after a while we jump to another new character. never really getting to know what happened to the those before the others. we jump from character to character that all have their own unik stories to tell. The movie brings up many questions we have in society today and also many problems. Its a very intelligently directed movie, all the short stories have their own meanings that's very well put together. Also has many comic moments that will make you laugh. I wish we had more of these film today, because 'The Phantom of Liberty' is a movie everyone should see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming and Witty Take on Life as it Could Be...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Phantom of Liberty plays like a witty joke among friends. It is smart and deeply insightful.The thought that runs throughout the film is the notion of freedom. What would we do if we had it and there were no limits? This is explored by a series of characters running around in absurd circumstances exercising their freedom. Most interesting was a scene where something similar to a dinner party is occurring, although in this case, the well dressed party-goers sit down on toilet bowls for communal bowel movements.It almost seems like the director is saying that we couldn't handle unbridled freedom. If we were given true freedom, perhaps we wouldn't know what to do with it and life would just become a series of events that make no sense.But this raises an interesting question. Is true liberty really "anything goes"? Is it doing anything and everything that we want? That hardly seems like liberty to me. In fact, it seems very much the opposite of liberty. True liberty might just be the freedom to do something but also making the choice to not.</fullReview>

However, I appreciated it more once I let go of my expectations and allowed myself to just watch and be entertained for a while. The scenes are conjoined in an extremely clever fashion, leaving you wanting more and more.

		<fullReview>I love watching movies that I walk away from having to think and understand what just unfolded in front of my eyes. Yet, I hate it when I just don't understand it. The Phantom of Liberty is a film that most people will feel that way about. Luis Bunel directs a film that unfolds like a dream. If you think about it, dreams make sense until you wake up. The Phantom of Liberty is a film that doesn't pass moral judgement of the extremities of good and evil. It's in the middle.One character connects to another character in stories that are completely irrelevant. As a millennium baby, I found it very difficult to stay in tune as the story jumped around constantly with out tying together. "Random" is a word that would best simplify this film. Bunel does a fantastic job thinning down the line between what's real and what isn't. He allows his characters to act out their fantasies and desires without moral judgement. (Most of the character's desires involve sexual oppression.) I got the overall message that the director sent my way, but my entertainment level was on and off. Films "now'a'days" have to be faster and exciting, or be slow and make a sense. The Phantom of Liberty was a big abstract message that one could really appreciate, but not necessarily enjoy. It's like eating your vegetables, do it, they're good for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most supreme example of Bu?uel shooting style...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a lot of things to praise in this film, but for me, the thing that stood out most was Bunuel's Shooting style. This movie is the perfect example of what he did on a technical level...His shooting style is very recognizable in all his films except for Andalusian dog. By the time he made Golden age (his second film) in 1930, he was already starting to develop his methods and the technical limitations of the time are the only real difference between that movie and his late era movies like this one. Bunuel's style is one of the perfect examples of a cinematic style that developed out of necessity. With the kind of films Bunuel wanted to make, it was natural for him to develop his particular kind of camera technique. In that sense he could be compared any number of other early pioneer filmmakers (Hitchcock, Ford, Lang, Eisenstein, Capra, Murnau, Hawks etc...) who had to figure out there own approach to movie making in the absence of many influences. These guys had access to the basic ground rules thanks to D.W Griffith and a few other folks, but they all had very personal ideas about what a movie should be and some of the subtle tricks that are now part of every filmmakers vocabulary were absent.What Bunuel developed was a cinematic style that favors economy and a general lack of emotion. I would describe his movies as distant without being cold. The way he moves the camera and the preferred framing distances in combination with the way he choreographs actors and edits scenes together.... Not only is it simple, and incredibly economical.... It also serves his surreal tendencies perfectly because his shooting style tends to create an air of understatement and subtle detachment. This allows him to show you bizarre and illogical things without shocking you out of your involvement. With Bu?uel's style, even the most incredible things can seem almost normal.An early scene in this film where an ostrich walks through someones bedroom is a perfect example. The camera and the actors treat it as a mere curiosity... Nothing to get too upset about... Something worth looking at, but not especially extraordinary.When you first here about Bunuel's films, you may expect something like David Lynch. I was already a huge Lynch fan when I first investigated Bunuel but I ended up being very surprised. You can draw a comparison between Andalusian Dog and Lynch's style, but after that Bunuel's style evolved quickly and all of his later films bare no resemblance to Lynch's work in terms of cinematic technique. Lynch combines his Surrealism with an aesthetic that's almost like the German Expressionists. Bunuel's movies are much more realistic and slightly less emotional. More like David Cronenberg, but more elegant and prone to whimsy. Not so interested in the grotesque. This works for Bunel because the original surrealists (and Bunuel was among them) were trying to present dreamlike content... When you're dreaming all sorts of strange things happen, but they don't seem that strange to you at the time. It's only later, when you wake up and tell someone about your dream that it seems bizarre. With a David Lynch film you feel like your entering someone else's dream... With a Bunuel film, you feel like *you're* actually dreaming. Out of all the directors who've dabbled in surrealist cinema, Bunuel is the best at making his movies feel like an actual dream and this movie is the perfect case study in how he did it.The technique in this movie is utterly superb and perfect in every scene. It's beautiful to look at... The camera glides around from one perfect framing to another and everything is so well orchestrated that it's almost invisible. The camera is almost constantly in motion, but most viewers will never notice because the movements are always logical and they always serve some simple dramatic or practical purpose. The movements are smooth and silky and almost never sudden or jarring...the camera takes the viewer through through the film like a ghost... Gliding along, interested in what's going on, but strangely detached and separated.. Incredibly bizarre things happen all the time, but the viewer is able to take them in without registering much shock or being taken out of the movie.In one scene he generates a deeply chilling sort of fear.. Appropriately nightmarish.. It's not really shocking but there is a cold dread. You feel this way even though what he's about to show you is utterly absurd and the whole concept behind it is laughable. While you're in the grip of the movie it doesn't exactly seem that way. You register the absurdity but it's outweighed by the feeling of dread. In some ways, this is about as close as anyone's ever come to putting a dream on film and having the audience experience it like a dream. It's not his best movie, but it's one of his better ones and it's his finest "technical" achievement.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surrealistic gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two years after "The discreet charm of the Bourgeoisie", Luis Bu?uel comes back with another surrealistic gem. "Le fantôme de la liberté" (1974) is his penultimate work, also this one is written with screenwriter Jean-Claude Carri?re.In the movie there's not a really precise story -it's a collection of surrealistic sketches with many characters... But Bu?uel approaches again the typical themes of his filmography -a criticism about bourgeoisie, moral beliefs, social conventions, police...It's difficult to describe a movie like this one, in which the visual element is very strong. Many scenes and metaphorical situations speak alone -the image is as important as the dialogs, maybe more. This is frequent in Bu?uel movies, above all in the last 10 years of his cinematic career -from "Belle de jour" on.For the visual aspect this legendary Spanish director reminds us of another Spanish surrealist master -painter Salvador Dal?. Actually they were good friends and did together "Un chien andalu"...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Phantom of Liberty" is one of my favorite Bunuel films. It's more similar to "L Age D Or" than any of his later work. The film doesn't have any particular story, but several. Every story is hilarious as it satirizes bourgeois institutions. One incident has a stranger going up to little girls at a park and showing them pictures. Bunuel makes it appear that the pictures are dirty, as the man tells the girls, "not to show there parents". Later we find out the pictures are of monuments and vacation photos, nothing perverse. There's also a dinner party where guests sit on toilets around the table. And who could forget the man at the hotel into kinky S&amp;M? The boy who has relations with his mother? And the Monks in a couple rooms over? This is all at the same hotel, too. Later a girl is reported missing, but she is right with the police man at the station. He says, "Have you seen this girl"? They still file a report and don't even realize she's right in front of them. I think the funniest part of the movie is the sniper. He literally shoots people for no reason while there doing everyday activities. "The Phantom of Liberty" is a masterpiece of not only surrealism, but of comedy too.</fullReview>

The little girl sequence is brilliant, as is the 'pervert' in the park how shows little kids 'obscene' pictures of.....famous national landmarks. "Just disgusting", a child's parent comments. This is the kind of film where a group of celebut monks join a card game, only to find themselves in the midst of kinky couple's bondage fetish. A man who's just been diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer is offered a cigarette by his doctor! And the piece de la resistance, families and friends defacating in public, only to leave the table to secretly cower in little private rooms where they can guiltily eat with no one watching. Inspiring to no end! This film made me go out and make my own surrealist video, even going to the trouble of shooting in the freezing cold and getting a severed pig's head for one scene. It's all for the sake of surrealist art!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Bunuel's best by a long shot but could be the best place for a novice to begin.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel the same way about 'The Phantom Of Liberty' as I do about Bunuel's previous movie 'The Discreet Charm Of The Bourgeoisie'. I think they are two of his most accessible movies, and while I certainly enjoy watching them, I think they are a little bit shallow and lack the impact of his "real" works like 'Viridiana', 'Diary Of A Chambermaid' and especially my favourite, 'Belle De Jour'. 'Phantom' is even more episodic than 'Bourgeoisie'. Comparing it to Monty Python isn't that far-fetched in my opinion. It's a freewheeling movie, full of invention and sly humour. The actors are all very good, and include Bunuel semi-regular Michel Piccoli ('Belle De Jour'), Monica Vitti ('L'Avventura'), Adolfo Celi ('Diabolik') and Michael Lonsdale ('The Name Of The Rose'). There are a few very inspired and memorable sequences in the movie, especially the dinner party scene which has entered into legend, but overall I think it's a little bit contrived, and just has too many "bits" that don't add up to a particularly satisfying whole. I think that 'The Phantom Of Liberty' might be the easiest way for a novice to get into Bunuel, but it's not his best movie by a long shot. Try instead the three I mentioned earlier and 'The Exterminating Angel'. Still even average Bunuel is better than 99% of the mediocre crud around these days, so despite some reservations it comes with my recommendation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Specter and illusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much ink has already been spilled on this seemingly enigmatic film by Luis Bu?uel. Hereafter, an attempt to analyze some of the obvious and hidden aspects of this masterpiece. The film uses two notions of the word 'phantom': specter (menace) and illusion. The film also plays on many levels: political, religious, social, mental / physical, symbolical, psychoanalytical.Political The slogan 'Down with liberty' is heard at the beginning and at the end of the film. Its message is clear. First, we witness a staging of the famous Goya painting 'The Third of May, 1808' where Spanish prisoners, shouting this slogan, are shot by the French Republican army. 'Down with liberty' means here 'Down with the French Republic' and its sans-culottes, the defenders of the progressive motto 'Liberty, Equality, Fraternity'. At the end of the film, the spectator vaguely hears a crowd (apparently a manifestation) which shouts the same slogan. The film was shot during a period when the Communist Party in France still had important political and social clout, especially through its trade union. This party was at that time heavily influenced by a totalitarian state, which was fundamentally opposed to certain freedoms, including political ones. 'Down with liberty' means here also 'Down with the French Republic'.Religion, Justice Religion (Catholicism) was (is) also threatened by liberty and the sans-culottes. The viewer assists at a desecration of a church and of holy bread by the French Republican army. In addition, for L. Bu?uel, representatives of the Church are corrupt: in the film, monks play cards and drink alcohol. A sniper kills people indiscriminately in the street, apparently to sow panic among the population; so, it's a provocation (an utmost topical issue). He is condemned, but the sentences of the judges are not respected. To the contrary, the sniper is set free and congratulated by the judicial administration and by part of the population: down with liberty of justice. Physical and mental life A challenging aspect of the movies by L. Bu?uel is the dissociation between the physical (time, space) and mental (sentiments) reality. One can see a perfect example of this dissociation in another film by L. Bu?uel (An Andalusian Dog), where a father slaps his son, followed by the text 'thirteen years later' and the action continues. In other words, in a split of a second (the slap) the son becomes thirteen years older (psychological time). This dissociation is (perhaps) an explanation of the sequence of the film where a girl disappears while being present. She is physically present, but not mentally for her parents.Illusion Freedom is an illusion in matter of instincts (like for the animals of the zoo). In this regard, scenes of sexual deviances are constants in the films of L. Bu?uel as are dream sequences. Other psychoanalytic elements in this movie are anal fixation (a dinner where the guests are sitting on a toilet) or a split personality (the two prefects at the end of the film). Liberty as an illusion is the basic outline of the screenplay: the journey of the characters is all the time disrupted by unforeseen encounters, accidents or bad weather.The end of the film is a shot of an ostrich head, as if L. Bu?uel exhorts the spectator: don't put your head in the sand like an ostrich, but do face head-on the (hidden) reality as the bird on the screen.Se non ? vero, ? molto ben trovato ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A second tier Luis Bunuel is still better than many other directors films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Luis Bunuel has been creating films since the silents of the 1920's. In 1974 he was in the twilight of his career.This film is far from his best work BUT it still is far superior to many other film writer-directors.Besides directing he co-wrote this with Jean-Claude Carriere.Near insanity reigns in the masters movies. This film is 104 fast minutes long &amp; is comprised of many non-related scenes telling about the human condition,including bizarre fantasies the various characters have. Some are hard to accept &amp; some are not as funny as we would like them to be,.Life is the same way, we see &amp; yet do not see, we hear &amp; yet do not hear.Do not take this movie literally, also do not try to examine it very closely. Just accept this wild mans feelings. As I said,it is not the best Bunuel BUT its still a good enjoyable film.Ratings: *** (out of 4) 86 points (out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flows from one inverse to another</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oddly enough, I've seen more of what could be considered Luis Bunuel's "lesser" work than I have of his most cherished classics. Mexican melodramas? Caring dramas about American racism? It's movies like "The Phantom of Liberty" that makes it seem impossible that he could have created something like that.Existing somewhere between surrealist whimsy and sober picaresque is this classic about a roving world of people who each represent some personal fascination's of Bunuel, from arbitrary social conventions to criticisms of religion to just pure, flighty sex (and no, I'm not referring to the incest). Instead of crafting the movie around any specific set of characters or even bothering to return to them (except precisely once), he let's the camera grab onto a passing character after he's done with a previous one and the movie goes in a whole new direction. It's for that reason that Phantom of Liberty can either be considered a single movie or many, depending on your concerns. The flow and tone of it is such that it definitely exists in its own world, with its own perspective, but on the other hand it's perfectly possible to just not enjoy one part of it while loving another.I think the most brilliant scene, synecdoche for the entire movie, is everything that happens in the hotel. Doors open and close and people come and go, strange things happen and either people react to their strangeness or they don't, and it's all coincidence on all levels--from the mere fact of their being there at that moment to what build up of social conventions lead them to act the way they do. Plus, well, from a strictly structural standpoint--if you are a film student, watch this scene and take notes on camera placement, editing, and movement. It's genius.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A critical look at Freedom and Bourgeois society</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1918, in the Dada Manifesto we read "... we are not free and we ask for freedom". Then, Surrealism developed from Dadaism and Andre Breton wrote the Surrealism Manifesto : "...Pure psychic automation by which it is intended to express either verbally, in writing, the true function of thought, though dictated in the absence of all control exerted by reason, and outside all aesthetic or more preoccupations". L. Bunuel was part of Surrealism and did work with surrealists artists like Salvador Dali. Both Dadaism and Surrealism were anti-bourgeois, libertarian, anticlerical, and provocateurs movements. L. Bunuel in The Phantom of liberty is truly faithful to this background. His aim being to launch the ultimate attack on religion, bourgeois tradition, and exploring the human condition vis a vis freedom. "Down with liberty" is a critical view on the possibility of the human being liberation from himself or as Henri Laborit would say ... as long as the Human Specie won't recognize that the domination from humans on humans, individually and/or collectively, is the main motor of life on the planet earth and trying to use this fact for the benefit, somehow positively, of the specie we won't advance one step from auto-repression, slavery, and obscurantism which is precisely the bourgeois world denounced by Bunuel.From the very beginning when the husband said "I am tired of symmetry" and "The sea is not longer the sea". We are aware of a tired European man facing nihilism and bourgeois boredom. Then L. Bunuel sets the tone with mockery and makes fun of bourgeois symbolic icons (ex., The Arch of Triumph , Sacre Coeur Church, both in Paris, etc.). Then follows a series of scenes, some surrealists, where Bunuel studies reactions and situations. Let's concentrate in the killer Poet; the missing girl; and the police repression at the end of the film. Andre Breton once said that the surrealist act par excellence was to take a gun, go outside, and kill everyone at sight on the spot. This might be the source of this scene. The serial killer poet is sentence to death according to the Civil Code, and then he can walk free to the outside world. The outside world is death, the bourgeois world is death, life was and is being converted to death. This is why A. Rimbaud wanted to "changer la vie" and Marx "to transform the world". With the missing girl episode, Bunuel is teaching us that the Bourgeoisie represented by school authority, family, police, etc. fails to understand the actual world, is enraptured in its own vision and reveries (one dimensional thought, order, traditions, making profits, hierarchy, etc.). The bourgeoisie can look but cannot see (see relativity of laws discussion on Margaret Mead episode).The film closed with rather a pessimistic vision... We all are the animals in the zoo, living in cages, enslaved, and screaming, shouting, all day long : "Down with liberty" (As the Spaniards did when French troops with Napoleon at the head did try to expand ideals of Freedom and Fraterny in Europe after the French Revolution). Revolution that did fail as the Russian Revolution... L. Bunuel once said "I remained sympathetic to the communist party until the end of the 1950s, when I finally had to confront my revulsion. Fanaticism of any kind had always repelled me, and Marxism was no exception; it was like any other religion that claims to have found the truth (...) Everything could be explained, they said, by socio-economics mechanism, a notion that seemed perfectly derisory to me. A doctrine like that leaves out at least half of the human being".The idea of Liberty did fail or how to reach Liberty, Fraternity..., ... because... , somehow, ... "we are not free but we ask for freedom".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Phantom of Liberty, The (1974) **** (out of 4) Various characters are introduced as we go on a journey that shows us one small story after another, all of them related only in small ways. While I preferred the first half of the film a bit more there's no denying what a strange and twisted little film this was. I loved the humor scattered throughout the film from the opening scenes with the statue hitting a man on the head up to all the stuff inside the hotel room. The hotel segment was my personal favorite but the one with the missing little girl was great as well. Bunuel does a masterful job at creating the surreal feel of a dream. Nothing in this film makes any sense but hey, that's just like a dream.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Discreet Lunacy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpan craziness seen through the wicked mind of Bunuel as only he could bring it to the masses who in 1975 went to the theatres to see his loosely connected set of stories that laughed in the face of logic. The story of LE FANTOME DE LA LIBERTE employs yet another version of Bunuel's sinful attack on social customs as when people gather around a dinner table that has toilets for seats and instead of eating dinner courses they defecate while talking about how 12 billion tons of human waste is being produced on a daily basis as every so often, someone steals away with a poker face to a booth resembling a time capsule self-serving a ready-to-eat dinner course.It can't get better than this, but Bunuel is symbolic with pure outrageous imagery that manages to tell little stories about how we have become victims of our social customs and how meaningless the whole charade is. When a little girl named Aliette is declared lost, her parents go to the school to ask questions, but when the teacher calls out the names of each student, there she is, with a bright little face eager to learn and obedient as always. Of course, the parents are under the understanding that Aliette is lost, and off to the police they go (with Aliette in arms) and with the help of Aliette they make their concise report.Does this mean anything? Not really, but it's just the sheer absurdity of it all. That the story continues its tale about how little Aliette remained lost as a killer went on a killing spree only to emerge later as a heartthrob (of course) and a prefect gets caught in a case of mistaken identity in the oddest of vignettes: he steps into a bar where he will play a game of dominoes with friends. Into the bar walks a beautiful young woman with whom he strikes some conversation. In their conversation, he reveals to her that she resembles his dead sister, and that he had an extreme fondness for her, to the point that he had her play the piano for him in the nude. The story gets interrupted (again, the Bunuelian act of "interrupting") by a phone call. It's his sister. Of course, it can't be; she's dead. Not content to leave matters alone, he goes to the cemetery where her body lies. Entering the mausoleum, we see a mane of red hair identical to the lady he met at the bar spilling out in a cascade... just as he gets caught by the police, incarcerated, and in walks Michel Piccoli as the real prefect who instead of arresting the fake one, decides to have him go into a shooting spree at a zoo. The last shot, a freeze-frame of an ostrich, is classic, outlandish, and rip-roaring funny.But not as near as funny as the lengthy, subversive, morphing introduction that starts out as the 1808 Toledo revolution where people who refuse to be liberated are executed and cries of "Long live chains!" are overheard. A soldier makes an attempt to kiss the beautiful dead body of a lady only to be whacked in the head by the lady's dead husband's statue. Here the story spins out of its own confines and we hear the voice of a nanny reading what we've seen as the little girl whom she's taking care of gets some pictures from a sinister looking man who tells her not to show it to her. When her parents get hold of the pictures, they are shocked at the content, fire the nanny, and then get aroused. It's then when I thought they must be seeing filthy pictures, but once I was allowed access to them myself, I screamed in laughter -- they were typical postcards! And then they hand one of them to the little girl, go to bed, and in a deadpan sequence, the father wakes up to see a rooster, an ostrich, and mailman come in, one by one, into his room. This leads him to seek therapy, and from there on, it becomes the story of a nurse who goes into the countryside and lands in a bizarre bed and breakfast where Franciscan monks get very attached to her and invite her to a game of cards (a throwback to the implied sex as card game in VIRIDIANA) as an SM scene is about to take place between a man and a woman and a young man seduces his older aunt.Bunuel's implication that mankind and society is unable and even unwilling to accept its own sense of freedom makes up for the odd title he chose for his film. Reportedly met with a mixed reaction due to the fact audiences were waiting to see something in the vein of LE CHARM DISCRET DE LA BOURGEOISIE, however slight LE FANTOME DE LA LIBERTE may look, it is truthful to Bunuel's previous classic. Bunuel had a remarkable way of telling the same story while never repeating himself too overtly. If you look closely all the elements of his style are there. Man's foibles are the well from where the best tales come from and he throws the ones he's most familiar with into the mix, coming with a deconstructed anti-story where wrong is right and nothing is as it seems.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Although Not My Cup of Tea, I Can See How This Film is So Popular</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me first, just start off with saying, that this film wasn't really my cup of tea. I like films that are more linear and have more of a story, I sort of walked away from this one scratching my head wondering what I was supposed to take away, if anything, from this movie. I can see how it was popular and groundbreaking cinema at the time it came out, just not so much as I watched it in 2009. I realize that was supposed to be clever and satirical as it pokes fun at religion and mores, but as I watched it I just thought that it was rather trivial and too tongue in cheek for my liking. Although, I'm not a particularly religious person in the traditional sense of the word, I enjoyed the naughty bits, such as the "making fun" of monks and clergy types by having them indulge in some not so Christ like behavior such as gambling and flirting with young, beautiful women, using their religious trinkets as pawns for their gambling games, and generally making fools of themselves. The one vinette I did find non-dated, and ahead of it's time, was the S&amp;M couple. It was hilarious to see the woman in her dominatrix outfit spanking her partner's bare ass. I wasn't aware that S&amp;M was already so advanced back then, and was funny to realize that these practices have been around for decades and decades.</fullReview>

The multiple stories/links had me sitting in my seat trying to connect - still I leave this film unsure of what it's idea really embraced....truly random things happening. What makes this movie very different, and in my assumption greatly appreciated by many is that it doesn't follow a specific order. Most movies have a set foundation - very predictable if I might add these days. The Phantom had me thinking the entire way through...I was like which way is this trying to go..what's it's purpose and what's the outcome going to be. To me this type of richness is a guide that many of today's films should follow. Change up the normality..there's so much free space in front of a lense...be creative.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes inventive, always uneven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen a great many of surrealistic director Luis Bunuel's films, but what I have seen I don't really like - and I don't like this film much for the same reason I'm not keen on the others - it lacks backbone, and while some of the visuals are nice and stick in your mind; the film feels like it's been put together by some lunatic whose been in a window-less garage full of empty paint cans for too long. The film doesn't follow a set plot structure, and basically is just comprised of a number of surreal set pieces, which follow on from one another. While some of these set pieces are highly inventive and offer startling images that you wont forget easily, others are just purely stupid and don't capture the imagination or the interest and serve only in slowing the film down. Sequences which are good include a backwards dinner party where the guest sit on toilets and occasionally retire to eat food, and a couple that invite a lot of other guests at a hotel back to their room, only for the woman to begin whipping the man. These scenes are good because Bunuel startles the viewer, and this ensures that the images on screen will stick in your mind long after the film is over. He's not able to make this stick all the way through, however, and scenes involving childish policemen and a 'missing' girl just don't have the same verve and vitality as the good scenes, and they bring the film down. If Bunuel could have succeeded in making the entire film memorable, he would have been onto a winner; but he hasn't and this film is therefore worth a look; but not a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If Only this Film Were Actually Funny. . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The back of the DVD box says that this film demolishes bourgeois conventions, and since demolishing bourgeois conventions is one of my favorite pastimes I was more than ready to be won over. Unfortunately, that never happened because this film turned out to be a series of self-indulgent vignettes that were strung together for no rhyme or reason. Some of the points were right on the mark, others weren't. It's just that none were hilarious or profound. None were given the proper time to flourish. Since this film never had focus I can't say that it lost it, but I lost mine near the end. Eventually I was just staring at the screen thinking, "Oh look, there's a naked piano player," or "Why is that guy crawling around a tomb?" Director Luis Bunuel relies on the theatre of the absurd to make his points, and while that can work for a while I seriously doubt you can build an entire film on top of it. I also can't help but think that maybe fighting the nonsense of the bourgeois conventions with more nonsense might not be the best strategy. For as crazy as Woody Allen's "Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex * But Were Afraid to Ask" was it was more grounded in reality and thus more successful. Both films used goofy skits to make social points but only Allen makes you care about his points. But what about Bunuel's points? The main one seems to be how ridiculous it is that we find it necessary to hide things that are perfectly natural. We are, for instance, the only animal in the kingdom that has sex in private. Is this what our advancement has bought us, shame? His ideas about our behavior towards food and bodily waste were also very good. To eat and urinate are both 100% natural, yet one is done with our friends and family and the other is done behind a locked door. Of course one smells good and one doesn't, but our treatments of these two activities are polar opposites and you have to wonder why. I also liked the point that the bourgeoisie thinks that they can label any old thing indecent if it fits their agenda (Remember when "Million Dollar Baby" was indecent?). And the way that religion intrudes on your life and then expects a pat on the back for doing so was right on the mark even if the skit was a dud.The worst of the skits was probably the one where the cops couldn't find a missing girl who was right under their noses. It probably would have worked better had the cops not been actively talking to the girl the whole time as that was too much for me to handle. The point being made was probably that we don't pay enough attention to our children (fair enough), or maybe it was that cops are ineffectual (duh), but that skit embodied all that was wrong with this film. No restraint, no context, no humor. Oh well. **1/4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Pythons are much funnier.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roger Ebert informs us, in his infinite wisdom or infinite stupidity (all depends on whether you take this bloated nincompoop seriously or not), that the vignettes in this movie are disconnected because the theme is freedom, and where there is freedom one cannot expect any kind of flow or logic because anarchy rules. Huh? This is a typical example of what's been wrong with movie critics in the last 50 years: reading meanings into things that don't mean anything, or rationalizing even the most absurd/abstract scenes or plots to the point of insanity and unintentional self-mockery. This has been IN PARTICULAR the case with pompous European dramas, and occasionally even "comedies".Bunuel's TPOL is merely a series of sketches, the way Monty Python had done them before him ? and far better. (How could the French/Spanish possibly compete with the British in humour, whether it be outright silliness or clever satire?) But while some of Bunuel's sketches have a good/humorous premise, they are often not directed or even acted too well. (When Lonsdale, otherwise a good actor, says "why can't the monks at least stay?" it isn't funny. It's a decent line, but it has to be PRESENTED and said the right way in order to be funny on film; it's tough to successfully transfer a funny line from text to the screen, and Bunuel is not a master of this, clearly (though better than many of his contemporaries).) The toilet-seat dinning-room idea would have been produced with hilarity by the Pythons, whereas Bunuel's direction merely makes one grin slightly.What I'm saying is: IT ISN'T JUST THE IDEA THAT COUNTS, BUT HOW YOU DEVELOP IT ON SCREEN. This simple fact is something pretentious critics have rarely failed to neglect.The only vignette that came close to being truly funny is the pedophile's photos sketch. However, most of the vignettes, while interesting, aren't funny. Borat is funny, Bunuel's material is merely unusual, maybe a tad clever at best.Honestly, I am not some hormone-driven teen (I am not a teen at all), but one of the highlights of the movie is Asti playing the piano in the nude. And isn't nudity and sexual perversion the real reason why a number of people watch supposedly intellectual European "masterpieces" anyway? Let's be honest here? (Btw, that vignette was okay, as was the one in police class.) Does anyone really laugh like a hyena watching this type of comedy? I only wish that I could be made to laugh as easy as some people out there? Some of the premises here are not funny nor clever nor anything. For me the dumbest vignette was the missing child one. The idea is too dumb, maybe worthy of a 30-second piece, but when stretched over 5-10 minutes it just gets tedious and quite pointless. Another dull bit was the spree-killer leaving the court-room: badly acted and not funny. So what was the point of that sketch? That freedom might mean that a man can kill people randomly, implying that the fine line between anarchy and freedom is hard to balance between? Or what? Whatever the brilliant ? and no doubt left-wing - message Bunuel had for us here doesn't get me excited at all. Style without substance in movies is not enough. But substance (even if there is any here) without (an adequate) style is insufficient, too.Watching this movie I was not only reminded of Monty Python, but also of Lyndsey Anderson's brilliant "O, Lucky Man!". That movie is relatively disjointed, too, but directed, acted and photographed with such class, such style that Bunuel should have studied that film to learn from the true masters of cinema. Bunuel, Truffaut, and other overrated film-student darlings could also have learned a lot from Kubrick, compared to whom they are mere amateurs. A little perfectionism can't hurt at all, you know, when making a movie? Btw, monks praying - and then playing poker? Is that supposed to be original? Funny? I've seen porn films with better gags?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very self-selecting film. Those who love Luis Bu?uel and adore his Surrealism will no doubt think this an an absolutely marvelous and absurd piece of art. Many of those who don't will probably be amused by some of the silliness, but could probably not be convinced it is either great art or something they'd like to see again. And I am also sure that a many of the run-of-the-mill film viewers would probably hate it. I just can't see most teens watching this type of film.In many ways, this movie reminds me of the paintings of Dali, and that is certainly not a surprise considering that the director and Dali had worked together in the past and BOTH adored nonsensical work that both confused and enraged audiences. This film was a deliberate attempt at both--especially as far as being confusing. Many of the vignettes just seem very random and go nowhere, while others are pretty revolting and others are pretty funny--it's a very odd mix. I think the one I liked best was the very first vignette with the "dirty old man in the park" who gives little girls "bad pictures"--it's not as bad as it sounds and was actually pretty funny. I can't say I necessarily hated the film, but I sure wouldn't want a steady diet of these films. It was certainly an unusual experience (much like eating haggis or hang gliding naked). If you liked this film, try seeing BUFFET FROID (another French film)--it is even more absurd and bizarre than this one.</fullReview>
