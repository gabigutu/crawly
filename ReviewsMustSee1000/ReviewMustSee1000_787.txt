		<fullReview>An heiress is murdered while honeymooning on a Nile cruise. Fortunately, the famous Belgian detective Hercule Poirot is holidaying on the same paddle steamer, and begins an investigation. However, it would seem that all of the other passengers on board have clear motives for committing the murder.This was the second of Agatha Christie's novels featuring Hercule Poirot to be filmed, after the success of 'Murder On The Orient Express' a few years earlier. The great Peter Ustinov, who so recently passed away, took on the role this time, and injected it with his own droll humour. Indeed the whole film seems rather tongue in cheek, with the all star cast having fun with their roles. Bette Davis, Maggie Smith and Jack Warden all enjoyably ham it up, but Angela Lansbury manages to outdo them all with a delightfully over the top performance as the perpetually drunk author of erotic novels. David Niven, ever the archetypal British gent, proves a good foil as Poirot's partner in the investigation.Where the film really scores is in the locations and photography. Egypt proves a stately backdrop to proceedings and veteran Cinematographer Jack Cardiff makes the most of it. The 1930's setting also gives an air of genteel opulence to the surroundings. While the film couldn't claim to be a classic tension filled mystery, it is a pleasant, laid back and enjoyable entertainment, that's clever enough to keep you guessing until the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another case for Agatha Christie's sleuth Hercule Poirot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The book, from which this film was adapted, is probably one of Agatha Christie's best. The plot centres on Linnet Doyle, a woman who stole her best friend's fiancé. The scorned Jackie pursues the couple wherever they go, and when she follows them onto a Nile cruise, it seems that Jackie is not the only one who has a motive for murder. Of course, the ever dependable Poirot is on hand to solve the incredibly cleverly planned crime.This film contains some fantastic scenes set in the heart of Egypt, along with an all star cast. The most brilliant performance of all comes from Angela Lansbury, who plays Mrs. Otterbourne, a drunken old writer who apparently used Linnet in one of her overly erotic books and is consequently being taken to court where she may loose everything. Lansbury captures the humorous side but also the unfortunate aspect of the character and it is this immense acting ability that should have won her an Oscar.The chemistry between the main characters is marvellous and at the end, when the final solution to the affair is presented, the audience is shocked when they learn who did it, appreciating fully the extent of Christie's genius. This is a fantastic film, which builds up tension fantastically, and is perhaps one of the greatest films ever made, and is always underrated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good, well-paced classic whodunnit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was the first and best of Peter Ustinov's performances as Hercule Poirot. Though physically not very accurate to Agatha Christie's description of the little Belgian detective, for this one movie everything worked and the discrepancy was not a problem. The film is well-paced, with all the plot turns and clues coming with perfect timing, not too fast to be confusing, but not too slow to strain the rather flimsy fabric of the story. The whole cast is very good, especially Bette Davis as a malevolent old spider of a woman, gleefully tormenting her long-suffering companion, Maggie Smith. The scene where she smiles indulgently at a group of Egyptian children waving at her on the river bank, only to sink into mortified disgust as they turn around and moon her, is a highlight of the movie. The climax of the film is quite surprising, and unlike many mysteries, does not cheat the viewer by withholding vital information until the last moment. We feel the pleasure of being honestly fooled throughout, and the conclusion is thoroughly satisfying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sumptuous version of classic Christie mystery...absorbing entertainment...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Murder aboard a Nile steamer in the 1930s is deftly handled here thanks to a good script and some excellent performances.There can be no question about it--if you're a mystery fan of the sort of crime novels Agatha Christie wrote during her prolific writing career--this is for you. The script fashioned from one of her best works gives a number of interesting actors roles they can chew the scenery with--and most of them do. I can't praise Angela Lansbury enough for her deft and daffy portrayal of a tipsy authoress--so good, she deserved at least an Oscar nomination. The only real flaw is the film's tendency to move at a rather slow pace before things get more intense.Other acting kudos among the suspects aboard a Nile steamer belong to Bette Davis as an elderly dowager with a penchant for stealing jewelry; her servant, Maggie Smith, with whom she exchanges some priceless barbs; Simon MacCorkindale and Lois Chiles as lovers; Mia Farrow as a vengeful ex-sweetheart; and of course Peter Ustinov as Poirot. David Niven has the least colorful role and can do little with it as he endeavors to help Poirot solve the mystery. The plot has all the ingenious twists we come to expect of Christie and is a very clever one--if slightly improbable when you stop to think about it--depending heavily on luck and coincidence.But it's all delivered as entertainment and wrapped up in a package designed to stir the senses with an excellent musical score, some fine scenery and Oscar-winning costumes. It's a relief that the writer decided to keep the period of the novel in the 1930s rather than update it as has been done with other Christie stories--notably, MURDER IS EASY ('82) which was updated to include computer technology as part of the plotline. The period flavor here is an added pleasure.Flavorful, and highly amusing whenever Bette Davis and Maggie Smith have a go at some wisecracks, with an ending that will surprise you if you fail to catch some of the clues. Superior entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always loved Agatha Christie novels because she never cheats in her mysteries. We're given all of the information and if we're clever enough, we can unravel the mystery and all will be revealed. This is true with the film adaptation of Death on the Nile. I adore Mr. Ustinov's Poirot and Maggie Smith, Betty Davis, Angela Landsbury, Mia Farrow and David Niven are just fabulous. Just so that no one is surprised the murders are very grisly even by todays standard, but the scenery is breathtaking and the sets and costumes transported me to Egypt and I loved every minute of it. Watch and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A wonderful cast of superb actors playing a wonderful cast of outrageous characters. Exotic locale. Lots of laughs. Great lines. ("If there are two things I hate it's heat and heathens.) Ustinov gives a somewhat harder spin to Christie's Poirot than Suchet but he's just as wonderful. Angela Lansbury should have had the Oscar for best supporting actress that year for her tipsy, dipsy authoress. Maggie Smith is her usual incredible self. The great and always fascinating Bette Davis. And the wonderfully synchophantic "manager" of the steamer. All this with exotic locations, superb camera work and well paced suspense. Not too often I vote a ten. On this one I did. Bravo!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot. Forget all those other phonies who've tried to fill his shoes! Including that ridiculous Murder on the Orient Express! His sly, lovable demeanor rivals any of the great actors playing detectives- Peter Falk as Columbo, etc. He has a wonderful way of gaining the confidence and trust of each of his suspects, while probing them for information. You never really know who he suspects, and that's the fun of the mystery. He guides you through the maze like true detective. I have seen each of his delicious portrayals as the great, Belgian detective several times, and they just get better with age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great all-star whodunit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Filthy rich Lois Chiles is killed on a ship traveling down the Nile River in Egypt. Good thing that detective Hercule Poirot (Peter Ustinov) is aboard. Unfortunately, everyone on board had a reason to kill her. Poirot tries to figure out who did it while the bodies start to pile up....Visually beautiful and totally fascinating adaptation of an Agatha Christie mystery. It was a deserved Oscar Winner for Costume Design--all the clothing was in period and looks truly beautiful. Also they shot on location in Egypt which helps. The cast went through hell though--it was very hot and the clothes they wore were heavy and uncomfortable. Bette Davis especially complained loudly about the clothes and tore into Olivia Hussey for playing loud music in her cabin--at 6:30 in the morning.The cast, however, is very good in their roles. Ustinov is perfect as Poirot--much better than Albert Finney in "Murder on the Orient Express". Bette Davis does wonders with next to nothing in her role as a jewel thief. David Niven just tags along with Ustinov helping him solve the mystery. Mia Farrow is (sadly) miscast--she struggles in a very difficult role. Angela Landsbury (obviously enjoying herself) runs away with the movie as an alcoholic novelist. George Kennedy barely registers--he's very underwritten. Maggie Smith, playing Davis' maid, is a treat--the sparring insults between her and Davis are VERY funny. Jack Warden is OK faking a fairly convincing German accent as a doctor. Lois Chiles looks absolutely stunning...but is killed off. Olivia Hussey is sadly underused. Simon MacCorkindale is very good as Chiles' husband. And Jon Finch is very wooden as a revolutionary. Still, everything works.I saw it back in a theatre in 1978 and loved it. Over 20 years later, I STILL love it. Much better than the overrated "Murder on the Orient Express". A definite 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Timeless Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is one of my all time favourites. As an Agatha Christie fan I am carefully critical about adaptations of her works. The screenplay is as good as one of her better novels; it makes a seamless transition from book to screen, eliminating some subplots and more minor characters (e.g. the Allertons) in order to achieve a flowing and 'easy to understand' plot with no holes. The choice of Peter Ustinov as Poirot was inspired. His Poirot is distinctly recognisable as that from the books but the talent and ability of Ustinov shines through. Albert Finney would not have been as good in this film.The supporting cast is brilliant. Each gives a performance that makes you wish they were on screen for longer; Angela Lansbury as a drunken novelist, Mia Farrow as a cold calculating murderer, etc.. One of the best is the young Simon MacCorkindale, for whom this was his breakthrough film (he is currently Consultant Harry Harper in BBC One's Casualty, for UK readers), as the man torn between love and then led to murder. Also David Niven gives an especially strong performance as Colonel Race.All in all; it is, in typical Christie fashion, a satire on the lives of the upper class that is buoyant with snippets of humour and romance as well as the inevitable murder (or rather four and a suicide). The score is very good too and the movie has a good old straight backed stiff upper lip feeling to it that makes it a pleasure to watch and makes one wish they could be there themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Adaption!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film when it was broadcast on channel four last Christmas and I was so blown away by it that I had to buy the movie on DVD. Coming from a true fan of murder mystery TV shows with my all-time favourite series being Midsomer Murders, I can tell you this has to be one of the best detective dramas ever to be adapted from one of Agatha Christie's novels. Peter Ustinov gives a wonderful performance as Christie's world famous Belgian detective Hercule Poirot, who along with his sidekick has to solve three violent shootings on a luxury cruise ship sailing off the coast of Egypt. The story is full of red herrings, great and really well acted characters and lots of fantastic humour. It is also very gripping with a crime that is forever tricky to work out and a truly unpredictable killer gives the film a perfect ending. I would suggest to all fans of classic British Murder Myestries to see this 1970's Agatha Christie tale but you will have to be prepared to be blown away by it. I overall give Death on the Nile 8/10 stars.ONE OF THE BEST DETECTIVE STORIES EVER WRITTEN!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Ustinov is an absolute joy to behold in the role of Hercule Poirot. He played Poirot in three theatrical films: Death On the Nile, Evil Under the Sun, and Appointment With Death. He also played Poirot in three TV movies: Thirteen At Dinner, Murder in Three Acts, and Dead Man's Folly. It's always a delight to spend time with Ustinov's Poirot. He's so much fun! The three Poirot TV movies starring Ustinov are now available in a three DVD set. I've had a great time watching these with friends and family and all of Ustinov's Poirot movies are worth watching and re-watching. My deep affection for Ustinov's Poirot grows with each viewing. He's brilliant and each of his Poirot movies are fantastic fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remains A Lively And Delicious Favourite Treat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The screen version of Agatha Christie's Death On The Nile would be one of the definitive adaptions of the very old fashioned(but still strangely popular) murder mystery genre. After twenty-seven years the movie holds up very well.The most was made of the Egyption setting of the film as it was filmed mostly on location and the stunning ancient sites of Egypt are filmed beautifully. Tourism in Egypt apparently increased significanlty after the film's release. Not surprising.Also making the film a treat is the wonderful cast. Peter Ustinov stepped into the role of Hercule Poirot for the first time and despite no resemblance to Christie's descriptions of Poirot, made the role his own for the next decade. Ustinov gives a stern but comic portrayal of Poirot which is balanced with the casting of Ustinov's close friend David Niven as Colonal Race, Poirot's sidekick.Heading the feast of suspects is the legendary Bette Davis as a grand dame with a sour Maggie Smith as her paid nurse/companion. There bickering scenes together are a hilarious highlight of the movie. Angela Lansbury is also a scene stealer as a tipsy, uninhibited novelist who does a hilarious tango with David Niven. Mia Farrow delivers a very good dramatic performance, as the women scorned which almost steers away from the usual cardboard stereotype characterisations of Agatha Christie.Director John Guillerman let his great cast have fun with their characters partly because veteran thriller writer Anthony Shaffer wrote the screenplay. Although the murder mystery is a clever one and played out very well Shaffer injected the script with more wit and spice than the original novel had. (The Bette Davis and Maggie Smith scenes being the best example) The soundtrack of the film is an underrated gem with veteran composer Nino Rota producing a grand, sumptuous, inviting and mysterious soundtrack which perfectly complements the setting and the drama. Also his arrangement of the tango tune "Jealousy" is the best I've ever heard.All this makes for a fun, lively old fashioned treat of a film that can be returned to from time to time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, old-fashioned entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main virtue of "Death on the Nile" is Agatha Christie's unbeatable whodunit plot, which is arguably even more beautifully constructed than that of "Murder on the Orient Express." The latter had been adapted for the screen in 1974 by one of America's great filmmakers, Sidney Lumet.Like its predecessor, "Death on the Nile" was filmed with a fine all-star cast, in which Peter Ustinov, Bette Davis, Angela Lansbury, Maggie Smith, Mia Farrow, David Niven and Jack Warden stand out. Ustinov's Hercule Poirot is perhaps a bit less eccentric than Albert Finney's or David Suchet's, but I actually like all three interpretations.The film is as lavishly produced as "Orient Express." It has nice costumes and beautiful natural locations. John Guillermin isn't as strong a director as Lumet is. Consequently, the images in "Death on the Nile" are pretty, but less artistically interesting than those in the preceding film. Moreover, Guillermin's visual storytelling is a bit repetitive (he shows all the possible versions of the murder in detail, which tends to become a bit tedious after a while), and the first half could have been shortened a bit. Still, the direction is way above average, and Guillermin handles the action scenes and the solution in a convincing way.To me, "Murder on the Orient Express" is the most artistically satisfying Poirot film, but "Death on the Nile" is the most entertaining of the Poirot adaptations with Ustinov as the Belgian detective. "Evil Under the Sun" is also enjoyable, since its strong second half more than compensates for the overlong exposition. I'd give "Death on the Nile" a rating of *** out of ****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best film adaptations of an Agatha Christie novel that I have ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Agatha Christie's "DEATH ON THE NILE" is a wonderfully crafted suspenseful drama set aboard a river barge floating on the Nile against a beautiful backdrop of Egypt and its famous landmarks. Director John Guillermin adapts the novel for the big screen, successfully transferring most of the prime aspects contained in the book including both characters and scenery resulting in a breath-taking and highly entertaining film, and most definitely a highly-recommended follow-up to 1974's "MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS".Guillermin handles the huge cast with such ease, you can easily see the likeness in his earlier film "THE TOWERING INFERNO" in which he gracefully directed more than 15 major stars and their roles and made the audience care about each and every one of them. Here, Guillermin directs 13 stars of which include Bette Davis, Angela Lansbury, Maggie Smith, Peter Ustinov, David Niven, Mia Farrow, George Kennedy and Jon Finch.Surprisingly, "DEATH ON THE NILE" was only nominated for one Academy Award (ie. 'Best Costume Design') of which it won. I thought Angela Lansbury, Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith all played wonderful roles. Ustinov is Hercule Poirot, the infamous Belgian detective whose 'vacation' is ruined by senseless murders and it is up to him to figure out 'who done it'. Here, he is assisted by David Niven who plays a Private Eye hired by the lawyers of the initial murder victim, a wretched and wealthy American woman (played by Jane Birkin) who has stolen the fiancé of Mia Farrow and has brought herself a death wish by upsetting just about everyone she comes into contact with. On board this barge are a group of characters who all have it in for her, including - Angela Lansbury, a famous erotic novelist who is currently battling a defamation suit with her - Bette Davis, a con-artist on the prowl for her next scam, the victim's set of priceless pearls - Maggie Smith, Davis' ill-mannered servant whose father's career was ruined by the victim thus leading her to a life of servantry.When the victim's body is found with a bullet in her head, Poirot must step in to solve the mystery. Everyone is a suspect and all with good reason, but who really killed her and why? The outcome is fiendishly delicious and extremely gruesome, but you will revel in the delights of your favorite actors doing what they do best - entertaining you. Lansbury nails down her role as a batty old drunk who writes steamy novels. Davis turns in a highly camp performance as a miserable old wretch who has eyes only for the victim's jewels. Ustinov easily nailed down the performance of Poirot, taking the reins from Albert Finney as he fills his shoes to portray the detective audiences and readers across the world have come to love.Some funny scenes to look out for would include Angela Lansbury riding a donkey, Bette Davis scrambling behind an entourage holding a parasol and the countless clues that may help you solve the mystery if you don't already know who did it. Between the actors featured in "DEATH ON THE NILE" are 4 Academy Award winners and countless nominations. The most surprising thing that I found while watching the movie are the multiple death scenes featured in this 'supposed' PG-rated film. Three women get their heads blown off by a hand gun and another woman has her throat slashed with a scalpel. This film is probably not suitable for children, but most adults will enjoy this classic feature. In a year where movies such as "DAWN OF THE DEAD" and "THE SWARM" filled theater screens and drive-ins, "DEATH ON THE NILE" was the lone gem that outshone them all.My Rating - 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I most enjoyed this movie. I viewed it years ago, and found myself enjoying it all over again. I couldn't quite remember who did it, but during the 'gather all the suspects in one room please' scene, I suddenly remembered. Ustinov looks to be having the time of his life here, and being paired with David Niven, who wouldn't? The rest of the cast are mostly hit and miss, the hits are Bette Davis, Olivia Hussey, Simon Mccorkindale and Mia Farrow. The misses are the spectacular "what WERE they thinking?" miscasting of Jack Warden as a Swedish doctor ("Vaht, you accuse me?") Peter Finch as a communist sympathiser, and Angela Lansbury just chewing the scenery up as a booze swigging romance novelist. The who-dunit is actually presented in an entertaining (and surprisingly violent) way, and makes for an entertaining time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Death on the Nile takes the viewer on a genteel cruise aboard the paddle-steamer 'Karnak' as it, along with its motley collection of passengers, wends its way through the stunning scenery of historic Egypt. Unfortunately on this voyage the Nile proves to have disturbing currents, and a wealthy heiress with a propensity for making enemies is shot. Corpulent Belgian sleuth Hercule Poirot is on hand, and, as the body-count rises, must tax his legendary 'little grey cells' to the limit in order to expose the assassin in their midst. The charm of this film is that to most of the audience it will be foreign in both time and place. The Egyptian location provides a visual feast, with visits to the pyramids, the inscrutable sphinx, and the eerie wailing statue of Ramses II at Abu Simbel. Scenery like this makes it somewhat easier to forgive the movie its overlong running time of almost 2 ? hours. The story (originally penned by Agatha Christie) is set in the 1930s - the golden age of detective fiction - when murder investigations were much less clinical affairs than they are today. In an era before DNA sampling, Poirot uses the narratively more interesting approach of involving suspects in conversation, and reading between the lines. The cast is certainly star-studded, but unfortunately several of the characters tend towards stereotypes. However, there are some wonderful performances by several of the silver screen's grandes dames - Bette Davis, Maggie Smith, and particularly Angela Lansbury as the inebriated author of appallingly bad romance novels. Although a little slow initially, various techniques (such as dead silence being used as the ultimate suspense music) keep the viewer's interest piqued right through until Christie's trademark denouement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen every single Agatha Christie adaptation, of course, but I know that "Murder on the Orient Express" is considered by most fans to be the best of them all. I believe that "Death on the Nile" in a vastly superior film, for the following reasons:1) Ustinov is a much better Poirot than the cold and dislikable Albert Finney. Ustinov combines intelligence and sweetness in the role, and the scenes where he displays Poirot's vanity ("I leave luck to others!") are hilarious.2) The logic in this movie is flawless and everything is CLEARLY explained, while in "Murder in the Orient Express" Poirot reached many ARBITRARY conclusions. You won't guess either ending, but it takes a brilliant person (like Poirot) to guess the ending here, while it takes a magician to guess the ending there.3) "Murder on the Orient Express" is somewhat claustrophobic, while "Death on the Nile" contains many more scenes filmed in beautiful natural locations. Visually, it's a much more pleasing film."Death on the Nile" has only one serious flaw: its overlength. But it's still an unpredictable, highly enjoyable film, and the scene where Poirot reveals everything is so perfectly done that you'll want to watch it again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A magnificent cast, opulent settings, a genuine ambiance - simply a MASTERPIECE!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Agatha Christie's world famous fictional sleuth Hercule Poirot, the eccentric Belgian with the distinguished mustache and the brilliant 'little grey cells', had been brought to the screen again at last after many years in 1974 with "Murder on the Orient Express" starring Albert Finney, it took the producers four more years to 'dare' trying their hand at another one of Christie's most famous novels; anyway, it had to become an oeuvre able to compete with the previous film, which had been celebrated from the day of its release as one of the GREATEST movie masterpieces of all times - and yet, they DID manage! The atmosphere of the 30s here is recreated in just the same careful way, with magnificent settings (most of them ACTUALLY genuine, since many scenes were shot on location: the Cataract Hotel in Alexandria, the Pyramids and temples of Ancient Egypt, even the original S.S. Karnak) and most beautifully designed costumes (for which Anthony Powell was awarded an Oscar), the plot, with a few little changes, is kept VERY close to the novel - and the cast, of course, quite equals that of "Murder on the Orient Express": the 'creme de la creme' of Hollywood's past and present superstars give the picture a touch of GREAT glamor. Bette Davis, Angela Lansbury, Mia Farrow, Maggie Smith, David Niven, Olivia Hussey - and, of course, Peter Ustinov in the role of Hercule Poirot!Now, inevitably we're being tempted to compare Albert Finney and Peter Ustinov and ask ourselves: who was the 'better' Poirot? From his appearance, Finney matched Agatha Christie's description more, and his behavior and movements also made us feel that the fictional Poirot had actually come 'alive'. But, on the other hand, Peter Ustinov undeniably spoke better French - and not only that: he actually managed to put his OWN stamp on the role of Hercule Poirot; and one that was so popular with the audience that he'd play the master detective five more times, both on the screen and on TV! In fact, for many people he really became 'identified' with Poirot - thanks to his continental charm, his unique humor, and of course his enormous range of facial expressions and tones of voice.And so, with all these ingredients, this big scale production turned out not only an immediate box office hit, acclaimed and highly praised by the critics and beloved by the audience - but in the course of more than 35 years, has become a REAL modern classic, a sort of 'cult movie' for both Agatha Christie and Peter Ustinov fans; and a wonderfully suspenseful and at the same time entertaining movie to simply watch over and over again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Top Notch Bunch Of Pros</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Cardiff was the director of photography, Anthony Powell, the costume designer, Nino Rota composed the score, Anthony Shaffer signed the screenplay and the list goes on and on and I haven't even mention the cast yet. Agatha Christie's novels have a structure that is a sort of cardinal rule. Murders, a set of suspects, all of them with a motive for the killing and then the unmasking of the killer or killers. Anthony Shaffer, the author of "Sleuth" milks it for all its worth. Snippets of wit trying not to obstruct the implausible plot. Tough gig. Dressed in a fantastic Nino Rota score, Jack Cardiff does his marvelous thing and Anthony Powell envelopes the stars in costumes that are not only stunning but character revealing in the most entertaining way. Peter Ustinov's Poirot is great fun and the cast moves through the carefully plotted story with disarming precision. Mia Farrow is the only one who plays it for real. Her jealousy is so believable that in a way we're guided by her pain and dismiss the obvious. Bette Davis does a Bette Davis impersonation for our benefit, I guess, and she gets away with it. Maggie Smith, Davis's long suffering lady in waiting, is always fun to watch and I imagine she had a lot of fun herself pushing around Bette Davis. My favorite? Angela Lansbury's Salome Ottobourne. Her alcoholic pulp fiction writer is a complex, compassionate, realistic caricature. David Niven,Jack Warden, Jon Finch, Olivia Houssey, Lois Chiles, Jane Birkin etc complete the who's who of this whodunit. I haven't mention the director: John Guillermin, from "The Towering Inferno" fame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**Please excuse me for some possible spelling mistakes** I don't know much about Agatha Christie (more than she's a famous writer) but I can say one thing. ''Death on the Nile'' is really great! I love this kind of ''Cluedo-movies'' where there is a suspense over the scene and everybody is a suspect. Sure, there are many more that will go to ''Scream'' for this kind of thing, at least teenagers, but I can say with a very clean concious that this is a really good movie with class. **** (of 5)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This show is so much fun to watch. It is a wonderful story and the conclusion is just perfect.We bought the video a few years back and have watched it several times. Many of our friends who never saw it before have really enjoyed it.Everything is just right about it - the acting is superb, the look is just right. The music is elegant and the costumes certainly deserved the Oscar it received.Regarding the murderer, it is impossible to REALLY know who it may be. Everyone COULD HAVE done it as and all had a motive.When I first watched it, I thought that maybe Mia Farrow was the daughter of Maggie Smith (maybe because of the red hair) and somehow conspired. Then I thought maybe Angela Lansbury was only pretending to be drunk. They're are many possibilities.We both like this show a lot and highly recommend it.gord &amp; lisa</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS. Another one of those somewhat claustrophobic Agatha Christie suspensers but a very well-done example of same. Wouldn't we all like to take a trip down the Nile on a paddle-wheeler? (The Egyptian kids run alongside on the river bank, waving and shouting at the boat, making Bette Davis smile -- until they pull down their pants and moon her.)She's quite good, Bette Davis. So is everyone else. They seem to fit into their parts almost as well as the characters in "The Maltese Falcon." Lois Childes isn't much of an actress, true. She has an accent that is straight out of the San Fernando Valley. ("I don't like being compared to a ba-bewn." That last vowel, if it were in German, would demand an umlaut.) But she is positively juicy looking. What a sinuous back! The usual unsavory or suspicious characters are aboard, all of them done very well. The best, perhaps, is Angela Lansbury. She is absolutely outstanding as a sex-crazed novelist, caressing the stone rams along the road, lauding "their ruttish nature." Her wardrobe deserves some kind of prize for its outrageousness -- she wears fuzzy turbans, her eyes are circled with black like a lemur's, and she wears what appears to be a long ton of beads which droop in festoons down to her belly button. And her acting is priceless. Half drunk all the time and all drunk half the time, she bats those awning-sized eyelashes, rolls her eyes at the overhead, practically swoons with self-love, and is utterly magnetic. She comes on like a woman out of Aubrey Beardsley, a treat to watch and to listen to. Everyone else seems human by comparison.The mystery makes sense. The plot is easy to follow. The characters are supposed to be quirky -- and they are. Excellent use is made of locations, mainly the ruins at Luxor, south of Cairo. There is a stunning scene of Childs and her husband racing across the desert on two Arabian horses that can't be beaten, not even by Ben Johnson in a Ford western. Nino Rota has written one of those orchestral scores called "epic," and for this scene he slyly quotes from Wagner's "Ride of the Valkyries." The film has no ambition to be anything other than what it is, Gott sei dank. Watch it if you have the chance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Death on the Nile", based on Agatha Christie's best-selling novel, is the best mystery movie ever made. Mystery buffs probably rank "Murder on the Orient Express" as the best. I liked "Murder on the Orient Express", but I like "Death on the Nile" better. I was into this movie right from the start. I never got bored watching this. I found it entertaining from start to finish. A spectacular all-star cast came together for this intriguing film about a murder on a steamer boat while traveling down the longest river in the world, the Nile. Peter Ustinov takes over the role of Hercule Poirot that was played by Albert Finney in "Orient Express", and does a great job of portraying the famous Belgian slueth. Ustinov gets terrific support from a cast of well-known stars. The best performance in the movie is turned in by the great Angela Lansbury as Salome Otterbourne, an alcoholic romance novelist caught up in the dangerous adventure. I think she should have gotten an Oscar nomination for her work here. Who knew that six years later Lansbury would get her turn at sloving crimes on TV's "Murder She Wrote". (It should be noted that in between "Death on the Nile" and "Murder She Wrote", Lansbury portrayed Agatha Christie's other famed detective, Miss Marple, in 1980's "The Mirror Crack'd".) In addition to Lansbury, there's the great Bette Davis as the jewelry obsessed Mrs. Van Schyler; Maggie Smith as Davis' employer Miss Bowers; David Niven as Colonel Race, an officer who helps Poirot in the murder investigation; George Kennedy as Andrew Pennington, an American traveling in Africa; Jack Warden as the doctor on board the ship; Olivia Hussey as Lansbury's daughter Rosalie; and Mia Farrow as Jacqueline De Bellifort, a woman caught in an unusual love triangle. When the murder occurs, I kept trying to guess who did it, and the outcome surprised me completely. "Death on the Nile", directed by John Guillermin of "The Towering Inferno" and "King Kong" (1976 remake), is a classy production. The cinematography and art direction are fabulous, as well as the Oscar-winning costumes. Of all the movies that have been made based on Agatha Christie novels (both theatrical and TV), "Death on the Nile" is easily the best.**** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Ustinov portrays Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot, traveling on board a steamer ship down the Nile on an interrupted vacation via the murder of a socialite who has offended the entire world it seems, and has been deemed a "leach on the edges of society," to quote one of the characters in the movie.Assisted by David Niven, he must sleuth out the instigator of this interruption before all the ship's passengers end up dead. One by one, they are being knocked off to cover the evidences of the original murder.Fine performances by all involved, but hats off to Mia Farrow! Possibly the most brilliant performance of her career. Stunning. Absolutely stunning.An all-star cast delivers an all-star performance in this top row production. The scenes were deliberate and well planned, the scripting was marvelous, the dialog was funny where it should be and intense where intended, the costuming was marvelously period, and the direction was without peer.But it was the scenery, the settings, the sets and the props that made me love this film. Set in Egypt of the 70's, you can see the Sphinx before it was blasted by 30 more years of sand, bombs and fighting. You get to climb to the top of the pyramid of Khufu in Giza, see the Karnak Temple in Luxor, the Dendara Temple is featured in the background shots of several scenes. You are shown parts of the Philae Temple (temple of Isis), and the Abu Simbel near Aswan (built by Ramses the Great to celebrate his victories and his beloved wife, Nefetari. Lovely images of the Nile, its people and the surrounding areas. Ustinov being one of my favorite Poirot's over the years, I rank this movie at least equal with the Murder On The Orient Express, though I think more money and time were wrongly dedicated to MotOE. Had Ustinov portrayed Poirot in MotOE, it would have been my favorite.There isn't a moment of wasted film in this movie. Every scene gives you some insight into these well-developed characters. Watch for the scene where Bette Davis is "mooned" by the local children! The scene towards the very beginning of the movie, between Maggie Smith and her "Lady," is hilarious. Absolutely side stitching, if you can appreciate the dry, British sense of humor.Top row movie, with top row casting, direction, screenplay and SCENERY. Take an Egyptian vacation in your living room. This masterpiece gets a solid 10/10 (a rarity) from...the Fiend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well Made Agatha Christie Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Death on the Nile" is a most entertaining crime and mystery story based on one of Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot novels in her classic "who did it?" style. But besides the plot this movie was filmed in beautiful and real Egyptian locations that make a great and unusual atmosphere all around. As usual in the "Queen of Mystery"'s plots some events occur too coincidentally perfect so that impossible situations and alibis become possible for the story's sake, but this was Miss Christie's trade mark and no doubt that she had a great imagination and skill to make most interesting and "catching" plots in the genre.Though Peter Ustinov doesn't fit physically with Chrisitie's description of her Belgium talented detective (a sort little insignificant man, bald and with an egg shaped head), Peter Ustinov has managed to be identified with the character with his classy and skillful acting. The usual star's cast playing the suspects that distract our attention in this one has the always reliable David Niven, the great Bette Davis, Mia Farrow, George Kennedy, Jane Birkin, Jack Warden, Jon Finch, Olivia Hussey and a magnificent Angela Lansbury (as usual). Lois Chiles is the spoiled rich heiress that is murdered under strange circumstances (she looks for it all the time).In my opinion and along with "Evil Under the Sun" this film stands among the best in Miss Chrsitie's novels movie versions. Don't miss it if you like the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Christie Adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had read DEATH ON THE NILE (probably Christie's best novel, superior to the overrated MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS) before I saw the movie, so I was sure there would be no real suspense. But, to the everlasting credit of everyone involved, the movie does manage to hold the book's air of mystery throughout. It's not as faithful to the book as it could have been--a whole major subplot is given just a few small scenes; several characters who were more substantial in the book are reduced to barely more than window dressing--but it is remarkably true to the main story, sticks to it nicely, and allows both Poirot and the viewer to come to such a completely logical conclusion about the murder that you will wonder on repeat viewings how you could have possibly missed the clues the first time.The real gems in this film are not the leads and big names, but the smaller parts--Simon MacCorkindale as Doyle, Lois Chiles as Linnet, Jane Birkin as Louise. In particular, Simon MacCorkindale (more familiar to American audiences from MANIMAL, FALCON CREST, and COUNTERSTRIKE) is a criminally underused actor, and he does a spectacular job here in this, his first movie role, playing the hopeless and hapless Simon Doyle, caught between two captivating women (Lois Chiles and Mia Farrow--wow, what a choice to have) and ultimately driven by greed as he chooses between them.This film is finally out in DVD, and widescreen at that, so if you like good murder mysteries and old-fashioned costume dramas, pick yourself up a copy and prepare to be entertained.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not taking into account the TV series of BBC and ITV I would class this as the best of the movies with Christie's name on.A beautiful lavish film, which boasts sublime direction, a wonderful cast, a gorgeous accompanying score, and the perfect mix of story and drama. The scenery is fabulous, the whole movie is a true feast for the eyes, the Pyramids, the Nile, even the costumes. It comes as no surprise the movie won an Oscar for costume design, they were spot on.The casting is impeccable, it is a flawless mix of people, Lois Chiles is incredibly beautiful, so believable. My favourite role of Mia Farrow's, I believe her all the way through. Simon MacCorkindale was perfect casting too, a great piece of casting with an enviable jawline. Too many wonderful performances to comment on them all, but Maggie Smith and Bette Davis win it for me, they made a sensational double act.I loved Ustinov's characterisation of Poirot, for me he beats Finney, whom I did admire but found a little on the theatrical side, there was something more natural about Ustinov, albeit he's not exactly how I visualise the famous Belgian sleuth. I mentioned in my review of Murder on the Orient Express that I felt Finney suited the flavour of that movie, and I'll say the same for Ustinov here, somehow it fits him perfectly.Often when I'm asked what my favourite movie of all time is I answer 'Death on the Nile,' it has so many incredibly good elements. It is a magnificent film, the story itself is one of my favourites. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Excellent Movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this and "Murder On The Orient Express" both, nearly back to back, and found this movie to be the superior one. Most critics have thought "Murder On The Orient Express is better, but it is not in the same class. "Death on The Nile" has great characters, which is what makes it not so ordinary. Angela Lansbury is the stand-out, and it is rather peculiar as to why the "Academy Awards" over-looked her for a Best Supporting Actress nod. Next in-line comes Mia Farrow, who turns in a unusual and shocking performance as an woman in love turned evil. Then not far behind (at all) comes Bette Davis. I found I was rather excited to see her on film in a not-so-drab role like she had been playing near the end of her career. She got to sort of sink her teeth into an actual good character (even if she wasn't seen in this film "enough")- playing a mysterious old woman who has an obsession for exotic jewels. The film's death sequences seemed greatly planned, and coordinated well with the story- one of which remains on Agatha Christy's best list. Check this movie out, you will be surprised at how good it really is and how its no where near as boring as other too-complex mystery movies (AKA: Murder On The Orient Express).</fullReview>

Note that several of them were to appear again, with Ustinov, Maggie Smith and Jane Birkin all appearing in the sequel "Evil Under the Sun" - giving strength to the theory that great actors give great films... The Egyptian locale is very well portrayed, as is shipboard life. John Dickson Carr was correct in calling this Christie's masterpiece (though "Cards on the Table", "Murder on the Orient Express", "Evil Under the Sun", and "Ten Little Indians" come close).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertainment On The Nile</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How could any mystery fan not enjoy this terrific whodunit, set in the early 1930s and mostly on a quaint steamer cruising down the Nile with a boatload full of suspects? "Death On The Nile" has eccentric characters, humorous dialogue, extravagant costumes, fantastic scenery, and a star-studded cast that includes some of the most talented actors Hollywood has ever produced.Naturally there's a murder on the boat, which is a closed space, implying that the murderer has to be someone on-board. Peter Ustinov makes the perfect Hercule Poirot, the Belgium sleuth who always manages to be at the right place at the right time, to put all the puzzle pieces together, and solve the case neat and tidy. He tells one suspect: "I, Hercule Poirot, have eyes which notice everything"; and I would add ... a brain that remembers everything.Probably the funniest suspect is the usually inebriated Salome Otterbourne (Angela Lansbury), romantic novelist: unobservant, galling, and a hoot when she dances the tango with an embarrassed Colonial Race (David Niven). But throughout, Mrs. Otterbourne can't quite remember Poirot's name, and thus refers to him as the "famous French sleuth", Monsieur Porridge. Wonderful.The script contains witty put-downs, as in one scene wherein Mrs. Van Schuyler (Bette Davis), always disgusted with her sickly-looking maid Miss Bowers (Maggie Smith), introduces her maid to another character: "My companion Bowers; she once did 15 rounds with Jack Dempsey; he was never the same man again".The plot is complex and intricate, and requires Poirot 23 minutes at the end to explain. It's totally contrived and not at all realistic, but who cares ... it's the puzzle that counts. The genius of Agatha Christie is that she wrote animated algebra. Each story is a puzzle that contains a basic, underlying logical equation that lies hidden beneath an ocean of irrelevancies. And it's up to the reader, or in this case the viewer, to solve the equation.For sheer entertainment, "Death On The Nile" is hard to beat. It's one of my all-time favorite films. Production values are top-notch. The cast and acting are almost perfect. One would be hard-pressed to find more spectacular scenery. And that ponderous score by Nino Rota marvelously adds to the Egyptian visuals. The only negative is that because of its exceptionally high quality, the film makes today's Hollywood films look really bad in comparison.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Famous cast of suspects in murdered heiress whodunit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I adore all the Agatha Christie novels, with Hercule Poirot as my favorite sleuth. This Hollywood production comes across as a highly entertaining and worthy adaptation of Christie's Death on the Nile. Peter Ustinov with his mustaches is wonderful as the renowned and meticulous Belgian detective, Poirot. He is assisted here in this investigation by his sidekick, Colonel Race, portrayed by classic actor and gentleman, David Niven, who basically serves as Poirot's foil. The story typically deals with the 1930's British upper crust. The mystery revolves around the murder of an heiress, Linnet Ridgeway Doyle, who is honeymooning with husband, Simon, on a cruise along the Nile. Typically, there is no lack of probable suspects, all fellow cruisers and very questionable characters with a good reason for wanting the lovely Linnet dead...Mrs. Van Schuyler (Bette Davis)...a sharp tongued, elderly dowager who covets Linnet's jewels Miss Bowers (Maggie Smith)...her sullen but loyal nurse companion, who has been forced into a servant's life as a result of her father's career being ruined by LinnetLoise Bourget (Jane Birkin)...Linnet's French maid, angry with the murdered heiress for refusing to provide the dowry she had promised herSalome Otterbourne (Angela Lansbury)...a sex obsessed, drunken writer facing a lawsuit brought on by the heiress after Otterbourne uses Linnet in one of her erotic booksRosalie Otterbourne (Olivier Hussey)...Mrs. Otterbourne's daughter, who wants to protect her mother Andrew Pennington (George Kennedy)...an American embezzling from the Ridgeway family Simon Doyle (Simon MacCorkindale)...Linnet's husband and former fiancé to Jacqueline (see below)Jacqueline DeBellefort (Mia Farrow)...Simon's vengeful jilted fiancée, who is furious with her former friend, Linnet, for stealing him from her and follows the newlyweds along on their honeymoonThe famous stars all seem to be having great fun with their roles. There is lots of witty banter between Bette Davis and Maggie Smith here in their portrayals of mysterious wealthy dowager Mrs. Van Schuyler and her companion, Miss Bowers. Angela Lansbury wears outrageous outfits and puts in a brilliant performance as the tipsy, man hungry author. The beautiful raven haired Olivia Hussey became one of my favourites back in her Romeo and Juliet days.The unstoppable Poirot has lots of sleuthing to do, taxing his little grey cells, before the unraveling of this particular whodunit with all the various plot twists expected of Agatha Christie in her murder mysteries. This crime proved a complicated one at least for me to ferret out on my own. The Oscar winning period costumes are fabulous and the locale exotic, the Egyptian scenery magnificent with the pyramids, sphinx, and Nile River itself all serving as breathtaking backdrops. It's a wonderful suspenseful film, full of good old fashioned fun. With Agatha Christie and this stellar cast, you couldn't possibly go too far wrong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The old pros make it work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This comes as close to Greek tragedy as Agatha Christie gets. One of the chief requirements in a mystery is to make the victim deserve his or her fate. The first victim in this one--and I'm not going to tell you who it is, so there--has done some fairly dishonorable things, but the punishment doesn't fit the crime. One of the motives of the criminal, likewise, makes it difficult not to feel a little sympathy.The supporting performances make this one sing. Ustinov is adequate as Poirot, but Albert Finney will always be my favorite. However, watching Bette Davis, Maggie Smith, and most especially the divine Angela Lansbury chow down on some scenery is pure delight to watch. Jack Warden likewise has some funny bits as Doctor Bessner. David Niven, on the other hand, seems a bit too effeminate to be the hardy Colonel Race.If you've read any of my reviews before, you know that I can't help comparing films to books, despite the fact that they're two vastly different mediums. In this case, I have to take issue with the gutting of the book's list of suspects. Three female characters, for example, are condensed into two, and two male characters are combined into one. The characterizations are also not what they could be, but it's difficult to cram Christie-style characters into a two-hour movie, anyway. The solution, if you don't know it, is quite ingenious, and you can expect to kick yourself in retrospect for missing the cleverly-hidden clues.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1978, the nominees for Best Supporting Actress were: Maggie Smith in "California Suite" (winner), Dyan Cannon in "Heaven Can Wait," Penelope Milford in "Coming Home," Maureen Stapleton in "Interiors," and Meryl Streep in "The Deer Hunter." I agree that Maggie was wonderful, of course, but Angela Lansbury deserved a nomination in this category as well, in truth, the win.Perhaps, the reason Jack Warden wasn't nominated for "Nile" is that he was up for "Shampoo." But, John Hurt's performance in "Midnight Run" was not superior to David Niven's in "Nile."I never understood Jill Clayburgh's nod for Best Actress in "An Unmarried Woman" in 1978. That spot should have been taken by Mia Farrow in "Death on the Nile." To be honest, Peter Ustinov deserved to be nominated for his incredible perfomance as Hercule Periot. When you watch it, he doesn't miss a trick. Just look at his "set up" as he accuses Angela Lansbury of killing Lois Chiles. Just watch the screen! If they had to add one name to the list, it should have been his.In my opinion, "Death on the Nile" should have been up for best picture of the year. It was perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As an avid reader of Agatha Christie's books, I found 'Death on the Nile' to be the best possible adaptation of my favorite book into film. Some technical details differ, along with the absence of some characters in the book, but the movie was engaging, had great performances, especially by Peter Ustinov, Angela Lansbury, Mia Farrow, David Niven and Bette Davis. The filming locations are visually marvelous. The humor was endless, Ustinov really brought an 'elegant' humor to Poirot, and Angela Lansbury stole just about every scene she was in with her hilarious, drunk, over-the-top performance as the unlucky romance writer, Mrs. Otterbourne. The tension involving the love triangle between Jacqueline, Linnet and Simon was executed in a very fine and artistic way in this movie. The various uncomfortable encounters Linnet has with her fellow passengers were also very good, and widened the variety of the people who could have been guilty for her murder. Also, Poirot's explanation in the end was wonderfully written and acted, and the flashbacks were effective in showing us EXACTLY what happened, until it leads to the tragic ending of Jacqueline de Bellefort and Simon Doyle. I found some things in the film to be more realistic than the book; i.e Jackie cutting Louise's throat instead of attacking her with the knife and stabbing her, causing a commotion, and also their suicide where she shot Simon and herself in the head; easier than in the heart as written in the book. The continuous arguments between Bette Davis and Maggie Smith were also very funny. Might I add, it was a joy to watch Lois Chiles, who was definitely gorgeous. All in all, an excellent film with great writing and stellar performances from an overwhelmingly talented all-star cast, in a wonderful location.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't read any of the Agatha Christie novels, including the one on which this film is based, so I cannot comment on its effectiveness as an adaptation. As a film standing alone, I found it reasonably entertaining though I'll probably never see it again. I suppose I am not as enamored with the Poirot character as others. Still, during my viewing I found the ensemble cast of all-stars to be quite entertaining in the various roles. I especially liked the always entertaining Jack Warden as the Swedish doctor. Lois Chiles (Moonraker) was great just for being Lois Chiles The score, exotic locales and the Oscar winning costumes also contributed prominently in making Nile a worthwhile viewing experience. Good, 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**Please excuse me for some possible spelling mistakes**I don't know much about Agatha Christie (more than she's a famous writer) but I can say one thing. ''Death on the Nile'' is really great! I love this kind of ''Cluedo-movies'' where there is a suspense over the scene and everybody is a suspect. Sure, there are many more that will go to ''Scream'' for this kind of thing, at least teenagers, but I can say with a very clean concious that this is a really good movie with class.**** (of 5)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the three best films (as opposed to TV - David Suchet and Joan Hickson are the best portrayals of the sleuths imaginable) of Christie ever done - "Evil Under the Sun" and "Ten Little Indians" are also excellent. Ustinov's Poirot, Niven's Col. Race, and the rest of the cast, all perform magnificently. Note that several of them were to appear again, with Ustinov, Maggie Smith and Jane Birkin all appearing in the sequel "Evil Under the Sun" - giving strength to the theory that great actors give great films... The Egyptian locale is very well portrayed, as is shipboard life. John Dickson Carr was correct in calling this Christie's masterpiece (though "Cards on the Table", "Murder on the Orient Express", "Evil Under the Sun", and "Ten Little Indians" come close).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Death On the Nile" is an excellent murder mystery with a top notch cast. Because it was set in the past, it doesn't seem dated at all. Someone is murdered on a ferry down the Nile river, and all the guests have a motive. Clues are provided throughout, but you probably will never guess the ending. Peter Ustinov, Maggie Smith (subtly hilarious as usual), Angela Lansbury (in an inspired performance), Mia Farrow, Bette Davis, Jane Birkin and David Niven all deliver strong performances.

I won't give you a plot summary, but will say Angela Lansbury goes above and beyond, playing her role to the tilt. Bette Davis is her usual brilliant self. Peter Ustinov and David Niven have somewhat boring characters, but give excellent performances anyways. Mia Farrow, Maggie Smith, and Jack Warden are also good.

		<shortDescription>A Deadly Nile Tour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not quite sure why Albert Finney did not want to play Hercule Poirot again after the smash success of the all star Murder on the Orient Express. It certainly would have provided him with steady work and a well known fictional character to be identified with.Finney's decision was Peter Ustinov's gain and our good fortune. Even with two Academy Awards for two vastly different parts, I think most people remember Peter Ustinov as both the big and small screen Belgian sleuth. Given Poirot's eye for detail something Adrian Monk could envy and his stunning success rate one might think that if homicide were planned as it was very carefully in Death on the Nile, if Hercule Poirot is around, call off the plans and save them for another day. Of course if potential perpetrators did that, then Agatha Christie would run fresh out of story ideas.As he often does Poirot just happens to be on the seen when a very filthy rich American heiress, the Paris Hilton of the Thirties is shot and killed while on a honeymoon on a Nile cruise.There's sure no lack of suspects. Her family attorney George Kennedy is on the scene, a flamboyant mystery writer Angela Lansbury. an old dowager and her companion Bette Davis and Maggie Smith, an old flame of the groom Mia Farrow, and the groom himself Simon MacCorkindale.It's a clever plot actually involving some risk to the doer. But witnesses pop up and that's where things go awry. David Niven is on the scene as well. Poirot's normal Watson, Hastings is not accompanying him so Niven pinch hits. That's a bit of an inside joke because Peter Ustinov made his screen debut in David Niven's The Way Ahead and in the British army he was Niven's orderly back in the day.My favorite in the film however is Jack Warden who plays a quack German doctor who confesses treating a patient with armadillo urine. I'll bet it was one expensive armadillo.For fans of Agatha Christie's immortal Belgian sleuth everywhere.</fullReview>

She is simply breathtaking in this movie as she ranges from shy innocent to the final climatic scene where all is told.The scenes along the nile are beautiful to behold. It is too bad that Mia did not get a chance to do more movies of this caliber.Nivens plays a great role also.The snake scene is one of my favorites, especially the reaction of the manager of the boat they are on.The plotting is fast paced and you really don't have a clue who done it until the very ending. It is a complete surprise. As is usual in a Poroit mystery, all of the main characters, and even the non-main characters may be the guilty party, so you always have to watch for all the twists and turns.Cheers indeed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death comes to beautiful life on the Nile</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a follow up to the star-studded and highly successful "Murder on the Orient Express", producers put together this next adventure in the glamorous, but dangerous, life of Agatha Christie's famed sleuth Hercule Poirot. Played by Ustinov (as Albert Finney declined to participate in this film), he is on a trip to Egypt and in the company of wealthy (and selfish) heiress Chiles. She is on honeymoon, having recently stolen best friend Farrow's hunky boyfriend MacCorkindale and married him. Unfortunately, Farrow is in hot pursuit, turning up at every locale to make them suffer. Even more unfortunately, Chiles and MacCorkindale board a paddle steamer to travel the Nile and virtually every fellow passenger on the vessel would be pleased to see Chiles six feet under! Lansbury is a tipsy romance novelist presently being sued by Chiles for libel. Hussey is her protective daughter. Finch plays an anti-Capitalist who resents Chiles' ostentatious wealth. Davis is a cranky, jewel-loving widow who covets Chiles' pearls while her dour handmaid Smith blames Chiles' family for the ruination of her father. Birkin is Chiles' somewhat oppressed maid. Kennedy plays Chiles' crooked attorney and Warden is a doctor who hates Chiles for her damaging public criticism of his clinic. Naturally, the chances of all these people being together at once on the same boat is preposterous, but it's the hallmark of Christie's type of mystery. In any case, Chiles soon winds up dead, but Farrow, the one who wanted her destroyed more than any other, has an airtight alibi! Ustinov must delve into every detail of the matter and solve the case. He's hastened in his desire when another passenger turns up deceased. Then another! One's tolerance for films like this will depend on one's love of things like wondrous scenery, a palette of well-known cinematic faces and a head-scratching mystery. Some less-interested viewers may balk at the lengthy running time or the deliberate pacing (it's close to an hour before much of anything significant happens.) Standouts in the cast include Davis as a cantankerous biddy and Smith as her put-upon aide. Their bickering and sniping supplies much of the fun in the film and, of course, Davis has the hysterical shoreline greeting from the local Egyptian children. Lansbury gives an audacious, completely over-the-top performance which is nevertheless delightful. She never lets up on her flouncy, barely navigable character. Farrow is entertainingly nutso, popping up again and again, her snowy skin and red hair contrasting against the taupe settings. Ustinov and Niven also make an interesting pair as they work on solving the mystery. Chiles, who looks wonderful in her character's striking clothes and hats, is in way over her head acting-wise. Vocally, she lets the air out of some of her more caustic lines. The costumes in the film are magnificent. A gorgeous family of creams, greys, blacks, tans and golds are beautifully represented in the stellar cast. Mention must be made also of the music, a majestic theme rows the boat down the Nile, giving the film a lustrous quality from the beginning. The endless use of fantasy scenarios can be a little tiring (how many times does the viewer need to see the scuffle in the saloon?!), but first time viewers who are still trying to figure it all out shouldn't mind too much. It's a beautiful, star-filled, solidly-constructed film, the likes of which is no longer made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Agatha Christie Ensemble</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like Agatha Christie's mysteries to begin with. The two I enjoyed most were "Death On The Nile" and "Evil Under The Sun"-DOTN being the favorite of the two. I love how Christie has the sympathatic-however unhinged, and jealous Jackie turn out to be the brilliant mastermind behind it all. I also must say, the cast was great, although having read the trivia and seeing that at one time "Michael York" was to be in it, I must admit, I always thought it WAS York, so the guy who got cast did a hell of a job! I thought Angela Lansbury being the flamboyant, tawdry sex book author was a fine choice, her costume and her Norma Desmond behavior cracked me up to no end. Ditto the pairing of the sharp tongued Bette Davis' traveling rich old lady and Maggie Smith's dour, but for some reason loyal nurse companion. Poirot has his good old Colonel friend, who they conveniently have set up to never be a suspect, so Poirot has someone to work with. POirot's sadness on realizing who the real murderer was gave me the feeling of devastation that was to be conveyed. You could tell through out the whole movie that Poirot felt sorry for this abandoned, frail creature, only to discover that she was so cruel, violent and, as it turned out, as unhinged as to eliminate the opportunity to convict her and her lover by the murder/suicide-which caught me by surprise, I didn't see that one coming. Best ensemble cast, perfect balance of lesser known names with known ones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Oh! Never have I seen such a reptile in a first class cabin!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Growing up, I was a huge fan of Agatha Christie's books. I would read and reread everyone I could get my hands on. I remember being terribly excited when Death on the Nile was released in 1978. The movie quickly became a favorite of mine that I've watched literally hundreds of times over the years without ever growing tired of it. I still find new things to enjoy with each viewing. The movie has lost none of its entertainment value on me. For me, there are two areas where Death on the Nile really excels ? Christie's story and the acting.Death on the Nile follows the basic plot structure Christie used over and over ? a group of people is isolated on a boat, train, old house, island, etc. A murder soon follows that only one of these people could have committed. Everyone is a suspect. Each character has a motive and the opportunity to have committed the murder. Death on the Nile is one of the best examples of this plot structure that Christie wrote. Unlike other mysteries, Death on the Nile does not cheat. There are no characters introduced in the last minute and there are not vital clues that the detective discovers just before revealing the murderer. It's played straight. Everything that Christie's detective Poirot knows, the viewer also knows. It's just that most of us would never put the clues together in the same manner Poirot does.As for the acting, Death on the Nile features a wonderful cast. While my personal favorites are Maggie Smith, Angela Lansbury, and Bette Davis, everyone in the cast gives a terrific performance. It may be something as simple as the look Davis gives when some Egyptian children "moon" her from the shore or it may be something as elaborate as Lansbury's over-the-top portrayal of the over-sexed writer, each character is played to perfection. In short, the acting is first rate.Two complaints I've read across the internet involve the perceived padding of the script and characters that aren't well rounded. The padding argument usually concerns shot after shot of Egyptian locations without much happening. Maybe it's just me, but I enjoy the scenery. Plus, I am usually having such a good time with the film that I don't want any of it to rush by. As for the characters, while it is a valid argument, I understand that it's the way Christie wrote. Most of her characters were simply there to be suspects. The rest of their lives didn't matter. I must confess that I too would have liked to see a little more dimension and depth added to some of these fascinating people. It's my only complaint.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This whodunit deals with Hercules Poirot (Peter Ustinov) as the Belgian sleuth man in he case of killing a rich heiress (a ravishing Lois Chiles ) aboard a luxurious Nile cruise steamer . He investigates the travelers and numerous suspects , all the support cast (George Kennedy , Bette Davis , Angela Lansbury , Jane Birkin , Olivia Hussey , John Finch..) . Who is the killer? , can he find the guilty? . Hercules is helped by a personage likeness to Dr. Watson (David Niven) . After the clues have been shown we will get a chance to give the answer with Poirot finding out about the culprit at a twisted finale with outstanding surprises . Then are taken the murders from different viewpoints of everyone aboard which it makes a little bit boring , endless and overlong .The film is a detective story in which you are the detective . In the picture there is mystery , emotion , love , suspense and wonderful outdoors like are: the pyramids Keops , Kefren , Micerinos , sphinx Gyze , temples : Karnak , Luxor and the rout of river Nile in the cruise ship . This movie was made and released about 41 years after Agatha Christie's source novel of the same name was first published in 1937 . Nice acting by the great Peter Ustinov . Interpretation actors are first-rate , Peter Ustinov acting is similar to Albert Finney (Murder on the Orient Express). Ustinov starred various Hercules Poirot , this is first of six appearances playing Detective Poirot by him , these are the followings : Evil under the sun (Guy Hamilton), Appointment with Death (Michael Winner) and for TV with low budget as : Murder in three acts , Dead man's folly and Thirteen at dinner ; but the best considered is Death on the Nile . Though Ustinov made the character famous on the big and later small screen , he was actually the tenth actor to play Poirot in film &amp; TV . This was also Ustinov's only outing as Poirot during the 1970s, all other five appearances were made during the 1980s . The movie gets a lush costume design (Anthony Powell) and magnificent production designs . Colorful and glimmer cinematography by excellent cameraman Jack Cardiff (Black Narcissus , African Queen) . The location shoot in Egypt went for seven weeks of which four were spent on the steamer riverboat 'Karnak' and three filming in places such as Luxor , Cairo, Aswan and Abu Simbel . Sensitive and atmospheric music by Nino Rota (The Godfather) , he's Federico Fellini's usual musician . This film was well directed by John Guillermin . John was habitual of disaster films (The towering inferno , Skyjacked , King Kong , Kong lives) , adventures (Tarzan in India , Tarzan's greatest adventure , Sheena ) , Wartime (Bridge of Remangen , Guns at Batasi , I was Monty's double) and intrigue (Death on the Nile , Shaft in Africa , The whole truth) . The flick will appeal to suspense lovers and Agatha Christie-Poirot novels buffs .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Albert Finney was the most convincing Hercule Poirot. Maybe it's good that he played him only once but perfectly. Among those where Ustinov plays Poirot this was the best. They hardly changed the story of the original novel and presented it grandiosely in a really classic direction with famous, routined actors and actresses.Unfortunately, there are hardly any Christie films in cinema nowadays. That's a pity because, as shown in ?Death on the Nile`, productions based upon classical literature are a possibility to get many popular actors together in one film, even if they have to play minor roles. Peter Ustinov was also a good Poirot and is not too old to play the role again. The TV productions are never that good because there is not so much precision in them like in films for cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hercule Poirot (PETER USTINOV) is enjoying a holiday in Egypt. However, during a cruise along the Nile on a luxury paddle steamer, the beautiful American heiress Lynette Doyle (LOIS CHILES) is found shot through the head in her cabin. Aided by his old friend Colonel Race (DAVID NIVEN), Poirot finds himself investigating a list of suspects as long as your arm and practically all of the passengers had a reason for wishing Lynette dead. For instance, there is the alcoholic romantic novelist Salome Otterborne (ANGELA LANSBURY), whom the dead woman was planning to sue because she felt that one of the characters in her book closely resembled her. The rich Washington socialite Mrs Van Schuyler (BETTE DAVIS) was obsessed with the idea of stealing Lynette's priceless pearls and the latter's companion Miss Bowers (MAGGIE SMITH) also had a motive because Lynette's father ruined her family financially. The distraught Jacquelline De' Bellefort (MIA FARROW) also seems like a likely suspect because Lynette used to be her best friend before she married her lover Simon Doyle (SIMON MCCORKINDALE). However, she has a water tight alibi because on the night of the murder, she shot Simon in the leg with a pistol and as a result of shock, she had to be put under sedation. Also on board is Lynette's American lawyer Andrew Pennington (GEORGE KENNEDY) who was determined to gain power of attorney over Lynette's estate. Two more murders follow before Poirot is able to apprehend the murderer, which he does in his usual precise and methodical fashion assembling the guests in the saloon where he presents the passengers with an incredible but actual solution as to how the crimes were committed.DEATH ON THE NILE was first published in 1937 and nine years later in 1946, it was adapted as a stage play entitled MURDER ON THE NILE when it opened in London in March that year to a rather disappointing run. It fared even worse when it opened in New York under another title, HIDDEN HORIZON, in which it only ran for a fortnight before it was canceled. However, some thirty years later, EMI announced plans for another big budget, all-star Poirot film as the result of the success of MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS (1974) only this time Peter Ustinov was selected to play Poirot as Albert Finney's asking price was considered to high.DEATH ON THE NILE is first class entertainment and is easily the best of EMI's lavish Christie mysteries, in which none of the actors seem unsuited to play Christie's characters. A fine thirties period atmosphere was created by Jack Cardiff's marvelous location photography in Egypt, which nicely complemented Anthony Powell's Oscar winning costume design. John Guillermin's direction is first rate and the cast rises nicely to the occasion. David Niven is exceptionally fine as the suave and all British Colonel Race while Bette Davis is perfectly cast as Mrs Van Schuyler and Maggie Smith does well as her long suffering nurse Miss Bowers. George Kennedy is marvelous as the shifty American lawyer Andrew Pennington as is Angela Lansbury as Salome Otterborne. Lansbury would play Miss Marple in EMI's next Christie film, THE MIRROR CRACK'D (1980). Peter Ustinov makes a good Poirot even though his portrayal is his own and nothing like the character depicted in Christie's books. Ustinov would reprise his role as the Belgian sleuth five more times in EVIL UNDER THE SUN (1982), THIRTEEN AT DINNER (TV 1985), MURDER IN THREE ACTS (TV 1985), DEAD MAN'S FOLLY (TV 1986)and APPOINTMENT WITH DEATH (1988). Mention must also be made of IS Johar who is excellent in one of the supporting comedy relief roles as the manager of the boat.Remade in 2004 as part of David Suchet's long running and popular British TV series "Agatha Christie's Poirot" (review to follow).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best Agatha Christie movies I've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I began watching this movie, I expected it to be similar to "Murder on the Orient Express", since "Death on the Nile" followed that one. But I was plesantly surprised that "Death on the Nile" is far superior. Although it cannot compare to the book, it is a great mystery movie. Unlike "Orient", this movie shows the different characters enough so one can actually make an educated guess as to who the murderer will be. (By the way, I watched this movie with my mom, and she guessed exactly who the murderer would be and partly how they did it.) My only complaints are the lack of characters and certain plot lines, ie. Tim Allerton was turned into Jim Ferguson, and this character was not involved with replacing real jewelry with false ones. *slight spoiler ahead* Also, I was disappointed that it was never fully explained why that boulder fell and almost killed Linnet and Simon. Peter Ustinov's Poirot could not compare to David Suchet's, but Ustinov is far more "Poirot-ish" than Albert Finney was. I was disappointed though that in this movie, Poirot actually accused each person he questioned. Although it was good for the audience to see the different possibilities of what might have happened that night, the "real" Poirot would have never flat out accused people. I think it would have been better if he had voiced the possibilities to Colonel Race instead. Anyway, overall it is an excellent Agatha Christie movie. Definitely worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An heiress is murdered while honeymooning on a Nile cruise. Fortunately, the famous Belgian detective Hercule Poirot is holidaying on the same paddle steamer, and begins an investigation. However, it would seem that all of the other passengers on board have clear motives for committing the murder.This was the second of Agatha Christie's novels featuring Hercule Poirot to be filmed, after the success of 'Murder On The Orient Express' a few years earlier. The great Peter Ustinov, who so recently passed away, took on the role this time, and injected it with his own droll humour. Indeed the whole film seems rather tongue in cheek, with the all star cast having fun with their roles. Bette Davis, Maggie Smith and Jack Warden all enjoyably ham it up, but Angela Lansbury manages to outdo them all with a delightfully over the top performance as the perpetually drunk author of erotic novels. David Niven, ever the archetypal British gent, proves a good foil as Poirot's partner in the investigation.Where the film really scores is in the locations and photography. Egypt proves a stately backdrop to proceedings and veteran Cinematographer Jack Cardiff makes the most of it. The 1930's setting also gives an air of genteel opulence to the surroundings. While the film couldn't claim to be a classic tension filled mystery, it is a pleasant, laid back and enjoyable entertainment, that's clever enough to keep you guessing until the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Linnet, a rich heir, travels on the Nile with a bunch of people who, for various(well thought out and credible) reasons, might like to kill her - those with money and power have no shortage of enemies. One night, she is murdered, and everyone aboard is a suspect, with motive and opportunity. Luckily, Hercule Poirot is on the boat, and along with his partner the Colonel, he begins work on the difficult case. Could it be Mrs. Van Schuyler, whose eyes were drawn to the jewel necklace of the deceased? The idealistic Mr. Ferguson who resents those who have a fortune that they did not earn? Jacqueline whose fiancé was stolen by the victim? Maybe Miss Bowers, who, on account of the actions of the father of the late wealthy woman, never got to enjoy life as a lady? How about the German Dr. Bessner, who feared for his reputation from her complaints about his methods, and could not stand the lawsuit that was his alternative approach to solving the situation? I haven't read the original novel, nor anything else by Agatha Christie(although I would love to), and cannot draw any comparisons. This is a clever, taut mystery that has you guessing. I was rather surprised by the twist(which does not negate anything that has happened prior to it, and makes perfect sense with the rest of the movie), but at the same time, it definitely provides clues along the way, and there may be those who can figure it out. If one wishes to do so, they will have to watch this closely. The characters are memorable, distinct and well-written, and you have little if any trouble telling them apart(without them being exaggerated), in spite of there being about a dozen. This is due to both the carefully conceived script(every line of dialog is delicious) and the acting(albeit this can be over the top some of the time, particularly for Lansbury and Warden, who have a slight tendency to play their roles in this like stereotypes... this happens with the others, as well, though these two are the worst offenders, and it still isn't that big of a deal), and everyone is well-cast. Niven, MacCorkindale, Chiles and Farrow are among the best. Ustinov nails it as the famous detective. The humor is fitting in amount and tone. This is well-filmed, and makes great use of the gorgeous setting for its photography. It treats the culture with respect, if it can be a tad racist against the people. Whether this was due to the year it was produced, or it reflected the book that it adapted, however, it's not very prevalent at all. This has a genuine classic feel to it. There are instances of bloody violence and disturbing content in this. I recommend this to any and all fans of crime fiction. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The prize Ustinov Poirot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A haughty and thoroughly amiable Poirot screen adaptation, this is a classic bank holiday feature for which Peter Ustinov could have been assembled as custom. He heads up a wonderful cast of Hollywood greats present and past but has the presence of mind (and an Anthony Shaffer script to do justice to) not to turn the thing into some sort of variety show.The joy of the premise is that the film takes place on a boat: in the same shot director John Guillermin can include the most wonderful backdrops (and light) but keep the action maintained in a small, stage-like space on board the vessel. David Niven is the perfect foil for Ustinov - it's as if they're planning to pop off to their dining club after each days filming. There are no weak links in the support performances although I'd like to single out Mia Farrow as a particularly creepy individual lending a an exotic, brittle European quality to the procedure. Satisfying. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great one from Mrs. Christy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following Albert Finney's quirky and compelling performance as Agatha Christie's Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot, in 1974's Murder on the Orient Express, Peter Ustinov capably took over the role in this 1978 adaptation of Christie's river-bound whodunit. While on a pleasure cruise along the Nile with a taciturn companion (David Niven), Poirot slips into action following the murder of a much-despised heiress (Lois Chiles). There's no shortage of suspects... until, that is, they also start dying off, obfuscating the investigation by suggesting that several killers may be at work. With a disciplined screenplay by Anthony Shaffer, the film is solid enough (certainly better than its 1981 follow-up, Evil Under the Sun) and is graced immeasurably by a glittery cast including Bette Davis, Maggie Smith, Mia Farrow, Olivia Hussey, Jack Warden, and Angela Lansbury. Directed with customary efficiency by John Guillermin (King Kong, The Towering Inferno).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Succeeds well as a mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This whodunit, a sequel to "Murder on the Orient Express", succeeds well as a mystery, but not so well as a comedy, though it is a mystery first. My mother read the book and first saw this film in her native China when she was my age and she remembered it as "a bit scary"Even though most of us see David Suchet or even Albert Finney as practically Poirot himself, Sir Peter Ustinov looks like he's clearly having loads of fun with the role, even if he doesn't resemble Poirot himself physically. David Niven plays his role as Colonel Race with class and Mia Farrow almost steals the show(boat) as the seemingly jilted Jackie. Angela Lansbury's a bit underused as tipsy Salome (pronounced SAL-OM-AE) Otterbourne but a pure delight to watch nonetheless. George "Ed Hocken" Kennedy also has a supporting role as Andrew Pennington, which he plays okay. Some say Lois Chiles does not play her role well as Linnet Ridgeway, I do not totally agree with this, as the character is firm and careful in her dealings and a strong businesswoman. Chiles kinda reminds me of Christina Applegate in appearance and a bit of myself in personality, though I have more enthusiasm in my voice. Bette Davis is in top form as Ms. Van Schuyler and Maggie Smith matches up well as her nurse Miss Bowers. The on-location filming in Egypt works beautifully also.Recently I watched this with my mom, and she wasn't entirely wrong about the frightening parts. If you get scared by these parts, try what the people at Science World tell you to do at the Omnimax Theater when you get dizzy: shut your eyes, though you probably won't be too frightened if you watch "CSI" regularly. Overall, I give this great mystery a 7 outta 10, because a little bit more work could've been done on the comedy parts. I found Jackie's drunken liquor verses clever, by the way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Spot-On Adaptation and a Brilliant Stand-Alone Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Death on the Nile is a cunning, sharp, perfectly told, stunningly produced and superbly acted screen version of Dame Agatha Christie's whodunit. Like its predecessor, it's traditional formalized amusement with a full-size cast and opulent locales. The difference is that here, there is more than mere stylistic commemoration of a time, place and tradition. It's actually an intensely realized story on screen. Director John Guillermin maximizes the interesting settings and employs a cyclical flashback method to build likely disparities on how the crime happened. The reenactments in this movie are almost surprisingly unnerving and the cast is very compelling.Sleuth playwright Anthony Shaffer's adaptation doesn't have a single fallacy. When Ustinov finally exposes the culprit in the ultimate drawing room scenes it comes as an absolute revelation. Each of the dozen characters hovering down the Nile is a suspect. Every one on the ship could have and might have bumped off Lois Chiles, the condescending millionairess who has thieved her best friend's fiancée.Shaffer has also rendered several knowingly overstated characters to harmonize Peter Ustinov, the fourth actor to play Belgian consulting detective Hercule Poirot. There's Angela Lansbury's inebriated depiction of a romance novelist. Bette Davis as an oppressive and pompous Washington lace curtain and Maggie Smith as her resentful company. Jack Warden as a frantic Swiss doctor. I.S. Johar in a richly offbeat performance as the caretaker of the ship on which the homicides transpire. David Niven as Poirot's associate Colonel Race. Jon Finch as a Marxist radical. Nevertheless the star is Ustinov and the piercing wits of our stuck-up hero.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best Agatha Christie adaptations ever and the first to feature Peter Ustinov as Poirot. It looks fantastic and the period detail is great. Ustinov is quirky as Poirot and whilst he brings a mischievous touch of humour to the role he is also often very touching (his final words to Niven quoting Moliere - lovely). Humour is in great supply generally in this film. There is no doubting that the recent TV remake with David Suchet is more faithful to the source material but in comparison with this I found it deadly dull.It's hard to pick out individuals in a uniformly good cast but Bette Davies, Maggie Smith and Angela Lansbury shine in a largely comic fashion. Mia Farrow is also very good in a more serious role and I thought Lois Chiles was just perfect as Linnet. David Niven has a more thankless role as Colonel Race but does what he can with it.On the whole I found it quite fast moving and the time flies by. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the best of Peter Ustinov's films as Hercule Poirot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, too many of Agatha Christie's fine mystery novels have been disappointing when brought to the big screen. Poor old Hercule Poirot has been particularly unlucky in these cinematic adaptations. I am not a fan of Murder On The Orient Express, for instance, a film which wastes one of the greatest casts ever assembled and is undone by Albert Finney's hideously hammy leading performance. Neither am I massively keen on Evil Under The Sun and Appointment With Death, both of which find Peter Ustinov as the Belgian sleuth and both of which are, I think, lacklustre whodunits. Ustinov also portrayed Poirot in a number of made-for-television movies, none of which were much better than average (Dead Man's Folly was probably the best of those entries). The one Hercule Poirot film that I feel was well-made and worthy of a few viewings would have to be Death On The Nile. Extravagantly staged, confidently directed and (especially) cleverly scripted - by the great Anthony Shaffer - it is the best of the films to feature this famous literary detective.Rich bitch Linnet Ridgeway (Lois Chiles) and her lover Simon Doyle (Simon MacCorkindale) take a romantic cruise down the River Nile aboard the elegant paddle-boat SS Karnak. However, they are followed by Doyle's vengeful ex-fiancée Jacqueline De Bellefort (Mia Farrow), who is still devastated at losing her man to Linnet and has unpleasant intentions toward them both. Once aboard the ship, it becomes apparent that virtually all the passengers have reason to despise Linnet. Author Salome Otterbourne (Angela Lansbury) and her daughter Rosalie (Olivia Hussey) face a libel suit against her; family attorney Andrew Pennington (George Kennedy) has embezzled the Ridgeway millions and is afraid Linnet is close to finding out; old fossil Marie Van Schuyler (Bette Davis) desperately wants to own Linnet's priceless jewellery. Unsurprisingly, Linnet is murdered one night while sleeping in her cabin and another passenger - Belgian sleuth Hercule Poirot (peter Ustinov) - attempts to solve the killing.The performances of this remarkable cast vary in quality. Ustinov is excellent as Poirot; David Niven comes across very well as his stiff-upper-lipped friend; Lansbury is terrific as the hard-drinking authoress; Davis oozes wonderfully poisonous venom as the jewel-craving dinosaur; Farrow is superb as the scorned, jealous ex. But on the flip side, some of the performances miss the mark: I.S. Johar mugs embarrassingly as the ship's manager; Chiles shows not for the only time in her career that she is a pretty face but a bland actress as the victim; and poor old Jack Warden is absurd as a Scandinavian doctor. Other positive points include Nino Rota's memorable score and the glorious photography of veteran Jack Cardiff. Shaffer cleverly scripts the film to show Poirot interrogating each suspect, and "envisioning" how they MIGHT have committed the murder, before revealing to us the true culprit in an ingenious finale. The journey to the eventual solution may seem somewhat long (140 minutes to be precise), but on the whole this Nile cruise is in most aspects worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very intriguing, and scenic, whodunnit.Based on the Agatha Christie novel, our favourite Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot, is on a cruise up the Nile. He is surrounded by an interesting assortment of characters, including a wealthy heiress and her husband, on their honeymoon. It appears that everyone hates the heiress...Very interesting, mysterious and tense murder mystery. The backgrounds of the different characters, including potential motives, are explored well before the murder occurs. It is never obvious who the murderer is (at one stage I thought we might have another Murder on the Orient Express on our hands...). Great twist at the end.Great scenery and cinematography too. Shot on the Nile, with the characters also visiting pyramids and other ancient sites. Star-filled cast (as seems to be the custom for Poirot movies): Peter Ustinov (as Poirot), David Niven, Bette Davis, Mia Farrow, Angela Lansbury (who really should have been able to solve the mystery herself...), George Kennedy, Maggie Smith, Olivia Hussey, Jack Warden and Harry Andrews. Also includes Lois Chiles who I am surprised did not turn out to be a bigger star (if you see her in this movie, you'll understand...). Solid performances from all of them. Maggie Smith, as Miss Bowers, gets the funniest lines, though has limited screen time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Murder Off the Orient Express</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taking the role of Hercule Poirot (played by Albert Finney just four years earlier) and making it his own, Peter Ustinov is excellent in this Agatha Christie adaptation, capturing character's trademark indignation at being called French and fixation on his moustache while providing charisma too. The most striking aspect here is the story though. As with 'Murder on the Orient Express', Poirot is confounded by an enigmatic mystery as a much despised woman is murdered on a cruise. Again, everyone is a suspect with a motive and again it is up to Poirot to solve the murder as police intervention is impossible when travelling down the River Nile. The story admittedly does not have quite the same impact once one knows the solution. The comic relief (mostly from a wide-eyed I.S. Johar) also gets more on the nerves upon revision. In general though, the film stacks up well to revision since everything hinges on the character interactions and all concerned are in top form. There is a condescending Bette Davis whose nasty wit is only matched by her spiteful servant, played by Maggie Smith. There is also the always solid Jack Warden, here with a German accent, David Niven as dignified as ever and the list goes on. The revelation scene is also handled brilliantly. The camera never sits still as Poirot converses with the killer, unsteadily walking around the room in close-up and medium close-up, providing an air of uncertainty that sends a chill down the spine. And for a film set among such picturesque locales, 'Death on the Nile' offers a delightfully spine-tingling tale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite of the all star Christie vehicles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beginning in the 1970's with Murder in the Orient Express the all-star Agatha Christie film was born. These continued through the early 80's though with each film the quality of filmmaking seems to dwindle. I would love to see these make a comeback though. The second entry in the catalogue happens to be my favorite Death on the Nile. Featuring famous men such as David Niven, George Kennedy and as Hercule Poirot Peter Ustinov (who is my favorite Belgian detective.) It is the women of this cast worth seeing. Bette Davis, Maggie Smith, Angela Lansbury, and Mia Farrow; it doesn't get much better than this, and they are the reason to check this picture out. The mystery takes place onboard a cruise ship working its way down the Nile and in the process the viewer is given a beautiful tour of some of Egypt's great monuments. At 70 years old Bette Davis still commands the screen as a wealthy American who also loves beautiful jewels. As her companion Maggie Smith is fantastic as a woman who once had money but has fallen on hard times. Her contempt for her employer is not hidden, and the scenes between them are wonderful. Angela Lansbury does one of her great character roles her portraying Salome Otterbourne a writer banned in many libraries for her explicit sex scenes in her romance novels. She is being sued by one of the passengers on the cruise. Her character is loud, flirtatious, and drunk at all times. Her performance alone is worth watching this film; she is on at all times never missing a beat, even in the background. Mia Farrow has never been a personal favorite, but she is fantastic in this film as the thwarted lover who has gone a little crazy. She does it well. As for the story itself in typical Christie fashion more than one person dies, and the passengers all have plausible reasons for committing the crimes. To find out who done it you will have to see the movie.</fullReview>

This isn't the best of the ones I've seen - that would be the gloriously dark And Then There Were None - but it's still up there in terms of fun. Peter Ustinov is Poirot in this movie, with David Niven as the other half of somewhat comedic duo of investigators.

		<fullReview>Death on the Nile is a long and complicated book, and this does the book justice in my opinion, despite one or two misjudgements. I have seen all 6 of the Ustinov movies, and will say that the weakest is Appointment with Death. The film looks absolutely gorgeous, and the music score was just perfect. The script was excellent, and if you haven't read the book, you wouldn't have guessed the final solution in a million years. Peter Ustinov clearly enjoys himself as Hercule Poirot, sure he mayn't look like the Poirot in the book, but his performance more than compensates. People say that this film is too long and drags. At nearly 3 hours, I think the film needed to be long to capture the essence of the book, though I do agree that it drags in the middle. The supporting actors were in general very good, especially the delicious overplaying by Angela Lansbury and Maggie Smith. I also liked Mia Farrow as Jaqueline and Simon McCorkindale as Simon. Bette Davis was very good as Mrs Van Schuyler, David Niven was excellent in an otherwise thankless role, Olivia Hussey was lovely though underused and George Kennedy was good but has been better. In fact, the only actress I wasn't too keen on was Lois Chiles as Linnette. Linnette in the book is blond and bitchy, but Lois Chiles looked as though she had mousy hair and she didn't quite have the bitchiness of the character right. That said, this is a beautiful looking film, that is fairly faithful to the book. All in all, 8/10. Bethany Cox.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eavesdropping; level 1.000!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's nothing I enjoy more than spending a lazy Sunday afternoon watching an overlong and bombastic '70s movie with an all-star cast and a compelling but nevertheless simplistic plot! Disaster movies qualify perfectly for this, the Irwin Allen kind for example, but I learned that also the Agatha Christie adaptations provide terrific weekend entertainment. In terms of cast &amp; crew, this movie is like a dream come true. John Guillermin ("The Towering Inferno") directs a splendid ensemble cast including great names in the final years of their amazing careers (like Peter Ustinov, David Niven and Bette Davis), timeless and always reliable performers (like George Kennedy, Jack Warden and Angela Lansbury) as well as new and contemporary popular actors and actresses (like Mia Farrow, Lois Chiles, Olivia Hussey and Jane Birkin). With an awesome cast like that, I don't even mind if the script would be inferior, but still it's a more than adequate and absorbing ? albeit occasionally tedious ? interpretation of one of Christie's more commonly known murder mysteries. Largely taking place on a luxurious cruise ship on the Egyptian Nile during the 1930s, we follow the beautiful but slightly obnoxious young heiress Linnet Ridgeway on her honeymoon with the hunky Simon Doyle. The two newlyweds can't fully enjoy their holiday, since they're aggressively being stalked by Simon's ex-fiancée Jackie, and it's also becomes abundantly clear that pretty much every other passenger on the ship has a feud with Linnet and openly threatens to kill her. Luckily the brilliant Belgian detective Hercule Poirot is on board of the cruise as well, so when Linnet's body does get found, murdered with a bullet through her brains, he can provide some bright clarification in the complex murder investigation. What ensues is a delicious whodunit mystery with numerous culprit options (literally everyone in the cast is allowed to kill Linnet in turns when Poirot recites his hypothetical murder theories) and dazzlingly far-fetched deductions. Although it has to be said that Hercule Poirot's accusations are almost always based on passengers' conversations that he overheard previously during the journey. This man must have astonishing hearing skills and eavesdropping capacities, as he mostly was yards away from the conversations but somehow he still overheard them! As the mysterious puzzle slowly solves itself, a couple more bloody and sadistic murders are committed and the whole thing ends with a traditional and fascinating Hercule Poirot lecture in the salon. Fantastic stuff! The filming locations and scenery are breathtaking, the performances are all flawless ? although I personally prefer Albert Finney in the Poirot role rather than Peter Ustinov ? and Guillermin's direction is steady and highly professional. This particular Agatha Christie adaptation is perhaps not as unforgettable or mesmerizing as "Murder on the Orient Express" or the 1945 version of "And then there were none", but it's great entertainment and must-see material for fans of the author, the genre and nostalgic 70s cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All-star whodunit shot on location in Egypt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was Peter Ustinov's first appearance as Agatha Christie's Belgian sleuth Hercule Poirot. He had not at this point fully mastered the role, nor did the script and director give him the opportunities to embellish the character which would arise four years later, in his second appearance as Poirot, in EVIL UNDER THE SUN (1982, see my forthcoming review). Nevertheless, this is an entertaining and amusing film of a traditional Agatha Christie tale of a group of people all of whom are suspected of some grisly murders, in this case, travelling together on a Nile cruise boat. Jack Cardiff was the cinematographer, and he struggled against the intense sun to get the most out of the exotic locations. Since the action is set in the 1920s, the Nile cruise starts at Aswan, in order for the film to use the old Cataract Hotel there as its period backdrop. (Usually cruises start in the north and sail towards the south, but this one does the reverse, without any suggestion as to how the travellers got to Aswan from Cairo.) For those of us who are familiar with Egypt, it was hilarious to see the young couple at the centre of the story leave the Karnak temple near Luxor and quickly go 'nearby' to Abu Simbel, hundreds of miles to the south. From the dialogue, one gathers that Agatha Christie (who was, after all, married to an archaeologist and could not make such a mistake) had intended them to be visiting the statue of Memnon, but the producers clearly decided that, as the statue of Memnon is not in any great shape, a huge statue of Rameses II near Aswan would look better, and who would know the difference anyway. So that was a quick journey! The wonderful old Victorian paddle-wheel cruise boat is a splendid sight on the Nile. There is still one left of that vintage, and I wonder if it is the same one. The cast includes Bette Davis, who is made up to look much more ancient than she was, for she was only 70, and lived another 11 years and made 13 more films after this. Maggie Smith and Jane Birkin feature in the cast, and they both came back in the next film four years later, as different characters of course. Angela Lansbury play a gauche elderly woman, but 36 years later is still acting and in fact at the moment is playing the lead in a West End play in London. I wonder what Peter (whom my wife and I knew so well) and Miss Lansbury felt when they played numerous scenes together in this film, considering that at an earlier stage in their lives they had been brother and sister in law, a fact little known. Did I detect glints of extreme familiarity in the corners of their four eyes? Mia Farrow plays a hysterical young woman not unlike the woman Woody Allen has accused her of being in real life, and she over-acts shamelessly. But then, Agatha Christie mysteries are not meant to be taken seriously as drama or as thrillers, since they are designed purely for entertainment purposes. Lansbury also over-acts, as does I. S. Johar, the Indian actor pretending to be an Egyptian manager of the tour boat, although he is at least very funny, whereas the humour in Lansbury's performance in lost entirely in sweeping arms, raucous declarations, and trailing necklaces and other such 'appurtenances of the person'. Olivia Hussey as a pale maiden daughter of Lansbury does not have much of a part, and might have been anybody. George Kennedy is very convincing as the fraudulent trustee, but even he, solid old trooper that he is, cannot resist over-acting when he shows his indignation, his anger, and he self-defensiveness. In short, the director John Guillermin has exercised no visible restraint upon his actors and appears to have encouraged them to camp it up. The scenes shot in Karnak Temple, amidst its immense columns reaching to the sky, are most impressive, and are lingered over in a most welcome manner. It makes an excellent stage set for a murder attempt. Lois Chiles is very good as an arrogant and offensive young rich woman. She had made a good impression in Jack Clayton's version of THE GREAT GATSBY (1974) and was still in favour as an impressive ingénue. Despite playing a character with a great deal of venom and vehemence, she does not over-act in my opinion. But of the older players in the film, the only ones who do not succumb to the temptation of over-acting are Peter Ustinov and the remarkably subdued and restrained David Niven, who was already looking gaunt by this time. The other half of the central young couple, playing opposite Chiles, was Simon MacCorkingdale. A few years ago he died tragically young, long before his time. Despite all the flaws which I have enumerated, this is still a most entertaining and pleasant film to watch. After all, there is no point in attempting realism in a film of this kind, which is intended solely as a confection. Too much cream on a cream puff simply does not matter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're going to make a movie of "Death on the Nile," Agatha Christie's intricate and ultimately unconvincing jigsaw puzzle of a murder mystery, it helps to have a huge budget, access to magnificent Egyptian locations and a powerhouse all-star cast to hoist what is basically a routine whodunit to the level of top-drawer entertainment. Seeming to take inspiration from her earlier success, "Murder on the Orient Express," with its bevy of glamorous suspects chugging through Eastern Europe in first-class train compartments, she now assembles another cast of disparate characters barging down the Nile with scenic stops at the Great Pyramid, the Sphinx, Karnak and Abu Simbel, all of which are nicely integrated into the plot. (Today it would all be done with CGI.) In "Nile" the body count and number of perpetrators is not only higher, but much less believable. The story begins in a vast English country estate where we are introduced to a British heiress and her less well off friend (Lois Chiles and Mia Farrow, respectively). The heiress essentially steals the friend's handsome but poor fiancé (Simon McCorkindale). But because both Farrow and Chiles choose not to speak with British accents, we aren't sure if they are ladies of the manor or American expatriates with some nebulous reasons for inhabiting that choice chunk of real estate. Thus, unless you are already familiar with the story, your understanding of the situation at hand is already wobbly. After a while both ladies occasionally switch accents, and we think "Ah," they are indeed supposed to be British but they are just not trying very hard to sound that way. Now it all makes sense. But it does drain one's focus.The real fun begins when Mia follows the newlyweds on a steamship excursion down the Nile in order to ruin their honeymoon ? or so it seems. Upon embarkation we are introduced to the all-star cast, fellow passengers on the ship, many members of which by sheer Christie coincidence also happen have grudges against Chiles. We know what this is building up to, especially if we're already familiar with "Express." But Hercule Poirot (played here with workmanlike competence by Peter Ustinov) will straighten everything out in the end.Of the stellar actors, the ones who shine brightest are Bette Davis as a wealthy American smitten with jewelry who travels with a dour servant-companion (Maggie Smith) and Jack Warden as a thickly-accented German doctor. Angela Lansbury has the showiest (and most annoying) role as the overdressed, overbearing, loquacious and alcoholic author of purple prose pulp romances. Farrow's and Chiles's accent shifting aside, both of their performances are dramatically strong. Simon McCorkindale has a sturdy, compelling screen presence reminiscent of the young Alan Bates. Too bad his career petered out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So many riches in this Egyptian mystery, and none of them robbed from a pharaoh's tomb.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The role of Hercule Poirot is now being played by Peter Ustinov." If this were a daytime soap opera, that would be heard after the credits rolled to indicate the change from the Oscar Nominated Albert Finney from "Murder on the Orient Express" to this follow-up four years later. It is one of the few times where the replacement became better known for a role, mainly because Ustinov would continue to play this role on and off for the remainder of his career, with mixed results. However, the first few films are exceptional in this series, and the films in some ways is even better than "Orient Express". That can be contributed to the humor added into the mix, Ustinov certainly lighter-hearted than Finney was, making the film much more amusing and certainly a feast for the eyes.The Egyptian locations are exquisitely utilized here, following the set-up where spoiled heiress Lois Chiles steals the fiancée of her friend Mia Farrow and marrying him. Handsome Simon MacCorkindale is the lucky fellow who ends up in British high society in spite of being a pauper, while Farrow spits blood (mixed with alcohol) as she stalks the couple on their Nile honeymoon. Then, there's the mixture of zany characters aboard this pleasure boat with them. Bette Davis adds on all of her matronly gusto as the socialite who may or may not be a jewel thief; Maggie Smith is her bitchy, masculine groomed companion. Wearing a wacky wardrobe that would make a drag queen drool yet Mame Dennis blush, Angela Lansbury is a scream, doing a drunken tango with Niven that is unforgettable. Jack Warden (as a German doctor) and George Kennedy (as Chiles' scheming attorney uncle) are also in support. With all of these Oscar Winners in the film, is there room for anything more? Agatha Christie mysteries were not meant to be difficult to figure out, and here, the victim isn't a surprising one, and the ultimate revelation not shocking, either. But it is how Hercule Poirot deciphers everything and all of the clues and intimate details which are revealed slowly throughout the movie. Along with the excellent performances, costume design and outstanding photography, the movie also boasts an excellent music score, and it is not surprising that with all of this talent aboard, this was one of the biggest successes of 1978. While Ustinov made Poirot more of a buffoon in later films, he's at his best in his first excursion. My only qualm is the lack of a real dramatic scene between Davis, Smith and Lansbury. That would have been the fudge on top of this ice cream sundae.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Throws out the eerie classiness of "Orient Express", but it's much more fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Second in the all-star Agatha Christie mysteries brought to the screen (the first was 1974's "Murder On The Orient Express", with Albert Finney cast as detective Hercule Poirot). This one stars Peter Ustinov as Poirot, and he fits the part quite snugly. The murder victim is heiress Lois Chiles and the suspects--all with axes to grind--are together aboard a creaky vessel sailing the Nile. Film has a campy penchant for melodrama (not to mention an odd fetish for leaving its victims with gunshots to the head!), but the cast is pretty good and gives the proceedings a little lift. Ustinov is charming, as are dowager Bette Davis and lady-in-waiting Maggie Smith, fidgety Mia Farrow, and drunken wreck Angela Lansbury. George Kennedy is just around to take up space, and similarly David Niven and Olivia Hussey aren't given anything special to do, but the movie still rolls along at a brisk clip and is surprisingly engrossing and amusing. One questions remains: how exactly did the killer get that python in Poirot's bathroom? **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moderately enjoyable as a silly and funny Agatha Christie 'whodunnit' mystery.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Years ago, when I was a mere young man, I used to enjoy watching crime detective mystery 'whodunnit' movies and TV shows. Mostly TV shows. 'Murder She Wrote' was one of them. 'Columbo' was another. A common element, even though murder was always involved, the shows were written with a running background of humor. They were meant to be entertaining, first and last. Now, years later, I only find this sort of story mildly entertaining.This movie, 'Death on the Nile', is made in that same manner. Someone dies, everyone around her it seems has a potential motive for seeing her dead, and a master detective (Poirot) happens to be amongst them to sort things out. Then, when we the viewers become thoroughly confused at all the clues, the master detective points to the murderer and carefully explains how and why they did it. Nothing about the story approximates what might happen in real life, especially that all your enemies just happen to be on the same small cruise boat with you, on the Nile. Still, as light entertainment the movie is a success primarily for its actors, some of the best of that era.Peter Ustinov is masterful as detective Hercule Poirot . Pretty Lois Chiles, former 'Bond' girl and now professor at the University of Houston, is Linnet Ridgeway Doyle, rich and single and looking for a trophy husband. Mia Farrow is good as Jacqueline De Bellefort, who gets jilted by her fiancée to marry Linnet as the movie begins.SPOILERS FOLLOW. By the time the 2+ hour movie ends, a total of 5 people are dead. Poirot finally figures out that Jacqueline (Farrow) did it, in concert with Linnet's new husband, who had married her with the intention of having her killed to gain access to her fortune for himself and Jacqueline.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most the important thing to do , during the view of a movie is to asking the question of some sequences , those puzzle's pieces that seems to have the same meaning of the key to the truth. If a poor man marries a richer woman , who is finding dead after the first 30 minutes of the movie , the answer is always the same , even if he's heavily wounded. The difference between the common spectator and the connoisseur it's really in the knowledge of the plot devices . Leaving aside the fact that the author of the script is Agatha Christie herself , the movie is a detective story composed by the usual elements : red herring , twist , McGuffin , whodunit. to success in resolving a detective story like Poirot , it takes to watch the truth with a technical look , simply applying the theory to the practice , because truth lies on a silver plate . Just be careful to don't be caught in the trap!</fullReview>

In this case, the exotic location is obviously Egypt, and the all-star cast includes Peter Ustinov (as sleuth Hercule Poirot), Bette Davis, Maggie Smith, Angela Lansbury (hilarious), Mia Farrow and David Niven.Director John Guillermin isn't the most creative of souls, but he does manage a couple of striking scenes, most notably one set amidst the giant pillars of an Egyptian ruin.

		<shortDescription>Fun, classical Agatha Christie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following the success of 'Murder on the Orient Express', producers John Brabourne and Richard Goodwin continued the series of Agatha Christie adaptations with 'Death on the Nile'. In this one, detective Hercule Poirot is present on a Nile steamer when a murder occur: as often, almost everyone has a reason to have killed the rich honeymooner, so it's up to him to discover the truth.This is typical Agatha Christie, in every aspect. The many twists and turns, where we are never quite sure who did it; the logic-defying coincidences and overly-complicated resolution that is quite unbelievable, but in a fantastic way; an exotic setting and a nicely varied collection of characters, above all the Belgian Poirot.The movie is very well made, in multiple aspects. The all-star cast is a match for the 'Murder on the Orient Express' one, with special mentions to Peter Ustinov (who substitutes Albert Finney nicely enough), David Niven, Bette Davis and Maggie Smith, as well as a serious George Kennedy. Being shot on location, the scenario of Egypt and specially the Nile is beautiful, and the entire film has a terrific and lively visual quality.The film develops nicely, as expected from an Agatha Christie story. Quite a lot of humor, specially from Ustinov and Niven, which help create a light-hearted feel to the film; in some ways similar to 1972's 'Sleuth', another equally laid back mystery. The ending is also very good, though a bit far fetched (in regards to the 'how' of the murder, not the 'who').Although I find the film itself (technical aspects, acting, directing...) virtually excellent, my only complaints are in regard to the story itself. Some logic defying plot devices Agatha Christie always use (the aforementioned coincidences, everyone having a reason to be the murderer) as well as the overly intricate, unbelievable final solution (even if a viewer could guess the murderer right, it would be impossible to guess how he did it); they are part of Christie's charm, and one of the reasons her work is so highly-regarded, but at the same time it also gets a bit on my nerves. It kinda feels like cheating, to 'invite' the viewer to solve the mystery and then introduce variables at the very last minute that makes the challenge virtually unsolvable. It is a complaint I always had towards Christie's work, even if I do like it; it is also made fun of in an excellent detective-parody, 1976's 'Murder by Death'.Overall, a very good and entertaining film. Visually excellent, with a great cast to go along with the clever plot. It falls short, however, when compared to the superior 'Murder on the Orient Express', specially in the tension creating and attention-grabbing aspect mysteries must have, but is still great entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Recycles all the clichés of the cinema whodunit, but does so with great style and panache</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Linnet Ridgeway, a wealthy heiress, is a very stupid young woman indeed. Stupid enough to book a cruise on the Nile on board a steamer where just about every other passenger has good cause to hate her or to wish her dead. It will therefore come as no surprise when Linnet is discovered murdered in her cabin. The principal suspect is Jacqueline de Bellefort, Linnet's former close friend and now sworn enemy after Linnet lured away Jackie's fiancé, Simon, who became Linnet's husband. There is, however, no shortage of other suspects:-· Salome Otterbourne, a novelist against whom Linnet has brought a libel suit after recognising herself in one of Salome's characters (described as a "nymphomaniacal baboon"). · Salome's daughter Rosalie · A Swiss doctor whom Linnet has accused of being a quack · James Ferguson, a Communist who regards Linnet as a capitalist parasite · Mrs. van Schuyler, an elderly eccentric who covets Linnet's jewels. · Miss Bowers, Mrs van Schuyler's companion, whose once-wealthy family has been ruined by the dubious business practices of Linnet's father. · Linnet's put-upon maid Louise · Andrew Pennington, Linnet's lawyer who wants to hide the fact that he has been embezzling money from the Ridgeway family estate. The murderer, however, is also a very stupid person indeed. Stupid enough to commit a murder on a cruise where one of the other passengers is the great detective Hercule Poirot, a man who makes Scotland Yard, the FBI and the Sureté look like rank amateurs and one of the few detectives in history with a 100% success rate. I mean, committing a murder while Poirot is anywhere in the vicinity makes about as much sense as starting a fist-fight with the Incredible Hulk. (Poirot is Belgian, and there is a running joke in this and other films featuring the character about him becoming very indignant whenever he is mistakenly referred to as a Frenchman. Actually, I would have thought that the thing that would really annoy a Francophone Belgian would be for him to be referred to as a Fleming). Films based on Agatha Christie novels vary in quality. For example, "The Alphabet Murders" (another Poirot story) is absolutely dire, largely because it attempts to inject humour into a story which was not intended to be humorous, and fails completely, whereas "The Mirror Crack'd" is actually a pretty good film, being based upon one of Christie's more ingenious and less hackneyed plots. As for the Peter Ustinov Poirot series, of which Death on the Nile is one, I would put them in the category of "guilty pleasures". (Ustinov was to play Poirot six times, three times in feature films and three times in TV movies). Yes, the plots are not only formulaic but also implausible; Poirot possesses a near-supernatural ability to solve mysteries by means of deduction alone, without needing to go through all that tiresome police procedural business of interviewing witnesses, taking fingerprints, carrying out forensic tests, and so on. And yet on the positive side, the films are generally very well produced and acted, with a gallery of well-known stars. This one includes not only Ustinov but also the likes of Bette Davis, David Niven, George Kennedy, Mia Farrow, Maggie Smith (who was to reappear in the next Ustinov Poirot, "Evil Under the Sun") and Angela Lansbury, who two years later was to portray Christie's other great detective, Jane Marple, in "The Mirror Crack'd". Lois Chiles as Linnet shows that she was capable of more than just being a Bond girl. Contrary to what one reviewer writes, however, Peter Finch does not appear. It would be remarkable if he did- he had been dead for a year by the time the film was made. (I think that reviewer meant Jon Finch). The film is a costume drama set in the 1930s, and aims at a loving recreation of upper-class life during that decade, against some striking settings. It was filmed on location in Egypt and features several of that country's best-known sights, including the Great Pyramids, the Sphinx and the temples at Abu Simbel and Karnak, to the extent that it could double up as an advertisement for the Egyptian Tourism Board. It may recycle all the clichés of the cinema whodunit, but it does so with great style and panache. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well acted and interesting, but talk about a contrived plot!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Up front I should say that I am not an Agatha Christie fan. Now it isn't like I have anything against her--I just am not particularly a mystery fan--so keep this in mind when you read the review. Perhaps it's because of this that I found the plot so incredibly contrived. Think about it--there is a boat traveling down the Nile and a woman is murdered...and practically everyone on board hated this lady and would loved to have killed her! This isn't like "Murder on the Orient Express" where a huge group of people who hated a man deliberately conspired to ALL be there to murder someone. We are expected, instead, to believe that it was all just a coincidence that almost all the passengers EXCEPT Poirot hated this particular woman! This strains credibility WAAAY past the breaking point and even Charlie Chan never faced coincidences like this! Plus, while different, it's enough like "Murder on the Orient Express" to make you wonder why this plot was explored. I know that many Agatha Christie fans out there cannot accept that I am not 100% in awe of her story, but this isn't meant as just an insult--she was a great author--but the plot does have problems. And the problems, unfortunately, don't stop there. At one point, Angela Lansbury is about to tell everyone who the killer is--and is conveniently shot in the head at that exact moment! Doesn't this seem rather...once again...contrived? It's all a shame, actually, as the plot did NOT need to have so many people on board who wanted to kill her--the actual murder and how it was constructed was really interesting. Plus, the final scene with the murderers was fantastic!Despite these problems, though, the film is quite entertaining. The multi-star cast is very good and I liked Peter Ustinov as Poirot as he looked less like a wax dummy than how Albert Finney (though "Murder on the Orient Express" was still a better film). Likewise, it was nice to see old favorites like Bette Davis, David Niven, George Kennedy and Maggie Smith. My only reservation about the cast was the odd decision to cast Jack Warden as a German doctor!! Why didn't they pick someone who was German or at least could be more convincing in this role? Overall, very watchable...but I'd advise you first to see "Murder on the Orient Express".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of all the Agatha Christie novels and plays to come to the screen, this is indeed one of the better adaptations, second only perhaps to Sydney Lumet's riveting translation of "Murder on the Orient Express"."Death on the Nile" is one of Christie's most perplexing puzzles, as it provides us with a seemingly endless supply of suspects from which to choose a murderer. The great Belgian sleuth, Hercule Poirot, is travelling on vacation along the river Nile, when a rich, much despised heiress is murdered in her sleep. Anyone could have done it, and everyone had plenty of opportunity and motive. Who of this group is guilty? For the answer we turn to the fathoming power of the 'little gray cells'. If you can figure it out before Poirot, I congratulate you.Ustinov is a natural as the continental detective whose acumen and penchant for deduction are second to none the world over. Supporting cast is stellar, with a convincing Mia Farrow as jilted lover Jacqui, David Niven as an English lawyer, George Kennedy as "Uncle Andrew", the wonderful Bette Davis (a thoroughly enjoyable screen presence), Dame Maggie Smith as Davis' bitter handmaid Bowers, Angela Lansbury as wildly melodramatic novelist Mrs Ottobal, Olivia Hussey as her reserved daughter, Jack Warden as a German psychologist and also Jon Finch, Jane Birkin, Lois Chiles, I.S. Johar and Simon MacCorkindale as Simon, husband of the deceased.The only disappointment is Nino Rota's overly dramatic score. Otherwise production design, cinematography and editing are all sound, and Anthony Shaffer's screenplay does Christie's intriguing tale justice.Monday, June 9, 1997 - Video</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly Watchable Christie Adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Ustinov's first outing as Hercule Poirot in the second of the Brabourne/Goodwin series of Christie adaptations turns out to be highly entertaining. While there are some awkward moments and risible dialog - especially at the end - John Guillermin's film is redeemed by some memorable individual sequences. The interplay between Poirot and Colonel Race (David Niven) is keenly illuminated - at one point Race raises his eyebrows in exasperation as he hears the Belgian detective self-importantly describing himself as "the great Hercule Poirot." The Colonel has a rather bad time of it; earlier on in the film he is forced to dance a grotesque tango with Mrs. Salome Otterbourne (Angela Lansbury), where he desperately tries and fails to keep up with her. Poirot tries his best to be polite in the company of others, but his patience is stretched to the limit by Mrs. Otterbourne's relentless obsession with sex and sexuality. At the end of one evening he is saddled with the onerous responsibility of taking her back to her cabin, while desperately trying to stop her collapsing to the floor in a drunken stupor. Bette Davis and Maggie Smith have a fine time trading insults as an elderly American dilettante and her full-time "companion"; Davis has one especially rich line as she suggests that she should take Smith for a "cooling break" in the Gobi Desert. Jack Cardiff's memorable cinematography shows the breathtaking beauty of the Egyptian landscapes, but suggests at the same time that they can be sinister - especially in the sequence taking place at the Karnak Temple, in which Linnet Ridgeway (Lois Chiles) is quite literally placed in mortal danger. Nini Rota's memorable theme-tune gives the film a stately feel as the boat plows its inexorable progress down the Nile. Even after thirty-five years, DEATH ON THE NILE is still highly watchable as much for the quality of the performances as for Christie's convoluted tale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Padded script hampers an otherwise excellent production</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DEATH ON THE NILE has everything going for it: amazing cast. Excellent production values. Eye-catching costumes. Unforgettable score. Lush cinematography. Perfect scenery. Everything about it looks and feels like a million bucks. Unfortunately, the script is mostly terrible. There are so many padded moments in it that if you'd remove all those moments, the film would be 45 minutes long. Scenes of Poirot individually implicating everyone in the murder of Linnet with those fake flashbacks, in which we see every cast member killing poor Lois Chiles, got very annoying but more importantly, those scenes were totally useless and deceptive. It's so unlike Poirot.Also, the script/story is filled with too many improbabilities: everyone on the tiny boat knows Linnet and has a motive to kill her. I mean, come on. What are the chances of Linnet and her husband going on a boat trip on the Nile and it's completely filled with people she knows. Wouldn't that just appear bizarre to her before she even set foot on the boat? The script never addressed this highly improbable and contrived plot point. Another annoying weakness in the script is the fact that people are dying left and right on the boat and yet people rarely seem to be bothered with this. I know this is supposed to be a detective/mystery movie, in which murders are supposed to happen but frankly, there were more dead people on that boat than in "TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE". You'd think people would be a bit bothered by the gruesome events but no one is, certainly when the surviving cast leave the boat. Everyone is happy and in love.The last annoying point about the script is that it doesn't seem to know what to do with the truly amazing cast. DEATH ON THE NILE is a case of a film with a grade A+ cast working with a grade D script. For instance, Maggie Smith is totally wasted in a minor role. And when Poirot unravels the whole mystery at the end, the entire cast is totally useless and they just sit there like a bunch of mannequins, filling up the background in the set.But even with a mediocre script, the cast still shines and have fun with what little their characters have to do. Angela Lansbury has never been more over-the-top fun to watch. And like I've said, the rest of the movie (production, location, music, etc) is fantastic. I just wished the script was at the same level of quality as the rest of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did enjoy this film, however, Ustinov is no David Suchet who plays the wonderful Poirot on PBS. Where Suchet is meticulous, even foppish, and doesn't like to get dirty, Ustinov is judgmental, doesn't cut a fashionable figure, and just not at quirky. That's not to say he's bad, he isn't, but for a really wonderful characterization, watch Suchet. Also, Ustinov seems to have a sign on him which says something like, 'I don't like people very much', where Suchet enjoys everyone for what ever they have to offer. As I said, not judgmental, that never enters into it with him, he simply takes you for what you are and is analyzing the entire time. The film is also pretty slow at times, it WAS made in 1978 after all. Things were slower then. I am not a freak about pace, but felt the film could have benefited by a little cutting and an occasional 'pick up the pace' from director Guillerman. The scene inside the pyramids before the attempted murder a case in point. I know, I know, you want us to see that everyone is there and they could all have made the attempt, but c'mon, move it along. However, overall the film is still very enjoyable, and of course, beautiful It looks great, scenery, settings, and costumes. These folks know how to live.</fullReview>

Of course, she claims to be innocent, though there are no shortage of suspects either...

Peter Ustinov, David Niven, Angela Lansbury, George Kennedy, all band together to make a "who done it" drama. Unfortunately they are old. And grumpy. The only one that was worth watching was Peter Ustinov, as always. On the other hand, Angela Lansbury should have never accepted this role.The script is quite bad. It relies on a set of unlikely coincidences and a long list of brilliant people acting dumb. Especially the main character, the renowned detective Hercule Poirot is quite dumb for a smart guy. There are a lot of problems with the script that anybody can spot a mile away. Mia Farrow's character does way to much traveling, for a poor girl. Where does she get all that money from? And how come the ruthless rich girl doesn't dispose of her? And how come everybody on that boat is her enemy? And why does she even share a boat with anybody? And there are way too many guns laying around. So much negligence, somebody should be shot! Oh, wait...Anyway. The solution to the mystery is a bit more ingenious than "the butler did it", but just as unbelievable. And it takes far, far too long.Death on the Nile. If you don't like unpleasant characters, stay away. If you do like them, you will get more than your fair share. 3/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre follow-up to "Murder on the Orient Express" (MotOE)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Death on the Nile" features an all-star cast (even if the career of many of these stars was already declining). The setup is fairly exciting and sometimes amusing, though at a not very subtle level, and the locations are exquisite. Nevertheless, the movie has quite some flaws. Where should I begin? First, Peter Ustinov isn't really Hercule Poirot - Albert Finney was far more convincing in "MotOE". Actually, I believe Ustinov is ALWAYS just Ustinov (this character is however absorbing enough, no doubt). Interestingly, the character as described in Agatha Christie's novels would be matched far better by actor David Suchet (as in the TV series). The revelation of the plot is even more far-fetched than in "MotOE". The last murder committed before Ustinov, beg your pardon: Poirot solves the riddle, is disgustingly childish, moreover. Whereas Richard Rodney Bennett's score for the Orient Express was nothing else than magnificent, the late Nino Rota's soundtrack is sweetish and exaggerated - a major disappointment, considering the wonderful oeuvre of this Italian composer. Some of the stars virtually over-act (e.g. Mia Farrow or Angela Lansbury), although it is altogether a nice ensemble. But the overall impression of the cast resembles the overall impression of the movie: somewhat dated and quaint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorry Agatha Cristie fans. This film does no credit to her story-telling abilities. The movie does have a dream cast (for its time) and the pyramids and other historic Egypt locations are very well photographed in the first half.What I didn't like were the following:a- The plot line was so repetitive! Like in Murder on the Orient Express, we know at the start that a central character will be killed and the first hour leads up to the motives for each person to kill her. No complaints so far because the cast and Egypt scenery were good. But, when she is dead, Poirot spends the rest of the movie ONE BY ONE with each character accusing them and re-enacting visually how they could have done it. Its so repetitive and such poor direction. When he finally confronts the real killer, he spends almost half an hour explaining how they did it - another re-enactment, only slower. I wonder if anyone in that talented cast bothered to read the script and wonder if this plotting could ever hold up audience interest.b- I found the depiction of the cruiser's Captain to be quite demeaning and racist. We have the cream - English, Belgian, American and German and then we have this silly Asian clown. Is that really how white people view brown people and isn't it quite insulting? The one amazing thing in the movie was a young actor with these dark, brooding looks called Jon Finch who played a young Communist. I was riveted the moment he came on screen. He was like a modern version of Lew Ayres, another unknown who could have been a top movie star if his anti-war pacifism in the early 40's hadn't put him on an unofficial blacklist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not as classy as the earlier MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS, but still an entertaining whodunit. Peter Ustinov is fine as Hercule Poirot --- a bit more blustery than Albert Finney was in MOTOE.Although it has top-flight production values --- a score by the great Nino Rota; costumes by Anthony Powell; a script by Anthony Shaffer --- it's saddled with the very unimaginative director John Guillermin, whose dubious resume includes the '76 remake of KING KONG. Nonetheless, the acting is terrific. In addition to Ustinov, there's Simon MacCorkindale as a sniveling gigolo, Bette Davis as a wealthy dowager, Maggie Smith as her unpleasant girl-Friday and Angela Lansbury, who stands out as a culture vulture romance novelist. Mia Farrow is the prime suspect and is quite good. Lois Chiles is her bitchy sister and although she's beautiful, she's not much of an actress. Jack Warden, David Niven, George Kennedy, Oliva Hussey, Jane Birkin, Jon Finch and Sam Wanamaker are in it too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pantomime in Egypt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Agatha Christie wrote crime terrible novels, with zero characterisation and witlessly improbable plots (in 'Murder on the Orient Express', for example, all the suspects conspire to kill the victim). But on film, with an all-star cast, they can still appeal as ropey entertainment, it's fun to see a collection of famous actors camping it up. The late Peter Ustinov, who plays detective Hercule Poirot in 'Death on the Nile', is more flamboyant than the tetchy Albert Finney (who played the same role in 'Murder on the Orient Express') or the finickety David Suchet (Poirot in the more recent TV series); but while he is fun and the best of the trio, you can't really take him seriously. The rest of the cast are either wooden (Simon MacCorkindale, an unconvincingly-accented Mia Farrow) or ludicrously over the top (Angela Lansbury, Maggie Smith). Best of the lot is David Niven's narrow minded Colonel, who gets offended when anyone speaks anything but English and who delivers absurd lines (for example, on discovering Jane Birkin with her throat cut and money in her hand: "Blackmail! She must have known something about Linnet Whyte's murder!") with a perfectly straight face. Worst is the racist portrayal of the Egyptian boat manager, which typifies both the missed opportunities and the strange compulsiveness of this film: there is no attempt to bring Christie up-to-date, if this wasn't an adaption you'd dismiss it as rubbish and yet somehow the formula casts its own spell, relieving the film of the responsibility to be accountable to the real world. Hardly a classic, but strangely entertaining viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Suppose The Cast Are Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Agatha Christie ? Ah yes the archietect of the frightfully middle class English whodunnit novel and such a formuliac writer too . Let me guess what happens , a bunch of jolly fine chaps and spunky fun loving girls are on a boat sailing on the Nile where a series of beastley murders are putting everyone off their expensive cuisine . Oh darling how frightfully ghastlyAs you can imagine I`m not really a fan of this type of crime thriller where everything seems to take place in some sort of alternative world where working class scum don`t exist and coinsidering the action takes place on the Nile it`s strange there seems to be an abscence of brown skinned natives too . I guess there is another way of looking at it and that`s the murderer will be a toffee nosed WASP thereby absolving Christi of any type of politically incorrect subtext , oh and the crime buster is a portly Belgian so trust Johnny foreigner to save the day If you like these type of whodunnits I guess you`ll like DEATH ON THE NILE . The cast are fairly good I suppose and it`s interesting to see Ustinov and Niven in a film together since they knew each other very well during the war and appeared in THE WAY AHEAD a morale booster movie from 1944</fullReview>
