		<shortDescription>Riveting and mind-boggling: after three sequels, the SAW franchise sky-rockets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who would've thought that a slasher horror film franchise, after three sequels, could STILL be one of the best things Hollywood has to boast today? Not I, that's for sure. The intricate, original, crowd pleasing, absolutely shocking, riveting, suspenseful "Saw" wowed audiences in 2004 and a very solid sequel did the same in 2005.I still remember seeing Saw and Saw II for the first time and realizing how amazing they were. Yet, I was unhappy with Saw III along with many others for reasons being: it focused more on violence than plot, there was no twist, and the ending was very unsatisfying.I know for a fact I wasn't the only person who thought the "Saw" franchise was officially over, judging by the very disappointing third film...yet, I still possessed a strange love for these films and couldn't wait to see the fourth when it hit theaters. I wasn't expecting a masterpiece at all...but I got one."Saw IV" is not the average horror flick. If you're a Saw fan that likes the series for its blood and guts, you're going to despise it. If you're not willing to completely concentrate on the film's every little detail, you're going to despise it. If you feel like just kicking back, watching a nice gory horror film, and not spending a night analyzing the film, racking your brain until you drive yourself insane, you're going to despise this film. Quite honestly, that's why so many people hate this film: because they were expecting something completely different. Make no mistake--the Saw franchise as we know it is now going in a completely different direction.Here's where the line's drawn between Saw IV and it's predecessors. With the deaths of two main characters in Saw III, you can't possibly think of how Saw IV could really be close to a decent film. Instead of a basic storyline of traps, unlucky individuals who don't appreciate their lives, and suspenseful jump scenes, Saw IV delivers a completely different premise: it's darker, edgier, scarier, more complex, more intricately designed, and more controversial than its predecessors. In some ways, the most horrifying thing about the film is instead of watching people being tested on screen--YOU, as a viewer, are tested--challenged to see what Jigsaw sees, feel what Jigsaw feels...judge how Jigsaw judges. The traps aren't there to entertain, or to make you recoil in disgust...they're there to make you THINK.Even if you don't want to, or don't feel like it, Saw IV will whisk you away into a land of nightmare where you're forced to make the choices to what happens to the individuals on screen--you're the one in control. By the end of the movie, you'll be so shaken up you won't be able to move. For me, this one "Saw IV" HUGE points because it's actually scary, unlike II and III! It's not a body-count movie--it's a riveting, mind-boggling psychological thriller in the sense of the first film. The film feels like it balances a huge amount of plot and story and a huge amount of gore and ends up taking the cake. The film is exceptionally, brutally violent (even more so than Saw III) and some scenes are very, very disturbing--not because they are violent, but because stuff so horrifying is happening you just want to vomit your brains out. Saw IV is NOT for the faint of heart and there is some very disturbing sexual violence in one scene and another massively disturbing scene where five people in my theater got up and left...and this scene has haunted me since I came out of my theater.Though horror veterans James Wan and Leigh Whannell, the original creators of Saw, did not write Saw IV--it almost seems better. Darren Lynn Bousman's exquisite directing incorporates a dire sense of urgency throughout the whole film, making it feel like you're watching a "24" episode.I will warn you now the ending will confuse the hell out of you, which apparently is another reason for people to completely, wrongly condemn this film. Me and my friends spent a good two hours discussing the film afterwards and it made much more sense to us. Be prepared to watch this film with an open mind and be ready for some serious post-viewing discussion afterwards. The ending is very much like that of "The Prestige," and you may have a desire to watch "Saw IV" again the minute it ends.If you're a Saw fan that was disappointed with the lack of psychological horror in Saw II and Saw III---fear not. Saw IV has what you're looking for and will take you to hell and back...but hold onto your dinner. I have no idea how this film made it past the MPAA without an NC-17 rating. Along with your dinner, try to hold onto your sanity while watching the film...good luck with that.Enjoy which, is in my opinion, one of the best treats of the 2007 movie season.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Saw IV" injects new blood into the series... A fantastic and fiendish fourth chapter!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many fans, I was crest-fallen by the ending of last year's "Saw III." I assumed that with basically every main character dead, there would be no way of continuing the series.I was wrong."Saw IV", from director Darren Lynn Bousman ("Saw II" and "III"), and writers Patrick Melton, Marcus Dunstan and Thomas Fenton (taking over for series veteran Leigh Whannell) delivers a story that is thrilling, poignant and disturbing, taking the series in a slightly different direction in terms of tone and style, while at the same time retaining the mood that made the first three films unique.It is honestly very hard to summarize the story without revealing the many twists and turns, but here I go: Jigsaw and Amanda are dead. However, during the autopsy of Jigsaw's body, an audio tape is discovered in his stomach. Detective Hoffman (who you may remember from a brief cameo in "Saw III") hears the tape, that warns Jigsaw's games will continue...At the same time, SWAT leader Rigg (of "Saw II" and "III") has become a shell of a man. Everyone he works with and treasures as friends have been killed. He is becoming reckless... burnt out and hollow.However, something sinister is about to happen... and Rigg will have to play a part in a fiendish new game orchestrated by Jigsaw, who despite being dead, is still the master puppeteer of morals and torture.That is the basic plot line in a nutshell. However, don't be fooled. Though he is dead, Jigsaw is still very much an important part of the story. We get numerous flashbacks of him before his transformation into the brilliant madman we know from previous films, and see exactly what events triggered his desire to turn... If you think his only problem was the cancer inside, think again... There is much more to be discovered about John Kramer... And I think there is still more to the character to explore in future films...There are also other new characters, including Jigsaw's ex, and a pair of FBI agents, who complicate the movie (in a good way), by creating numerous intersecting sub-plots.But onto the real fun of the series... The traps. I, personally, loved every trap in this film. We get to witness Jigsaw's first effort (which I can only say is painful in many different ways), and we get new, disturbing and complicated set-ups... While the film might not have the "ouch" factor that past traps (paticularly "The Rack" from "III") might have had, they are certainly gory and zany enough to keep everyone entertained and revolted at the same time. In fact, I would say the audience I saw the film with (a sold-out theater at 10:25 opening night) had the best reactions I have ever seen with a film. Bravo to the filmmakers! There were really very few down-points in the film, for me. I ate-up everything that I saw, and loved just about every second of it! Also, the numerous twists and turns throughout kept me reeling. And for once, I can honestly say I did not see the (series staple) twist ending coming... A real shocker!And while I did miss some of the characters from previous installments (I wish Shawnee Smith's Amanda could have gotten more screen time), the new characters have so much promise and potential, I can forgive any complaints I might have.Here's to "Saw IV"... A frenzied and freakish sequel that has only fueled my hunger for future installments! 9 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Film - Hardcore "Saw" Fans Will Be Pleased.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first sat down to watch "Saw IV", I was not expecting much as it seemed it would be very difficult to make a good sequel with Jigsaw dead. I am not a huge fan of the "Saw" movies, but I was very impressed with Saw IV considering it lacked the presence of Jigsaw.The film opens up with an autopsy of Jigsaw/John, where an audio cassette is discovered in his stomach, and that sets out the whole plot for the movie. Throughout the film we learn a little more about Jigsaw's history, and why he did what he did. Of course Saw IV also includes some creative, painful and very gory traps which lead to a few slow and painful deaths, which will make even the strongest moviegoers cringe.Saw IV is nothing like it's prequel, Saw III. It doesn't have a lot of random and somewhat pointless violence like Saw III, it makes you think and had a good twist which Saw III also lacked. If you go to watch Saw IV expecting an average, overly violent, torture porn horror film, I guarantee you will hate this movie. Much like the first "Saw" film, you will be pondering over the final twist for hours.Overall I thought Saw IV was a decent film, it was entertaining and had a pretty solid script which keeps the audience interested, and the usual bloody "Saw" special effects. However, I thought that it did lack in suspense towards the very end and was a little too far-fetched in some scenes.6/10 - Entertaining, hardcore "Saw" fans should be pleased.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The SAW Franchise finally descends into absurdity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jigsaw is dead, but his game is far from over. A detective is on the hunt for clues around the city, in which he must act in the same manner as Jigsaw with the victims he finds. He must do this in order to find the location of two of his colleagues and save them.It's easy to see how the SAW franchise, as it is now called, is turning into the same mess that struck Friday the 13th, Halloween and Nightmare On Elm Street. The story is over, but the cash flow still has some juice in it. In this installment Jigsaw is dead, but his cruel game continues. How you might ask? Well, if I were to explain that, it would ruin the film, but it's hard to review this film without leaking something.The original SAW redefined the horror genre, so much so that there are now countless imitators. It packed the goods in gore and a shocking twist at the end. The sequel, which really was not needed, tried to capitalize on the same system. It failed. Yet still made boatloads of money. Hence the 3rd, and this film and of course the next one. SAW IV becomes a parody of itself, unintentionally mind you. It tries to re-capture the essence of the original from plot points to the twist, which is a staple in the series now. Why SAW IV doesn't work as well as it wants to, is because it's far too confusing and doesn't satisfy it's audience, instead it leaves more holes, that will be filled in by it's sequel, much like how this one filled in some from the 3rd.SAW IV answers the questions, such as who the blonde woman was in Jigsaw's dreams and why he covered the tape in wax. Yet leaves out other things, specifically what the letter said to Amanda. It could have easily been explained, but they wanted to leave as much story as possible to continue this franchise, which should have been over at 1 and could have been wrapped up completely with 3. This leaves the audience confused, as well as angry. When the final credits rolled up I sat back in my chair and asked myself if they really answered anything as to why it ended the way it did?it doesn't. It throws in that twist that is expected, but doesn't bother to explain it. I guess we have to wait another year to find out why things happened the way they did.SAW IV is gory, probably the worst out of all of them, but not quite as nerve flinching as the others. It doesn't have any scenes that make you squirm in your seat like when Dr. Gordon saws off his foot, or when Amanda falls into the pit full of needles, or even when Detective Matthews smashes hiss foot with the toilet cover. Those small things are the ones that get the audience; this film simply shows the bloody entrails of people.I will give credit to where it's due. The film stays consistent with the others and I applause the actors and writers for continuing certain characters through out the entire series. It gives fans goose bumps when they see a familiar face. Also, the twist, which fails in comparison to the first two but it better then the third, is adequate. In fact there is more then one twist. We also get some more background history on Jigsaw, who he was before he became a psychopath. A little hint as to why as well. We can't connect to any of these characters. Characters from the previous films that show up here, have very little screen time and are killed off. Why have them survive through all this stuff just to kill them off. It cheapens the films in which we root for them to live; we know their fate in the end. There may have been characters that you cared for in previous installments that were trapped in Jigsaw's game, this time around, unless you knew them from before, we know their fate, we know we don't care.The ending will confuse the hell out of a lot of people; I had to take a minute to figure it out myself. Maybe because it was really well written, or horrible executed, I haven't decided yet. I found myself sitting there with a confused look across my face, wanting more, not simply because I wanted more, but because the film needed more. The film has a lot of stuff going on, it's not to know who' who, who's dead, what's going on where and so on.If you've missed one film in the series, you will most likely be lost in this film. It asks you, as do the others, to pay attention to the previous films. I really enjoy that; it asks the audience to think a little bit, which is usually missing from horror films these days. It's a tad better then the second and third, but falls apart near the end. This time around we can't seem to care for the guy whose trapped in Jigsaw's mind game. We've come to expect the unexpected, we've comes to be grossed out. Have the makers of this series run their course? Well, after the next film, to tie everything up, I hope the answer is yes. The first is still the best and I cannot imagine the next one being any better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It surpassed my expectations...Saw reigns again for the fourth year in a row.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a die hard Saw fan, Saw IV was one of my top must sees of 2007. Fortunately, I didn't get my hopes up, and therefore I wasn't disappointed. The movie has its fair share of flaws, don't get me wrong. However, the movie made this Saw fan happy because it maintained the spirit of the series. The movie's biggest flaw is that it is by far the most unrealistic of the series and relies too much on chance within the story. Too many events are contingent on others, which makes Jigsaw look almost clairvoyant. However, I was able to look past this and enjoy the fourth Saw film.Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) is dead. Though he is gone, he vows that his work will continue. And it appears he is true to his word, for SWAT Lt. Rigg (from Saw 2 &amp; 3) is the latest member of the police force to be thrust into one of Jigsaw's deadly games. Meanwhile, Detective Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) is joined by a pair of FBI agents to help stop the Jigsaw killer once and for all...They'll start by looking into his past, beginning with his ex wife, Jill.The acting is pretty good. Costas Mandylor, Tobin Bell, and Scott Patterson are the standouts. Bell brings so much more to the character this time around through flashbacks as we learn more about John Kramer. Showing that he has created one of the most memorable characters of recent memory, Bell makes us almost sympathize with him, despite the acts he has committed. Mandylor is really good as Detective Hoffman, even though he has limited screen time and dialog. I liked Patterson a lot because of the toughness and reality he brought to the character. Agent Strahm is a good character and definitely one of my favorites in the series. One big surprise was Lyric Bent as Rigg. He definitely showed a lot of range in this movie. He has a future.The plot is probably the most complex, as there can be as many as 3 different subplots going on at the same time, all while the audience has questions from the first 3 movies answered. The ending also leaves a little to be desired, as it is the least impacting twist of the series (and most obvious). However, I really enjoyed the traps, which were definitely a step up from Saw 3. The random gore was kept to a minimum, but the beginning is absolutely horrifyingly gory. It also felt rushed, which means I can't wait to see the unrated DVD. Hopefully it'll have more extra footage than the others. Saw 4 has the weakest script of the series, but it's still better than I expected. At this point, it appears as if Darren Bousman is going through the motions, and that's what keeps the series spirit alive. As long as Bousman, Wan, or Whannell continue to be involved, the spirit should live on. I also have to give props to the editor for the smooth and catchy transitions, not to mention the production design is top notch. That and the lighting provide at least some horror realism, as the plot does border on absurd at times. The sound is better than ever, with the classic 'Hello, Zepp' tune that has become one of the most recognizable tracks in movie history making its dramatic appearance in the climax of the film. The ending also leaves us wanting more, so I'm expecting Saw 5 next Halloween.8/10 --spy</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate in modern horror...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a rare occurrence, but get ready to see this more then once. Saw 4 plays more like a detective story lifted from a page of a who-dun-it novel. This time, we delve deeper into John's past, his ex-wife, and the real secrets about what made him Jigsaw. During his autopsy, it's reveled his stomach contains an audio tape. The tape warns that his work will continue.It seems that die-hard fans don't wish to know about what's in the story, since I had to re-edit my comment so that none of the story would be revealed (except that which you see in the ads anyway). In my previous comment, I said nothing about the ending, yet just giving away some of the plot is enough of a no-no. I don't blame them, since this 4th outing has too many elements that make it easier to predict what's going to happen. Regardless, you'd have to be some kind of rare genius to figure out what will happen in the end.The series has flowed like a smooth, well-oiled Rube Goldberg machine. It's the most complex of the bunch, in some ways, outdoing the previous ones. I repeat: it begs to be watched again. Just when you thought that the previous Saw Traps had done everything they can to a human body, this one has some clever ones of it's own (not as gruesome as Saw 3, though). The autopsy scene is set to the extreme; the MPAA stating that most viewers have now gotten used to seeing programs like CSI and other medical procedures, so they let this slide easier. Deceptive, dark, very edgy and well written, the Saw series can easily end here. It's almost necessary to have watched the previous Saws, but can stand on it's own as one of the best of the chapters. Of course, it leaves it open for yet another in the series, which will be in production soon. I don't know when I will tire of the series, but honestly, I can't wait to see what other delicious traps they cook up next.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Turns down the gore and up the drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now you might think that from my title I'm going to slate Saw 4, well I'm not.Like most I'm an avid fan of the series and when Halloween rolls around I'm always wondering will it be good how you keep a genre like Horror fresh.Well they done it again while don't get me wrong there is a lot of gore in there its seems a lot more toned down and more apportite for the film instead of just torture torture torture, which I feel really helps the film develop into its own skin.The story line focuses more on jigsaw's back story this time round and how he became to who he was at the end of Saw 3, this allowment of character development I feel is vital to the story as we have always wanted to know more about the man behind the machine.The story also focuses on Rigg and his story into the sick world of Saw, this film picks up where Saw 3 left off so its the same thing that Jeff went through he has to try help other people decide their own fate.The ending is a good one but obviously never as good as the first one its safe to say I doubt they will ever be able to recapture what they had to begin with.My advice for anyone still waiting to watch this film is keep an open mind about it and never set expectations too high because this is a good film and you should really give it a try before dismissing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing that we haven't already seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I went to see Saw IV yesterday night. What do we actually gain from this movie? Basically it shows nothing new, it's like a reprise of Saw III. And the question is, do we prefer Saw III or Saw? Saw started with only two guys, chained in a bathroom, wondering where they are and what's this all actually about, and those questions are typical for existentialism. The point of this movie reminded me a lot of "No Exit", written by Jean-Paul Sartre.Both Saw II and Saw III distinguish from the first Saw but Saw IV doesn't bring anything new. It sticks to its prequel. We get to see the same scenes (flashbacks), the same places and again we face those Jigsaw traps that never seem to end. I think that we all know by now what Jigsaw really wants and how we are supposed to play. But the detectives and agents seem to lack intelligence and don't listen to his rules. That's how we face again the catastrophe of this spectacle. We also get to see a bit of John's past and his ex-wife, Jill. I thought she was there to reveal something new about John but she never does.Actually, Saw IV offers quite a lot, many traps, many people who got into them, many stories and also a lot of blood and violence. The truth is, I don't want to see those things anymore. I have already seen all of that in Saw III. It's like the creators of the movie are falling with every sequel deeper and deeper into meaninglessness. They have forgotten a long time ago about the meaning of this whole thing and rather decided to focus on blood and violence. Too bad the team Leigh Whannell and James Wan, the founders of Saw, does not any longer exist. Nothing can save Saw anymore.But the director Darren Lynn Bousman keeps on trying, which is actually a big plus. He really can create the atmosphere that fits best to the movie.I have also nothing against the new actors that appear in Saw IV, p.e. Costas Mandylor and Scott Patterson, who played really professionally for those two roles that they got.I guess I still hope that they will save Saw, because I'm a big fan, although I already assume that the situation is hopeless. They have sunk too deep.Good luck with the next sequel. You will definitely need it.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do you Saw what I Saw?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without a doubt, Saw has become an absolute phenomenon. I find it quite impressive how a small $1 million horror film garnered strong word of mouth and made it big, spawning a franchise which has become Lionsgate Films' yearly bread and butter. I've really enjoyed the Saw films and have been there since the beginning, viewing the first film on opening day in the UK. It was refreshing to see something original and to my surprise, the sequel, Saw II was just as good. However, the third instalment (still good) showed signs of clutching at straws.SWAT Commander Rigg (Lyriq Bent) has become obsessed with finding Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), particularly since his fellow officers have died via his sadistic games. However, Jigsaw finds Rigg and has him play his own game. With two of his colleagues, Officer Matthews and Hoffman (Donnie Wahlberg, Costas Mandylor) held captive in one of Jigsaw's traps, Rigg has 90 minutes to try and find them. Meanwhile FBI Agents Strahm and Perez (Scott Patterson, Athena Karkanis) question Jigsaw's ex-wife Jill (Betsy Russell) in an effort to uncover Jigsaw's mysterious accomplice. Saw IV is a sequel that is struggling to stay consistent with the numerous plot strands and filling up of plot holes. It almost feels like an extreme connect the dots puzzle as one tries to piece together all the characters and incidents from the previous instalments. Even when watching it, I could already imagine Internet forums swarming with hundreds of questions.What made the first film so unique was that the victims are often people who essentially deserved to be punished, be they drug dealers or con artists frantically trying to save themselves from the macabre situation they were in. With Jigsaw as judge, jury and executioner, do we as an audience side with his objective, or do we sympathise with the wrongdoing victim during their last few seconds before they die a fantastic death? As the sequels have progressed, saving oneself appears to have been completely abandoned, for in the third instalment as well as this one, some victims simply have to wait to depend upon someone to help them. Also some supposedly innocent (?) people are dragged in (the guy with his eyes sewn shut is involved in the film's best trap, but who the hell was he?), while some injured victims are merely swept aside and we never know if they live or die.In an effort to try and make a bigger sequel, games are no longer in one confined space, but set in different locations across the city, pushing 'suspension of disbelief' to the limit. For example, Rigg's apartment is turned upside-down within a matter of minutes, with blood on the walls, pictures hanging from the ceiling and how someone managed to get a scalping chair up there without anyone noticing is beyond me! Some may like the distancing from the previous movies, but for me this is a slight shift towards conventional slasher movies. Acting wise, it's rather mediocre. Apart from Tobin Bell, quite a bankable name now because of the Saw franchise, a number of small stars litter the film and help keep the costs down. For me, the only other name that stands out is Donnie Wahlberg, and even he is somewhat wasted. As expected, it's reliant on flashbacks, some of which made me feel like I was watching a soap opera rather than a horror. However director Darren Lynn Bousman does fulfil on account of gore, pushing Saw IV with 'in-your-face' violence and close ups that probably wouldn't have passed through the BBFC with an uncut 18 certificate five years ago. If you've been following the franchise then you can't help but be roped along for the ride. I certainly was. For something that was written, shot, edited and practically gift-wrapped all inside one year, it still works. It's just a shame that what was once so original three years ago now feels stale with hardly anything new to offer. Hell, there aren't even any jumpy moments! Given the rush-job nature at dishing out sequels, maybe they'll have more fun at turning it into some kind of weekly/monthly TV series.I really do hope that this is the last one, because really now, enough is enough. But as Jigsaw says, "the games have just begun." Rating ? five out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's hope the games never end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will it ever end? I don't know, but after this one, I'm eager for more still! I know what you're thinking, it's been overdone. I admit that it's your opinion and you can judge the series after three movies, but you don't close the book on the 3rd movie when the story is "just beginning".Should you bother seeing this movie if you haven't seen the other Saw movies? No. What if you like gore and suspense... sure. But this movie is strictly for the Saw fans who have seen the first three and followed every step and hint, otherwise it's a big waste of time. The only thing that helps those people is that every Saw movie shows flashbacks. Honestly though, it's not as useful as seeing them to begin with.Now to the movie...This was the first Saw movie that was not written by Leigh Whannel. Is this a problem? I don't really think so. Saw IV was just as riveting and plot-detailed as the first three. I watched the movie tonight with 2 friends in a closed theatre, and we were all talking during the entire movie asking each other questions and trying to figure out the plot. I feel bad for the massive amounts of people cramming the theatre on opening night; there's going to be so much talking, it will be unbearable to follow. "Who's that guy?" "Do you think he really died?" "I bet he's playing a game as well". Not so much fun.Let me be completely honest about this movie, and that will be all for me. There were many twists and turns, all what we hoped for. The details are superb; everything clicked and was managed well. Most of all, the gore, violence and games were top notch. I was stunned at how amazing the tests were... seriously. It was a joy to watch.Completely entertaining. If you liked the first Saws, then you will not want to miss this one. 7 out of 10. In my opinion, it was better than Saw III, but slightly below Saw II... and of course, not near the original. But still, Saw IV was brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It would be comical if it wasn't so patronizing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Against my better judgment, desperate to see a horror that wasn't "30 Days of Midnight" (which I'd already saw), I decided to give the "Saw" franchise another look by partaking in this sequel. It was a stretch you see, because I think after the first one, the movies went way downhill. Of course, I didn't realize how badly they'd gone downhill until I saw this one.This is not the most grotesque of these films, although the autopsy at the beginning of the film is enough to make you lose your lunch, popcorn, or whatever. Naturally a tape is found, reminding the police that the game is just beginning.This in itself begs the question: why exactly are the police the targets of Jigsaw's "games?" This was a man whose past victims included a man who wanted to die, a swindler, a drug addict, an apathetic young man, an uncaring doctor and criminals in general. So why does Jigsaw have it in for the cops? Okay, the shady cop is one that made sense- but why the others? Who knows? I don't think they care anymore.But wait...is it really Jigsaw at all? He died in the last one- the said autopsy is proof of that. Well anyone who saw Saw 2 or 3 knows where this is going- even a child could figure out that its not Jigsaw anymore, but one of his "students." To illustrate how ridiculous this film gets, in the final scene you see the man from the third movie, still looking for his daughter and the remains of the Doctor who got her head blown off. As Jigsaw died in this room, along with his initial student, why exactly wouldn't the coroners actually take the Doctor's body? Why would this man still be running around, looking for his daughter? Are the rest of the bodies still littering the building? Of course, if you've seen any of the other three Saw movies, you realize there is a gory aftermath, which is inevitably followed by a rehashing of ALL the events that have happened, proving that everything is interconnected. Lets face it...the rehashing in itself is meant to say to the audience "see, you didn't notice how all of this is intertwined," however how many times can this finale play over and over again before it simply patronizing? How about giving your audience some credit? We've been down this road three times before- if you're going to change the direction of the films, then do it in a way that doesn't rely on a cheap retelling of events that would make Aesop recoil in agony!If you're a "torture porn" fan, there will be plenty of gore and torture for you to indulge in, and no doubt "Saw V" will be out Halloween 2008. If you're looking for a good movie however, you'd best try your luck with "30 Days of Night." Enough of this franchise- it is just getting dumber and dumber.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"If it's Halloween...It must be Saw." That's the tagline for Saw IV, the newest installment in the gory horror series of Saw. It's almost a tradition that every Halloween there's a new Saw sequel, hence the tagline. But after this messy, self-indulgent bloodbath I kind of wish that this tired series would just come to an end already.Saw IV involves a SWAT officer named Rigg (Lyriq Bent) who is kidnapped, and placed in a deadly game by the supposedly deceased Jigsaw. He is told that his also-kidnapped partners Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) and Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) are playing a game of their own, and that Rigg must resist saving them for a total of 90 minutes. While searching for his two friends, Rigg continually finds people in life-or-death situations, on the path to his final test. Rigg must choose whether he wants to help save these people (His usual reaction), or follow Jigsaw's rules and let them get out by themselves. Who will win? Who will lose? Who will lose a limb? (Or limbs?) Who will care? A new Saw movie comes out every Halloween, that means that the filmmakers only have about a year to write it, cast it, shoot it, edit it, and roll it. The first three movies all felt like, for the most part, well constructed films (Saw II not as much). You could tell that they were well thought out, and that a general effort was put forth to create a constant storyline where each movie follows the tracks of the others. Unlike horror flicks like Friday the 13th, or Nightmare on Elm Street, Saw cannot just go off on a tangent, it has to follow the footsteps of its predecessors in order to keep the Saw storyline chugging along. Saw IV is the first in the series that truly feels like a complete rush-job. Since Leigh Whannel (Writer of the first three Saws) has been replaced by Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan, it is obvious that these new writers of the series were pressured to write a coherent storyline so that the filmmakers could get Saw IV out by Halloween. Close to nothing in this vapid movie is well thought-out, there are plot holes all over the place, and the characters are so incredibly stupid that even their idiot actions aren't funny. It's an assault on the eyes, ears, and stomach (The squeamish will be puking, and the Saw fans will be nauseous from its stupidity).About the only thing I enjoyed about this sequel were the revelations of John Kramer/Jigsaw's past. Those are the only dramatic scenes that work, but there aren't nearly enough of them to keep Saw IV afloat. I won't spoil anything but this movie, during flashbacks, shows us Jigsaw's first trap, and it is without a doubt the best scene in the whole movie. That is the only scene where character development and story progress actually came together, and made for a tense and excellently suspenseful scene. However that's about all that I liked about Saw IV.The story makes dangerously little sense, and the characters are basically only there for a quick kill. For instance there's a scene involving a pedophilic rapist who is held at gunpoint, and forced to get into a trap where either his limbs will be torn apart, or he gets his eyes ripped out (That means no more porn watching. Yikes!). Scenes like this won't even be enjoyable for the torture porn crowd. They are so horribly edited, lit, and acted that they are reduced to absymal trash that nobody will be able to appreciate. The editing in the Saw flicks have always looked like the result of an editor on acid. There are endless flashing lights, fast zoom-ins, Pan-shots that spin around faster than Linda Blair's head, and repeated shots of screaming that should build tension...but only build laughs. I've had it up to here with Saw's editing because it gives me a headache, and when it's all over I feel like I just woke up from a nightmare where I was addicted to crack.The effort put into making Saw IV is minimal to the point that you can tell it was just made so the series can thrive on till the final film (Supposedly Saw VI). It's like the middle child, or older brother, that gets ignored while everybody is busy adoring the newborn baby. In other words the filmmakers didn't seem to care about this sequel as much. They're just stalling until they get to the big payoff with Saw V and Saw VI. And trust me Saw IV's twist ending is the epitome of both "rush job" and "stalling". I give Saw IV a 1 out of 5. No wonder Darren Lynn Bousman walked away after this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw 4 is a terrible film - I LOVED the first one, it's genuine shocks, insane brutality and INSANE ending. Ever since then it's been going down hill - but still watchable. In parts 2 &amp; 3 the traps and gore still kind of shocked me and were very tense moments. In this one, nothing works - nothing shocks you anymore because it's all been done in that "Saw manner - it's fast editing, flash screen segment just get annoying and when people scream you just really want them to suck it up and die...Even though this tripe was happening in a big screen in front of me I was eager to see the end, I'd heard the actors were all signing back up because of "the end". Lemmie tell you, the end is the start..."The games have just begun" and I couldn't care less - no character has any real motive for doing anything in this film and it's one big trailer for the next 5,675 Saw flicks that will be bled out this increasingly ridiculous franchise. It really sucks. They might try and explain stuff in Saw V but I don't really care. All-in-all this is a waste of mine, yours and the film-makers time - nobody can be bothered anymore...Another point why the hell is "the creepy doll" a baby version in this one - seriously it's like 1/2 the size of the original!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfortunately, the 'games have just begun'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much the like the three preceding Saw films, Saw IV is filled to the brim with inconsistencies, bad acting, annoying editing and poor twists. However, despite its shortcomings, this was definitely more watchable Saw II. The film begins with an incredibly graphic (and pointless) autopsy on Jigsaw, who was killed in Saw III. A wax-covered tape is found in his stomach, and quite clearly states his legacy will continue and that the games are far from over. We are then introduced to Rigg (Lyrqi Bent) who has 90 minutes to save Detectives Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) and Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) while passing through a series of tests which involve random people. To add some more story into the mix, Agent Strahm (Scott Patterson) and Agent Perez (Athena Karkanis) are hot on Rigg's tale, while also trying to find Matthews and Hoffman.Obviously story was thrown out of the window when making this movie, as the story is convoluted and predictable. It is merely an excuse to show off some inventive and sadistic traps for the ADD riddled target audience. Whereas in James Wan's Saw, traps were secondary to the mystery and intrigue, here they are the focus. Not to say I do not enjoy watching how they work, as they provide some excellent gore. Director Darren Lynn Bousman has not changed his style very much, because the editing is as atrocious as it always has been with quick, flashy cuts that plague most scenes. These are incredibly irritating and make it hard to follow the action. Even parts of dialogue are reduced to this MTV music-video style of camera-work.None of the acting is particularly worth mentioning; Tobin Bell really needs lessons to broaden his range, as all he does is talk in that same gruff voice he has done in Saw - Saw III. Betsy Russell is probably the best as Jill, Jigsaw's ex-wife. To be fair, the actors are not helped by the script, as it is pretty darn poor. The twist at the end could probably be seen a mile away and lacks any punch whatsoever, and it does not help that we are treated to a series of flashbacks which explain it, like we are not smart enough to think for ourselves! The story itself seems contradictory, as Jigsaw's motive was to kidnap people who did not appreciate their life (like druggies, arsonists, rapists) and test them. In this, Rigg is chosen, although he is a policeman whose flaw is trying to save everyone?! Seems a bit dodgy to me...Regardless, you could do worse for 95 minutes. If you are a hardcore Saw fanatic you will probably love this, if you aren't you should probably just skip it. This is nothing but a rehash of Saw III with more gore and the same silly story.1?/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw IV (2007) *1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every long-running horror series has to have its nadir, and for the SAW films it's this muddled installment. It didn't strike me as a total disaster this time though, as compared to when I first saw it at the theater (I rated it a total BOMB at that time). I think it helps to see this right after the first three rather than cold on its own, but even being somewhat familiar with the characters and scenarios set up in the storyline so far, many people are still bound to get lost and mixed up. Director Darren Lynn Bousam at this point established himself as the go-to guy for this franchise (he also directed parts II and III, each diminishing quality) but this time the dizzying camera-work and bouncing around from flashback to flashback take on new heights of tedium.Tobin Bell (as the now-definitely-deceased John Kramer, aka Jigsaw) returns via numerous insights back into his past life, but there is getting to be less interest in what made him the angel of death he is, since we've already learned enough of that in the previous films. We're introduced to his ex-wife (Betsy Ross) and there are some new angles toyed with amidst the confusion, but the best thing that may be said for this sequel, for those who would look at it this way, is that the gory death traps which are the main staple of this series are still potent. *1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw IV was a thinker.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite what other people may say, I'm very glad that the Saw crew has decided to continue the Saw franchise. There were too many loose ends at the end of Saw III that needed tying up, and I believe that Saw IV accomplished this to the degree that it was supposed to. Sure; as a stand-alone movie, it's quite confusing. I would strongly recommend viewing the previous three before this one; otherwise, as aforementioned, you'll be lost throughout the movie. As expected, IV had all the down-right blood, gore and grisly traps that I've come to know and love from the series in addition to explaining a bit more about Jigsaw's past and the inner workings of his little 'set-up'. I understood that ALL of my questions wouldn't be answered; that's what Saws V and VI are for. But I was satisfied that some of the most important 'puzzles' had gotten a few more pieces by the completion of IV. All in all, I view the Saw franchise as a 'thinking man's horror' kind of series. If you can tie the four movies together in your mind, it makes a lot more sense and you can understand what's happening better. So, I'll give it a 10/10 for avid Saw fans like myself, and even a modest 7/10 for people that aren't too into it. Saw IV is definitely worth watching through, regardless of your stand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw 'bore'; 'chore'; 'snore' ? give it whatever pithy subtitle you like, it's exactly what it deserves.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw IV represents a sort of landmark for me. It was the first time I'd been genuinely nullified by a horror film that had, or seemed to have, so much going on. Within the runtime of Saw IV, characters will shoot about all over the place, encountering many-a situation that you'd feel would have some sort of effect on them: physical or otherwise. The film is full of is so much visceral content, with a lot of goo and blood getting thrown at the screen and splattering all over the place, while there are also many heinous, yet somewhat creative, traps and incidences being set up and executed. With all this going on, it's a shame that all you can do is sit there, stare and wait for it to end.Saw IV might equally represent a landmark in the overall franchise, of the kind that nobody is even bothering anymore. If the first sequel was an intriguing and unpredictable, pseudo-Big Brother piece that built to what turned out to be an interesting denouement; while the third entry at least had Angus Macfadyen, whom looked as if he'd stumbled in off of another film, grounding the entry with his morally torn character and his shedding of a 'skin' (a jacket or a dressing-gown) as each task came and went, while the realisation of the situation settled in and he became a different person; then número quatro in the series is a gigantic mis-fire, a non-event of a picture.Number four has nothing; and I mean absolutely nothing in the way of anything at all. It's the same stuff, and that statement isn't limited to the ideology that the people go in to see the film solely because of the traps, it's linked to the running around; the stern-looking faces; the dumb decisions people make and the sheer outlandishness of some of the executions of the antagonist's plans. Take some of the Saw series' more identifiable moments. If in the past, a character clicked on the TV and saw themselves on it by way of a CCTV monitor hidden in their house, then it might have worked somewhat and was quite eerie. Similallry, a puppet on a tricycle hiding in another person's wardrobe might've worked reasonably well as a visceral and effective jump as our own human eye struggles to identify just what the Hell it was in perfect parallel with our brain's absorbing the initial shock. In Saw IV; piggy mask clad women hiding in hospital corridors as people from prior entries, whose narratives have been done and dusted, are snatched does not make for good, interesting or even frightening viewing ? but that's what we get.But hey; who cares, right? You turn up, you get grossed out and then you leave again. You shrug and you wait for the next instalment, right? Wrong. Wrong attitude. I gave the Saw franchise the benefit of the doubt, I really did, at least for two of its sequels; but this is garbage, and everybody knows it. The film is a part of a growing tradition in recent large scale; lots-of-money-thrown-at-it; productions, of deconstructing the villain or showing them in a humbling light that tells us how they got to the point we all know them for. Following on from the third Star Wars episode; the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remakes/prequels; the recent Hannibal Lecter prequel; the third Saw entry and now this: a crass, delving into a past nobody cares about as Jigsaw (Bell) comes to be the mechanical, contraption expert we all know him for.The film, for the most part, covers the journey of a police officer named Rigg (Bent) as he ventures from one trap involving others to another, all the time aiming to save fellow police officer Eric Matthews (Wahlberg), the guy that has been missing since the finale of number two. Like every film of this ilk, he has a time limit; ninety minutes, which doubles up as your bog-standard length for pieces of junk films such as this one. Rigg's adventure is peppered with dumb, would-be deeper meaning, pseudo-philosophical statements in which he is invited the 'see what I see' and 'feel what I feel' by a Jigsaw character pathetically put across only by way of cassette tape. His journey is uninspiring and episodic; it consists of him stumbling across an array of different people of various past bad-deeds; instances that could unfold in any order at all and we'd all still end up where we eventually end up. Some of the more sicker scenarios in the series worm their way into this segment, in which scalps; eyes and blood circulatory points in the body are the order of the day, and are targeted by these traps.But everything is tired and dull. The hyper-kinetic editing and camera work becomes tiring, while the zooms and the cuts and the whip pans just completely draws you out of whatever small amount of interest you have invested in all this. Saw IV is a film with a labyrinth of a narrative, but then needs a character of high authority to come on screen at the end and explain everything to you. It's the sort of cynical, self-aware piece that, by this point, knows it's absolute garbage and just provides you with the gore and the blood as its story just 'unfolds' in the background: if you're following it, then great ? if not, we don't care. By this point in the franchise; some suit-clad, money-counting producer of sorts, somewhere, seriously needed a slap. Whereas if you enjoyed it, and good God - there actually seem to be some out there that think it's some sort of a minor-masterpiece, then you can all stay as far away from me as possible.</fullReview>

Previously however Jigsaw died yet his familiars continue his work.This would seem like a clever film, that fills the gaps like Saw III but it basically fills nothing but our mouths with vomit.Saw IV contains nothing more than pure blood-shed, despite the occasional police investigation everything seems a bit too morbid and dark...A little too much this time, bring back the cleverness!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Simpsons did a better flashback within a flashback...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let the games slow down. Thankfully the best thing I can say about 'Saw IV' is they cut back on the gore. They didn't necessary replace the gruesome aspect of the series with more plot, story or acting, in fact, if anything, they all but eliminated those aspects that were the only thing holding the previous installments alive. Okay, sure this movie is gory, but comparatively speaking, it's "SawLite." Here we have more of a back story of Jigsaw (and the Mrs.) as he had died in the previous film. That's not a spoiler; the movie starts with his autopsy. It didn't really gross me out, as it was all medical, though it might be not for the squeamish. It does set the scene for some of his postmortem games ? basically what parts IV+ are set up since they killed off the main character/ring-leader. Unfortunately, as that's a key plot point to keep the series (or games) alive and incidentally, its downfall. From there, you never know if you're in the present or past. It is flashback, upon flashback, including, hilariously the now made-famous: flashback within the flashback. (I saw that once on 'The Simpsons' and that was hysterical. Unfortunately, here, it's to be taken seriously, though I still laughed.) Just to jump ahead a bit, in 'Saw V' it's more relevant, but part 'IV' sets the stage where they simply just make up stuff that happened in the background to keep the story alive. If you watch this movie, or the following one(s), you'll see where character's just appear where the writers want them to ? around corners, behind doors, etc. I pity them as it seems like they're grasping at straws to keep the series going. Not a horrible movie, but, boy, they needed to end it with 'III.'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another year, another Halloween approaching, and thus, another Saw film. Why, oh why. The Saw franchise should of stopped producing sequels after the first one. Pehaps even after the second. It was blatantly a cash in. The first Saw epitomised the sheer genius of torture horror of the new millennium - which has sparked off sub-genre type films like Hostel and Vacancy.Saw I was the king of psychological grim violence fest that had you hooked to the edge of your seat, and with a finale to die for. It was sheer brilliance. The second movie saw the new apprentice from the survivor of Saw I, taking over Jigsaw's work. Pretty much giving us flashbacks of the processes involved etc etc, and giving a pretty cool twist at the end. It wasn't as good as Saw I, but it was a decent sequel. In my opinion. It should of stopped here. But this wasn't enough. Instead they went the extra mile, and made Saw III even gorier and even more grim for kicks. It was shoddy, poor, pathetically acted, and a let-down.Saw IV however, takes the biscuit. Not only was it bad all the way through, and completely ridiculously over the top, it was without a doubt, one of the worst films I've seen this year. A few familiar faces couldn't even help it nurse its way upwards from Saw III, in fact, Saw III was just completely irrelevant. The whole point of Saw III was for Saw IV to pick up where it left off. Not kill off the poor bugger who had to do the rest of his tests to find his daughter. To be quite honest, by the end of Saw IV, I just didn't even care who was in it, so many name checks, so many people and the story and flashbacks just went all over the place. It was more confusing than a Rubik's cube.What really annoyed me was the cheese factor about the whole line at the end of the movie "Game Over". As soon as this line flopped out of (insert random character that really has no reference to the movie franchise what so ever, here)'s mouth, it just summed up what I really hope will happen. Saw. Game Over.It's been rinsed far too much now, and its getting boring. No longer do I even care about people getting tortured and killed in the most interesting of ways. The spark has now disappeared from Saw. Its no longer a cult thing, thanks to its sheer poor sequels/prequels.If you do like the Saw franchise, you'll probably fall head-over heels in love with this instalment and get sucker-punched, ready for (what can only be called) a diabolical 5th and 6th movie. I personally want to get rid of the memory of watching this movie and the 3rd movie, possibly even the second movie. The fact remains, if you haven't seen any of the Saw movies, stick with the first. It will at least, give the franchise some sort of credibility for being one of the best films this genre has to offer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Feels Like Belated Sequel with Half the Substance of a Typical Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me just start off by saying that I'm a pretty big Saw fan, the first three movies were fine examples of how to create a psychological horror movie. I was especially fond of the deeper and more integrated character development in Saw 3, which is my favorite of the series. While the ending was too cliché of a cliffhanger (in a sense) to simply ignore, it did get me more pumped up than most movies with those endings, more or less because Saw and Saw 2 were somewhat similar with their endings (aside from not making a sequel so obvious). That said, my initial anticipation for this movie was quite high, but then the early reviews come in and I feel less enthusiastic. But I shun those away and decide to go see the movie today, and let's just say the Saw series has taken four movies to get the horror movie franchise curse started here.First off, the story is just all over the place. It feels like the movie's basing itself on a book as long as Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix with twice the text per page. Unfortunately, the movie's less-than two hour runtime can't help it carry all of the story well enough, and many parts that progress the plot feel rushed like Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (although that movie didn't have it anywhere near as bad). Another issue with all the plot-lines this movie has is that about half of them include completely new and generic characters, and it's hard to care for them when you want to know what happened to those who lived through previous installments.Now, I will say that the first half of the movie isn't so bad since it does follow one character that we've known since Saw 2. However, after the first hour the film just branches off to detail Jigsaw's back story. While the series did need to give an explanation behind Jigsaw and how everything began, it feels misplaced and when the setting returns to the present time it's really easy to feel confused as to who you should really be caring for.I'd have to say that Saw 4's strongest aspect is that it keeps you guessing throughout the entire film. There are some parts that are rather predictable, but it's always nice when a film has its audience guessing, which has been a staple of the Saw series, and this one is no different. That said, it does feel like these parts are just ways to set plot twists up, and since many of these revolve around new characters it's hard to not feel cheated.While twists and guessing has become a big staple of the Saw series, it's the traps that have made it so popular and caused many to cringe. But since this is the fourth installment in a series that has become popular for the creativity of its traps, one might suspect the traps will become dry with this one. Fortunately, the producers seemed to have recognized this and have kept the amount of traps to a minimal focus. Of course there's still some great traps that people are placed into here, although not all of them are as well-done as previous ones (more or less due to how some of those took the time to make the impact sink in, some in Saw 4 feel very brief and don't leave much of a fazing feeling).While I have said a couple good things about the movies, they don't really amount to much, especially when the second half feels completely devoid of effort or compassion. As I said earlier, there are quite a few new characters brought into the story and it really feels like the old characters we care for have become the last resort for detailing. There's nothing wrong with introducing new characters to the franchise, but when old characters are ditched like mere dirt it doesn't really make for a good impression.And let me just take this moment to say that there's one scene that I think ultimately ruined the movie for me. I won't directly spoil it, but let's just say that one of the centers of attention in Saw 3 is killed off so easily that it's impossible to not feel flat-out back-stabbed. In fact, there are actually quite a few scenes that leave a good few questions about many characters that it feels like the writer(s) and director are playing the fans for fools to buy in to the next installments. Once ending finally comes it's easy to ask just how many more of these movies there will be, and after this movie I really don't want to see another eight-plus part horror series composed of mostly crap.All told, I'd have to say that Saw 4 is definitely the worst of the Saw movies so far. While I was rooting for this series after Saw 3 (both because I thought it was a great movie and a horror series was finally good for three installments), I feel betrayed and ripped-off after some select events in this movie. The movie is aimed at avid Saw fans, but it's just as likely that those fans will leave feeling disappointed as one that hasn't enjoyed a single Saw movie yet. Approach with caution.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Messy and Absurd Story ? The Game and the Franchise Are Over</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the autopsy of John Kramer (Tobin Bell), the coroner finds a tape inside his stomach and calls Detective Hoffman (Costas Mandylor). Meanwhile, the police find Detective Kerry dead and the SWAT Commander Rigg (Lyriq Bent) is absolutely traumatized with the tortured corpse of Kerry and obsessed to save Detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) that has been missing for six months; however Hoffman asks him to take vacations and leave the case. The FBI agents Strahm (Scott Patterson) and Perez (Athena Karkanis) join Hoffman's team to investigate the legacy of Jigsaw. But Rigg is abducted and forced to participate in another sick game to save Eric's life."Saw IV" has a messy and absurd story, indicating that the franchise has really finished. The director Darren Lynn Bousman uses a style of frantic images and flashbacks with annoying noises and does not give time to the viewer to think how absurd and stupid the screenplay is. The result is a sequence of gruesome and gore scenes disclosed in an extremely fast pace that make impossible even to recall the characters of the previous movies of the franchise. "Saw" is over! My vote is three.Title (Brazil): "Jogos Mortais IV" ("Deadly Games IV")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw 4 appears to pick up exactly where saw 3 left us. With the death of the famed Jigsaw killer. However, this film is not a sequel in the direct sense and involves itself more in following the events leading up to Jigsaws death, told through flashbacks, however a confusing and somewhat-shocking twist at the end of the film changes the significance of these flashbacks.Although I can't really say what happens in this film. (As the entire SAW series is based on everything being a potential clue) I will say that the traps match, if not top those in the previous films, maybe not in ingenuity but in brutality and suffering for the test subject and that the film is an adequate addition to the SAW series. The downfall is that there are numerous storyline running at the same time and these story lines all have their own flashbacks and back stories which intertwine and get very confusing. This movie could have been longer and allowed for more explanation...but then it wouldn't be SAW, would it? Overall Saw 4 was a compelling, but confusing film and will have to be viewed many times to truly understand the many clues and story lines that interplay. All i have to say is BRING ON SAW FIVE!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I marked this as having spoilers because it might accidentally happen, don't expect anything big though ;-). Let me start by saying that the entire premise of this installment into the series is excellent. the way the film makers mis-lead the audience repeatedly even going as far as to use prior tricks again, is amazing. I saw an advanced midnight screening earlier and most of the audience consisted of college kids. the movie had our attention the entire time, leaving little to no bored groups quietly chatting under the harsh score. The film as far as plot dives into the history of our leading man giving him new life even in death. As I said the way they trick the audience into seeing something and then explaining that it is in fact something entirely different is a gigantic plus. Not being able to figure out the plot ten minutes into the film is what has made this series so successful, that and the gore both of which are plentiful in this third sequel. If you are a fan of the other films you will undoubtedly love this one as well. It shows improvement from the previous films and guides the series in a direction fitting for the obligatory sequel...next Halloween, expect part V.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...and even then, only the braindead ones, "Saw IV" does nothing to advance an already crippled franchise beyond setting up the next (and hopefully last) installment. Director Darren Lynn "Repo! The Genetic Opera" Bousman is really cementing his growing reputation for being a schlockmeister; his third helming of the "Saw" series is easily the worst so far, thanks not only to Bousman's predilection for sequences edited in a strobe light fashion to the beat of second-rate industrial metal, but also for the near-incomprehensible scripts he accepts. This one, by the goofballs who wrote "Feast" (a mildly amusing horror comedy) and will apparently be serving up a no-doubt awful remake of "The Tingler," is chocked full of characters no one cares about, an utterly absurd premise, and more plot holes and contrivances than an average audience can hope to follow, let alone the braindead one that actually planted butts in theater seats for this one.This is make-work cinema, and I really don't want to insult any of the major players in this project by actually mentioning their names; they know who they are, and why they took the paycheck. I don't hold it against them. I hold it against the unprincipled knuckledraggers who greenlighted this mess. They know who they are, too.This is one to avoid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another entry in a shockingly stupid horror franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first in a series of reviews I will do on the torture horror franchise 'Saw'. Saw IV will be the first as it is the most recent I have seen.To begin, I am appalled at the high ratings for the sequels in this franchise. I understand there are many saw fan-boys out there but the fact is, these films are cheap, tacky, look and feel like episodes of a TV show and have acting so hammy it puts Nicholas Cage to shame (oddly enough the 'bad cop' character in this episode has an uncanny resemblance to Cage himself). It has me questioning whether the horror franchises of the past (Friday, Halloween, Nightmare) degraded themselves in similar ways with all the sequels. It may be true of some of the Friday sequels (Manhatten may be the best or worst example of this), perhaps even the latter Nightmare additions (Five and final) but for some reason the look and feel of all the Saw sequels gets on my nerve.The influence of the recent flashy crime TV shows, in particular CSI is obvious in the direction of 'Darren Lynn Bousman'. There are flash-cuts, unsubtle lighting and set design all contributing to giving the film an overly MTV, cheesy teen pop feel. The fact that your pretty much watching an episode of a bad crime TV show, with more gore that has been released theatrically pisses me off. Its exploitation at its highest, exploiting the audiences stupidity to make money and probably keep funding the rest of Liongate's film endeavors. So perhaps if its letting the company fund films of more artistic merit then OK ill except the crass nature of the saw series, but I wont except high rated reviews for it.The plot is full of twists, unexplained events and coincidences that pretty much just points to lazy and rushed screen writing. Of it course its rushed when the team behind it is forced to deliver a film every year. Characters enter and exit without much information as to who they are, assuming that you've studied incredibly carefully the plots of the previous films in order to remember these bland characters or perhaps the screenwriters prefer to keep the audience in a state of constant confusion so that their ham fisted attempts at plot twists can seem far more clever then the lazy revealing of information that they really are.Special effects wise, well I've already mentioned the cheap TV feel of the film. Set design such as the over-used industrial spinning fan, with luminous green light behind it has been over-used and therefor is completely ineffective in the film. Other sets include the default busy police station (featuring a hilariously obvious good-cop/bad-cop scene with our Nicholas Cage act-alike), the default crack house operated by the corrupt fat guy in a singlet and the various rooms of torture and abandoned factories where we see the creation of the first torture machine created by Jigsaw/John (told in flash-back). Characters jump between sets with very little explanation, which adds to the rushed feel of the movie.And yes, there's the gore. The film begins with an extended autopsy scene of the corpse of Jigsaw, which is farely gruesome and a little too long so early in the film. The discovery of a tape inside the stomach of Jigsaw leads to the beginning of this films wild goose chase, with obsessive cop Rigg as the man in the middle of all the traps. Perhaps the only positive thing I can say about the film is the traps, which I guess is the very reason for the films being. The are creative, entertaining and would be shocking to those who are not long-time horror watchers. Everything on screen has been done in the Lucio Fulci films, the cannibal films, the Japanese exploitation films of before. For that reason I wasn't shocked but could still be entertained by scenes such as the battle between a man with sewn up eyes and a man with a sewn up mouth in a race against time or the flashback trap in which the man that causes the serial killer in John to emerge is subjected to a viciously inventive trap with no possible exit. I felt the gore in general was lower then Saw 3, or perhaps it was a little less sadistic, you wont find anyway twisting crucifixes or drownings in pig carcass's here.The ending is yet another twist, setting up yet another film of traps and twists, bad acting and rushed writing and lazy TV quality direction. Do we really need yet another Saw? Despite the traps being inventive and entertaining at time there's only so many times we can learn life lessons while dying in creative ways. If the series is not wrapped up within one more film, I very much hope for the sake of naive film goers that the series goes straight to video because I cant see any possible way that the series can be taken in a different direction or improve in its artistic vision. If you do feel the need to watch this film, wait till it hits the one dollar section at your local video store, its a curiosity worth nothing more then that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Major plot flow errors &amp; an overabundance of total gore.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This will probably be touted as some kind of horror masterpiece by many but it is actually a movie seriously flawed on several levels at once. The film opens with the antagonist being autopsied and then later in the film closes with a scene that takes place before the autopsy as the culmination in the series of events that happened after the autopsy. In short it is absolute cinematic trash. If that mistake isn't bad enough there is more gore in this film than in any other film I have ever seen-so it has achieved greatness-if you like a great stink. The actors are-as usual-just doing their jobs following direction-but since the people in charge of this didn't know what they were doing, having decent actors didn't help much. They should have stopped at three films-or better yet-not made them at all. Other gore orientated franchises like 'Wrong Turn' also suffer from similar issues-all gore and no plot logic. In WT the father of three 'mutants' is killed by way of being blown to little bits only to reappear in a later film installment. if they are not going to do these films right-why bother at all? Even a crappy film guarantees some kind of a profit margin based on audience expectations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the atrocities entitled Saw II and Saw III were released, I didn't think the series could possibly get any worse. I hate to tell you, it did. I'm actually ticked off at myself for watching Saw IV and I didn't even pay for it.It starts off pretty much the same as all of the other films. Jigsaw picks a victim, and the victim has to choose to save people or not. We learn more about Jigsaw in this film but I've just stopped caring. Every movie is left open ended so that the producers can make more money off the next film the next year. Thankfully, I heard they're taking the year off next year.My final complaint is about the twist. The writers of this film claimed that they had a twist that competed with the original Saw. The twist in Saw IV absolutely sucks! I can't believe they would make such a bold statement. Basically, if you're like me and you loved the first Saw but thought the next two weren't very good or average at best, then save yourself an hour and a half and don't see this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jigsaw returns to his games but as we know from Saw 3, he is dead. The opening of the movie starts with the autopsy of Jigsaw. But later they find that even that he's dead, he has planned more twists for then and his work hasn't ended.The main idea of the sequel is uncovering the true reasons why jigsaw became the man he is today. Many of the characters from Saw 2 and 3 and present in the 4th sequel which they used to build on the story and i can admit that there is a lot of suspense and mystery in this sequel.It is hard to predict what is gonna happen in the next scene but again this is what made the SAW series one of the best psychological thrillers ever made.I was disappointed by the ending, unlike the other 3 parts of saw, the element of suspense died in the last 10 minutes of the movie and i think this is where the movie will loose a lot of its rating power.However, this a movie that will be nice to watch more than one time .. i know i will and i do recommend watching this movie at home.One lesson can be learned from this sequel and that is Patience ... after u watch it you will know what i mean</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the third sequel to the gruesome horror movie Saw, where Jigsaw's deadly game continues despite his death, luring a new set of victims in his trap. FBI agents Strahm and Perez try to sift through Jigsaw's latest remains and investigate his sick legacy. However, things get complicated when SWAT Commander Rigg is abducted and forced to participate in another grisly game to save Eric Matthews' (from the previous film) life.The story uses the same elements as in the previous three films: mind-playing games, revenge, and people in despair. There is no shortage of blood, gore and graphic scenes. Like the previous movies, this sequel is very disturbing and sadistic, and it offers a bit of a plot twist.The acting was pretty good, but the rest of the movie's elements is just dark and depressing. I'm still convinced that most movie goers don't find downright sadistic and gross plot elements captivating.Grade D-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I give the Saw franchise points for consistency. More inventive traps and a further look into the life of Jigsaw further the story. Unfortunately the film still has a lack of a plot, and it is still twisting and turning in an attempt to escape the inevitable. Now we have Bent encouraged to stop wasting his life saving people. Jigsaw's plan seems to be getting more bizarre. Punishing people for trying to save others because it's a waste of his own life? It's a big jump in logic. Gore? Check. Twists? Check. It's nice to see how such events effect even the smallest characters from previous installments and to see some familiar faces in the background. It's certainly one for the fans and isn't trying to convert anyone into enjoying the series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than Saw III</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alright, I pretty much said "enough" with Saw III, it was getting just plain silly and whereas Saw and Saw II focused more on the plot, Saw III was simply disgusting situations where people are killed...Saw IV was a little better. It gives much more background into Jigsaw and what drove him insane.Spoilers below: Basically, these movies are all piling on top of each other. What we see happen in this film pretty much occurs concurrently with Saw III though I don't get why. I think sometimes that these writers get a little too clever and end up writing themselves into nonsense.Okay, the first Saw was great because nobody saw the ending coming. The second Saw was good because it completely tricked us with the time line of events. Saw III had neither of those and I guess they wanted to return to the intricate plot lines of I and II. Take for instance, how the autopsy of Jigsaw which is shown at the beginning of the film will actually be the opening for Saw V or some such nonsense.I'm just tired of how the writers simply want another paycheck so they'll intentionally write in "plotholes" or questions unanswered into the plot which they will of course explain in the next film.Don't get me wrong, it is clever but come on...Also, where did this Cop come from as the next Jigsaw?? Why??? Yes yes I know, they'll write a whole back story about this for V and VI. And why are they planning a Saw VI??? Come on. Ugh, oh well, I guess Saw is the next "Friday the Thirteenth" and Jigsaw is the next Jason. Guess what, we get to look forward to at least two more films with Jigsaw in it when he was killed in part III, haha. And this is the modern horror genre...Spoilers end: Okay, the film is entertaining...I'm not going to buy it or probably watch it again but it's worth a watch. You'll be greeted with a gruesome autopsy which is the grossest part of the film. There are some other sick parts as you might expect. But there's no more needless torture and death like in Saw III and some people actually make it out of their traps like in the first Saw films.It's worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a horror movie franchise, it is always difficult to keep a level. Or keep the tension and/or the quality of the original. Saw seems to be able to keep it up. The 4th installment (and a sort of ending to a few things, like the director ... he did Saw 2-4, Saw 5 will have a new director) can hold it's own. That doesn't mean you don't have to see the other 3 movies, before you watch this one ... "au contraire" (the opposite is the case)! The story will keep you guessing where this one is going, with a lot of time "jumping" (you'll be at different points of the Saw time line, so you have to watch carefully). That's what I liked about this. Of course you'll get another set of "machines" or quests that our main character has to go through like in the previous movies and all that mixed together make up for a good movie! (imo)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, we come back for a fourth dose of the Saw series to find that yes, John Kramer is dead. How will the series go on? This is how, Saw IV picks up right after the end of "Saw III" and we find out that Jigsaw has already entrapped more victims (before his death).We are taken back to before John Kramer went insane; he was married and had a child on the way. But when his wife loses the child, John Kramer loses his mind. We learn why he starts making people choose between life and death, because life is a terrible thing to waste."Saw V" is due for release this Halloween, so how will it go? We must watch ahead for the next chapter of John Kramer's insanity; thanking a higher power we are alive! Admittingly, this take on Saw was not as good as its predecessors, but just the same, it was weird. And unlike other horror franchises, the story is still going strong, and the fans love it. Eat your heart out Freddy Krueger (not for real).So, after all I thought and said, I gave the film an 8. Heres hoping that "Saw V" will be just as good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know, upon first view of SAW IV, I honestly thought that SAW III was better. SAW II to me was good but it just couldn't live up to SAW. I thought SAW III did that rather nicely but SAW IV pulls it off well above the other 2 sequels. Of course this time around, Jigsaw and his apprentice Amanda are dead. This movie plays with and around that element in a very fun fashion. I enjoyed the majority of the traps in this movie although a couple were to similar. I especially enjoy the way in which Donnie Wahlberg's character meets his demise. I also like they way the script builds more onto why Jigsaw became the way he did. More of what provoked him to become that way.This script doesn't have any of the original writers name on it and it doesn't need too. This movie is the second best of the SAW series, enough said!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Darren Lynn Bousmann and crew never cease to amaze me. How in the hell did they pulled it off? I have no idea. Obviously they know what they're doing, and the passion they bring to each and every Saw incarnation is evident, because every movie never looses its edge. They keep bringing fresh ideas like it was nothing. Saw fans and hardcore Saw fans will love this one, but people who haven't even seen the second, shouldn't bother. The fourth sequel in the popular horror franchise is filled with everything we have come to love about it. Horribly inventive torture contraptions, awesome gore, decent acting and above all, a great script. This movie goes even deeper into the mind of Jigsaw, and for the first time, we see his past more clearly. Special Agents Strahm (Scott Paterson) and Perez (Athena Karkanis), try to figure out jigsaw's next move and also, find a missing teammate. The script is great, but it has some flaws (as in the case with Saw 2 and 3). Agent Rigg as one of the main characters was a bad choice. We never care about him, his motives, compared to the characters in the past; he is one of those badly written characters that the actor portraying him just couldn't get the job done, like Xavier in Saw 2. Another bad choice in the script was the pace that follows after the excellent beginning. It is bland, slowly gaining speed and tension as the film progresses. And also, the death of Jigsaw, what the hell?! It was good to see Tobin in some scenes, but damn I missed him, and I'm sure I am not the only one. Now I have read reviews from fans saying that the ending is really hard to figure out or that it doesn't make sense. Read this carefully: go rent Memento or Irreversible. That is just a "clue" to follow if you didn't 'get' the ending at all. The gore was very well done. The autopsy was great, Jigsaw's first "official" trap was amazingly good and horribly painful at the same time, and the other torture devices had to be seen to be believed. The special effects crew really outdone themselves with this one. The acting was, as in the case with all the Saw movies, decent, except for the some standouts. Sadly there are only two standouts in this movie besides Tobin: Scott Paterson and Betsy Russell. Scott just oozes anger and does the character of the 'tough cop' to perfection. And Betsy as Jigsaw's ex-wife is fierce, just see the interrogation sequence and you'll know what I mean. The supporting cast was OK. Past characters return and the new ones are all right. The acting by the tortured was better than Saw 3, except that baldheaded man in the beginning, he just made me laugh. The music is the same, the editing is the same with some notable differences, the photography's the same, you get my drift.Saw 4 ends with a bang, and introduces a new Jigsaw, and leaves further questions that weren't answered: Amanda's letter, Obi and Cary Elwes. Where the hell is Cary Elwes?! Who knows, but I bet I know who does. The fabulous screen writers. With two more Saw movies being developed, one can ask "Haven't you run out of ideas yet?" Upon seeing Saw 4, I can safely say...maybe. Saw 4 gets 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw I: An en genius, well conceived film with a phenomenal twist, brilliant traps, wonderful camera-work, a good script, and amazingly done for most of the scenes being taken from the initial take (literally, very few re-shoots) Saw II: A well developed film that follows up strong on the original. It's concept and storyline were well enough designed to appropriately be a sequel, but it was different and original enough to prevent itself from being boring. It was well done, very similar to the first in camera-style, dialog, and creation, and seemed to use over twice the budget it had effectively. They did this film in less time than the first, and so had even less time for re-takes, so it turned out pretty decent. It also answers a few questions from the first.Saw III: This is where the series... was a bit different. This film, as many who have seen it will know, is based on the fact that this time around it is a different 'mastermind' behind the Jigsaw's traps. The new antagonist (Amanda) failed to see how the Jigsaw's plan and genius flowed and felt as though the goal was to simply punish and torment, therefore made the traps impossible to escape. This was a good concept for the film and lead up to a well thought out, more than decent ending, but it took away the entire idea of the traps. The cool thing about Saw I and II, beyond the story and twists, is to see how drastic the circumstances must be to escape and to see if the victims truly valued their lives enough to go through it. Being an impossible escape made this factor suffer their fate.Saw IV: This film took an entirely new approach. Not only was the camera-style, music score, and lighting all entirely different, but the storyline was now attempting to go for a more complex shape. This installment shows you the beyond of Jigsaw's death, and proves that even in death his game continues. The first portion of the film is very shotty and difficult to follow. It takes many alternate paths and branches into several, at the time, seemingly irrelevant side-stories which all have SOME sort of impact on the climax, but overall their complexity proved unnecessary and made the main story difficult to focus on. About an hour into the film is when you first witness the classic genius of the Saw franchise. A trap, featuring two closely 'tied' victims, or pinned rather, proved that the classic fashion of the Jigsaw had not faded, and continued to have the same intent as always. Beyond this point the side stories begin to fade, or merge, so that the main theme is more easily followed. It begins to answer a few questions you may have been confused about and ties up a lot of loose ends. It begins to reveal a great deal about Jigsaw's past as well as why he does what he does and what inspires him. It shows more of the old, healthier (or at least stronger) Jigsaw when he was beginning his work, and you witness a brilliant trap from his history that certainly did not disappoint (to those who've seen Saw IV... think knives).The ending is also a very classic feel that pays homage to the original title in the series. For the last ten minutes it almost feels as though you've been taken back to Saw's best of times and does not climax with disappointment. It makes the difficult to follow, sloppy, loosely timed hour from the beginning of Saw 4 and makes it worth it.If you're like me, you'll like it, but you may want to see it again now that it's finished to catch any parts you forgot (due to confusion) from the first half and make more sense of them.Overall, it was a bit sloppy, but for the budget, the time it was developed in, and the mere fact it was a FOURTH installment, it was pretty good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We've seen it before but the final product is still worth the price of admission</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is gas left in this tank. Saw IV doesn't have anything overly original in it but it still keeps you interested. I was worried when I heard that Whannel would not be involved with the production for IV, I was also worried because the end of III doesn't leave an opening for a sequel. We are reminded of this at the film's beginning when we see John Kramer's mutilated corpse on the cold coroner slab. John Kramer may be "gone" but his character is what makes this movie work. Tobin Bell gives another outstanding performance as the twisted Jigsaw, who we visit in flashbacks during IV. The back story given to him is far more satisfying than the one given to him in the graphic novel.Kramer had the world in his palm until his pregnant wife is attacked by a drug addict. She loses the baby that John had invested so much emotion in. This back story makes Jigsaw a more interesting and tragic character.Hearing Tobin Bell say "You can't save them, they have to save themselves" is all most worth the price of admission.The traps laid by Jigsaw in IV are interesting but the people put into them aren't. Their back stories lack the irony of what made these "games" really work.Our hero in IV is Rigg, the SWAT detective from II/III. He is an interesting character and the ordeal he has to go through is very well planned out, I had no trouble believing it. His flaw which makes Jigsaw choose him is actually quite clever. We develop a connection to him right away, while we had to wait a while to develop one with Eric Matthews or Jeff.Saw IV also benefits from having a larger world for our people to explore instead of taking place in a secluded area. The main flaw with the movie is that it isn't able to juggle it's stories well. Each of them are interesting but they aren't able to mesh well with each other. Saw IV has too many characters and we can't quite get a grasp on who they all are and what their significance to the story is. I would have spent more time fleshing out the FBI characters simply because the FBI's involvement shows that the Jigsaw case is more than your isolated serial killer being chased by homicide detectives.Yes Saw IV isn't overall original but is it really supposed to be? The Saw films have been great popcorn entertainment(That is if you can hold in your popcorn) I for one look forward to hearing "Hello Zepp" being played in stereo on the big screen again next Halloween.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasing sequel to a legendary franchise...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw IV should, in my opinion, rank right up there with Saw II and definitely higher than its prior, Saw III. The surprises, while great, were hampered a bit by the mind-boggling speed this movie used to run multiple story lines at the same time. This movie, at 1 hour and 48 minutes, could easily have gone 2 1/2 hours and may have been delivered more clearly. Saw 4 was more than just another Saw movie with great traps, surprises, and a very nice ending, but it was also a fan appreciation movie. I would not recommend this movie for a casual couple of movie watchers just wanting a scare. This was a very deep movie, and one should brush up on his or her Saw knowledge before attending since this movie ties in to the past more than the others.Solid addition to a legendary franchise: 8/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best SAW to-date yet.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After days, weeks, and months since the despise of John Cramer "Jigsaw" at the end of SAW 3 fans have been left wondering how could the franchise possible continue.Well the answer is money talks, and with the confirmation of SAW 5 and SAW 6 it appears as though its talking loud and long to the right people. Usually those sorts of people don't care about the quality of sequels but in this case the right people listened and the right people brought quality to a film which started out as a low budget semi-horror flick.The writing in this film is top notch, even though in places the time-line of events doesn't seem to match up 100%.So how could Jigsaw survive even though he died in the last film? The bottom line he doesn't and its all done in a series of flashbacks before and during SAW 3, which is how I suspect the other 2 will turn out. It was nice to see several other beloved characters return to the franchise namely Donnie Wahlberg as Eric Matthews, Lyriq Bents as Rigg and a brief glimpse of Shawnee Smith as Amanda.The traps are as always a joy to watch unfold as people struggle to escape them, my personal favorite being the bed trap, but clever traps alone a story does not make. The back line plot of trying to figure out who the next apprentice was, with how Jigsaw became the person was, read like a classic who-dun nit mixed with an autobiography on the man.You go into the cinema wanting to hate Jigsaw but I found myself going in and applauding the guy, questioning my own quality of life, which is what everyone should do every so often.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jigsaw is back and hes is meaner than ever. This fourth Saw movie is quite refreshed with the same formula but with a new story,its full of suspense, bloodier than ever and with some unexpected twists. Here we can see that many of the loose ends from the previous movies are all tied up, we finally know the origin of jigsaw and why he turn into a serial killer. The cast is very good, very decent acting from everyone. Tobin Bell was again awesome as John Kramer a.k.a Jigsaw, Lyric Bent's role as agent Rigg was great, his performance really convince me. Mark Wahlberg's special appearance was good and important for the story. The makeup and the special effects were very good. To conclude, this movie will make you stay on the edge of your seat for an hour and a half, for those who don't support gore movies, its not recommendable to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw What?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More like Saw 3.5, as this film takes places simultaneously with the previous installment. If you ever wondered why no one came to help any of the characters in Saw 3 then Saw 4 will answer your questions. Sadly, the characters are still all very stupid, despite their supposed training, and do not think logically to get out of their situation.SWAT commander Rigg is thrown into a new game by Jiggy in which he has to help some people and hurt others. As he runs all over the unamed city the FBI pick up the pieces of Jiggy's life and slowly begin to unravel his master plan.It's a clever story, but, once more, it is undone by horrendous editing, an idiotic sound design, and cheap, filtered photography full of quick fixes in post production. I'm not kidding, there are scenes where you can tell that the film was shot too darkly and they've lightened an area of the picture to make it more visible, thus turning black actor Lyriq Bent's face a shade of stupid purple. It's no mystery why this film won no technical Oscars. It looks like an angry child's nightmare. This series would look great if shot like a late 70s/early 80s exploitation film (which it essentially is). The post-modern fakery does not suit it at all.To it's credit, it does pack in a LOT into the 91-minute running time, but it comes at the expense of coherence. What happened to the scalped hooker? Who is the the blinded guy in the mausoleum? Why doesn't Art just barricade the door and save Donnie Wahlberg's long suffering detective? Not one of the victims in these movies have learned from their experiences. Jigsaw is not an effective teacher. Either that or he should concentrate on choosing better victims. Or better movies. Or at the very least a better crew.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't like Saw IV at all. It was probably one of the biggest disappointments I have seen in a long time. Considering I really liked the other films in the series, Saw IV blew. If you have seen it then you know what I mean. It was by far the worst in the series and after this film, I had it with the Saw films. I was so excited to see this film and it was a disaster. I appreciated the first three films because they had brilliance. But Saw IV was high on violence but low on brilliance. The twist in Saw IV is a disappointment because if you watched Saw III closely then you knew who was taking Jigsaw's place. Saw IV is a terrible film that disappoints if you're a hardcore Saw fan. If you love blood and guts and other disgusting things, then I highly recommend this film to you. Because that is all Saw IV is. I have to warn people who want to see this if they haven't already. If you see this film, then I am pretty sure that you won't want to watch any of the other films. Because I sure as hell know I don't. The other films were good, but Saw IV is not.

		<shortDescription>It's just crap to make money</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved the first Saw movie. I adored the idea, the philosophy in it. It was so new and so thrilling. And the ending was the most unexpected possible, leaving me with my jaw dropped to the floor, shaking and thinking how amazing this creation is.The second Saw movie was half bad. It had some good psychology moments in it that I liked. It was still watchable, with a not bad ending, but it already wasn't as good as the first one.The third was just disgusting. It was only worth watching because it contained some explanations of the previous one. And I remember thinking when it ended "If they make another one... It's just going to be such a crap." And guess what, it is! I only watched this out of curiosity, because I had no idea what they could make of it any more. I knew if they make this it will be just dragged to the title, but totally out of the whole Saw idea that came in the first one. I was right. They're just using the title to make money out of it, because it became popular. But it lost all the charm. It's empty, shallow, primitive and oh so predictable. It didn't even have a proper continuity in itself, in the middle of the movie I got completely lost who is who and who is where and why. And it's even more disgusting than the third one, I spent half of it looking away from the screen. Not because I was scared, because I felt sick! And the plot was so awfully designed that it made me wonder if the creators themselves haven't got lost in their story.Sadly, if the first movie is genius, the sequels are usually just making of money and not worth to get the title of the first one. Like someone else here said, half of the thrill in the first movie was that it all was happening in a single room. It was all in those 4 walls. In the first movie I fell in love with the genius mastermind of the main character John aka Jigsaw (but he got the nickname in the second movie, right?). I still adore the first movie as one of my favorites. But now I'm only disappointed and sick of the thought how people take the genius titles just to make more money and spoil them completely.</fullReview>

This time they seem to have gone for gruesomeness rather than any interesting situations or plots.The characters weren't too smart, either. For example, two of the traps involved some gears turning. All the guys trying to stop it had to do was insert something into the gears to jam it up, things they had in hand would work fine.

		<fullReview>I'm usually not the kind of person that tries to summarize a movie in a couple of words, but this one really disappointed me. SAW really kept many people interested. The first part was great. I loved the idea, and the way it followed through.With the time, SAW movies get uninteresting. Alright, it's kinda fun to watch new ways of how one could take a body apart, but that just doesn't do it. The twist, that should be fundamental, and hopefully surprising and shocking just happens less and less, the larger the numbers after the tile "SAW" get. And in this movie, the plot reaches a new low point. The story tries to be confusing to make up for the not apparent mystery. By trying to get people to think about things, that in the end have nothing to do with the outcome, it seems to me like the writers were really in a hurry to write some crap in time to make this movie happen at Halloween. The ending is the most disappointing of any SAW movie so far. The twist is simply boring, and predictable. The movie doesn't ever build up any suspense, no dynamics. After every scene in which some blood flows, the movie lets itself plunge into the same hole it just came from.I'm sorry, I am somewhat of a SAW fan, but this one is hopefully not the creative peak the writers are trying to reach, when writing the next one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After an opening graphic autopsy of Jigsaw the film settles down into the usual game of nasty traps so that people will finally feel alive, as Jigsaw has left some messages from beyond the grave. Technically a better film than the previous two this film suffers from total illogic and the damning flaw (as have all but the first film) of the impossibility of making and setting up these elaborate traps in such short period of time. yes the traps are cool, but lets face it, they really are just S&amp;M porn pushed to the limit while everyone keeps their clothes on.While I'm all for what ever floats your boat I have to wonder what this says about out society when the orgasm of the actors in real porn which might involve a loving relationship is restricted and locked away, while films like Saw 4 where heads are squashed in anger and hatred between two huge blocks with a huge eruption of blood and brain matter, is readily available to anyone pretty much at any age simply because its not deemed adult.

		<shortDescription>"Saw" plus "IV"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's gotten to the point in the "Saw" series of serial killer/torture films that we can always expect a new one after the last concluded. It's also gotten to the point that while there is a very perverse sense of genius working behind the scenes, it is clear that we have a new horror franchise on the loose, and unlike the films of Freddy, Jason and Michael, it doesn't show any signs of running out of steam any time soon.The latest sequel in the "Saw" series, "Saw IV," begins right where "Saw III" (2006) never left off, which featured the demise of the Jigsaw Killer (Tobin Bell), a serial killer who was not a serial killer in the usual sense of the word. Jigsaw is unique amongst movie slashers in that he did not technically murder his victims; they did that themselves. Jigsaw often set up elaborate tricks &amp; traps/torture devices that were designed to teach his victims the meaning of their own existence and if they died, it meant they didn't value their lives; being able to escape with their lives intact was its own reward. They may have been horribly disfigured or mutilated if they survived, but at least they were alive.When Jigsaw met his demise at the hands of distraught father Jeff (Angus McFayden) in the previous film, we first see Jigsaw in "Saw IV" being given an autopsy, and the medical examiner discovers a tape he had hidden in his stomach, which details that someone new has been selected to carry on his "work," and the possible locations of two previous Jigsaw victims - Kerry (Dina Meyer) and Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg). In this new chapter of tricks &amp; traps, S.W.A.T. officer Rigg (Lyriq Bent) has 90 minutes to save the lives of Eric Matthews and an F.B.I. man named Hoffman (Costas Mandylor).Meanwhile, Agent Strahm (Scott Patterson) and Agent Perez (Athena Karkanis) are hard at work grilling Jigsaw's former wife Jill (Betsy Russell) because it's clear to them that Jigsaw was not working alone, even while bedridden and dying of cancer with his protégé Amanda (Shawnee Smith) to carry on his work. So is there a third Jigsaw out there?James Wan directed "Saw" back in 2004, which introduced the all-new torture movie concept. He has been succeeded in each sequel by director Darren Lynn Bousman. While the content of the story of each sequel has gone down, the gore factor has gone up extremely (but succeeds in being hideously inventive, and subtly sadomasochistic). The production values, mood, and writing also remain top-notch. When I first heard the rumors that were later confirmed when I learned that "Saw IV" was being made, I didn't think it was possible to make yet another movie, especially after the way the third movie ended, and the departure of "Saw" co-creator Leigh Whannell (who also played victim Adam in the first film) didn't help matters much. Since writers Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunston are filling in for Whannell, this film's story is as twisted and convoluted as one of Jigsaw's traps. The narrative and tricks &amp; traps is strong, but ironically it's also its biggest weakness, since the plot just seems to be too smart for its own good, and apparent gaps in the storytelling seem to hurt it when trying to figure out the confusing bits.In the end, however, I guess such criticisms are forgivable because the movie succeeds in keeping you on the edge of your seat during its running time. Despite any drawbacks, "Saw IV" remains yet another strong and successful entry in a franchise that looks like it's just going to continue on for years to come, which is both good and bad. The good is that the writing is sure to remain thoughtful and convincing and full of neat little twists. The bad thing is, those twists can only go only so far, and pretty soon you can bet that they'll start running out of sick and ingenious ways to torture/murder people. That's what happens when we fall for a serial killer who always has the last laugh.8/10</fullReview>

I've read some comments that have said about the film "the same thing that all previous movies". What do you expect from a movie that you know the way how the plot is? . Definitely has no sense to say something like that. Bloody games of course!.The film has some terrifying scenes in which you'd prefer not to see. I'm not sure if it is more Bloodthirsty than the other three works, but I think it is. With this movie we knew two different things, about Jigsaw's life before he became a serial killer, in other words, the beginning of the story and who will continue with his legacy.

		<fullReview>I saw it on midnight last Thursday with a friend which, to my surprise, it said on the top that it was the Saw Marathon and it started at 6, and the end credits to Saw III were rolling when we got in there, I guess they were playing all 4 Saw movies that night in chronilogical order. Damn, I wish I would've known, then I would've came to see the first 3, too, even though I already have all of them on DVD (that's how big of a Saw fan I am). Still, Saw IV was really good, but I'm here to warn you right now: just like the 3rd, if you're in the least bit squeamish, DO NOT SEE SAW IV! I can't stress that enough. This one's even MORE disgusting than the 3rd, believe it or not, it seems each new Saw that comes out is more disgusting than the last, watch as they find a way to top the 4th in disgustingness with the next movie (it's not gonna end just there, like Jigsaw said in the previews, it will continue, LOL). But still, it was really good, quite possibly the best of the 4, and I'm a big fan of this series. This one may have had the best traps of the 4, and the backstories behind each one and whatnot I thought was done superbly, and a nice twist at the end (hint: it's not what you may think). All-in-all, definitely go see it, if you're into gross-out horror flicks, but be warned about it's gross content, it was, at times, too much for even me to handle, I even had to turn my eyes away from the screen during certain parts of it (literally, it was that gross).Overall, I give it 4.5 */5, this was about as close to perfection as it's genre allows.</fullReview>

If you are looking for a vastly entertaining psychological thriller that will bewilder you and keep you on edge, then this is a movie you simply must see.

Saw 4 is so well done you can't even chew on it for days in the hopes that it might grow on you. The more you chew the more you realise that the director was amateure, the producer was a dick, the actors were less than worthy of daytime television, and the storyline was of the caliber that usually ends up on Oprah or Judge Judy. Like imagine Obama had an affair with Clinton...that bad.

It was CLEARY MADE, that she MURDERED HIM in III....if u ask me...SaW IV is not worth money at all.Not worth even seeing if you loved the first three.And the sad part is there's going to be 7.One more with Tobin Bell (long live Tobin as JigSaW).So what the hell point?.This movie is a money scam...it will only leave u asking why? Why would lions gate ever make this? Why would they allow it? Its pointless...LGF needs to smarten up and stop making the SaWs now.Its past its prime with JigSaW dead.So why do we need more? Why is the real question!?! Oh yea before i forget about the traps...the traps were AWFUL!! All of them were bad especially the main stories one about Rigg trying to save Mathews...Screw SaW IV and just watch the originals by Leigh Whannell.There the only good ones.SaW IV's Official Rating By me would be lower then 1.So don't bother seeing it...it will only kill SaW for you.</fullReview>

I understand that Saw IV runs at the same time as Saw III but I'm still confused as to why Agent Strahm ends up being locked in the room from III with John when John had already been autopsied and had the tape extracted from his stomach? The film goes back and forth to John's early days to get an understanding of what made him what he is but this unsequential time line adds to its complexity.Go and see this great installation in the series, but I promise, you'll need to revisit the cinema to watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unrelentingly Awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw IV takes the already hopelessly bad Saw series and manages to go one step further. This time it hits rock bottom and never looks back. There is nothing original in this movie, as much of it is recycled from past Saws. The plot is yet again exactly the same, to put some unsuspecting person through a series of tests. The course of action he will take is completely predictable not to mention rather boring.There are also plenty of sub plots and flash backs, which are supposed to fit in and make sense to this whole master plan. Most of the plot didn't make much sense and what did make sense was bad to say the least. There was way too much of an attempt to make the past Saws tie in with this, and it really shows as the script goes no where.Most of this film being made seems like an excuse to have more of those Jigsaw traps. They are obviously present again and are once again way over the top and elaborate. There are so many flaws with the traps alone such as the design, set up, and execution. Most of them would never get past the idea of them, but impossibility is no match for Jigsaw or his sidekicks, apparently he can make anything happen. It's just not fun to sit through any of the traps, let alone the entire movie, when there is absolutely no payoff for the viewer. And as always, Jigsaw's plan goes off without a hitch. Not once does something out of the ordinary happen where something malfunctions or a character takes a different course of action. Apparently Jigsaw has thought of everything and no one can ever get out of anything he puts you in. Throughout this series there has been plenty of times where someone could have done more than nothing to interrupt this plan or get help. But then again I guess this movie couldn't be made if anyone had any common sense.There is nothing to like about Saw IV. Everything from start to the unsatisfying finish was pure garbage. Even the sound at some points was horrible with this over the top cracking sound. Finally, there is the twist at the end which seals the deal on how bad this movie really is. The plot, the traps, the setting, the characters, and the terrible writing all seem so unrealistic and careless of anyone watching this. If it had any inclination of making sense they would have cut out the flash backs and stop trying to make "everything" lead up to the events in Saw 4. But it's all supposed to be okay, because according to Jigsaw these people will learn to appreciate life after going through it. By the time it's over you won't care, any maybe not even know, who put who up to what and why. There was once again an obvious attempt to surprise you just as the first Saw may have with it's revelation, but fails due to it's lack of shock and significance.In the end you take a terrible concept and somehow make it worse. Saw IV plunges below the bottom of the barrel and is possibly the worst of the 900+ films I've watched. This makes The Hitcher and Black Christmas look like they're not the worst. It almost makes Leprechaun 3 look average. It really creates it's own level atrociousness. I hated every second of Saw IV. The bottom line here is only watch Saw IV if you are interested in adding another 1 rating to your total. Get some extra sleep instead of subjecting yourself to this worst movie of 2007. Zero stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing! Nearly as good as the first movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I watched "Saw," I was horrified beyond belief, yet as soon as the credits rolled I wanted to watch it again and again and again.Saw II was just as amazing, but I thought the traps were a little dull, probably because I spoiled myself watching the traps on YouTube. =/ Saw III was very good, but nowhere as near as great as I, II, or IV.Saw IV was amazing. It was a thriller that had me racing the entire time. However, just like how Saw II and Saw III failed to deliver the true horror the first movie delivered, Saw IV didn't have me cowered into a little ball in my seat. Despite the fact that I was more thrilled than scared, I still found the movie extremely scary. The number of jumpers was kept to a minimum, and, as with the previous movies, you could always tell when a jumper was going to happen. The only thing that made me jump out of my skin was when my old girlfriend showed up at the theater.The traps were phenomenal! The traps were by far the best out of all the movies! Some of the traps were EXTREMELY gory. I wondered what they had cut out to merit it an R rating! Even though the traps were extremely gory, they weren't a mindless killing spree and they were very interesting.The acting was superb! Tobin Bell (John Kramer AKA Jigsaw) stole the show yet again, followed by Scott Patterson (Strahm), and then Lyriq Bent (Rigg). All of the emotions of all of the characters seemed genuine and I did not notice a single sentence that was poorly acted.The only minor drawbacks to this film were- a)Several of the things that we were told would be revealed were not! b)The ending seems like it sucks until you think about it, but the writers wanted us to think, so I'm not sure if I should put this as a drawback.Overall, this movie was amazing, and you should definitely see it if you've seen the first three.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The trap in Saw IV is the movie itself!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Saw movies always feature people stuck in terrible trap in which to survive, they must go through excruciating torture. The latest installment in the series, Saw IV, is one of these traps itself, in which you will either suffer through 95 minutes of excruciating torture or commit suicide before the end credits come up.The first Saw was an accomplished horror movie. It was new and interesting, as well as very unsettling. Most of the film was spent in a single room and it focused more on suspense, rather than gore. As new installments came to theaters, there was a gradual decline of suspense and the focus was put more on gore and torture. By the time Saw III rolled around, the entire movie was basically disturbing torture, but there were at least a few scenes that attempted to be frightening.Now that Saw IV is out, you can tell that they're really dragging this series out as far as it will go. This installment has two separate story lines, one in which a police officer is put through a series of tests to save his friend. Although Saw IV had a new writing team, the story is almost identical to the one in Saw III, which wasn't a good story to begin with. The movie is set up to showcase as much gore and torture as possible, which means the main character's trap is that he has to try and free other people from traps, and more often than not, they die excruciatingly painful deaths. The storyline isn't scary and there isn't even an attempt to be. The director, Darren Lynn Bousman, just tries to cram as much torture into the film as he can. This is exactly the same type of storyline we got in the third Saw. It sucked in the third one too, but at least it was original. The only difference between the story lines is that in Saw III we got a lady's rib cage being torn open, and in Saw IV it's a lady's scalp being torn off.Not only is the whole movie pointless, it's poorly written too. This has to be the first Saw movie where I'm almost positive I could've escaped from at least two of the traps easily. They are so poorly designed. It's a miracle at least half the characters die in them, as they rely solely on unlikely coincidences and chance. In the first Saw, the characters tried many different attempts at escaping and all angles were covered. In this one, everything just falls into place perfectly and the victims in the traps never do the "smart" thing. It doesn't even make sense. We never learn why the hell the main character couldn't just call the police and have them come help him work his way through the traps, as there is nothing stopping him (yes, in Saw IV, the main character actually has the option to not partake in the trap at all if he wanted).The second storyline is told through flashbacks and attempts to explain why Jigsaw, the old man creating these gruesome devices, got into the business of killing people. This new storyline provides absolutely nothing interesting or any insight into why he became what he is. The audience was already given enough of an explanation for his motives in the previous three films. Saw IV just adds a new, unnecessary motive, involving Jigsaw and his ex-wife. Not only is it pointless, it's poorly done too. Tobin Bell wasn't a recognized actor before the Saw series and now I know why. He has no acting ability and can't convey any emotion. The flashbacks are supposed to show his progression from a regular guy into a crazy psycho, but he acts exactly the same throughout the entire storyline. Even at a pivotal moment, when something terrible happens to him that is supposed to change him, we get shots of him standing there with the same damn expression on his face.A key part of the Saw movies is the twist ending, but they aren't even trying anymore. It's as if they just threw in the first thing that came to mind. The twist comes out of nowhere and further insults the audience by showing flashbacks to different points throughout the course of the movie, as if they are supposed to point in any way to the nonsensical twist. There are so many plot holes in the last 10 minutes, including the fact that the characters all do random, idiotic things that nobody on this planet would ever do in the given situation, as well as a death straight out of Final Destination (which I guess could happen, but it's just cheesy).When it comes down to it, if you liked Saw III, there's an inkling of a possibility that you may enjoy Saw IV. They both lack suspense, a good plot, and good writing, but at least Saw III was original. If you're looking for a good horror movie, I suggest you go see 30 Days of Night. I'm not going to debate whether or not 30 Days was a good horror film in a review for Saw IV, but it at least attempted to be good. Saw IV doesn't even try. It just tries to show off tons of gore and adds a twist at the end, and hopes the fans will eat it up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie we didn't need.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Saw III ended, we all thought it was over. Jigsaw's dead, Amanda's dead, Lynn's head exploded and Jeff was left in the room to rot.What an conclusive trilogy!Then Saw IV was announced and I said "Oh god why?". Saw IV was a pointless cash grab, an awful stain to the series, useless and pathetic. The story consist's of Officer Rigg, who was only a minor character we never cared about in II and III. He is being tested because he... Runs through doors.He also can't forget about saving everyone and won't give up trying to find Detective Matthews. So he is tested and has to save Matthews, Detective Hoffman and some guy Jigsaw met. There is also a second plot where Jill (Jigsaw's wife) is being interrogated by a hot head called Peter Strahm and we get to learn Jigsaw's origins, which is the only part of the movie I enjoyed.Overall the trap's sucked, the story was pointless and it was an obvious cash grab. However Tobin Bell will forever be a great and entertaining actor.So I'm giving the movie 2/10 jigsaw autopsies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I just Saw yet another bore filled with gore and nothing more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw IV is all about torturing and killing people in the most sadistic way possible. That's all it is. Just loads of gore. Jigsaw may be dead, but his legacy continues. Jigsaw continues to appear in a lot of flashbacks which completely slow the film down, yet they are the best part of it thanks to Tobin Bell's magnetic screen presence. Meanwhile, yet another unfortunate person is being put through a brutal test so that he can overcome his flaws and appreciate life. What is his crime? Being a bit impatient and being obsessed with saving his friend. That's it?! That is no justification to put someone through the wringer like this at all. That sums up the slippery logic of S4. Nothing really makes sense, it's just disturbing instead of scary and this is entirely lacking in the twists and interesting themes which made the original a hit. There is still a twist ending, but by the time you've finally reached the end of a deeply tedious series of bland traps which drowns both its unfortunate (And likable) protagonist and it's possibly even more unfortunate audience in endless mountains of fake blood, it's difficult to truly care. This starts off with a pointless, gruesome and not even very well-made scene showing Jigsaw's autopsy. That opening sums up the entire movie. If this is Jigsaw's legacy, than I feel very sorry for him.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pointless continuation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is going to be the shortest review I've written for a Saw film, as this is the one with the least merit on every level...until 3-D. Not only does this fail utterly as a stand alone movie, but it also fails to advance the Saw series as a whole. The only meaningful thing to happen in this movie, apart from some Jigsaw flashbacks and the introduction of his ex-wife Jill (Betsy Russell) that could frankly have been used in any of the next three films, is that we learn Detective Mark Hoffman was in cahoots with Jigsaw and is actually going to take over his work as the Jigsaw killer and, as we're told at the end of the film by a tape retrieved from Jigsaw's stomach "his test will come.". We also see Jeff from the previous film get shot. Matthews finally dies (one of the best deaths of the series) and Jeff's daughter is saved by Hoffman. What to say about this film? It happens simultaneously with the third film, a cop out in and of itself as one of the main reasons I saw this movie was to find out what direction they would take the series in after Jigsaw's death. There's a new character, Rigg, who is being tested to be put in situations and not intervene. The film kind of hints that Jigsaw is trying to convert Rigg to his cause, leaving messages like "See what I see" and "Hear what I hear. Either that or simply make it look like Rigg is in cahoots with Jigsaw. There's an FBI Agent Strahm (Scott Patterson), who was the late detective Kerry's contact, who buys into the possibility that Rigg is either being tested or in on it. He's accompanied by Agent Perez (Athena Karkanis), who would go on to become important in later films in the series. And did I mention Rigg has been obsessed with saving people since Matthews disappeared, kind of like Kerry suffering from depression in part III? So basically, the Rigg story would have worked better if they hadn't killed off Kerry in Part 3 and just put her in the role in this film. A character we had seen in multiple movies in the series and was just thrown away in the opening 20 minutes of Part 3 with no build-up. This certainly would have made the film more satisfying, but I'm not convinced it would have saved it. More successful are the flashbacks of Jigsaw's origins, but like I said, these could have come in any of the films of the series, and this will be a continuing problem as the series progresses. Trying to add interest by introducing new background information on Jigsaw. Ultimately, the characters we're seeing caught in his traps and acting out the story in front of us is where the interest should come from, not in adding increasingly convoluted information to the backstory of characters whose story has already been told.Saw 4 is a lazy retread of a bunch of stuff we've already seen in the series, It puts off the inevitable problem of explaining what happens after jigsaw dies by happening while he's still alive. Worst of all, it fails to be a satisfying experience in its own right. The worst in the series so far, but it wouldn't take long for company to arrive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw 4 (2007): Dir: Darren Lynn Bousman / Cast: Tobin Bell, Scott Paterson, Lyrig Bent, Betsy Russell, Costas Mandylor: More bodies being mutilated in all sorts of methods. Jigsaw is dead but a tape is found in his body and played thus leading to a series of events to find two missing detectives. Detective Rigg follows the clues that lead to traps set to punish those whom have committed criminal acts against innocent people. Structure is detailed but violence is graphic. Director Darren Lynn Bousman is skillful but he needs to grow beyond the Saw franchise, which he has been part of since the first two sequels. Tobin Bell is seen in flashbacks as the cancer ridden Jigsaw. As the film opens, he is dead but we are given his relationship with the Betsy Russell character. Scott Patterson plays a detective who targets Russell for questions before learning where the traps are rigged. Lyrig Bent plays another detective who is the latest victim tested with gruesome traps that will advance himself and give explicit justice to criminals who have gotten away until now. Betsy Russell plays the stunning vixen who is revealed to be a target. She tells of her miscarriage and destroyed marriage before her relationship to Jigsaw. Costas Mandylor plays the detective listening to a tape and being tested. The ending rots like its victims in its disgusting display that opens for another sequel. Score: 5 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has a decent backstory on jigsaw, cool camera transition scenes, dims in comparison to jigsaw as the killer though. Jigsaw is what made this film series and now he is dead and can't help thinking you still want him to be alive. The films main character is Daniel Rigg a guy who wants to go around setting people up in traps the help Eric in his own game of jigsaws helper. The movie gives no reason why in the world he would do this other than he is obsessed with helping people and wanting to save them. Then why is he putting them in traps to save someone else? Why does he care about eric matthews so much? The movie doesn't say we are just supposed to not think I guess and just go along with it. The lawyer of jigsaws is part of his game as well and shows backstory on why jigsaw got so mad and became who he was after his pregnant wife was hurt by a druggie trying to get drugs from her clinic that she runs and bumped into her with the door and caused a miscarriage. He sets the guy in the trap (has to push his head through some knives) and he gets through it and comes after jigsaw and falls into a barbed wire cage. The guy would have to be a complete moron to fall for that. He just runs past john and jumps right in it. Yea right. I also kept thinking cant they have another kid? He tries to get victims to forgive others but he doesn't seem very forgiving himself. Seems like the saw franchise suffers what most other horror franchises do as well. It is revealed that one of the FBI agents that was part of the game is actually the new jigsaw and everyone else dies. They put dumb characters with no common sense and horrible lack of judgement into their films. It shows a lack of creativity and laziness when you do this and honestly is a pet peeve of mine but it's something that I have to ignore when I watch some horror movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat enjoyable if highly problematic effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finding one of the newest crime scenes, an FBI profiler tries to track down the truth about the murders while attempting to make sure a fellow officer caught in another game doesn't become another victim of Jigsaw's legacy.While this one certainly had its moments, this one ended up being quite a troubling effort as well. What really stands out here is that the gore, as usual, saves this one with a multitude of brutal, bloody scenes here that are rather entertaining and fun. Starting with the opening autopsy of graphically removing many of the interior organs from his corpse and cutting the body open to reveal the contents of the new game, the first game to be played here where the two disfigured and chained figures are playing a demented version of tug-of-war that gets very messy as it goes along and the later scenes of the traps from the previous games all give this one some rather gory times though it's the main game featured here that gives this the most gruesome moments. The apartment encounter and the motel sequence are fine, while the biggest one here is the game at the school where the previous victims are found and really give this some solid and twisted moments here. While the final game results in some fine moments, just about everything else about this one serves it up even lower. The biggest flaw here is the continuous going's back to the past three films to try to make sure that whatever piles onto it makes sense. This was attempted previously in the last installment which really made no sense there and continues on here by instead making it clear those should be watched instead while offering the same problem as the previous one did in halting the traps to clear-up something from another film entirely. This also ties into another crippling factor here that there's so many subplots here that's just not that interesting at all, ranging from the relationship between the two and how he turned into a killer which is just annoying and not at all scary, the traps aren't confined like they used to be as leaving his handiwork out in the open in order for others to see and follow him is almost as if they just decided to throw them in there in order to stay connected to the series since they've all had them so this one should've as well which makes no sense if he's such a masterful serial killer while dealing with the current lesson, and there's so much to keep track of it's just not that worthwhile. The last problem here is that the lessons are stupid based on his own dubious morality that frankly doesn't seem all that likely to make an impact on someone at all based on how they're utilized here which is carried over from the others. These all help bring this one down from what it could've been.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The fourth entry in this extremely visceral series continues to dish out the same kind of stomach turning moments and intense moments that fans came to expect. It works overtime to tie in with previous films and as a result may not stand up to a lot of scrutiny. The material is still too grim and rough to be able to suit a lot of tastes, but some viewers will find it compelling in its own way. The pacing is better here than in the previous entry, resulting in approximately an hour and a half of lurid thrills.Jigsaw may be dead, but he was a very busy boy while still alive. He's found another protégé, who's set up many more elaborate and sadistic torture devices and begun to put a new bunch of protagonists through their paces, chief among SWAT team officer Daniel Rigg (Lyriq Bent), whose desire to save the lives of others often interferes with his common sense. A pair of FBI agents, Strahm and Perez (Scott Gordon-Patterson and Athena Karkanis) are also on the trail. More tapes, more puppets, and more grisly demises are in store as the clock is ticking until two associates of Rigg will be butchered.Be prepared for a lot of flashbacks as writers Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan go about tying all the movies together. Giving this sequel something of a shot in the arm is the presence of iconic 80s hottie Betsy Russell ("Private School", "Tomboy", "Avenging Angel", etc.) in a solid comeback performance as Jigsaws' ex-wife Jill. (One thing we learn here does provide Jigsaw with an undeniable motivation.) A deeply committed cast and explosions of gore are assets; director Darren Lynn Bousman do their best to give their fans what they believe they want. The ending, naturally, sets up the next adventure to come.Considering these movies were rushed into and through production so that Lionsgate could release a new one each Halloween season, they came off fairly well up to this point.Seven out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw IV - Decent enough to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My guess is that three is a trilogy and any more then three, a film series can be considered a franchise. So with that, the "SAW" franchise continued with "Saw IV" another film about the serial killer Jigsaw and his maniacal way of sending people to their deaths.The first film was arguably one of the freshest most original horror films to come out in years. It had a certain style and feeling that grabbed your attention and wouldn't let go. You knew what you were watching was gross yet you couldn't turn away. "Saw II" continued that feeling a bit and spun the concept in a new direction and after all was said, it was almost as good as the original. "Saw III" seemed to be the end of the trilogy. The idea was no longer original. We saw Jigsaw die. Honestly, the film itself was not too entertaining. Sure, the contraptions used were fun to watch, but otherwise, "Saw III" had me leaving with a stale taste in my mouth.Thus came another Halloween and with it another annual "Saw" film, this time, "Saw IV." How could this be with Jigsaw dead? The film begins with Jigsaw's autopsy which is one of the most gruesome parts of the film. During the autopsy, a cassette is found in the stomach of Jigsaw. When played, it is the voice of Jigsaw speaking to a homicide detective. Jigsaw proclaims that the games have only just begun and so does our story.The film takes place 6 months after "Saw II." Officer Rigg, a S.W.A.T. team member has lost two friends, Det. Matthews (Donnie Walberg) and Det Kerry. His belief that Matthews is still alive has driven him away from his wife. Thus comes Riggs obstacle. Riggs finds out that Matthews is still alive and he has 90 minutes to save them. Along the way he will have to face obstacles and make choices to save a person or to let them save themselves.The film plays like "Saw III" in that it is one man walking through obstacles, coming across people. However, instead of the mindless violent traps set in the third film, Riggs is forced to be a trial and jury himself. He has his options, can he resist his temptation to be everyones savior and let people make their own life saving choices, or does he risk his friends life and save people himself. These moral questions is what makes "Saw IV" a decent film. There is a new message to be told. It spins the franchise in a new direction yet brings it back to some of the ideas of the original film. And there are new twists throughout the film that does leave you guessing.We also get an even more in-depth look of who Jigsaw really is and why he became who he is. The mystery behind this man is always unraveling in each film.Where this film goes wrong is that it has an unbelievable ticking clock. It's story is to be told in 90 minutes, and there is an actual countdown but a lot of the things going on throughout this film would need more time then 90 minutes. It took me out of the film questioning if all of this can really happen in 90 minutes. Of course in film we have to suspend disbelief but how much can we suspend before we say ridiculous.This and this alone has me giving "Saw IV" a less then favorable review. Reason being, the moment I am taking out of a film questioning it's approach, you have lost me. I am no longer following the story but following the believability of the story.All in all, it is a watchable film with all the aspects of a horror film can deliver. It is not the best in the series but not the worst either.</fullReview>

At the end of the movie, Jigsaw is locked up in the room with Jeff as he was in the end of Saw III. How is it possible that FBI agents/surgeons found Jigsaw's body and conducted an autopsy in the beginning of the movie without running into Jeff and the building where Jigsaw conducts his test for his victims. I'm assuming that if they found Jigsaw in the beginning of the movie then FBI agents would investigate the whole area of the building. If they investigated the whole building then they would find the other victims of Jigsaw's game. It also seems that Jeff's test in Saw III happened at the same time as the tests in Saw IV, again, if everything was happening simultaneously, how can Jigsaw be at two places at once? Once in the autopsy room, and the other in the locked room with Jeff.Maybe I'm missing some facts here, but I'm just really curious. If you guys figure out the answer to this huge mistake, please tell. Otherwise, this movie would have been great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Going further into the franchise they had to decide what was the most important thing. Going on with the torturing devices made by Jigsaw or going deeper into the story. I guess I won't spoil anything by saying that Jigsaw is death. You just have to see the opening before the credits how they investigating the corps of Jigsaw, excellent shot and done. And if that wasn't enough they gave us instant torturing afterwards. But they have to give us a story after the credits.The story itself goes a bit away from the previous parts on the part of Jigsaw devices. We go deeper into the story of Jigsaw as John Kramer. We see how he became what he is, what went wrong with his wife that made him become a killer. But we also go further into the investigations towards Jigsaw. And things go wrong with the investigations. Rigg is getting involved into the deadly game without knowing what the consequences are. Detective Hoffman looses some of his detectives but others are wandering who Hoffman really is. The game continues.Saw 4 was made in the bloom of torture porn and still delivers on every part. The gore is still intact and the end is again some kind of revealing you couldn't see coming. The opening sequence really made the movie for me. It do has a lot of flash backs but still I advise to watch the franchise in a row to understand it all. Gore 5/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 4/5 Comedy 0/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still going good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw 4 is another great installment for the Jigsaw killer series. Surprisingly still going good, even good without Jigsaw. I still believe that Saw 2 is the best in the series, so far. I have only seen Saw 1-5. I will see 6 and 7 very soon. Saw 5, in my opinion, is where the Saw series starts to go downhill. Others say that Saw 6 is the best since Saw 2. That makes me so happy!! I always expect more and more blood, because every sequel gets more violent and gory. Be warned because the beginning is extremely gruesome and gory. Leigh Whannel is the creator of the amazing Saw movies. Tobin Bell outdoes his suspenseful tone in his voice as he instructs his victims how to get out of the traps. I get chills every time that he says, "Live or die. Make your choice. Let game begin". I am so far a huge Jigsaw fan! This is a great movie to watch on a Friday or Saturday night. Saw 5 is definitely the worst in the series, but still good. Every weekend, I always a Friday Night Fright. This was a very good choice. I highly recommend people to see this movie. "Make your choice".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A morbid curiosity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More of the same. It's interesting that I keep coming back to these films, it's morbid curiosity really.Basically, this is the point of the saga where we find out about the 'killer'- to unravel the enigma. Of course the exploration into Jigsaw's mind is rather superficial although it does - just about outdo- the humanisation of Freddy Kreuger in Freddy's Dead.Of course there's still plenty of time for the sickness. And although the traps continue to be relatively innovative the whole thing is growing slightly tiresome.Essentially this is the same film, again. Only this time it is amped up even more than it's predecessors. The action moves thick and fast, each early scene melded together by a kind of overly stylistic editing which is almost as disorientating as the more blood curdling moments.As with each of the Saw sequels it has its moments but it's just a bit overly familiar now and with Saw 5 on it's way this franchise shows no sign of slowing down. No doubt my curiosity will bring me back to the saga one more time at least.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now dead Jigsaw has a new apprentice who is after everyone who knows him for who he really is!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film was pretty good, I loved every bit of this film but the traps were pretty intense to handle for some viewers watching near me in the theater. I had never suspected Hoffman as Jigsaw's apprentice and he does a better job than now dead Amanda Young(who died in last film)he really gives others chances at solving their traps and feeling good about themselves and their lives. I thought that some scenes where kinda not suitable for anyone under 13yrs(rape scene, head-crushing scene, pictures of vicious rapes of young women, etc.)because they were pretty graphic and should have been put on as a DVD feature instead of putting it in the film for people to see for themselves. The traps were good but the story concept of the last police officer who wanted to look for Dec. Matthews is going on a 90 minute journey to see what Jigsaw is trying to tell him at the end of the film and him going around seeing all these people dying in front of him and nothing he can really do about but stand around and watch or look away, that's brutal for viewers everywhere!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its not a game, its a lesson -- I saw SAW I to SAW VII</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Masterpiece fabulous story told in 7 years. Some movies are made to tell us Why the movies are made and give us a good reason to watch movies. Marvelously written and brilliantly filmed, Very Interesting and Intriguing. The message of the Saw series movies are clear -- don't abuse yourself, don't abuse others, control your emotions, and be fair. Do not take drugs, do not smoke, do not cheat or lie, do not frame others, try to forgive, do not keep vengeance, control the obsessions, do not make profits on others death -- Follow the Rules, and you will win in the end. Do not sin from the tiniest to the gruesome/ heinous. There are many gore and horrible scenes when the victims are TESTED. But I think its a glimpse of hell, what we can expect as the wrong doers will be punished in the after life, because they did not followed the rules or had not got the clues. Its not a game -- Make Your Choices! Cherish Your Life!When the Legacy was handed over from John to Detective Hoffman, it all started going in the wrong direction. He tried to fulfill John's Will, but as he had lesser human side, and was going himself against the rules. He became a Victim to be Tested by himself. The Final Chapter is also more interesting with more gore and gruesome scenes and more people getting killed now, mostly innocent and police officers. Before it is Game Over!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw IV is the 4th out of 7 film in the Saw movie franchise, and it is the best. The two movies before Saw IV were boring, but this movie makes up for that, your on the edge of your seat for the movie as soon as the game stars. The story is great, the characters are great, the Jigsaw flashbacks were great, the traps were great, this movie is just amazing and I have no idea why people think it was the worst. This movie is just pure greatness from start to finish. It is awesome. Also Jigsaw's rule is to put criminals in his traps the people in these traps in Saw IV are the most deserving people. I mean, these dudes really deserve the traps expect the girl in The Hair Trap, way too young to die. Saw IV is simply great and it introduces an awesome new character, Agent Strahmn, who was awesome in this movie, and Jill, well, just watch. Saw IV is a great movie and is the best movie in the series. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ingenious climax and more traps.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw 4 adopts a different approach towards the plot that has been witnessed until now. More characters are introduced and the plot becomes more complex in comparison to Saw 3. Darren Lynn Bousman does a commendable job and with this movie and it seems that he was born to make these movies. One will learn that the entire script of the Saw movies 1 to 7 may well have been scripted prior to the production of the second one. This is a good movie but I noticed that the quality began to deteriorate at a small pace. As more detectives and lieutenants are brought in to the picture, the movie starts to become a investigative piece of work. But if given a re watch it can turn out to become a enjoyable experience nonetheless. There are more victims and traps than one can ever imagine. Without these the movie would not stand up in comparison to it's predecessors.SPOILERS The dead body of jigsaw is discovered by S.W.A.T along with the surgeon, his wife and Amanda. After a autopsy a tape is discovered by lieutenant Hoffman which actually challenges the finder to pursue the truth behind his death. Detective Kerry's hanging dead body is also discovered and two new detectives Straham and Perez are assigned to find the killer. They begin to have doubts that perhaps there is a male accomplice to the jigsaw. A friend of the decease cop Detective Rigg is forced in jigsaw's games and his destination is to discover the location of Detective Matthews (Wahlberg) and Detective Hoffman who have subjected to jigsaw's trap. They will die if Rigg enters there. Meanwhile Jigsaw's ex wife is being interrogated by Straham. A flashback begin to bring to our attention that Jigsaw once had a medical clinic that he ran with his wife and he lost his child. Detective Rigg continues from one lead to another while attempting to save individuals from Jigsaw's traps with unfortunate consequences. In a surprising twist we learn that Hoffman was also a accomplice to Jigsaw and that this scenario was happening simultaneously when he was requiring surgery. END OF SPOILERSAs I stated earlier the movie features more traps than ever imagined. The first scene involving the visually and verbally impaired men was emotional to watch. The writer really put his imagination in to full force. The movie seemed very similar to the sequel in terms the plot attempting to catch Jigsaw. But the similarities end at that point. There is a deeper insight in to jigsaw's past. This contemplated the present story well. It gave more meaning to his character and we learn to understand why his actions. The genuineness of the theme does remain throughout the movie but Jigsaw's presence is not terrifying as it could be. Jigsaw's cop accomplice is the surprise in the twist but this is the ridiculous element of the movie. I did not feel it was required. However it helps to progress the movie on to the fifth installment. The other twist involving the time line was devious and it gave the climax a good feel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen all 6 SAW movies in chronological order (of course) and this one is by far the worst one! I liked all of the other 5 movies in the series.I rented out this movie for $1.I just kept yawning throughout the movie and couldn't wait for it to finish! I was very disappointed though I am a fan of the SAW movies.It just kept dragging on and off for a long time even though it was only for a hour and a half.I kept asking myself why Jigsaw was still in the movie even though he was dead.At the end I was pretty relieved because I thought the movie was over long last! I am still a fan of SAW and do want to go and see SAW VII.If you are a huge fan of the series then see it and if not don't.SAW V is better than this.3/10 IS MY RATING</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Kramer (Bell) is dead, but Jigsaw is still alive, and Detective Rigg (Bent) is being tested. Did the torture need to continue? No. Fortunately, this outing isn't nearly as big of a waste of time as "Saw III"; in fact, it's actually quite good in comparison to the third installment. The fans will probably love this one. Plenty of twists and interesting traps to go around, plus an interesting backstory with John Kramer and Jill Tuck (Russell). This film has the most returning characters (not counting archive footage) of all seven films. Some plot holes and continuities are patched up--others are created (hint: brother of Mark)--but if you're willing to move on you'll be wonderfully grossed out. Enjoy!*** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An average addition to the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The games have just begun and the games have gotten slightly more complex as Saw releases yet another movie: Saw IV. The story isn't as clever or as strong as the other movies, this one is a little bit boring but it's still an average addition to the series. Also, it's not friendly to newcomers of the series, people would need to at least watch the third movie before watching this. The characters were written okay and the way Jigsaw set the traps for the main character is a little bit clever but it just doesn't have the same intelligence as the first movie did although it tries to. There's little character development this time round and you aren't really very interested in the main character but more interested in the characters he has to save. The acting is very mediocre, as there were some scenes when the acting was undeniably quite bad but it picked up later on in the movie. However, the best actor in the movie is yet again Tobin Bell as Jigsaw. The direction was average and the writing isn't as good as it was in the first three movies. The special effects were done great and the traps were, yet again, inventive and each trap matched the personality of the person in the trap just like the other movies, which I found clever.I didn't like this addition as much as I liked the other three and, even though watching Jigsaw's past and explaining why he did the things he did was all good, it just didn't feel the same. The movie didn't actually feel like a Saw movie. It actually felt more like it was supposed to be a television show more than a movie. I also felt it lost that little bit of intelligence and that spark that made the Saw movies great.Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw remains great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw IV is great just like all of the others. It keeps you guessing from beginning to end. It has interesting characters such as Special Agent Strahm, Officer Rigg, and Detective Hoffman. The story is good and keeps you thinking. The traps are OK. I really don't mind because I watch Saw for story, not traps. The acting was good, in particular Lyriq Bent (Rigg) and Scott Patterson (Agent Strahm). They were both great alongside the always great Tobin Bell. Saw IV provides great flashbacks of John before he became Jigsaw. I loved these flashbacks because I felt they were necessary since Jigsaw was killed off in the previous movie. The twists were also good. I really liked them. The only problem I have with this movie is the directing. It felt sloppy and it felt as if director Darren Lynn Bousman wasn't even trying. I did however like the fast pace it had. Overall I think this movie is very underrated, and I liked Saw IV better than than it's predecessor Saw III, and I find it to be just as good as Saw II. Definitely give it a watch, but I warn you. If you haven't seen Saw III yet, you will be extremely confused as to what is happening throughout the movie.8.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw IV is by far the best sequel in the Saw series. While Saw II &amp; III were sadistic in their violence and storyline, Saw IV is a perfect sequel. You don't expect much, but it surprises you by being quite good. And while the violence is graphic and bloody, its toned down compared to other Saw movies (with the exception of the first) and necessary to the storyline. The performances are quite good for a fourth installment in a horror series; again you don't expect too much, but then you're surprised by how good the actors perform.Saw IV solid **** out of *****.Rated R for Graphic Bloody Violence &amp; Language.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but the least satisfying of the "Saw" Series so far.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jigsaw/John Kramer (Tobin Bell) is finally killed by one of the people (Angus MacFayden) that Jigsaw set the trap on him with the help of Amanda (Shawnee Smith) but the game isn't over yet. Since Jigsaw might have worked with someone else than Amanda. Now two detectives Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) and Rigg (Lyriq Bent) are trying to stop Jigsaw's latest trips &amp; also Detective Matthews (Donnie Walhberg) might be still alive for all this time.Directed by Darren Lynn Bousman (Saw 2, Saw 3, Repo!:The Genetic Opera) made an entertaining if complex sequel to the ever popular "Saw" movies. Leigh Whannell, who usually wrote the "Saw" films isn't involved with this one. There's two new screenwriters in this one and you can tell, the screen writing is much different than Whannell's writing. "Saw 4" tries very hard to be unique than the previous pictures and it works at times. There's some new characters, including Kramer's ex-wife! played by Besty Russell (Who was seen briefly in "Saw 3"). This one tries also to fleshed out more Jigsaw/John Kramer's character but now Jigsaw isn't quite interesting anymore sadly. Now Jigsaw/John Kramer's character appears now as a second rate Hannibal Lector/Freddy Krueger! The R-Rated DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 EX Surround Sound. DVD includes the director's video diary, two featurettes, deleted scene and an music video. The Unrated DVD adds two new features:two running commentary tracks by the filmmakers. Still "Saw 4" was an box office hit like the other previous three pictures. Since "Saw 5" is coming out this fall, i only hope that "Saw 5" will be an major improvement over "Saw 4". Die Hard fans of the "Saw" films will enjoy this one best. (*** 1/2 out of *****).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only If You're Smart Will You See What A Gem This Is.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Saw IV, Jigsaw is now dead, but more traps have yet to be sprung. Two FBI Agents are brought in to clean up the mess. When a detective is captured and put in a trap, a SWAT commander must try to save him, and in doing so, gets the chance to save an old friend.At this point, only the true fans of this franchise are still tuned in, but if you are a true fan, Saw IV is anything but disappointing. However, you really need to be dialed in to understand this movie. Most people are confused by the result of Officer Rigg's test, but the main twist of this movie will leave you dumbstruck for awhile. It's a great story, kudo's to the new writers who were brought in. This movie dives deep into Jigsaw's background and how he became what he is. I personally love this movie. Saw is the undisputed best of the franchise, Saw II is probably the worst, Saw III is great, and Saw IV (once you finally figure everything out) is topped only by the first movie. They've set Saw V up very well with #IV. You can't help but think that V will be genuine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>can it really be over</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's over when it's over they say, and yet 'Saw _IV' is kind of a proof that a serial killer series may not be over even after the serial killer is dead, and it's not about his childhood and teens age either. This 4th series begins with a gruesome (but what means this term in such a film?) autopsy scene which ends surprisingly with triggering a new plot. The good news is that the plot is really good, has pace, surprises and even some logic. There are of course a lot of graphic torture scenes, violent deaths of all kind and other special effects for the fans of the genre, but the quality of the film lies more in the psychological tension, and surprisingly it works and makes sense - of course if as a viewer you have survive to the final sequences of the film.</fullReview>

After all, he didn't exactly go after the innocent, did he? It was certainly gory and the inventiveness of the traps were still impressive. In addition, there was more story here; more of a psychological thriller.I imagine that we will see Agent Perez (Athena Karkanis) again, and that is worth waiting for. It will be interesting to see if they can keep coming up with interesting gadgets.I await the next installment.</fullReview>

Now this time around the twist is not the most unpredictable thing but it will still make some people say "ohhhh". Don't think that there is a big twist at the end and that is it.

		<fullReview>To begin with, allow me to clear one thing that might have got other viewer's judgments clouded.. Saw 4 has an entirely different plot keeping in mind the basic behind saw 1 and saw 2..this movie should not be viewed as a part of the saw franchise, rather one should understand what the director has done with this movie.Darren Lynn Bousman has gone deep into developing the characters in this movie and has done his best to make us understand the plight behind Jigsaw's life, his sole motive behind being so brutal with his tests.Considering that, the movie has done an excellent job in delivering gore (which i extremely adore) and also an intense storyline where the viewers will have wreck their brains to understand certain stuff..The only part in the movie that made me go "oh damn!" was the ending, which didn't really sit on the intensity created by the whole movie. It lacked the basic punch on the face ending every other saw sequel provided..but nonetheless its a great movie and i would not think twice before recommending it to people who wants something brutal..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And the franchise disappeared up its own a$$</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What started out as a great standalone Indie-movie became an unnecessary trilogy that has now grown into a never-ending and continuously degrading franchise in the vein of "Friday The 13th". It was inevitable that "Saw IV" would become a bad movie. What's interesting is the way in which it fails.As most fourth parts in a series "Saw IV" doesn't feel fresh anymore. The excitement of the original movie has gone. Whereas other sequels just get shallow, though, the fourth entry in the "Saw"-saga gets caught up in complicated side plots and incomprehensible twists. To understand this movie or even get an idea of what might be going on you have to see its predecessor right before it.For all its complications, "Saw IV" still doesn't make sense once you comprehend the coherences, though. To continue the series (which, unfortunately, has already been confirmed to go on for at least two more sequels) the writers desperately try to expand Jigsaw's story, invent new connections between characters, disclose motives we haven't heard of before... and it's all too obvious that none of it is plausible. No matter how many secret accomplices Jigsaw is supposed to have had all of a sudden, it still never explains how all the abducting, the planing of traps and the perfect execution of the crimes could have been possible. Maybe that would be forgivable, if the franchise wouldn't be so eager to present everything as flawlessly thought-through. This way the movies seem as if they wanted to be cleverer than they actually are.Apart from the forced storyline, it's the basic premise of the "Saw"-movies that just doesn't work anymore. It has become as trite as Stevie Wonder-jokes by now. The traps and gruesome deaths, that had a nasty fascinating quality in the first part, are just getting more and more boring. We don't know anything about the characters getting killed and we couldn't care less about them or the "heroes". What makes matters worse are the same old, over-used editing tricks that haven't even looked good in the original movie and are just plain annoying (which also goes for the "artful" transitions between scenes that grace "Saw IV").Sure, it's remarkable that the producers manage to knock out a new entry in this franchise every year, but none of these movies will stand the test of time. Watching them even now, their flaws and missteps are obvious. They seem rushed and cheaply made. The "Saw"-sequels and, particularly, the fourth part are merely emotionless transfer pictures of a once original and intriguing idea. This hardly comes as a surprise, though, when the commercial appeal of a movie is so calculatedly milked dry as is the case with "Saw".To be continued...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More like Saw II than Saw III</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie should have been a direct sequel from Saw II. It seemed like one. This movie was more like the first 2, with fear and confusion being the 2 main components this time rather than just torture. The traps were a lot more clever this time around. The characters were all very well played. And everything was a lot more random in this than in the 3rd, where you know who was gonna make it pretty much. You couldn't tell who was gonna make it and who wasn't, who was part of the game and who wasn't. That was the biggest surprise here, you couldn't tell who was playing the game or who was just a bystander/victim. However, the reason I gave this movie a 7 was because there were elements of Saw III present. Some torture elements and stuff which I wasn't too fond of in Saw III. However, I was looking forward to seeing this in theaters. After missing it the first week and having to sit through the treacherous "30 Days of Night" instead (See my 30 Days of Night comment). Then the next week me and my brother got lucky and got in to see Saw IV. And I wasn't disappointed. Saw IV is more of a movie for Saw fans rather than someone looking for a good scary movie to watch. 7/10 Hopefully Saw V will bring me back to the enjoyment level of Saw and Saw II.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you've finished laughing hysterically at the clever pun I used for the title of this review (you BETTER laugh--I spent all night coming up with it), you probably already know what my take on this movie is going to be. I saw this on Halloween night, and had a crappy Halloween as a result. Anyway you cut it, this story was finished at part 3 (actually part 1, but oh well), and there was no reason to make a Saw IV. Saw IV is easily the worst out of the series. It lacks the suspense and strong characters of the first Saw, the "funhouse" aspect of Saw II, and the gruesome/disturbing, squirm-in-your-chair schtick of Saw III. It simply isn't that thrilling, because there just isn't much more that can be done with this premise. None of the traps are especially creative or bizarre, and the plot is loaded with gigantic holes. The attempted continuity between all the Saw movies also becomes a convoluted mess, here.If you're a big Saw/horror fan, I would recommend waiting for video (or better yet, until the Sci-Fi channel shows it or something).</fullReview>

But for the best of luck the middle east distributor decided to pre release it on 21st Of November 2007 in order to hit the box office &amp; to avoid any hacked web torrents or Smuggled DVD Screeners. And they were actually right. the cinemas seats here are totally complete . reservations are full that i even reserved for 2 days (yesterday) &amp; (today) .I watched it yesterday &amp; now i have to see it again for my second ticket reservation which i really regret now !!! In a special interview with Tobin Bell with APTN he announced that the viewers should watch the first 4 or 5 minutes in the movie to know Jigsaw status &amp; what's going on . He was right but he cleverly announced this not to know the status of Jigsaw which we all know . Well can't say in order not to spoil the movie.The incidents went on cleverly made. Traps were set . Audience were screaming for the most bloody gore scenes that reached the top in the Franchise. But at the same time you are completely confused (why is Jigsaw playing this game when he's dead?)but equivalently the story of how Jigsaw became a serial killer was like a breath comfort taking from the brutal incidents although it appeared to be unconvincing till the moment .The special appearance of Emmanuelle Vaugier (Adison) from part 2 in the 4th sequel was like a glance of a moment only to be included in the upcoming sequels with the rest of the new cast .The final parts of the movie weren't surprising &amp; taking like the first 3 but instead it made all the viewers unable to understand what did the film wanted to say . Instead the audience began shouting &amp; quarreling together &amp; asking questions . Even me who loves the Saw movies. I was in a complete mess up . I said after we left the cinema (That this was junk) &amp; they seem to make this 4th sequel for gaining more money &amp; targeting stupid fans only .But after seconds of entering my car i told my friends (One moment , i now understood what has happened &amp; what the writers have done to play with our minds for the whole movie... Its very smart from those guys to do that .which is the only good point to be added to part 4) What will part 5,6 &amp; 7 have.I don't know what will actually happen but if continues they must play on a tight line &amp; never try to play this game with viewers by all means .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw remains sharp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never thought I'd see a horror franchise where the sequels hold their own against or even surpass the original. SAW is that singular franchise. And SAW 4 continues that series' suspenseful and sometimes scary tradition. We start off with the autopsy of Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), only to discover the game is still afoot when a tape is found inside of him. As various people continue to fall victim to his awful games, a bunch of detectives and FBI agents try to locate his victims before they die. In particular, they are seeking three detectives who have fallen into his hands. They also interview his ex-wife, thinking she may be involved in some way. And this is a way for the filmmakers to give us, via a series of elaborate flashbacks, the complete story of how John became Jigsaw. Some familiar faces from earlier SAW films are back for that reason. We get to see Jigsaw's first trap, a primitive device that forces its victim to push his face into a cluster of knives in order to free himself. We also get to see a much more elaborate trap involving blocks of ice and a hangman's noose. The gore quotient is high, but the filmmakers occasionally pull the camera away from the worst of it, leaving some of the nastiest coup de grace to our imaginations. The ending is a mind bender for anyone who has closely followed the series. And I should mention that SAW 4 will make little sense to those who have not seen the entire series. Costas Mandylor stars as the main detective on the hunt for Jigsaw. Don Wahlberg, who starred in the last film, has a smaller role this time around as one of the trapped detectives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best of Saw series (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to state the obvious as everyone else. I didn't think this series could last this long, but it has. And watching these movies, I'm always blown away with how creative the writers make up these traps and try as hard as they can to create the twists in the movies.Saw IV is a fun, confusing, and overall great movie. Basically after the 3 years of watching and obsessing over the Saw movies, I automatically know that I wasn't going to understand the movie completely watching it from beginning to end, unless talking about it with my friends afterwards. This movie is hard to explain without spoiling it, but the movie starts off with Jigsaw's autopsy, and sets off the dark mood for the rest of the story. Not even 7 minutes into the movie, you'll realize why they're going to keep doing the sequels (Saw V and Saw VI). Right after, you go into the real story, where Rigg is captured and put into a test to see if he can follow his actual test, or risk his life along with others.Personally, I felt this movie had a more creative twist to it, since it brings back the past 3 movies, and explains some (but not all) the cliffhangers. The traps are of course gruesome, but not far-fetched like the 3rd one was (don't get me wrong, I liked the 3rd one, but Saw IV made me actually believe the traps were built by him). All the traps had a meaning to them, and each one was actually going along with Jigsaw's "choose your own fate" philosophy. The acting was great. I understood Jigsaw's reasons for the traps for Rigg (SEE WHAT I SEE, FEEL WHAT I FEEL, SAVE AS I SAVE, JUDGE AS I JUDGE). The new characters actually acted great too. I liked how they even went into explaining Jigsaw's past and the REAL reason why he started his work.The only problems I found was 1. The "twist" in the end. Not as great as Saw II, but it still got me. I saw it coming, but it threw me off near the middle. 2. The random blind/mute trap after the autopsy scene. I get that it shows that "his work will continue" but seriously, it wasn't a good place to put it.Either way, I loved this movie. I watched Saw IV to follow the series's story, not to criticize it. It seems like everyone's hating on the film because its not "real". Yes some of these traps can't happen in real life, and yes it's almost impossible to swallow a wax tape and still be found whole, and yes there are problems the movie, but big deal. Take Saw IV for what it's supposed to be; a movie, with suspense, gore, and perfect for Halloween.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly...the best SAW movie in the series!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My all-time favorite in the series is the first one because for being original. This one on the other hand, delivers like never before! This one blows away the last two completely. In my opinion, this is the best one yet and shouldn't be missed!Jigsaw's dead. But is the game over? Hardly. Jigsaw's reign still continues beyond the grave. His last transmission (that we know of), was in a tape hidden in his stomach saying, "...the game had just begun." This movie is hard to summarize because whatever you say about this movie is a spoiler all the way! I guess that's good marketing when one person would say to another, "Dude! I just watched SAW IV and you have to watch it! I can't talk a lot about it because I'm afraid I might ruin it. Watch it yourself!" All I can say is there's a lot of familiar faces in this one from the previous movie and the ending will totally blow you away! It took me awhile to understand what just happened and it made total sense to me under 5 minutes. Certain gruesome tasks in the movie have been toned down a bit which levels the violence and the storyline pretty well just like the first one rather than the third one with all the gross things happening that makes you wanna barf and a mindless plot that nobody would really care about at the same time. This movie is not a disappointment at all. It's a must-see for all SAW fans!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good ideas, but an incoherent and fragmented movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There will be blood, sorry, spoilers, re. some of the previous films, so if you want to skip this post, I will forgive you.I liked "Saw" and "Saw II". I thought that they were tight, nasty, gory, ingenious little horror films. True, at heart they were nothing more than superior torture porn, but gruesomely entertaining nevertheless. People much cleverer than me will write volumes about why some people find violence and horror so entertaining, and I have thoughts on that, but those thoughts can wait for another time.About a year ago I saw "Saw III". At the time I wrote that I liked it, but in retrospect I would admit that "Saw III" was probably not as good as the first two films. At the end of my little review I wrote the following.'The ending of "Saw III" is setup nicely for a sequel, but maybe it will be one movie too many?'One movie too many? Maybe. Either way, I thought that "Saw IV" was the weakest entry in the series so far because of the lack of clarity in the plot, the really confusing and fragmented telling of the story and the fact that the viewer needed an encyclopedic knowledge of the first three films to make head or tails of what was going on. I would imagine that a punter coming in off the street to watch this film, having not seen any of the other films, would be absolutely sunk. Sometimes exposition is needed, especially in a third sequel.True, there were some good ideas in "Saw IV". With the death of Jigsaw and his assistant Amanda at the end of "Saw III", it was interesting the direction that the filmmakers took. I liked the way that they chose to investigate the motivations of Jigsaw, showing flashbacks to his life, his relationships and the sequence of events that turned him into a serial killer with a moral purpose. I also liked the devilish (final?) set of traps, set to ensnare unsuspecting victims even after his death. (My favourite was the scalping machine. Eeek! If I had more hair I would be holding onto it now.)Hang on a minute! I think I have just convinced myself that "Saw IV" was not all that bad after all, but, please-please-please the writer(s) of "Saw V" (an inevitable prospect?), give the script a good rewrite before going into production. Simplicity is the key. I cannot afford to scratch my head through another "Saw" film. I haven't got enough hair.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Get inside the head of John Kramer..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>..literally ;-) I'm sure most of the opening scene was for shock value, but then this is the Saw franchise.Then take a journey into John Kramers mind through a series of flashbacks.. to discover what made him into the serial torturer known as Jigsaw, as (seemingly a little too inept) FBI agents try and piece together the whereabouts of Rigg, the SWAT team member who has seen those around him die, forensics man Hoffman, and detective Eric Matthews.Jigsaw is dead.. so now his purpose is to allow others to see what he saw.. feel what he felt.. to know things from his side.One downside to this movie is that you really need to have seen (and paid attention to) Saw II and III to understand some of what is going on.Others have said there is nothing new here - yes there are "death traps" just like in the other movies; that's what makes this a Saw movie, however most are centred in a new way..After Saw III I thought they could not add much more.. I kind of have that feeling now after this movie, however this one proved me wrong, so I'm looking forward to any new instalments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brief saw 4 review (WARNING: CONTAINS BRIEF SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original saw films were extremely original and completely shocked the audience, re-birthing the horror genre for the 21st century. Me personally, not being a huge horror fan, I was dragged into enjoying the series simply due to the originality of it and the shock factor. And the fact that there has a moral behind it, rather than a killer running around stabbing people.Any of Darren Lynn Bousman titles will have the traps, the "gore-nography" factor, all the twists and turns that keep us guessing, and which will inevitably keep us guessing and wanting more. So after all, the saw series will always be discussed which results in more promotion; a continuous franchiseAs many felt that #3 had started to grow stale, whereas I felt the ending was very genuine and left me desperately waiting for number 4. Now the traps for number 4 were very original indeed, however I felt the writers had spent too much time trying to describe WHY Jigsaw became how he was, and WHY there is a pig mask etc, and it kind of lost some of the fear factor of the whole plot. It becomes unbelievable that "Rigg" truly deserves what he is going through, simple just to go home to his wife and save himself rather than people who don't deserve, The only believable is "Cecil", now that guy really deserved it, his trap and death was satisfying to watch, and to watch jiggy stand in front of him which his arms open, what birthed his obsession with jigsaw killing.I voted the film a 7 out of 10 because it was overall enjoyable, and the editing, the effects, the plot was all different than the previous, and made it overall interesting, however, it begins to get tedious to follow a character ie - Jeff from number 3 go through so much, only to be killed within an instance in number 4. Although it may be kinda unrealistic, it gets kind of irritating that no one ever survive. Also, if a film is a success, you must raise the bar in the next, it appeared the time line for number 4 was trying to be so clever that it made it just stupid. we have to believe that all of the events take place within 90 minutes, and whilst number 3, being one of the twists. It is a clever idea and I respected that however it just seems to be a bit ridiculous. And leaving me feeling completely negative about number 5. It constantly will stray away from original characters and grows into a money making glamorised franchise. I feel that number 4 was a success in that it brought a new aspect (perhaps more of a detective murder mystery) and that it was exciting, but it just leaves many negative expectations that the saw franchise could carry on successfully.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Part 4 and STILL GOOD!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit, I had my doubts about Saw IV. There was little or no marketing on this, and the story was unknown. My initial thoughts were how are they going to continue after the conclusion of Saw III, which seemed to tie everything up. So, my attendance at the movie was based solely on curiosity. I must say WOW...for a third sequel, this movie manages be well made, well acted, stays loyal to the initial mood and story without being repetitive, and still provides twists and shocks that you aren't expecting. Rarely do you find a series like this in which each movie ties into the others so seamlessly and plausibly. This series is not your typical brainless gorefest...it actually gives you something to think about even after you leave the theater. I am actually ready to see how good Saw V is going to be! I will be waiting for it to hit theaters the last weekend in October, 2008!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anemic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the few saving graces of the "Saw" horror movie franchise is its titles. Compared with either the "Friday the 13th" or "Halloween" movies with their verbose titles, such as "Friday the 13th, Part V: A New Beginning" or "Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers," the only thing that sets one "Saw" movie apart from another is its numerical designation. Had Lions Gate Films, the distributor of the audacious but repellant "Saw" series, tacked on a secondary title, director Darren Lynn Bousman's latest installment might easily have been called "Saw IV: Jigsaw's Postmortem, Long Live the Death-Trap Games." Sadly, this ambitious but convoluted sequel lacks the memorable characters, the diabolical Rube Goldberg torture devices, and the tense, white-knuckled atmosphere of the earlier epics. "Saw IV" qualifies as a punctual but implausible thriller rather than a terrifying tale of terror that makes your hands clammy and your skin crawl. Indeed, Jigsaw and Amanda are really dead, and they cannot rise from the grave. The trouble here is that the villain that substitutes for Jigsaw is bland, and the death traps aren't as ghoulish. Hardcore horror aficionados that grade their gorefests on how far the filmmakers push the envelope may ridicule "Saw IV" as a supreme bore.Although it unfolds on the right foot, "Saw IV" stumbles not long thereafter, never recovers, and provides negligible thrills and chills within its hopelessly complicated plot. Actually, Jigsaw's demise in "Saw III" doomed "Saw IV." You never knock off your primary villain in a franchise. Since the "Saw" movies stick strictly to life and death situations without slipping into the supernatural realm, the producers literally painted themselves into a corner with Jigsaw's death. Meanings, as the flesh and bone rogue that he was, Jigsaw has no hope of resurrection as the maniacal messiahs of the macabre--Freddy, Jason, or Michael?have done in film after film to breed terror into the hearts of audiences.The first scene in "Saw IV" tops the rest. We get the rare treat of watching the pathologist (David Boyce of "Exit Wounds") perform a gruesome autopsy on Jigsaw. Mind you, they don't cover up Jigsaw's body the same way that the medical examiners on TV in "NCIS" or the "CSI" shows do. We get to see Jigsaw displayed in all his anatomical glory as they remove his brain from his cranium and crack open his chest. No sooner has the M.E. emptied the contents of Jigsaw's stomach than he discovers a tiny audiotape cassette! Jigsaw must have bulk ordered his supplies before he croaked because tapes and hand-held tape players play an indispensable part in all the "Saw" movies. Immediately, the medical examiner summons natty Homicide Detective Hoffman (Costas Mandylor of "Mobsters") and two FBI profilers, Agent Strahm (Scott Patterson of TV's "The Gilmore Girls") and Agent Perez (Athena Karkanis of TV's "The Best Years"), join the investigation. Like Det. Hoffman, they insist that somebody else is supervising Jigsaw's nefarious torture games. After all, Jigsaw's psychotic assistant Amanda (Shawnee Smith) died along with him in "Saw III." The Feds pursue two leads, Jigsaw's ex-wife Jill (attractive Betsy Russell of "Tomboy") as well as an impulsive, loose-cannon cop, SWAT Team Leader Rigg (Lyrig Bent of "Saw II"), with a suspicious history himself. Jigsaw toys with Rigg when he warns him via audiotape that he has 90 minutes to save the lives of his abducted wife and child as well as his former partner Eric Matthews (Donny Wahlberg of "Saw II") who has been missing for six months. The FBI interrogates Jill about Jigsaw. They suspect that she is Jigsaw's new accomplice, and we learn that Jigsaw was once a prominent engineer and an expectant father."Saw IV" operates on the level of a modest, straight-to-video thriller. Each scene contains a giant digital clock ticking away the minutes. Director Darren Lynn Bousman keeps the action moving headlong, even in the dialogue scenes, and the film's elaborate transitions enhance the visual quality. The problem is that Rigg spends too much time off screen so we have nobody with whom we can identify. Meanwhile, Jigsaw dominates the movie with his flashback scenes. Actor Tobin Bell racks up more on-screen time in "Saw IV" than in any of the previous "Saws." We learn about Jigsaw's origins before the nasty hand of fate twisted him into a serial killer with an offbeat agenda. Unmistakably, "Saw IV" solicits sympathy for its devil by portraying him as a saint and wants us to absolve him of his treachery. Talk about too much information ruining a character! Jigsaw's villainy suffers irreparable, and he is no longer the menace that prowled in both "Saw II" and "Saw III." None of the torture devices-granting the prequel type favor of his flashback scenes--can compare remotely to the original "Saw" or its first two sequels.If you missed the earlier "Saw" movies, you'll probably get lost in "Saw IV." Bousman, who helmed "Saw II" and "Saw III," never quite managed to bottle the creepy qualities of the original. Mechanical death traps take front and center in Bousman's "Saw" movies, and Jigsaw calls the shots even though he is fatally stricken with cancer. Whereas "Saw" was a claustrophobic nightmare, the sequels opened up the arena and sacrificed the mystery and captivity that the original created on its shoe-string budget. The disclosure of the person acting on Jigsaw's behalf comes as no shock. The plot convolutions served to obscure the identity of Jigsaw's replacement. Happily, Bousman and his writers sew up all the loose threads; look for Jeff from "Saw III" to wander with gun in fist into a scene. For the record,"Saw IV" earned its R-rating with over 60 uses of the F-word. The least anxiety-inducing entry in the franchise, "Saw IV" generates none of the intensity or ingenuity of both sequels and pales by comparison with the iconic original. Altogether, "Saw IV" emerges as tame and anemic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another great piece of the puzzle!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading a few reviews it's safe to same some people didn't quite get one of the biggest twists of the movie, which admittedly confused me a first too, but understood it by the end of the film. So firstly like to say if you don't understand the movie why bother reviewing it, go back and watch it again first! Secondly I know many people compare this film to the first, which is understandable, and yes I have to agree is probably the best in the franchise. But don't forget saw 1 was made as a standalone film, where it's easy to see in the 3rd and 4th that these films are simply parts of a bigger picture, much like jigsaw him self's 'games'. So if you haven't seen the previous films or didn't like them you probably won't enjoy this.Anyway back to the film, personally I loved it, it was very cleaver went back over the last 3 films answering a few questions, but raising some new ones too, a brilliant way to keep the audience wanting more. And let's face it not many films practically in this genre get you so hooked on the story. True I believe the film has gone downhill in some aspects for one the devices have obviously gone downhill, one simply involving a victim having to push buttons to meme himself and escape the trap. The first trap in the film was the only one I saw as being clever, the rest seemed too straight forward, and didn't follow the original idea that they killed themselves with the traps rather then the trap killing them. Secondly many of the new characters seemed under developed, and quite plain, meaning you didn't really care too much about wither they lived or died. Thirdly I feel they spent a bit too much time explaining johns back story (which could have been spent developing the new characters and focusing on there fear) when after all many of us where satisfied that johns fatal cancer is what drove him to want to 'save' people from there lack of appreciation of life. After all this doesn't make much of a difference, true it explains a couple of small things but to be honest they wasn't things that you'd loose sleep over. Over all I have to say it's a very well put together film, and the film makers are as cunning as jigsaw himself, making us fall in to all sorts of traps along the story leading us down different roots, to keep the truth from us, keep us guessing, and of course wanting more! It's safe to say that film probably puts the final nail in the lid of john's coffin, (having died in saw 3, and past revealed in 4) but opens the door to a new era of the franchise, with plenty more to be revealed. I just hope that they have got the bigger picture all worked out, and that they aren't going to try and put it together as they go along, so that they can finish telling the story, and have it remembered as one of the greatest horror franchises Hollywood have ever created, rather then just another film the industry has milked till it looses as it was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had to re-watch Saw 1,2,&amp; 3 before seeing the 4th because I know how confusing they can be unless you remember how the latest one ends. This new one was more fast paced and there seemed to be more happening and it ultimately ended on a confusing but satisfying note.I could not believe the gruesome opening.I thought the last movie was violent but the autopsy scene was disturbing and hard to watch.Saw 3 ended on such a major cliff hanger.But one thing I did not like about saw 4 (warning! this contains a spoiler)was that it didn't really solve the mystery of the end of part 3.Maybe there were missing pieces for a reason which we will see in the 5th one.I was expecting to see what happened to Jeff's daughter Corbett the little girl that was kidnapped and held somewhere.Her father didn't appear til the end and she was still missing unless I missed something. I did like how Donnie Whalberg was back, but holy sh*t what a violent way for him to go and finally leave the series! I wanted him to escape it and be in further saw movies.He has come a long way since N.K.O.T.B. and is a great actor.I will miss him. Erik Knudsen who played his son Daniel should come back again. After going through what he did and surviving it,i'm surprised that was the last we ever heard or saw of him. Hopefully the actor will at least come back for his dads funeral in saw 5 if they even show it.One thing I don't like about this series is that it seems that most of the victims of violent torture seem to be male! I would like to see more female victims. I am looking forward to seeing what they do next with this series.They keep getting better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Understanding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For all those people who are confused with this movie this is my understanding of it - Warning, it does contain spoilers. Saw IV is occurring exactly the same time as Saw III - for e.g. the scene where the father is still looking for his child (Saw III) is occurring the same time as the ice block scene. Saw IV opening scene with Jigsaw's autopsy is actually the last scene of the movie but has been changed around to the beginning - sort of Pulp fiction style - that is why people are confused when the closing scene of the movie shows the Jigsaw and Amanda dead, the Dr with her head blow off and the cop gets lock in the surgery room - how can that happen if Jigsaw autopsy has already been performed, well it hasn't - the movies just been cut to look that way. A clue that helps back this theory up is the morticians carrying out the autopsy notice Jigsaw has already had some sort of 'backyard' brain surgery - which the Dr performed in number III. So I guess Saw V will continue with the 'helper' listening to Jigsaws next set of instructions from the tape from his stomach, finding out what his relationship is with JS and if the child and injured cop get out?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw IV Ending explained to those that have seen the movie: SPOILER!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the ending of this film we see SWAT Commander Rigg in front of the door that's entitled "final test". Eric Matthews is standing on the ice block and screams not for Rigg to open the door and he shoots Rigg in an attempt to stop him from entering. Rigg falls through the door, triggering the second trap that is elevated over Eric Matthews' head which contained two ice blocks the size of the one he stands on and the blocks crush Matthews' head, killing him instantly. Art Blanc, tries to tell Rigg that "Jigsaw" is testing them and Rigg shoots Art in the head. Thinking Art is the apprentice. But when Rigg listens to the final tape, Jigsaw states that Riggs obsession of trying to save people caused the death of Eric Matthews. That the 90:00 minutes that Eric had was on Rigg's side,and that Rigg could have waited until the time was over to save Eric. Dec. Hoffman then takes himself out of the trap, flashbacks explain that Hoffman had been helping Jigsaw and Amanda Young during "Saw III", and after he locks Rigg in that room, he heads to the room were Saw III took place, he locks Agent Straum in that room. Now, that twist explained that Saw IV has run currently with Saw III. An that video tape that was inside John Kramer's stomach was played again meaning the Autopsy was the actual end and not the beginning. This was and Excellent was to continue the series, and especially after the real Jigsaw has died.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine addition to the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw IV was the best fourth installment of a horror series I have seen. Now that may not be saying much considering the relatively low quality of horror movies after the first, however, this movie succeeds on several levels and falls short on others. First and foremost, I have to give the writers and director credit for putting out films of this quality once a year for 4 consecutive years. That alone makes these movies remarkable. Most Hollywood writers can't throw together a decent movie after 5 years of production, let alone 1. Now the strengths and weaknesses in my view: The strengths were a creative story, with a suspenseful plot and inventive traps. I was engrossed in the movie from start to finish and deep into the plot. Also, the director did right by toning down the blood and violence from the last one, and making the traps less violent and more realistic. Also, the writers succeed in filling in plot holes which plagued the other movies- like how Jigsaw had the knowledge to build such devices and how he had the muscle to do so when he was suffering from cancer. Character development was also a lot better in this movie than the the last two. I found myself much more invested in Rigg and Matthews than in the last two and I was actually rooting for the both of them to survive. The twist in the end was also decent, even if it leaves you wanting (Hoffman did come out of nowhere, so we will have to learn more about him in the next installments). The good thing is that while the twist was not as grand as I expected, or the director led us to believe, it was sufficient and could lead to good story lines for future movies if done well.The weaknesses were what the movie did not answer. Perhaps I was too focused on the pre-release hype, but I expected a lot more to be answered. I wanted to know about the note to Amanda, I wanted a more satisfying conclusion to the Jeff Reinhart/ Denlon saga (what's Corbett's fate??). And they should have done more with Hoffman's character, since he came out of left field (yet I understand that he will be the jump-off for future stories, so he was likely ambiguous to keep an interest in the progression of the series). In all, my biggest complaint was that they didn't stretch the movie out a little longer to build more of a stronger storyline.All in all, Saw IV was a fine edition to the series and it has kept my interest in the series which was a strong point of the previous movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Super!!!But I mean 'not bad'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must accept that i was bored of 'Saw' until today.I hardly went to the theater.I sat down and i realized that i wasn't curious about this film anymore even i watched the first one with great excitement.Maybe the reason was it's popularity.Then the film started...I was shocked!!!The scene was so disgusting and full of fun.Even I was about to get out of the theater.It was interesting to see how did Jigsaw become this position.When the film had finished,i got out from the theater with a great joy.I found more than i expected in this fourth chapter.Definitely not the best one but it was better than the third.And i must say that i'm bored of the same surprise ending.They did the same in the second one.There was nothing different.And this film is only a bridge between the third and the fifth one.So don't aspect something new.You can't eat the same dinner twice.But if you're a typical and bored 'SAW FAN' like me.You will enjoy this one too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really like and enjoy all the Saw films, especially the first one as it was something completely different to any other horror i have ever seen. I love how they are all totally gross and bloody but have such a strong meaning and reason behind them. I did enjoy Saw IV i thought it was very gruesome, which i don't mind at all and i thought all the new traps were excellent. I also like how it goes back and you find out how and why Jigsaw started up his games. I have to say though i didn't at first get the ending and it was only after i had thought about it for a while i think i began to understand it so i think i'm going to see it again because i think this is a film you need to watch more than once to truly understand it. Well worth a watch if this is your type of film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is just too much. If they're going to continue making these, Darren and the new writers need to go back and watch SAW until they realize what made it great. This movie is such a far reach from the original, it's ridiculous. It just doesn't feel like a saw film. -The music is unoriginal and underplayed.-The traps are random, overdone, ridiculous, poorly developed.-They are essentially traps, not games.-The bathroom is no where to be seen. -A saw plays no important part (orany part at all) -No Amanda. -No Jigsaw (except in flashbacks) -No confined location. -No patience. -Little to no character development.Don't get me wrong, there were parts I was entertained, but as a whole, it's just not SAW anymore. Just stop.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A much anticipated sequel to the horror film industry. Saw 4 displays some of the life of Jigsaw, helping to reveal some of his motives and beliefs. The film takes place at the same time as the precursor, Saw 3. It reveals several interesting plot twists and gives insight into a possible Saw 5 villain. With various continuations of traps and effects the movie lives up to the franchise with it's gory scenes and atrocious inventions. The movie is well rated in the sense that its gore and violence deserve the rating of "R". However, I fully believe that the film is the best in the series, and is a hand's down horror movie must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen every Saw movie and was hoping that the 4th one would be decent. Unfortunately, it was a disappointing movie.There are a number of errors/disappointing things in the movie: 1) If they found Jigsaw's body, wouldn't they have found the woman doctor's body (from the 3rd movie), along with her husband (who you will find out is still alive in this movie)? 2) Why would Riggs become stupid when reading the last card, when he had smartly followed and played by Jigsaw's rules for the first four clues/situations? 3) Why would one of the detectives, who finally figures out where the two missing detectives are at, go by himself without any backup? 4) This movie still hasn't explained what happened to the following people: the doctor (Cary Elwes), the guy locked with the doctor, along with the character played by Danny Glover in the first movie; and the little girl in the 3rd movie.There are some other things as well, but I won't go into any more detail. If they do make a fifth one, I hope they won't insult the intelligence of the fans of the series, or any moviegoer for that matter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A descent inclusion to the franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw IV was given the publicity of being the goriest film ever made, with the most gore filled opening 20 minutes ever seen in film history. Then we were told it had to be scaled down to suit audiences or face the can. Well it must have been scaled down to nearly a whole new film. In my mind the gore is only a way of filling in the emptiness of no storyline to fill the 90 minutes. In IV the storyline tried to lead the way which is always the best way to be.The opening scene shows us the autopsy of Jigsaw which is the harshest scene in the film. Following this we're lead on the trail of a group of characters: Agent Hoffman (Mandylor), Agent Strahm (Patterson)and Rigg (Bent). Jigsaw intends to teach Rigg that he cannot save everyone and must let people die who are deserving.Donnie Wahlberg's Detective Mathews character gets a small inclusion during the film but very little screen time and the dull and annoying character of Amanda is seen in one three second clip.The plot wavers and breaches into that of II and III with rare glimpses of new ideas, but it's still a lot of fun. The ending is confusing but I'm sure it'll make sense if viewed more than once.We learn a lot more about Jigsaw during the film, and all the pieces which made him what we know him as today.All in all a descent film which is considerably better than III but lacks the psychological edge of 1 and 2.8/10</fullReview>

Various agents, FBI and police as Scott Patterson, Costas Mandylor are going him after. But they must also avoid the deadly traps Jigsaw(Tobin Bell) has set on the way. Meanwhile, a policeman (Lyriq Bent) is being trapped and Jigsaw's wife(Betsy Russell) is detained. Jigsaw writes on walls strange phrases and words captioning : 'Cheerish your life', 'Feel what I feel', Save as I save', 'See what I see'. Jigsaw, who is dead on Morgue where forensic finds a tape in his guts, has become obsessed for revenge and has prepared twisted traps. The group must race against the clock of Jigsaw's on ticket until an impressive final on a factory named Gideon.This fourth sequel from original by James Wan, packs grisly terror, tension, suspense and lots of blood and gore . The film takes accent as suspense as well as well-knit plot full twists and turns and of course abounds terror with creepy use of images-shock and slick edition. Provides an imaginative and well-knit screenplay by Patrick Melton plenty of thrills and surprises . Sinister and mysterious atmosphere , well made by cameraman David Armstrong and eerie musical score adequate for mystery and tension by Charlie Clousier, booth of whom are habitual of franchise. The movie again is starred by Tobin Bell, he's a secondary actor working from the 80s in TV series(Walker Texas Rager, Stargate SG1, Alias, 24) and occasionally for cinema(Goodfellas, The firm, Ruby, Black mask 2), achieving success with Jigsaw character. The motion picture is well directed by Darren Lynn Bousman who also directed Saw III with Dina Meyer, Shawnee Smith and Costas Mandylor; and followed by Saw V directed by David Hacklin with Costas Mandylor, Betsy Russell and of course Tobin Bell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first three movies in the Saw movie are nothing less then graphically entertaining. But, what it feels like now is; that every year, they need to make a Saw movie. Saw IV was nothing special. Sure its still got its graphic and bloody scenes but in order to enjoy and find them suitable is it needs a good plot, good acting, but Saw IV just lacked in those departments. It changed its inner-theme, playing Jigsaw's 'game' all around the city, instead in one 'sickroom' that made Saw so different, and uniquely positive. Saw IV just had that twist, the blood and that's about it. Nothing exciting to keep the suspense holding until the end, I just wanted to watch it until the end so I could find out what the twist was; and it was rather ordinary. Nothing special in Saw IV.</fullReview>

But it also frustrated me on logical grounds so i had to give it a 6.John Kramer is not justified, even with his god forsaken rules, to punish a hardworking police officer for being too ambitious to save others. For God's sake that is his job, this is what he is being paid for. And being ambitious about it is a quality I wish every police officer had. It is really hard for me to get over it. It makes him look desperate and so much not like The Jigsaw.Other than that it is nicely paced and enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An imperfect sequel that, at the very least, serves a purpose.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"This is overkill" - Agent Perez With "Saw III" effectively putting Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) to rest, "Saw IV" opens up on the rather grisly autopsy that follows it. It seems that his work is not done, and John Kramer (a.k.a. Jigsaw) still has some tricks up his pulse-less sleeves. From beyond the grave, he tortures a quickly diminishing police force as well as sending SWAT Commander Rigg (Lyriq Bent) on his own test. Taking a tour of all the new and nasty traps, it appears that even if he wants to, Rigg can't help the would-be victims. It also seems that Jigsaw and his accomplice, Amanda (Shawnee Smith) were not alone: There is a third person still on the loose."Saw IV" is playing a weak hand and it knows it, which I suppose is why this one is much leaner than it's predecessors. The story -- penned by "Feast" scribes Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan -- is pretty basic but more or less efficient at accomlishing two things at once: Being a semi-prequel as well as a continuation of left-over characters from the previous film. In spaces between the current storyline, "Saw IV" is padded out with flashbacks that shed some more light on how John Kramer transformed into Jigsaw, as well as wrapping up a few loose ends. Truth be told, the strongest parts of the film are the flashbacks, and it's a pleasure to watch Tobin Bell do his thing, showing the before and after of what his character eventually became. Perhaps this would have worked better as a prequel? Who knows.The main plot of the story isn't all that engaging when compared to the previous films, and to be honest, doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Time and time again, Rigg is told that he shouldn't try to save the people being tested. You'd think that after the first or maybe second attempts, he would realize what his purpose was. A major plot-hole, if you ask me. Either that, or the character was intended to be really stupid. Regardless, Bent plays the character strongly, making him the most interesting character -- at least presently speaking -- in the film.Returning from "Saw II" and "Saw III" to direct, Darren Lynn Bousman steps up to the plate and injects yet another dosage of effortless style into this sequel. Even though the script is pretty light, he serves it all up with some truly unique imagery. Take the opening autopsy for example, or even the first trap that pits two men -- one blinded and one muted -- against each other. Some truly unsettling imagery is created in these scenes, but in such a stylish, fresh way. Even if some of the other parts of the film feel half-baked, Bousman does his best to make it all look good, at the very least.It's not an overly classy film, but it's certainly a good enough sequel that hits all the expected checkpoints of a "Saw" film and at least lends credibility to the fifth sequel, as well as justifying its own existence in spite of the way "Saw III" went down. Even with the series showing some serious age, it's nice to know that at number four (and now, number five) they can still keep the films somewhat tasteful and enjoyable. It has nothing on the original film or the sequels that precede it, but "Saw IV" is certainly worth a look.</fullReview>

Typical unrealistic plot contrivances that are impossible and just plain stupid. And, as usual, really dopey 'Rube Goldberg' styled murder contraptions that would never actually be invented or exist. (Except in the minds of twisted gross-out filmmakers, which begs the question, what kind of mentally aberrant person would think of such things as fun to show?)Maintains the same totally bizarre logic of the 1st Saw film which presented the wholly ridiculous idea that Jigsaw would lie still without twitching or breathing for multiple hours, then tried to explain it away in absurd fashion in Saw II after the outcry about how dumb that setup was. The series then went downhill from there.Only good if you need something to pass the time while you eat popcorn, then want to puke it up afterwards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of the Saw series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw IV is the best of the series. This is the episode where you get a better understanding why John Kramer is the way he is. The whole film is setup like a intricate tapestry that has elements from the earlier installments interwoven in it.The traps are in a sense beautifully sadistic. Yet this movie isn't about the traps as it more about the psychological aspects of the main character. He is confronted time and time again with his own compulsive behavior (saving people no matter what the cost), which got him (or rather his teammate) into trouble in the earlier Saw in the first place.I'm not sure if this movie has painted the big picture or that this is a small part of a more elaborate setup. One has to appreciate the telescopic nature of this plot. I can't wait to see what they have planned for Saw 5. It is very rare (or maybe this is the only instance) that sequels beyond the first sequel to a movie is nothing more than a superlative.</fullReview>

I had nothing else to do that night so I stuck it on, expecting nothing much. It surpassed my expectations.the ending is much better than the ending of Saw III, but again, the games that Jigsaw presents to his victims are torture-porn gore, totally unrelated to what goes on in the first movie.However, I enjoyed this enough to look forward to Saw V at Halloween. Hopefully, Saw V will be the last one. They can't do anything new here. Jigsaw is dead. His helper (exposed in Saw II) is dead. This one only exists because the twist is, it runs parallel to the events in Saw III. What could Saw V possibly offer that these other sequels haven't already? Nothing but more excuses for torture-violence. Despite my mediocre enjoyment of this tired franchise, I still rate it below average. Unless you're a Saw nut -- in that case, you'll love it!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The small amount of good does not outweigh the messy whole</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although the tagline may involve Halloween being a time for another Saw, I tend to watch the films in the dead days of winter for one reason or another. And Saw IV was no different. And while I was not too impressed with third entry, I think it could be considered brilliant compared to this one.Picking up right where the last left off, Saw IV begins with a rather grotesque autopsy of Jigsaw (Tobin Bell). While doing the autopsy, the coroner discovers a tape, and yes, yet another game begins. Soon after finding the body of Detective Kerry, SWAT Commander Rigg (Lyriq Bent) is thrust into a game to try and save his friends and coworkers. Meanwhile, FBI Profilers Agent Strahm (Scott Peterson) and Agent Perez (Athena Karkanis) are hot on the trail, attempting to put together the pieces of the puzzle Jigsaw has created.Sound a bit convoluted? Try more than just a bit. Whereas the third film went back to the original film's roots, exploring just a few characters, this film goes back to the problems of Saw II in attempting to focus on too many characters all at once. I had a bit of trouble trying to tell at least two characters apart, and had even more trouble attempting to understand the motives everyone brings to the table. Character development is almost non-existent (save for Jigsaw himself, despite beginning and ending the movie as a stiff), and when there appears to be a little bit of a growth for any of the characters, it is either discarded as nothing or brings up even more questions. It is almost like Saw is attempting to be like an episode of Lost, only not as clever and almost as infuriating. I realize that all of the little details and idiosyncrasies seem to be the key to understanding the Saw films, but this film takes them to a level of absurdity usually saved for art-house or bottom dollar horror films.The film relies far too heavily on flashbacks, and relies even more on the memory audiences have of previous films. Select scenes are replayed here and there, but the majority were either explained already or border on overkill. While this continues the motif of the series in trying to be original and unique, rather than descending into the likes of tried, tested and true methods of Halloween, Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street, it also brings the film down more than it should. The writers just do not seem to know how they want to recreate or re-illustrate previous events, and as said previously, seem to make many of them hinge on the most minuscule of references to the other films in the series. It worked for Saw II, and it worked a bit for Saw III, but it is getting very tired now in Saw IV. This film needed to be a readjustment, and a change of pace for the series. And yes, the shocker ending is quite surprising, but only for a few moments. It will leave you more baffled and confused than anything else, and even upon rewatching it, it still does not make too much sense.The violence, while not as profane or as infinite as in Saw III, is a bit more old school here. Yeah, some of the scenes are horribly graphic, but they are a whole lot more in tune with the "less is more" approach of the original Saw. None of the scenes are over the top, and rather surprisingly, the upped ante seems to have been lowered to a broader sense of dare I say, realistic violence. They also seem to have brought back the moralistic approach to the deaths, sadly missed in Saw III.The film's main crutch, and a bit of downer, is the focus on Jigsaw before he became the monstrous psychopath. In ways, it is very much like the reboots of Halloween and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, in that you see him as a nice, misunderstood guy, pushed into a world of depravity and murder. While the subplot here actually works in context with the rest of the series (and does not just make border on a whiney joke of a serial killer like in the other two examples), but Bell does not make it work entirely. This guy is crazy evil (to the point of looking terrifying, even when bedridden and nearly immobile), and seeing him as just a regular John Doe does not cut it. He is not the least bit convincing at it, and although they give the most depth to the film, they are also the worst moments in it. I liked having the history on the character, but I think they could have made it work a whole lot better.The acting, what little there is, is far from great. Bent tries his best, but having a lot of the film resting on him seems to be a little too much of a gamble. I thought he was okay, but was nowhere near as compelling as Angus Macfadyen, Donnie Wahlberg or even the grossly overacting Cary Elwes. Petersen is not given much to do, other than yell and look like a deer caught in headlights, and Karkanis is fairly well useless in the grand scheme of things. I would have liked a bit more of Costas Mandylor as Detective Hoffman, but only because he actually makes an attempt at trying to be good.All in all, Saw IV is the worst film in the series. It does a lot of things really well, but messes up more than it should. I liked that it tried to go back to its roots, but the franchise is starting to show its age. Hopefully Saw V will try and bring something completely unexpected to the table.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm becoming more and more disappointed...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without a doubt, the Saw movies are getting worse and worse. The first Saw was great: it had a plot, an outline, and it wasn't too grotesque. This one, however, was way too gory and had very little outline/plot. The story starts with Jigsaw's autopsy, and yes, they show everything in pretty graphic detail. They show the autopsy for a few minutes, until they get to the stomach, where they find another tape coated in wax. Homicide is called, and the 'game' begins. The acting is mediocre: Scott Patterson, (agent strahm), should stick to the Gilmore Girls. He isn't believable and his dialogue sounds forced. Tobin Bell, Jigsaw, makes the movie, i think...and he's dead! His acting has always been great, but in this Saw, he is just in flashbacks. I don't understand why (well, money of course) they even bothered making Saw IV. Yes, I'm a huge Saw fan, but this saga can't continue forever, especially following this downward spiral. Also, the story is difficult to follow, since it goes back and forth, back and forth. Overall, if you can stomach it, and you're a devoted Saw fan, i guess it's worth seeing. Just be prepared to be disappointed, because previous Saw movies were much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best SAW yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched this yesterday which was our official release date. I was not disappointed. In fact this SAW was the best one yet. The story is very complex and my mate didn't get the ending but I explained it to him. You really have to pay attention during this SAW as it's very complex. There are basically three sub plots going on that are all linked. You have to watch SAW 2 and SAW 3 as a lot of things are linked to those movies in this one. The gore is here but not as much as in SAW 3 which I was thankful for. The traps are more twisted though and some are archaic looking. We also get to find out why Jigsaw traps people and a lot more backstory is revealed. The SAW series is one of my favourite series of movies and this would be a solid 9.2/10 in my mind. It is done very differently compared to the others and the ending left me satisfied unlike 3 where I wanted to immediately find out what would happen next. SAW IV and SAW 2 are the best ones in my opinion and I cannot wait for SAW V. The Games Have Just Begun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confusing flashbacks, thin plot make it the weakest of Saw.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am an avid Saw fan. I have watched all the Saw movies in the theater, and this one was no exception. The first Saw was truly refreshing, a genuine quality thriller movie with one of the most truly shocking endings I have seen. The second Saw wasn't all that good, as the suspense from the first movie was missing, although the twist was still awesome. The third Saw was better than the second one, a bit more dramatic with flashbacks and a little over the top with the traps, but ended the movie with an amazingly strong closure. Now comes Saw 4, which has a near-incomprehensible plot and a messy script, is a decent movie but nothing compared to previous Saw movies.Saw IV focuses most on SWAT Commander Rigg (Lyriq Bent), who is haunted by the loss of his colleagues -- especially Detective Kerry (Dina Meyer) -- at the hands of Jigsaw. Rigg is abducted by Jigsaw's mysterious new helper and finds himself engaged in a game engineered by Jigsaw from beyond the grave. Since Rigg is obsessed with saving people, Jigsaw has set a series of interconnected traps that force Rigg to question his obsession and ask whether people must save themselves.Now to start with a few good points of the movie: the traps are still amazing and inventive, which has always been the strong point of the Saw movies. The whole background story about Jigsaw's past is done well, which gives you a greater depth on his character. That is pretty much it.Now to the problems: the whole idea of mixing flashbacks with concurrent events of the movie is very confusing to the viewer in the first viewing at least, and it is very difficult to follow. The whole purpose and reason of Jigsaw's killings is not even implemented here, as he is killing many innocent people off throughout the movie. The ending, without spoiling anything, is confusing and not satisfactory, as it proves Jigsaw wrong in his theory even more, and doesn't add anything to look forward to, but leaves space for another Saw movie.Overall, this is a decent torture movie, but is stale compared to the other previous Saw movies. Worth the ticket price only for avid series fans, the rest should wait for a rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ENOUGH already, we've seen enough Saws, damnit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this with the same disdain and spiteful attitude that I watched the second season of Heroes and the third season of Prison Break with, just thinking, "ok, let's see how much worse this gets."This series has progressively got worse with each sequel, not only the writing and the story, but the traps. The most iconic thing about Saw are the traps, and they don't even make sense anymore. These traps are about as arbitrary as the placement of those impossibly hidden items in Super Pitfall. The traps used to be clever, and the theme of the trap used to tie in with the recipient of the trap. For example, from Saw 1, a person who had slit his wrists was ironically in a razor wire trap. In Saw 4, a prostitute was in a trap that... rips her scalp off, obviously.The story isn't even coherent anymore. When 90% of the movie is told through flashbacks, you've got a problem. With all these flashbacks, they're creating this false sense of artificially created depth and lore to the characters which is simply not there. You can't just arbitrarily concoct a character's history and customize a story already told by just creating a flashback on the spot and saying, "see, see all that? That's the history on this guy, isn't it interesting what all is going on with him and how it ties in to everything else?" No not really.Parts I hated:**Jigsaw's wife was annoying. She had that one expression the entire movie, that unrealistic sneer on her stupid little face.**When that one cop lady got shot through her mandible with that bow and arrow, the two other cops' reactions weren't realistic, they didn't appear as startled as they should be after witnessing something so gruesome.**In general, I hate how this series now relies on gore to scare you. It's no longer the clever writing, the atmosphere, or the logical traps, now it's just relying on showing you the uncensored dismantling of the human body to creep you out.**Isn't it about time they done away with that little camera effect they use where it speeds up and does that panning 360 or whatever around the person/trap and then slows down. Isn't that just a bit old now? No?**The guy named Rigg that's going around trying to save everyone- so basically he wants to save everyone's life, and has the kind of disposition and values that drive him to do that, yet this same guy would put another human being in a TORTURE DEVICE? I'm not saying I wouldn't do it (whether the unlucky person was a rapist or not), I'm saying, these two actions should be mutually exclusive. A person who's sooo blindly caught up in having to save the lives of all these people he's coming across, yet he's twisted enough to knowingly put another person into a device that will most likely leave them significantly lighter by several pounds? I don't buy it. You're either the kind of person that does one or the other, but not both.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as the third one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, things are shaping up...vaguely. The third SAW was an underwhelming and pretentious load of crap, and this one at least takes the gore to a new level, with several excellent traps and gore scenes which draw more heavily from Se7en than ever.I don't know if we'll be able to accurately rate this series until it's finally over, because there is just too much going on here to predict where anything is going anymore. We have several plot lines racing ahead at full speed, and a few which have not even been touched yet. This has so much potential, and I have to say I expected much, much worse. This isn't even really a horror movie; more like some sort of pulpy "whodunit" crime thriller at times, and I think I like that aspect of it quite a lot, combined with the fast pace of things.The biggest flaw though, is the fact that this movie only looks good from far away - when you take a closer look, you realize how calculated and unrealistic it all is, and how ridiculous some of the aspects of the story seem. Same thing as the others, though, really. Oh, and I must mention that the ending of this one was pretty bad, being pretty much exactly the same as all the others - try something new already! The "new Jigsaw" really came from left field and doesn't seem like that great of a character either, but I will give him time.Not great, but not terrible either. If you hated the others, you'll hate this one too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Horror Franchise Out There</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a person who was born in the month of October, I don't have to tell you how many times my birthday and Halloween were a combined event. So needless to say, the horror movie genre is by far my favorite. Being sentimental kept me hung up on the Halloween franchise (we both began in 1978), but as I got older, blood for the sake of blood just wasn't cutting it anymore. Pun intended. In my adulthood, I needed to know, why is the bad guy doing what he does? Why is he bad? Why am I seeing all this blood? And my tired eyes needed more than just a knife for all that dirty work. Finally, the Saw franchise started. The first one blew me away with the wickedly twisted ending of Jigsaw being in the now infamous Saw bathroom the entire time. The second and third ones went a step further by introducing Amanda as an accomplice to Jigsaw's traps, most notably the Bathroom Trap. But I'd have to say the fourth one is my favorite in the franchise. Two reasons. The Trap for the rapist. I don't know of a single woman not clapping her hands and screaming "Yeah!" at that scene in the theatre. The other, how even after just watching the first three prior to going to the theatre, I was still shocked out of my seat at the end. I simply cannot wait for V, VI, VII...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful movie with awful plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I went to cinema for Saw 4 i though of fun as like as SAW 3, but this "movie" couldn't even match it.The beginning is really cool(thats one of the reasons i gave it a 2), the film starts and you are amazed how they made continuing from saw 3,where jigsaw died, to saw 4. But thats all, there the fun ends, and starts the screaming and you just try to realize why they scream, the camera works shows nothing, all is in pitch black, the important things are shown for a second...and the end??don't won't to include spoiler, but it's just disappointing.All in all a poor movie from a very good trilogy. If you don't won't to be disappointed from saw as a whole, don't watch this one!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I went to the theaters;I thought this would be the worst in the Saw series because Jigsaw and Amanda were dead,I was wrong.First of all,when you are going to see Saw 4,understand this pay attention to the movie because, if you don't; you won't understand sh*t.The movie starts off with Jigsaw's autopsy which is really gory.Then we have Rigg back,there where investigating why are all the officers were disappearing.Then all of a sudden Rigg gets kidnapped,He wakes up in his apartment's bathroom;as soon as he opened his door;the game began.The game was that if Rigg didn't get to the destination in exactly in 90 minutes;Eric Matthews would die.In the game Jigsaw tested Rigg's moral judgement.Saying things like See What I SEE,FEEL WHAT I FEEL,I'm not gonna go to every exact detail;because it ruin the excellence of this movie.I just gotta say please watch this movie;no movie in 2007 had such a great storyline.This movie contains it all,from gore to great traps to the biggest shocker in Saw history.This ins't over;I assure that Jigsaw's work will continue!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fairly decent fourth instalment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a surprise as I really wasn't sure what to expect. The track record for horror movies hasn't been very good this year (Hostel Part 2, Captivity and Paradise Lost were all rubbish, with only 28 Weeks Later succeeding in the scares department) let alone the forth instalment of a franchise that many critics think should have ended with the first film. When you get to a "part 4" what are we to expect? Just look at similarly placed films in the past. A Nightmare on Elm Street 4? Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter (it still spawned six more sequels)? Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers? By this point these movies have dwindled into self parody or are just plain bad. So the prospect of another Saw movie, a fourth Saw movie no less, wasn't looking too good.But surprisingly enough it actually turns out that it isn't really all that bad. Are there things wrong with it? You bet there is. There are a LOT of things wrong with it, but, at the same time, it isn't a total failure either.There is one thing however that acts both as a hindrance and a saving grace. Being only a measly 90 minutes long, the producers and screenwriters seem to think that they need to answer all the questions in this instalment as well as ask more. As such, it means that there's a hell of a lot going on in this movie and, a lot of the time, it doesn't always make a lot of sense. Why cram so much in when it's been publicised that there will be at least six of these movies (released October 2008 and 2009 respectively). Surely there's enough room to keep fans guessing? Not everything needs to be answered all at once.It also becomes apparent that the screenwriters were uninterested with some of said questions raised in part III and have decided to skip over them quickly (most notably the conclusion of Jeff's story from the previous film). This is the first movie not to be scripted by co-creator Leigh Whannell (who played Adam in the original) and it shows. These new boys obviously feel like a couple of kids in a candy store and have gone totally wild. This ain't necessarily a bad thing, but it ain't good either, as it creates a mish-mash of ideas, too many, in fact, to be contained within the film's short running time. How can we care about any of the characters when we only focus on them for two minutes at a time? You know there's something wrong when the most interesting character in the film spends 90% of it tied up waiting to die (for Saw fans: I'm not talking about Detective Matthews).But, as I said earlier, this busyness also becomes the movies good point. It's a mess and a confusing one at that, but with so much going on it's very hard to get bored. I did find some characters more interesting than others (Sergeant Rigg = Zzzzzzzzzzzzzz, Agent Strahm = Yay!) but with such a short space of time between each interlinking story-arch (I counted four separate storeys), you never have to wait too long before your favourite characters are back on screen, doing their thang.And the traps seem to be more back to basics. The great thing about the original was that the traps seemed plausible, you could imagine someone making them, setting them up and executing them (no pun intended) perfectly. Each new instalment though has required the audience to suspend belief more and more to the point where, when it came to the third film (which I actually quite enjoyed) they were just idiotic. This film though shows Jigsaw at the time of his change from mild mannered engineer to full blown psychopath, thus we get too see his early "test subjects". The knife chair trap is just nasty.Not only that but even the later traps during Rigg's test have been stripped down to the bare elements. Rather than a crucifix like machine twisting limbs till they break (I mean c'mon, does that sound believable to you?) we have an abusive husband and his wife impaled back to back and, most disturbingly, two men trapped in a room, attached to a device that'll break their necks. Not too bad I hear you say? But one of them has had his eyes sown shut and the other his mouth. Communication would seem quite difficult I think.It's the simplicity of these traps that makes them all the more disturbing. By the third film you were almost laughing at how implausible it would be to make these things thus it detracted you from the sheer horror of the idea. And let's be fair, horror is supposed to be just that: horrific. When you suspend disbelief too much, you loose your grip and your target audience.It wont be giving away too much to say it leaves it open for the next film, but hopefully they will learn from this one and take more care with Saw V. Whether anyone will still be interested by that point is yet to be seen but so long as the money keeps rolling in (it opened at No: 1# in America) I'm sure we will see more of these films. "Coming 2019: Saw XVI: Jigsaw Takes on Slough". You get the picture.If you like your horror gruesome with a whit on ingenuity, this'll be for you. Otherwise stay away.3/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Go See It For Yourself.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not going to lie. After seeing SawIII last year, I was ready for this to come out. I honestly sat and waited for the site to launch in mid-June and and continued to count down the days for premiere date 10-26-2007. On that day, I logged into Fandango.com and prepaid the tickets, because as I anticipated, the showings were sold out as soon as the box office opened that day. The hype was built on myself alone, for I, as many of you, are true Saw fans. Well now you are logging into sites such as IMDb.com and Rotten Tomatoes to find that, while the movie was popular in sales, did not fare to well in the eyes of the critics.And so you find yourself asking yourself, do I continue my tradition and see the movie, or sit it out and and wait for the DVD? My challenge to you is to ignore any opinions, and word of mouth that you have heard, and be a true Saw fan, once again.As always, I don't sit here and hype the movie up more, nor do I spoil the movie for others. Today I address you my friends, and fellow franchise fanatics alike,to tell you to go and see this movie. It really is a true Saw film, and as any Saw film there are things that we will not understand, question, and challenge in possibility. Get ready for the same mental torture as the end of the movie does suggest that we can anticipate a 5th chapter, and as a loyal Saw fan, I will be there as always.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Major mistakes in timeline?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give the movie a 5 out of ten only because I don't know that I fully understand the movie yet although I'm fairly sure the producers missed a major mistake. Let me know if you can prove otherwise because I'm truly curious as to whether or not I'm just misinterpreting it...I understand that the beginning of the movie was actually designed to take place at the end of the following events, proving jigsaw will continue his exploits even in death. But, throughout the movie, characters said several things suggesting they already know that jigsaw and his accomplice from the third movie were dead. An example of this was referring to suspects as "copycats," never even examining the possibility that jigsaw himself was the killer. This suggests they knew he was already dead. If this isn't enough, upon finding the body of a female cop who was a member of their team, the police make note of the fact that it couldn't possibly have been jigsaw's female accomplice from Saw III because she was "107 pounds and too small to have hoisted the body up herself." This suggests that the police had already found her body. Now if all this is correct (and it may not be) then why would the bodies of jigsaw and his accomplices remain in the room which they died to be found at the end of Saw IV???? Now assume this is all incorrect and this isn't the way the timeline worked. Say the discovery of the cassette in jigsaw's stomach DID set off the chain of events that are Saw IV...How could he have been on an autopsy table AND be in the room he and his female accomplice died in during Saw III at the end of Saw IV? If anyone has any feedback or can clarify please let me know. My email is rtbr222@comcast.net</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oops, they bled it again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You don't need me to tell you that the blood and guts in Saw IV is, well, a bit grotesque. After all, the torture series has made evisceration its bread and butter, if you will, and it's probably a little bit late to slap that sin back into Pandora's Box. So, Saw = gore. Presumably, if you've read even this far, you're all in for goopy blood and entrails and whatnot. It's your bread and butter too, you see.So Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) and his faithful companion Amanda (Shawnee Smith) are no longer among the living, but their "work" lives on, in an unending conga line of sequels. In this one, two veteran FBI agents join the local cops to try to figure out who's killing cops, especially with the supposed mastermind quite sincerely deceased.As with the first three movies, people are maimed and killed in variously creative ways, all part of some posthumous scheme cooked up by Jigsaw. Or by some accomplice who's carrying on the evil work. The good news? It's all interconnected with the events of Saw III. The bad news? Saw III was somewhat confusing, and this one blows it out of the water in terms of murkiness and who the hey is doing what and when. But we do see a lot of the same basic concepts, like a victim wakes to find himself in some sort of diabolical trap, and he must suffer incredible pain if he wants to live. I have to admit that the devices themselves - and the plots they forward - are pretty ingenious. In one scene, a husband and wife wake to find themselves impaled on a series of sharp sticks. That is, a stick enters the woman's body and exits, and then enters the man's body. The backstory is that she was physically abused by him for many years, and now she literally holds his life in her hands. She can live, but only if she removes the sticks, and by doing so his vital organs are skewered. Awesome stuff.But at its heart, this is a revenge movie. Revenge of Jigsaw for the wrongs he'd suffered. In IV, we find out a heck of a lot more about John's life story, what made him who he is. In fact, we learn he has/had an ex-wife, who makes an extended experience here. Can the ex-wife jokes, you guys out there. She's actually a good guy in this one. I think. It's hard to tell, the plot's so convoluted. You did something wrong to Jigsaw? You die violently. Cut him off at the supermarket? Dinged his car in the parking lot? Littered on his part of the sidewalk? Man, you are so dead.Meanwhile, all the cops and agents are trying desperately to find out where the actual Jigsaw headquarters is, because the killings continue - and one of their own is missing. Well, more than one, actually; one's been gone six months. But another just vanished, and for some reason the men in blue think he's the one behind everything. They may have a point, since as they follow his trail the bodies pile up. And, as I said, each victim has been selected for a specific reason. Man, if Jigsaw put as much effort into saving the world as he did in killing people off, we'd be pretty set.This ain't for the squeamish, certainly. First scene is Jigsaw being cut open during an autopsy, and no sight is worse, perhaps, than seeing the skull sawed open, the skin flapped down, the brain removed... Eww. It's a big fat eww, and it's not the only one. If I were you, I wouldn't eat anything sticky or squishy while watching this - parts of it make Hostel seem like Herbie the Love Bug.The biggest caveat is that the plot is a little tough to follow, since your mind is overwhelmed by all the carnage. At one point during the final ten minutes or so, a character appears whom I swear I didn't even recognize, and that's because some of the events of IV run parallel, timewise, to those in III. Saw III was so last year, so I didn't remember the character.Overall, though, there is no substantial dropoff in quality from III to IV. Or even, really, from II to IV; the first one still reigns supreme, but that's partly because it was all fresh for us back then, and the others have had to live up to that film's standard. IV manages to hold its own; good thing, too, since it's very likely we'll see a V and a VI.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SAW IV might actually be the best and most intelligent of them all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SAW IV in my opinion is the most intelligent of the Saw's. People don't seem to like it cuz they were expecting more, or differntly. It's a good think i went in with an open/clear/free mind and just let it come to me, rather than search for things. The twists are really genius when you really-really-really think about it. No it's not like 'oh my god!' after the twist of the first one, but this one makes you think long and hard long after it ends, and when you realize the beauty of it, it truly is the best twist(s) (spoiler:) And i hate how people say they predicted it...so your saying you knew that if Rigg entered the door, Eric's head would get smashed by giant ice blocks, and that the 4th was going on the same time as the 3rd...? OK, yeah. I dare you to watch all the movies again, and see the 4th in theatres again if your a hater, and then really judge it...it's a smart movie that makes people mad cuz they're not smart enough to accept the fact a sequel, let alone a 4th film in a franchise can be really excellent. Fantastic movie that has become my favorite. WOW!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw 4, is sawfly good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Continueing after Jigsaw's death, this movie follows officer Rigg, who has played a minor role in the previous 2 films (and didn't show up in the first one). With Jigsaw dead, the traps are set and Rigg has to make his way through the tests in order to fulfill his 'obsession'. With having to deal with Jigsaw and Amanda out of working order, they really make the movie worth seeing by bringing in the new characters to work with. Even though some just came in in this installment, you feel like you've been cheering them on since the first. Saw IV was a genius and intriguing movie that equals out with all of the others. Unlike Saws 1 and 2, this has fine acting from all aspects. Even with Rigg, who we never really got to see shine, played his role well. The gore factor is not as bad as the third one, and the traps go back to the basics, which make them even more disturbing. Each component in the mechanisms are carefully placed to really bring the realism out of the film. I definitely recommend seeing this flick, this one isn't just a blood infested movie, but just a good movie in general. As the movies plays out, you keep catching on to the little surprises and see the development of all the characters. And like the hunt we all take part in, trying to find jigsaw's new apprentice, characters from the movie help us out by taking part in the search. Bringing in new clues, and unravel mysteries of Jigsaw's work. The ending, like always, is intense and will leave you speechless. Again, this is a good movie, and even better, a good saw movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jigsaw fits the name well 'cause this is a jumbled mess.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw 1 is the only suspenseful and well-made movie out of the whole series. Who cares why a weird old man with a raspy voice feels like making people cherish their lives? I'll tell you...for Hollywood to make money out of gore and pointless twists.What made this movie so hard to like is the fact it was so jumbled, you don't know what's going on at parts. It flashes back, goes back, goes 3 scenes back and such. Also, the gore is ridiculous. Whoever comes up with the games of torture is sick in the head, let alone to start the movie with showing the performance of an autopsy (which really shouldn't be shown in a movie).I can barely remember the plot except - Some detective is put in a game for being obsessed and ends up being the hope for Eric and Hoffman, while some other investigators try to go back and find out about Jigsaw, his past, and why he decided to do this crap. Eh, one of those movies you can live without seeing.</fullReview>

I liked the part of the ex-wife in the movie also,, very keen,, also these victims and their crimes are more related to john or officer riggs more than all the other Saw's,, they show Jigsaw's workshop,, all the cool stuff, way decent thumbs hi up in the air for this saw..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lets get down to the point and examine all the negative attributes of this film.1. Why do they keep making references to prior saw movies? As if anyone remembers, it just makes it more confusing. And its plenty confusing on its own.2. Not only does john kramer have to be a genius to be able to carry out his plans, but also a magician, a psychic and a zombie because everything seems to work out perfectly even after he's dead. Hello!!!! He's dead, you don't have to do what he wants anymore. Put the stupid tape player down and go home. Are you really telling me that this guy can convince lawyers, detectives, cops, and doctors to do everything that he wants? After he's dead even? Even if that were possible, his plans have to follow through 100%, or else it all falls apart. Manipulative storytelling? Its the only way it can work.3. Its confusing, everything is intertwined somehow. The lawyer sets up the detective, the detective sets up the cop, the cop sets up everybody else, 3 of the detectives look exactly alike. There's flashback after flashback mixed in with events that seem to be taking place in the present. Dead victims from saw 3 keep reappearing adding to the confusion, and all the while it was the detective (that looks like the other 2 detectives) who is behind it all because he found another tape recorder in jigsaws stomach after they autopsied him. Apparently during the third movie, when everyone got up to use the bathroom, jigsaw ate the tape recorder. Are they just going to keep adding more and more scenes to the other saw movies just to make sure that the current one makes sense? Its bad enough that your movie sucks, but leave the other ones alone.It eventually gets dull and monotonous, you don't care who lives or who dies. You just want it all to end. I'm hoping that this will be the end of the saw movies, it is for me.The only cool thing about this movie are the contraptions that jigsaw keeps making. Thats the only reason I gave this movie 2 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! This is the best Saw sequel in the series. Okay, I've read some reviews of Saw 4 already it seems that fans seem think that Saw 3 had no twist. Saw 3 did have a twist. The twist was the game was for Amanda not the doctor as it's told in the film. The other twist was the Doctor's husband was going to take over for John and play a game to get his daughter back. Now that problem is cleared up here's my review of Saw 4.Saw 4 is the best horror film of the year. Even better than "30 days of Night". The movie was very well written with lots of twists and turns. Who knew a detective was going to continue the John's work. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time! At the beginning of the film shows the autopsy of John and the a doctor finds a tape in his stomach. The detective figures that someone will continue his life's work even though he's dead. The question is who is it? If you've seen the Saw 3 you would assume it's the person who killed John at the end. However it's not. What a huge shocker that was! That's all I have to say but this is the best time I've had at the movie's in a long,long, time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw IV Movie Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If the first sequel to Saw was running on fumes, Saw IV is out of gas. Lionsgate has squeezed out every last drop of creative ingenuity the first surprise, horror hit promised by forcing out enough cookie cutter sequels that they couldn't go anywhere else but start back at the beginning.With Jigsaw dead, who will go on to continue the mad serial killer's work of forcing those who do not value their lives to choose between death and grueling torture? That's the catch Lionsgate is hoping to entice audiences on with their fourth entry in this tired horror franchise, and aside from that plot point Saw IV is literally an empty vessel designed to suck the last few pennies from the series remaining fans' wallets.Luckily Saw IV doesn't break the grizzly realism of the series by opting for a supernatural finale, choosing the cliché route and raising their villainous main character from the dead. However director Darren Lynn Bousman and screenwriters Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan failed to deliver on their months of hype promising a satisfying solution to this seemingly unsolvable narrative obstacle. Audiences will groan as they suddenly realize that not only did the filmmakers manipulate the time and spatial aspects of the picture's structure, but they literally rehashed one of the series' biggest twists.While Saw IV does bring several of Bousman's sequels full circle and dives deeper into John Kramer's psyche, it does little in the way of revitalizing the failing franchise. While this installment's traps are indeed creative, Saw IV still utilizes the same hacked up, music video editing that its predecessors employed in their attempts to fuel intensity. However with the influx of torture porns that audiences have been hit with since James Wan's original Saw, what once seemed to be an aggressive style is now passé and strained.Interestingly enough, while Bousman doesn't dare touch the technique surrounding the presentation of the traps which has made the Saw franchise such a lucrative commodity, he has managed to improve his ability to create suspense in other ways. When the director lets the camera slow down and breathe, reminding audiences of the terrifying abduction sequences in the original Saw, the picture verges on a refreshing, and sometimes even terrifying new take. Employing several Hitchcockian techniques, like the overtly noticeable ticking clock, Bousman has made several marked improvements within the confines of his stale parameters.However this exhilaration quickly fades, as the picture quickly slips back into the routine method of its predecessors. In fact the traps are arguably the least interesting part of the latest Saw film; rather it is the human drama surrounding how Jigsaw could possibly be continuing his work carries the picture.Sadly though, even this promising glimmer of the franchise being reborn is a marked disappointment. The whole film rides on the ending being a success, and the rehashed clincher is sure to send the delicate balance that the series has been "seesawing" on for the last three years to come crashing to the ground.The pace at which Lionsgate has cranked out Saw films is truly remarkable; however the quality of the pictures has lessened with each passing entry. Bousman does his best to improve his film-making skills with Saw IV, but it is time for not only the young director, but everyone involved with the franchise to move on. However, as the box-office receipts indicate, this isn't the last time we will see Jigsaw's blade spinning. The only thing more devastating than the announcement of a fifth and sixth installment of the series is coming to the realization that critic's will be forced to find even more reasons as to why Saw needs to stop buzzing.-Joe Russo</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The absolute best of the franchise thus far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Jigsaw died, I had a feeling the franchise would be over. Then I heard studios green-lighted Saw IV BEFORE Saw III was even made, and I thought oh god, not another one. I had my doubts, but listening to the commentary on Saw III assured me they had a plan.And what a plan it was.So far, it seems all the Saw movies have had one prevailing theme to them. Saw II: Patience. Saw III: Forgiveness. Saw IV: Self Preservation. The most vital theme involves people in traps saving them self.Thus is where Lieutenant Rigg is tested, the black cop who has been in all the Saw movies, and seen all his partners die. The film makes it clear right away that Rigg's problem is he cares too much---he wants to save everyone, and everyone (from Jigsaw to his wife) is telling him he can't save everyone.Alongside this, two other story lines go on, including a Lawyer who survived Jigsaw's first test, being put in a second, and flashbacks showing John Kramer's (Jigsaw) life before the events of the series, with his wife Jill, and his job as an engineer. We see what causes him to change, and leave his wife, and eventually (as well as getting cancer) sets about his games, where he personally witnesses his first victim succeed, only to blow it and try to attack Jigaw---to then get himself killed by his own stupid actions.Despite all that's happened, Saw IV has plenty of twists and surprises, including the ultimate shocking turn involving Rigg's game, which I won't reveal here even though I checked the spoiler alert. It's simply too juicy.The events of the film (sans flashbacks) happen simultaneously to the events in Saw III, with the final autopsy shown in the beginning of the movie to set the tone, and to assure people Jigsaw truly IS dead.The gore? Plentiful. It manages to improve upon its predecessors (as the movies always have) without getting overly excessive. The gore isn't there just to gross out or entertain the audience, and is rather tastefully handled, giving it an edge for realism as well as art. The traps are nothing garishly out there, but definitely some of the most creative in the entire franchise.As with Saw III, potentially the goriest, most shock-inducing scene involves Jigsaw himself. Where in Saw III, it was the live, amateur brain surgery, Saw IV steps it up with a live autopsy complete with the nauseating buzz of saws, cracks of bone, and squishing of still-wet flesh and organs, which resemble a true autopsy.For the sake of quashing dreams of fan service, I will safely spoil by saying Dr Gordon is NOT tied to Jigsaw in any further way (though that would remain to be seen for the next two Saws) and both Jigsaw and Amanda are dead.With the series running the risk of being milked by greedy executives into oblivion, the writers/director of the series show that they are masters of the craft of not only modern shock horror but noirish storytelling as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>May contain little spoilers Now first let me say I was the type to go on all these sites all the time and really looking forward to this movie. True maybe it was all the hype for me, but after watching it I was disappointed. The traps were designed to be gory but some were almost funny (Cecil was hilarious, everyone in the movie were busting up), and yet they led that one to be the worst, and even have Tobin Bell say during an interview before it came out "All I'm gonna say is Cecil God be with you" and the fat hotel guy that trap was intense but watching what he did on that TV in the room while the trap was going on was worse than the trap lol. The ending yes was a "twist", but they could of done a lot better I thought. I'd say 60% of the people in the theater at the end booed, 20% cheered and another 20% just didn't know how to react. I went to Saw fest and after watching all 4 as far as gore goes its probably the 2nd best (after Saw 3), but as far as movie goes is the worst I think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw 4 is actually amazing. I have been a huge fan of the saw series since saw came out. Saw 4, actually is just what Saw is all about. It shows you amazing traps and it also shows the true reason for jigsaw. It was a fast passed movie, but it kept you wanting more. I recommend to see saw 4 if you like the saw movies. The acting was better than in the first two and it just makes you think WTF. Also Saw 4 does not ruin the whole Saw series, it actually makes it better.SPOILERS..My favorite part was when Eric gets his head smashed by the ice cubes. And there will be a Saw 5. there has to be a saw 5. If there isn't, It just ends really weird. Hoffman is the new Saw, you find that out at the end, it was obvious but at the same time, you are like wow thats awesome.GO SEE SAW 4! IM SURE IT WON'T Disappoint YOU!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know why people are complaining, this film was just as good as the others!!! it contained everything that all the others had- the characters, the traps, the good twists and a good story. The only thing i saw wrong with it was, they were trying to cram a little to much into this film, which felt like it was slightly rushed- other than that i thought it was great! I would even go as far as saying it's my second favourite in the series, just under Saw 2 (which was the best) What i like so much about this film is that it explains almost everything that was left unanswered in the previous ones!!! Also it was extremely clever like the previous ones, and it was the first one that I didn't really catch on to anything until the end- if you haven't seen it already.... SEE IT NOW!!! :D</fullReview>

There was some spark that kept you relatively interested.Well Saw IV is the most unimaginative, dull, horrendously tedious, dragged on, messed up, dumb sequel yet. This seriously makes Hostel Part II look like an impressive achievement.Jigsaw is dead, but the traps are still set. Wow! I couldn't care less who dies or lives, all I wanted was for this film to end, it was unbearably boring.The bad cinematography, laughable acting and script along with the non-existent storyline, make SAW IV one of 2007 very, very, very worse offerings.All I can say is that I can't wait for SAW V!

		<shortDescription>SAW 4: It's a Crock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the opposite of a spoiler - it's a "Do me a favor".I utterly loved Saw 1. Blown away by it. And I'm a huge horror fan -16yrs of dark love.I liked SAW 2 very much. They tried a new tack on the same ground. I wondered if I had been injected with "idiot drug #9" when I watched SAW 3. This was neither scary nor very chilling, nor a mental challenge - Why was this a SAW film?? "Suffering." Yes it was - hoping that Whannell and Bousmann would only put their names to a good film - and finding out that they REALLY like cash.I couldn't even tell you why I bothered with SAW 4. It's tag line should have said "It's a joke" not "It's a trap". Although it is a trap - I went back - so it's a Hope Trap. Bastards. Why are we concerned about any aspect of any character in this film - And what happened to Dr Gordon for Christs sake? What other possible issue is there in this series if they're going to pretend it's all connected? Why have they been moving characters sideways and backwards instead of onward and upward?How it should have been marketed SAW 4: Deus Ex Machina_The Granduer. "Leave everything to chance, coincidence and 11th hour tactics" What's next in SAW 5?Hoffmann has a twin? With a deformity who was picked on as a child? Who was a puzzle genius? That met Kramer in Hospital under the care of Dr Gordon? That has a hook for a hand? And used to go out with Amanda when she was a user? Here's the log line: SAW V: Where Parodies-of-selves-go-to-die.I am forced to pen the script for SAW 3 as it should have been. And re-release it as SAW III v2.0. Hopefully the faithful from SAW will understand what I have to do and follow me back off the beaten track into the nasty world of fiendishly ironic punishment and sledge hammer twists.I think this is the only time I would watch the next installment of the Aptly Named "Franchise".Chronically heart broken and disappointed. At least Hellraiser, Evil Dead and Nightmare On Elm Street got three right before going south.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It took only one viewing and hours and hours of discussion to finally get this movie. It was amazing. The writing fits perfectly into the series and the acting is definitely better than the first two. Some questions get solved like the meaning behind the doll and the pigs and the other accomplice helping Jigsaw, as well as the fate of Eric Mathews and how John turned into the Jigsaw Killer...but it leaves the viewer asking more questions than it answers. I counted at least 15 questions left up for the writers to solve and that's with a single viewing...Let me just say this once...every synopsis, every critic, every website says blatantly "Jigsaw and his apprentice are dead....yet people who watch this are confused about it....they are dead...dead, dead, dead...yes this movie has tons of twists and turns, probably as much as the first 3 had put together...but I love the fact that these guys came up with such a complex movie in the midst of some horrible movies in the genre...watch it more than once, PLEASE watch the first 3 before seeing this one, and it will make much more sense to you. It's not perfect by any means, maybe the final one where everything raps up will get a 10/10 by me, but this one starts and holds you until the very last scene...then leaves you hanging excited for next Halloween...after all 6 or 7 come out i doubt that anyone will ever be like "Oh hey wanna watch Saw 4?" but thats because it wasn't made to be a stand alone movie...it was made to be a bridge between the originals, and its new direction...and in that sense it works just fine...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Straight-Up Horror Film of the Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fresh off the success of last year's big moneymaker, Saw III, Twisted Pictures and Lionsgate have found themselves another smash in the excellent Saw IV. A truly sick, demented movie with a great kooky cast of characters and a delectable new script from Feast writers Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan, Saw IV continues the horror franchise at the peak of its popularity with loads of twists and turns, and plenty of things to keep the fans happy. This fourth installment stars Lyriq Bent, Tobin Bell, Betsy Russell, Scott Patterson, Donnie Wahlberg, and several other returning cast members in the most entertaining and by far goriest installment yet. The film is directed by Darren Lynn Bousman.Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) and his apprentice Amanda (Shawnee Smith) are dead. In the wake of Detective Kerry's murder (Dina Meyer), two FBI profilers and veteran Detective Hoffman try to piece all of the clues together to find SWAT Commander Rigg (Lyriq Bent) before it's too late. Along the way, lots of details about Jigsaw's past are discovered, and his ex-wife, Jill (Betsy Russell), becomes a potential suspect.Tobin Bell once again delivers a breathtaking performance as the newest icon of horror with his deep, distinctive voice and great acting chops. He really makes each Saw movie just that much better, and this time is no exception. He is given lots of screen time in this installment, and it's all used to flesh out the very interesting backstory of Jigsaw, including his very first trap. Lyriq Bent is quite likable as the lead character, and brings just the right amount of likability and charisma to Rigg. I personally think he has a big career ahead of him. Donnie Wahlberg plays Detective Matthews so well, as if he is just so used to his character after being in three Saw films. He might have incredibly limited screen time, but he does a magnificent job. All of the actors and actresses contribute greatly to make this movie how great it is.Darren Lynn Bousman directs the slickest and coolest Saw yet with so many intricate shots and camera angles. It's really easy to become completely immersed in the situations and feelings of the characters because of the spectacular directing and cinematography. The grimy locations, the dark warehouses, and the dimly-lit rooms all make for incredibly ideal surroundings and settings. The writing provided some new and much needed creativity to this series, and it managed to fit things together so perfectly that it's a wonder anyone ever doubted how good this film would be. The entire Saw franchise just works so perfectly as a whole, especially when you watch all of the films back-to-back. Everything connects so well, and the tiny plot holes that are scattered throughout will no doubt be answered in Saw V or Saw VI. The quality of these films has still not wavered at all yet, which is extremely rare to find in a series that goes over three films. The fourth movie is usually when you start hitting all sorts of bumps and mistakes everywhere, but it's certainly not the case with Saw IV.As always, the traps and the gore in the Saw movies are, for many fans, the most important part, and this film is no exception. Didn't think it could get any gorier than Saw III? Saw IV begs to differ. Knives, scalp pulling, electrocution, and spears are only a taste of the horrors that plague some of the characters; my personal favorite was a trap that involved lots of ice. Fans of the franchise have also come to expect a certain quality about the twists in the movie, and there are certainly plenty here. There is no lack of shocks or scares, and when it comes to the twists and turns, they just keep splendidly piling on. While the ending of the original Saw still remains one of the best twist endings in all of modern film, Saw IV's shocking conclusion really stays with you and leaves you shivering in anticipation for the moment when Saw V will finally be in theaters, which feels like so very far away.Saw IV does not disappoint in any way, shape, or form, and is terrifyingly close to being the best installment in the series. The gore, the characters, the twists, and the traps are all simply great, and this film is without a doubt the best horror film of the year, right up there next to Grindhouse and 28 Weeks Later. One can only hope that Saw V will be able to surpass the fourth one or be, at the very least, even half as good. As long as the plot continues to impress, the movies continue to connect, and the quality never wavers, you can always count me in for the next Saw.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another successful Saw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been reading a lot of comments regarding this movie and saying it wasn't good, but I definitely have to disagree. The Saw franchise, through this movie, is definitely starting to reinvent itself and I believe that this is the beginning of the next series of SAW movies.This may contain some spoilers; i am not going into any details, but may allude to some things in the movie.We all know that jigsaw couldn't live forever. If a movie had the same villain in it sequel after sequel; it just wouldn't keep the ideas fresh. There had to be a sequel that turned the face of the franchise but also kept fans interested in the series. SAW IV, I believe does just that.With Jiggsaw gone, he leaves a tape saying "the games have just begun" and that someone would be there to carry on his work. From there you learn that certain traps in previous movies couldn't have been done solely by Amanda, so there has to be another apprentice; an apprentice that could have been doing a lot more then we were led onto believe before.As the movie unfolds, loose ends are tied up and you learn a lot more about Jiggsaw's past. His wife (or Ex-wife) is introduced and even though she doesn't say much throughout the movie, you can't help but think she could be involved in something. Im walking away from the movie thinking she could be.Anyway, as the movie progresses you realize that someone is actually pulling the strings in the entire operation as well as setting the traps. Loose ends are tied up at the conclusion of the movie but new twists are also created leaving you wanting SAW V to come out right now.What I love most about this series is that all of the movies have been quality movies. Sometimes franchises get stale after a couple of movies and I believe SAW has not only avoided that, but also left fans in anticipation of the next installment. I can't wait!</fullReview>

I was reading a lot of peoples comments over the past year that were saying that whats the point in making another saw film cause all the main characters were dead. I thought the same after a while but when i went to see this film they were all dead wrong. The twists and turns to the gruesome traps right up to the end of the film was great. Also it was great to see a cameo from Donnie wharlberg too.

		<shortDescription>'Saw IV' works best when we look to the past, and is at it's worst in the present</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2004, we got Saw. In 2005, we got Saw II. In 2006, we got Saw III. Faced with the death of Jigsaw in Saw III, the producers, heading into Saw IV, knew that they were going to have to change how the films would play out. So, faced with Leigh Whannell (writer of the first three Saw films) departing the series as it's writer, they hired new writers and continued on, creating the fourth Saw film. How does the film compare to previous Saw films? And how does it do at creating a Saw film where Jigsaw is no longer a major player? Let us find out.Saw IV follows Lieutenant Daniel Rigg as he is put through several tests rigged by Jigsaw, designed to get Rigg to see what Jigsaw himself sees in the people he tests, while at the same time, Agents Strahm and Perez try to figure out Jigsaw's game before it becomes too late.Saw IV is a enigma, to me. The storyline that is told by Betsy Russell, as Jill Tuck, John Kramer's wife, is very interesting and easily the best part of the film. Rigg's test is not as interesting and is probably the worst part, as most of it is boring and not as intriguing as other parts of the film. The agents's story is so-so. It's kind of interesting, and does help give way to the Jill Tuck part of the story, but it's a little flat, especially since we're being thrown new characters to follow so quickly.As in previous installments, the acting is just fine. Tobin Bell does a great job as Jigsaw/John Kramer once again, and he is given a chance to show off his more emotional side due to the events that Jill Tuck (Betsy Russell) recalls. Speaking of Russell, she does a great job playing the conflicted Jill Tuck, torn between the two versions of her ex-husband that she knows. Scott Patterson and Athena Karkanis both do great jobs as Strahm and Perez, respectively. Costas Mandylor is also great as Mark Hoffman, especially because of what his character will mean in future films, as per the ending. Lyriq Bent does a great job, as he did in the previous two films, as Daniel Rigg, who has to play Jigsaw's deadly game. He turns in a very, very good performance, in my opinion.The music is a little more sub-par, especially compared to the music I liked so much in the previous film, but that's not to say the music has gotten any worse. It's still the same great music as before, it just didn't wow me as much as it did before. The visual effects (or aka the gore and stuff) were surprisingly toned down. About 1/2 of this movie has nothing to do with blood, guts, or gore, and I was shocked. I mean, of course, it was better, but I'm just shocked because the selling point of most of these movies is that there's a lot of gore and stuff.As I said earlier, the storyline was a bit messier than in previous installments, but also just some of the characters were flat-out uninteresting. Rigg was a pretty decent character in II and III, but that was because he was a background character, he wasn't a major player. Shining the spotlight on him and his uninteresting story really didn't do the film any favors. If the story had been focused on another character in the police force, or if maybe the film had been told from the perspective of the detectives, it could have been fine, but since Rigg was always there, it didn't really make me be anymore interested in the film.Overall, Saw IV is a mess. The story lines vary from intriguing to flat-out boring, and the characters seem to be a whole lot less interesting than I remember them being. Still, the acting, music, effects, and script all still work, but this is definitely a bigger step down that I had expected from this series. If the series doesn't get it's act together soon, it may just end up being a lot worse than I expected it to be. We're at the halfway point in the series, guys. Do they get better or worse?6/10. | Grade: C+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Exponential Increase in Gore, Brutality and Violence, But Ultimately Patience Testing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Saw IV' may prove to be the limit. Even for people who consider themselves fans of the franchise. The traps for the most part are repetitive, the violence seen before in the previous films and the climax and solution to 'Saw IV' is all too obvious and easy to figure out. It is perhaps a mark of how much I enjoy the original, that for me at least, 'Saw IV' is never less than watchable.After 'Saw III', which saw the deaths of Jigsaw and his apprentice Amanda, we are now shown the autopsy of Jigsaw. Detective Hoffman is called to the scene and given a tape that was inexplicably found in Jigsaw's stomach. Talk about insurance policies. Jigsaw informs Hoffman, that he is not safe and Hoffman has a test of his own in store for him. Meanwhile Lieutenant Riggs remains obsessed with trying to find the missing Detective Eric Matthews. It's been several months and Riggs finds it increasingly hard to let go. It is not long before Riggs is embroiled in his own test, which if he succeeds in, he will save the lives of Hoffman and Matthews. Riggs has three tests to complete and the clock is constantly ticking.'Saw IV' is noteworthy for being the film in which the series sees a decline in quality and overall creativity. My main criticism of 'Saw IV' is that there is no variety in the traps. They consist of body parts being ripped from the body in gruesome ways, leaving you to stare without meaning at the screen. The traps feel contrived and pointless. It must be noted that Riggs is under no obligation to complete his tests, in contrast with 'Saw III', where the tests were in a confined area, which you could not leave. This gave 'Saw III' urgency, sorely lacking in 'Saw IV'. Riggs could take a coffee break for ten minutes and return to the tests late. This approach does not work and therefore 'Saw IV' becomes less engrossing as its plot unfolds.There is one trap that does feel fresh, whether this is worth waiting seventy minutes for I leave for you to decide. The victim is sitting on a chair. Ropes bind him and knifes are digging into his body causing him to lose a lot of blood. In order for Jigsaw to release his binds he must press his face against a knife mask. This trap would not be notable, if it was not for the trap to collapse halfway through the victim's test, showing that Jigsaw has not yet perfected his craft. This is because this trap is a flashback of Jigsaw's first trap and shows how John Kramer became the serial killer known as Jigsaw. These segments are by far the most interesting parts of the film, so it's a shame that they are not more common. Thanks to Tobin Bell as the frightening Jigsaw, 'Saw IV' manages to make it to the end of the film, without falling like a bullet ridden corpse on the floor, dead.'Saw IV' has a relatively short run time in comparison to 'Saw' and 'Saw III'. There is enough going on to make sure that your mind stays focused, regardless of how ludicrous the plot is and the coincidences that are present throughout many scenes.'Saw IV' is a step down from 'Saw III'. Without a tangible story, the traps start to turn rusty. Luckily, there are enough of the origins of Jigsaw, a fairly strong central performance from Lyriq Bent, an unrelenting score and a short running time, to ensure that although Jigsaw is dead, the franchise will live. As Jigsaw aptly says just before the closing credits "The games have just begun".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw IV</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is anything to give credit for the Saw series is that the writers genially try to piece together a fluid story. Through four films I can't pick up on one continuity issue. Most horror franchises throw a screenplay together just for a quick buck and don't put forth a sensible edition. Even though the film truly suffers in Part IV, (6/10) rating, I give major props to putting forth commendable effort. The majority of the characters are reoccurring through prior movies, which I dig, but they have zero development behind them except Jigsaw and Riggs. Unlike previous Saw films, the twist endings are hard to figure out. However, in the case of Part IV, the viewer can pick up on many clues and predict the twist quite easily. To sum up Saw IV, it's alright from a horror movie perspective but an above average follow up for a horror sequel, which is extremely rare in this genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incoherent mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jigsaw and his apprentice are dead, but the games have not stopped and a team of police officers and FBI agents are on the new killers trail. Meanwhile a cop wakes up in one of the games, where he has to help other people with their games to save the protagonist from Saw 2 who is somehow still alive. While this is going on the team of investigators interview Jigsaw's ex wife and we are given flashbacks of how he started out.Needless to say there is a lot of content in this film, too much in my opinion. The story is all over the place, there are flashbacks left and right and overall it is very hard to follow.Tobin Bell still manages to play a major part, despite being dead, this time in the flashbacks. The origin story of Jigsaw is quite interesting and I would have liked them to focus more on it instead of mucking about with all this other stuff. The acting in this one is superior to the previous two, but once again the characters are too shallow and uninteresting to care about.The direction in this film is also a mess. There is hardly any real tension, the editing is bitty and incoherent and the cinematography is lacking compared to it's predecessors.Saw 4 is an incoherent mess of a film, they tried to fit too much into too little time and in combination with sloppy editing this leads to a film that is hard to follow. It is a lot less gory than Saw 3, but they seem to have also cut out the good parts. I'm both curious and anxious to see where the plot is going in the later films. Suffice it to say that the game is far from over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Made up for SAW III</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you read my previous review of Saw III, you will understand that I was disappointed with the third movie. I had doubts about this movie, after reading all the reviews and after the third episode of this series. But I'm glad to say that I managed to sit through the whole thing, and actually enjoy myself. Don't watch Saw IV thinking that it's just another gory horror movie, because while it does have a lot of gore elements, it has a lot going through the script. For once I found that mostly all the main characters didn't suck. As you expect, Tobin Bell stands out once again, but one that I feared was Lyric Bent: he gave good performances in previous Saw instalments when he didn't have much screen time, and I was afraid that he wouldn't be able to pull an awesome performance out of this movie where he's technically the main character, but to my surprise I'm pretty sure the guy has a future. Other than that, Costas Mandylor, Donnie Wahlberg and Scott Patterson are all pretty good as well. But most of the other characters suck, with maybe an exception of Shawnee Smith.The plot is as twisted as it gets but at the same time it is very challenging to follow, there are many events going on at the same time. The last murder sucked as well (I won't go into detail about what happens but to kill such a character, he deserved a much more honourable death). Also I disliked the fact that the plot goes through the same ''torture-porn'' thematic as the third one. The ending was good, though it wasn't the best of the Saw endings. The beginning was just plain sick, and I enjoyed it. Overall, I'm quite pleased with this fourth Saw movie, but it's just too bad Saw V couldn't quite follow the footsteps. I give Saw IV 8.5/10, because it's not the best of the Saw movies but it's far from being the worst.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw IV - The Game Continues even in Death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How does a sociopath killer get his start? How does a serial killer continue killing after he is dead? Strange questions but almost all of that is answered in Saw IV.Now a lot of people have complained "The Saw Franchise needs to stop, the only good film in it was the first one", well I tend to disagree, and I thought Saw IV really sucked, the first time around, but now that I've sat here and watched it for what could be the third or fourth time(on the premise of giving you good folks information, but every one really knows I'm just obsessed), I have to even disagree with my better judgment, Saw IV is like that missing piece of information that we don't think we want, but we really freaking need to completely understand the mind trip we've been on this far. Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) is dead. Amanda (Shawnee Smith) is dead. Who is left to take over Jigsaw's Games? We follow SWAT team leader Rigg(Lyriq Bent), on his obsessive journey to find his partners Kerry(Dina Miller) and Eric Matthews(Donne Wahlberg), little does he know, that the new faceless Jigsaw knows where Matthews is and that Kerry is dead in one of Amanda's flawed traps. Nor does he know that he is the next on Jigsaw's list, his crime according to Jigsaw? Obsession, with the case and the lives of his partners "you can't save everyone"Meanwhile, because of the virtual standstill that the case is on, the FBI calls in new blood to the team Agent Srahm(Scott Patterson) and Agent Perez(Athena Karkanis), they soon pull in Jill Tuck(Betsy Russell) Jigsaw's ex wife to interrogate her about her husband's past and psychosis. This is where the movie really shines, through flashbacks, we see what happened to Jigsaw, from the miscarriage of the couples child Gideon(Also the name of John's toy company), because of Cecil's((Billy Otis) attempt to rob Jill's drug clinic, then the closing of Gideon, and then John finding out he has cancer we slowly see John unravel, to the breaking point, Jill leaving him, he then goes after Cecil in a Chinese new year celebration, brings him back and puts him in his first ever trap, that he purposefully watches.Saw IV's true genius is the fact that it uses both the current storyline and flashbacks to set up the cannon that is the saw franchise, it leaves you wanting more, more than ever, as you follow Rigg through his trap and the FBI agent's through their investigation you find out just how twisted Jigsaw really is, all the pieces fall into place to reveal who is taking over Jigsaw's Legacy, in a final twist that will leave you breathless truthfully breathless and scratching your head waiting for Saw V</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jigsaw's work continues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Swat Commander Rigg is the test subject this time around who is now obsessed with saving other people after his old friends start to disappear or get killed off. Except he isn't the one that is strapped to any torture devices. As a matter of fact the scenario is sort of similar to Saw 3 except Riggs is going through Jigsaw's puzzle in order to save Eric Matthews. And has 90 min to solve it. And while this is going on a couple of agents are on the new Jigsaw's trail, mainly Agent Strahm and his apprentice Amanda Young. Who has got to be one the dumbest character in "Saw" franchise so far, I mean as soon as she sees one of her teammate get impaled by the new Jigsaw's trap, she puts her face directly in front of a doll which leads to something unpleasant. Anyways Riggs has to go on some sort of Punisher type of missions for the new Jigsaw, and the first test is this one chick that is on a device that will scalp her. And the thought that was going through my mind is "Why not shoot her ponytail", which didn't make any sense even if he was panicking. The next test and destination for Rigg's is in a motel, that is run by a serial rapist and what that fat bastard gets at the end of the test is actually very satisfying to watch. And the last test is some guy that abuses his wife and daughter at a school. What I really liked about the 4th installment is how it shows more of the original Jigsaw's origins. Although it is somewhat disappointing since it is not as deep, thought provoking or complex as some might have expected. There is a lot more detective elements thrown in this time that actually works quite well, Agent Strahm has good detective skills, but when it comes to facing the Jigsaw's puzzles he doesn't seem to have that much of a common sense. The gore in this one is a lot more tones down compared to the previous "Saw" movies, but has more character development. But some of the aspects of this one seems similar to part 3, since Rigg's has to go through similar scenarios as Jeff did in "Saw 3" as they both go through and try to help other people with there fate, except Rigg's is more of a Punisher type. When the movie started with Jigsaw's autopsy although some say it's faked, they find a tape in his stomach with Jigsaw talking about how his work is going to continue. I thought I was in for a bloody good time, but didn't really meet my expectations. Just about every part of Jigsaw's future plans worked too perfectly, it seems Jigsaw sort of creates the device depending on the victims characteristics but it went too perfectly even the timing. The ending wasn't even that good since the twist isn't that satisfying, and when you find out who the new guy that will be taking Jigsaw's place it's a real WTF moment cause it doesn't explain why he was picked and why he is working for the deceased Jigsaw, even if it may reveal why in part 5. Besides Jigsaw's origin this one is sort of a meaningless sequel.6.8/10</fullReview>

After the news of Detective Kerry's murder, two FBI Police, Agent Strahm and Agent Perez, arrive in the community to assist Detective Hoffman in sifting through Jigsaw's latest grisly remains and piecing together the puzzle. During the autopsy of John Kramer, the coroner finds a tape inside his stomach and calls Detective Hoffman. When SWAT Commander Rigg is abducted and thrust into another game, the last officer that has been untouched by Jigsaw has but ninety minutes to overcome a series of demented traps and save a friend or face the consequences. This was another great film in the Saw series of films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A new franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow the Saw franchise has come a long way since 2004, who would have thought a low budget torture flick would spawn a franchise, a new Saw movie coming out every year, something that hasn't been done in years, a once dead sequel craze that started in the 1980's with Freddy, Jason and Michael Myers films. To be honest I was a bit sceptical about this as I thought that Saw III would have been the end after Jigsaw being dead and all that, but none the less I was excited anyway at the new prospect of a new Saw movie coming out every year (Part 6 coming out soon Yay...).When I heard that this movie were gonna have different script writers from the other 3, I thought that this was gonna be a disaster but when I saw it, I really liked it, not as good as the first three to be honest, but well it's kinda expected because It would be hard to match the brilliance of the first three. The beginning we get a gruesome autopsy of Jigsaw and then a tape recorder is found inside him informing us that the games have just begun.What I liked is that we get more insight into Jigsaw's past, showing his first ever trap and we also get to meet Jigsaw's ex wife Jill (Betsy Russell from Cheerleader Camp), still looking hot and she did well in this part her acting's definitely improved. Although this is the weakest of the four films, It's still a very good movie, the storyline just wasn't engaging enough, our lead character this time is Rigg (Lyriq Bent) whose caught up Jigsaw's game wasn't interesting enough but Eric Matthews (Donnie Whalberg) makes a comeback as nothing more than victim fodder and also I didn't find his storyline believable at all, (why would he be kept prisoner for 6 months) I mean he already played his game. But other than that the gore was still high and the premise was engaging in parts and sadly the twist ending was stupid this time round.All in all The weakest in the first four films in terms of quality, but the traps were still clever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sputtering franchise catches its second wind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the somewhat lackluster third installment, I was a bit wary about strapping myself in for another Saw outing. It seemed to me that the franchise had settled into a regurgitation cycle, revisiting the same ideas that made the first two films so excellent, but diluting the recipe with the familiarity of repetition. While Saw IV certainly adheres to the same formulas set forth in the movies that preceded it, this entry in the gore-soaked series comes closest to recapturing the spirit of the original, and in doing so, infuses some new life into the deflated bemusement induced by the muddled denouement of Saw III.This is not to say that Saw IV isn't a confusing mess at times. But, in this case, the confusion arises from the film's assumption that viewers have the events of the first three films memorized. After soaking in the triplicate twists of Jigsaw's fourth climax, I had to read the detailed notes on IMDb to sort out exactly what I had just seen, and even doing so, I must admit I'm still not entirely clear on how this whole business was resolved.Each sequel in the Saw saga has built directly on the conclusion of the film that came before it, and that trend isn't altered here. But Saw IV rather ambitiously builds on EVERY chapter that came before it, replete with cameos from characters major and minor alike, going back to the first movie. When you piece together the time-line of the events depicted herein, you eventually realize that this film isn't so much using its precursor as a launching pad, but actually piggybacking the plot of that film and presenting us events that are happening concurrent to those in III. It's a pretty fascinating device when it all comes together, and if there's any profound knowledge to be gleamed from Saw IV, it's that these films are best digested in a single sitting marathon. That's really the only hope the viewer has for keeping the significance of these disparate characters straight. My memory's pretty decent, but I still have no idea who a third of the characters in this ensemble are, even though it's clear that I'm supposed to not only recognize them, but also recognize their significance within the greater puzzle. Even if this is a bit manipulative, ultimately Saw IV makes one want to watch the other three films again, and ads further resolution to events we thought we had already followed to their logical conclusions. Well played, Jigsaw.The improvements over III come courtesy of a definitive Jigsaw origin. While I'm from the school that thinks horror is scarier when the unknown is at play, I also respect the decision of the film-makers to shed some light on a character we've spent at least six hours of screen time with up to this point. While I'm not totally sold that Jigsaw's portrayed plight fully explains his transformation into a deranged welder of murderous machinations, it's definitely nice to have some insight into his motivations for constructing the hypocritically brutal "lessons" we've seen unfold in the series. On that front, the harbingers of demise in Saw IV are also a drastic improvement over the impossibly complex teaching tools portrayed in Saw III. Nothing in this film is nearly as obtuse as the inconceivably intricate deathtraps of the previous installment, and the relative realism found here adds a significant degree of tension to the affair. Simply put, if something looks like it could actually happen, it's inherently more jarring. That strategy is well-employed here, and in terms of pure horror quotient, Saw IV hits higher on the meter than anything we've seen since the original.Of course, being a "Gilmore Girls" fan, it's pretty nifty to have a Luke sighting, and the presence of the under-used Scott Patterson continues the Saw trend of tossing unlikely likable characters into the mix. Sure, Patterson is just as stiff here as he was on GG, but the dude is fun to watch, or at least he will be until they inevitably kill him off a sequel or two down the road.While the ending here is so thoroughly dense that it's practically guaranteed we're going to need another film to tie all the loose ends up (they even show us an unused trap, which conjures some delightfully grim and gory images for Saw V), this excursion is fun enough to warrant another go round. Sure, I'm there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Keeps the "Saw charm" but the new structure is all over the top.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some explanations towards previous Saw movies and character background were finally given. Yes, we find about Jigsaw's tormented and unlucky past; we also know what happens to Amanda and Eric plus some other tortured characters.A New Beginning happens in part IV! Now that's giving fresh oxygen to the series.The torture sequences and inventive traps are more exaggerated than in previous sequels and that reduces the impact and violence factor in my opinion. Sure, creativity is always appreciated in Horror cinema but not when it's taken too far. Also, some of Jigsaw's dialogs and tactics are all over the top. This feels like a Horror movie thanks to the great autopsy sequence, some killings, and the plot but it becomes some sort of adventure driven game at some points.There are many positive aspects in this movie such as keeping the viewer's attention as the plot throws some hints towards Jigsaw's "fate" and Rigg's intent to survive and win the game. Also, when some events of "Saw III" are thrown into the plot, things get really good.Still, I found very easy to figure things about before the twist and some situations are over the top.The game is getting boring, but I must confess that it's one of the better parallel-plot Horror films I've seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"It's brilliant, it ties everything up really well," said my mate Dave when he first saw this movie. "No," I replied when I had finally seen the film, "it doesn't tie anything up. Part three tied everything up. This film just tries to backtrack and add more and more so that they have reasons to keep making them." "Well, I think it's the best one yet," said Dave. And that was that, no point in the argument carrying on as we just had two completely different views on the movie.There is more trickery at work here as yet more people find themselves at the mercy of Jigsaw's fiendish death traps, despite the rather small problem of him now being apparently dead. A background is provided, fleshing out how one man eventually became Jigsaw and how he was perhaps not entirely unjustified, especially when beginning his mission to right the wrongs of the world.The acting is not too bad considering how rushed these movies always seem to be but nobody (with the obvious exception of Tobin Bell) stands out in their roles, not even Costas Mandylor who plays Hoffman, a character destined to play an important role in the proceedings, surely.Everything else is about what you would expect from the series and, while it's certainly a dip when compared to the first three there's no denying the fact that this time around any failings are at least compensated for by some fantastically ingenious deathtraps. If only part 5 had at least kept that in the equation, who knows how long the series could have steamrollered on without making me groan in disappointment.But don't just listen to my point of view, you may find that you agree with Dave. Each to their own.See this if you like: Saw, Saw 2, Saw 3.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly entertaining, but one of the weakest in the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw IV makes for a jolly good time. It's highly enjoyable and really succeeds on the level of entertainment value. It also has more of a Halloween-vibe than the other installments and manages to hardly ever be boring. It keeps you as the viewer going along with it until the final credits start to roll.The downside is that, even with these positive aspects, it unfortunately is one of the weakest in the series and for that, I find it difficult to give it higher than a 6. Darren Lynn Bousman really let me down here. His directing for Saw II was good, and as a freshman filmmaker he impressed me. His directing for Saw III was a colossal improvement; it absolutely blew me away. His direction for Saw IV......was horrible. The transitions were irritating, the lighting was nauseating/in your face, and the quick cuts were atrocious (it felt like Darren and the editor were having a seizure on the keyboard). His super-fast pacing, while helping to make the film more enjoyable, just doesn't work.The script clearly is rushed (probably the most rushed script yet), and the execution is very sloppy. The narrative is overly convoluted, as it simultaneously goes off in three different directions, with none of the plots being developed well. The one plot though that nears being developed well with Strahm and Jigsaw's ex-wife is really interesting and, in my perspective, succeeded from a dramatic standpoint. Throughout it are flashbacks depicting the rocky road and dissolving marriage that led to John becoming Jigsaw. Yes, it could have been something more, but it was still above average.There's an overload of characters, most of whom are unlikable cardboard cutouts just lined up for a quick kill. Saw and Saw III had fewer characters, which allowed for more character development and more sympathy for them. The actors/actresses who play the characters are, for the most part, amateur at best. The only real stand out performances are Tobin Bell who's fantastic as always and Scott Patterson who brings a lot of charisma to his role.The film's not quite as nerve flinching as the others. It doesn't have any scenes that make you squirm in your seat like when Dr. Gordon saws off his foot, or when Amanda falls into the pit full of needles, or even when Eric Matthews smashes his foot with the bathroom toilet cover. Those small things are the ones that get the audience; this simply shows the bloody entrails of people.Overall, Saw IV is very fun and will certainly keep you entertained, but it's still one of the weakest in the series. It's a tad better than V, but doesn't hold a candle to the first three.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought Saw 4 still has something to offer. I thought the plot was better than 2 or 3, but certainly no where near as good as the first film. The movie picks up right where 3 leaves off. It starts off with a gruesome autopsy of Jigsaw, whose inners hold a tape. Two FBI agents join the investigation. Hoffman gets kidnapped and Rigg is the next player in Jigsaw's game. Rigg is given several tests of dealing with people in traps. Does he save them or let them die? Some gory scenes are a girl getting her hair twisted to the point her scalp starts to tear, a guy getting quartered, a guy getting his head smashed by two huge blocks of ice. You get the picture.The one part I didn't get was at the beginning, Jigsaw is being autopsied. So, how come in the end, when Detective Strahm enters the room where the woman had her head blown off from Saw 3, Jigsaw is still laying on the table. I didn't understand that timeline.FINAL VERDICT: If you are a fan of the series, then you will probably like this one too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I personally loved Saw IV it was the best in the series in my opinion especially when you look at the fact that by the fourth in a horror franchise a good half the viewers walk away disappointed, when i heard there would be a fourth the first thing that came to mind was "they soiled a good trilogy with another Jason series" but saw 4 delivered not only thrills and intensity but with so many characters and 95 minutes of film to work with it had energy and put the viewers in the position of the characters which is crucial in the saw franchise. the whole movie flowed very nicely and rapidly. There were few dull moments. The series tries in every way to define itself as a puzzle where each installment is like a new piece of the puzzle. Well Saw 4 is a puzzle and a half. You watch it and know that if this film slips off target the series is DEAD (childs play and Halloween). But this movie for being hyped to be nothing it took an already good trilogy and transformed it into a franchise that unlike 90% of horror films actually stayed on target. For having little to work with and for losing its main murderer in part 3 this film adds characters story and class to the series and ups the pace where every minute adds more of what people want, a story that in the end clarifies itself and is unexpected. The main reason people become upset with Saw 4 is because it takes mystery and story and combines that with torture and violence. Well from a fans point of view it'll impress the hell out of fans who want a story with logic that'll keep them thinking after they leave the theater exciting them for future installments seeing as how Saw 4 also has a nice cliff hanger that is dramatic and mysterious. And for fans who want a movie full of gore and nail biting violence...its a saw movie! head smashing, scalp ripping gun fights...enough said! All in all it is somewhat confusing and far fetched at some points nearing the end but by the end all the different story lines connect and the series is not over yet! Saw IV twisted what could of turned into a bland and meaningless series into a franchise that left most saw fans including myself wanting more... 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Kramer and Amanda died in the last installment but not the traps, in fact the games have just begun, the series gets gorier, more brutal, and throws more light on the life of John. Like the brain surgery sequence of the third movie this movie has a postmortem sequence, which can be rated among the most graphic scenes in the motion picture history.In this series, detectives are in search of the accomplice of John and Amanda, whom they believe have helped them. As they move on with investigation they become aware that the game has begun already begun and then starts a trail of execution, in the way this series is famous for. It comes to light that the lives of two detectives are at stake and the team tries to save them. Also, the wife of John is introduced in this part. As he story unfolds more light is shed on the life of John and why he chose this path. This is where the freshness of the story ends.The series is getting stereotypical in terms of graphic scenes, the way the persons are executed and the way they are tested. In the second series detective Eric Matthews was tested, in the third a father of the dead son is tested in this installment again a police is tested who tries to saves everyone's life around him. Graphic scenes as usual are as brutal as they can get.Watch this movie only if you are a brave at heart to bear to the graphic nature of the movie, but mind it, if you have watched the earlier parts, you still need much more guts to see this one.www.moviesopinion.blogspot.com</fullReview>

And this doesn't just apply to Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger or Jason Vorhees, who can (but shouldn't) come back because they're not human. Exhibit A: Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), who had suffered from an inoperable brain tumor since the first installment in the franchise, was clearly and incontrovertibly killed by one of his victims at the end of Saw III. Game over? No way (besides, the fourth chapter was green-lit before the third had even been written).Ironically, the beginning of Saw IV does nothing to deny the obvious: John "Jigsaw" Kramer is indeed dead, as cinema's most gruesome autopsy scene confirms. However, a tape found in his stomach (and this tape was already visible in the previous installment, despite Leigh Whannell's claims that the series would die with its main character) causes some anxiety, all justified when the killer's unmistakable voice says: "You think it's all over just because I am dead. It's not over. The games have just begun." And so three separate stories begin: we have Detective Rigg (Lyriq Bent), who receives a tape telling him that he has 90 minutes to find his missing colleagues Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg), who's been Jigsaw's prisoner for six months, and Hoffman (Costas Mandylor); we have FBI agent Strahm (Scott Patterson, aka Luke from Gilmore Girls) who's convinced Jigsaw has a new apprentice (what with Amanda being dead and all) and follows the trail of blood caused by Rigg's game; and we have the aptly inserted flashbacks, which reveal how John became Jigsaw.The flashback technique is obviously an excuse to have Tobin Bell in the film despite his character's demise, but it works anyway, primarily because Bell, now forever associated with Jigsaw, is as creepy as he's always been, and also because, on a purely technical level, the time shifts are rendered through some pretty smart, eye-catching editing. It gives the film a fluidity that should have been used in the overlong third movie (nearly two hours), as boredom is very unlikely to kick in at this point, in spite of the torture scenes being more and more contrived and gratuitous as a new Saw film follows another.Unlike Saw III, however, the fourth installment benefits from a simpler, nastier script that, while providing poor excuses for the most pointless death scenes, shows how the new writers (Whannell left after the previous installment, thankfully) didn't want Saw IV to be a mere cash-in on its predecessors, but have a dignity of its own. Proof of this is the inevitable twist ending, which is smarter and more memorable than its Saw III counterpart (though it has to be said the franchise's trademark music helps a lot too), and the real reason why this fourth tale of philosophical killings, albeit not a patch on the original, is strangely enjoyable, especially if the viewer is a bona fide fan of the franchise. Too bad it's also all too clear the series won't end anytime soon.6,5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>why do i like them so much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a horror movie fan but for some reason this series has me hooked. Even though the 4th one wasn't great, I can't wait to see the next one. I recommend seeing the previous 4 if you are going to watch the 5th. I guess it is inevitable that they are not all going to be great but in terms of sequels these are definitely up there with the best! I guess its the suspense and not a traditional try and make you jump out of your seat horror like Scream which I also like. It is more sophisticated and the scripts are well written which is unusual in a horror flick. You never know what is going to happen unlike most horror (lots of deaths) and i never once laughed at the movie (unlike a lot of horrors). Who knows how many they will make but I will probably see all of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah, the "Saw" films. I hated the first one, didn't care for the second one and have so far enjoyed parts 3 and 4. Weird, huh? Saw IV picks up where 3 ended, but since I tend to forget what happens when things get convoluted (as they do in these movies) it didn't matter and I was able to move on. Jigsaw is dead but the games continue as we follow a cop trying to get with the plan of the man.What I enjoyed about Saw IV was the back story on Jigsaw. Man, talk about having a rough time of it! No wonder he put his good-hearted engineer/architect brain in psycho mode. I also liked the gore, which there could have been more of but who am I to complain? All in all, not a bad entry and a pretty good detective story at that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw 1, was in everybody's eyes, something geared towards extreme horror. It turned out to be mystery. Very very well written and wonderful use of key dialogues. My favorite dialogue, "No appreciation of life".Saw 2, disappointed me in 1 fashion. Anybody, that's "anyone with a brain" or has paid attention to the first Saw, knew each and every twist and angle, in the sequel. It's like everything was purposely given away, but more gore, more victims and breath taking - Emmanuelle. Good movie.Saw 3, went back to it's roots. More questions. More mystery. But the story got so far fetched though. Jigsaw became an entity. An untouchable, at that; but extreme gore, possibly 1 of the goriest in the series, or thee goriest.Saw 4, I honestly felt in my heart, was absolute garbage, but still am a fan of the series. No story, hardly anything happening. It was like, it was rushed way too fast, to be on the big screen. More work and time was needed to be put into this. After some fine tuning, they could've made it; at least, as good as part 2. But hands down, if anyone knows their Saws, they know thee best ones were Saw 1 and Saw 3, hands down. Part 4 (sigh) needed much much more work.Awaiting part V, will they run out of characters? I've read, they're bringing 2 beauties to the screen. So let's see what happens.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a really gd crime horror, but without being scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie on DVD tonight. I haven't seen any of the other saw movies, but i thought this was really gd. It makes u think about the film and what u would do if u were the victim. Its keeps the suspense and the thrill right until the end.It is like midsummer murders, diagnosis murder, csi, etc, but far more gorier and with the traps included, with these crime dramas don't have. Its not the best horror film I've seen, but far from the worst as well.I didn't find this that gory as i thought it would be and it was definitely not frightening. As i said before, if u like crime dramas such as midsummer murders, your probably going to enjoy this. However, if your looking for a gore fest, a film with no plot or a movie which you don't have to think about, your not going to like this.My vote is 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The fourth part in the ever popular Saw series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw IV (2007) brings back the series to what I really enjoyed about it, the complex and layered plots that keep on making the Saw series so entertaining. This film is not as sadistic as part three (I don't think they could ever top that one) but the plot and the multi-twists make this one the third strongest of the films. Jigsaw is dead but that doesn't mean the games will end. He has chosen a successor who'll continue his quest to show people who valuable life is. Detective Matthews has been missing for awhile along with Doctor Gordon. This time around, a new player Officer Rigg (Lyric Bent) has been chosen to play a game. He has to locate the missing Detective Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) in a couple of hours. There's also a pair of FBI agents who are now involved in the Jigsaw case. Many questions have to be answer. Can Rigg find his buddy Eric Matthews? What do the two feds bring to the table in finding about Jigsaw and his criminal activities and who really is Jigsaw? You'll find the answers to these questions and many others when you watch Saw IV!Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This has to be the worst Big-Budget horror movie ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I have no idea how i got through an hour of this movie,(when I turned it off)it's a lot like Hostel Part 2, lots of gore and grisly torture with no original good background story. I like it when movies have a lot of gore(Dawn of the Dead remake,28 Weeks Later,etc.), but man, this is just too much. I have no idea how this got past the MPAA without a X rating. When it comes to the Saw movies, I liked the first 2, and hated the last 2. I watched this one with my Dad and friend. About an hour through, my Dad said,"How do you guys like this stuff?", and I said,"This movie is horrible.Let's turn it off.". I rarely ever do that. Sometimes I fast forward through movies that are terrible to see if anything good will happen, but this one just had nothing going for it but over-the-top gore and a plot identical to the other movies in the series(which is a good plot, don't get me wrong, but it gets old after a while). I just hope there's no Saw 5, and if there is, its gonna have to get some pretty damn good reviews for me to see it(this movie has a 6.2/10.....6.2?!!?!?That's seriously just messed up). Then again, I guess it is just my opinion, but honestly I have no idea how people like this movie.Overall, 0.5/10. Among the worst pieces of trash I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After Jigsaw and Amanda were killed in the last installment, Jigsaw's corpse has been dissected and a tape has been discovered in his gut organ. After Detective Kerryu died, two agents named Straham (Scott Patterson) and Perez (Athena Karkanis) investigate yet another piece of a puzzle made by Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) himself SWAT commander Riggs (Lyrid Bent) has been abducted and finds himself in a mysterious place where he must play a deadly 90 minute game through a maze to solve traps with helpless victims at risk and must save a friend in time before he can uncover who is now in the footsteps of Jigsaw and his bizarre games.Riviting and ultraviolent fourth entry of the now popular "Saw" horror/thriller franchise! there's plenty of good gory torture sequences and memorable parts like the most realistic autopsy sequence to hit the screen since perhaps "Men Behind The Sun", "Re-Animator" or "Beyond The Darkness: Buio Omega". The performances have improved from the third movie as well as the cinematography, Donnie Wahlberg does an appearance in this movie and gives us a look at what made Jigsaw become psychotic.It's great gory fun for anyone!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It only missed one thing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally! Another good Saw movie after the first one! The two movies before this one, kinda undid the whole story of Jigsaw and his sick, original ways to make people's lives end. Saw IV brought the whole story back and made a huge comeback. It was as sick and creepy as it was before, only with a better story. It almost had the WHOLE package... There was only one thing missing. The one thing that made Saw special. The one thing that Saw II en Saw III didn't had. I'm talking about the "Techinically he isn't a murderer" vibe. In Saw II, III and IV Jigsaw DOES kill them. Not all, but a lot. And in the first Saw he avoided it and THAT was the thing that made the movie special! So I was kind of bummed out when I realized Saw IV made the same mistake, because I liked the rest of the film!Then a little technical thing: The way they edited Saw IV was, I thought, weird. Sometimes it was confusing. But the special effects and the make-up was, as all Saws, top drawer.I give this movie a 7. I wanted to give it a 7.5 but that's not possible and a 8 is too high. Watch this movie! It's worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was okay...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enough to give it a 7. Some things got on my nerves. Just letting you know I am NOT racist. Now we talk about how stupid white people are in horror/suspense films. But the main character (who happened to be black) did some mighty stupid things. First off, yes, Jigsaw is right, he DOES rush into things. Rush into rooms and doors and dark hallways. You're a police man. This is what police men learn first. NEVER rush into a situation until you KNOW what's going on. And the fact that he knew it was jigsaw he was dealing with made it worse. Jigsaw was known for setting people up in crazy situations so you've got to be extra careful. He didn't care. He busted into every room. And didn't learn a thing. I guess that was the point of the movie but this lesson is one that shouldn't have to be learned. Especially by someone who's been on the force for X amount of years.There was one scene that really made me mad. A girl was sitting in a seat and her hair was being pulled by a Mechanical do-hickey. The police man is shooting at the chair and looking for things to cut with and doing all sorts of things. Why doesn't he just shoot her hair from the side? I'm sure that would have worked. He wouldn't have had to leave her unsupervised and she wouldn't have been able to get the knife. Not that he knew that that was her plan but still. It wouldn't have even come up if he had just shot her hair. But he's an idiot. At least in the other Saw movies, the main characters did what they could and what they thought logical. They took small steps and looked around before touching anything. This guy is all impulse and emotion. And that's why he died. Too bad other people had to die at his expense. In the other movies, the people died through their own devices. In this one, people die because of the policeman's stupidity AND their own devices. Dumb. But there were some good parts and, for that, I give it a 7.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave this movie a 7 out of 10, because it's definitely not the worst in the series but not the best. I really enjoyed this movie, yes it had more gore and suspense than the past 3 films, but it was still a really good movie. A lot of people didn't feel for Rigg, I did, I thought he was a great character in the movie. Tobin Bell, of course was excellent, I saw him in another movie, not to long ago, a comedy, and it was really funny, and my husband says, "I can't believe that's the same guy who plays Jigsaw".Jigsaw is back, well, kinda, he's dead, but he still has one last game to play, or maybe a few. Donnie Wahlberg, I've loved him since NKOTB, was amazing in this film, like he's been in the last 2 movies.I'm not going to give anything away/spoil the movie for you, because it was a great movie, but it certainly wasn't the best, but not the worst. This movie, even when it was over, my heart was still pounding away..., it definitely got my adrenaline boosted that's for sure.All-in-all it was a great movie, there's a lot of loose ends from the past 3 movies that come together in this one too, great dialogue and action, suspenseful for sure, a little too much gore for my liking, but you can't have a thriller without a little gore. Tobin Bell should get an Oscar for this movie for sure!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>saw IV is a decent movie and all, albeit it's pretty freaking ridiculous in the sense of all the traps and setups. my main issue with the movie isn't really with the movie itself, as it is with people that refer to the saw and hostel movies as "gore porn" and stuff like that. these movies aren't too gory or graphic, compared to a lot of the stuff out there. for a Hollywood film, yes, this is pretty gory, but people saying that stuff like this is extremely gory need to go watch films like flowers of flesh and blood, some olaf ittenbach, timo rose, or andreas schnaas films, or even a troma film like terror firmer. what they're doing is akin to someone saying a movie like eyes wide shut or something has sooo much nudity, when there is hardcore porn out there. just as pornography tends to be lacking in the content department, so do a lot of gore films, but it still annoys me to see people acting like films like this are the alpha and omega of gore. that being said, it had some nice traps, and the storyline and acting were a step up from saw I and II, i haven't seen the third one, and i don't really think i will anytime soon, but this film definitely improved how i view the saw films.</fullReview>

Bad points:There were some unclear parts in the movie:1-What was written in that envelope with the name of Amanda on it.2-Why Jigsaw chose Hoffman to continue his work and why he accepts it.3-What had happened to the Jeff and her daughter.4-The jigsaw's body was on the final test place where saw3 finished but we saw his body at the beginning of the movie which they discover a tape from his stomach.At last I think that it's really a great movie and you should not wait watching it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Each of these movies gets further and further away from the elements that made the first one so successful - the mind game, and the fact that the victims each have a choice on how much they're willing to suffer in order to save their own life.Instead, what we have here is a montage of disconnected scenes that just don't flow well - replete with lousy editing and annoying camera work. It's shot like a bad MTV video. Half second shots here, 1 second shots there, a couple of frames blasted at you in between, and you're wondering what the hell's going on - and the genius of the great special effects work gets lost in the process.The character development of the supporting actors isn't that good either. At different times you're wondering who this person is, and what role he/she plays in the overall story. The whole idea of this type of serial killer is a great premise, but it's evolved into a disjointed Road Runner Cartoon that isn't fun to watch anymore.I don't know how anyone could wade through the confusion to absorb enough of (what passes for) a plot to even come up with a spoiler.</fullReview>

However,the movie is just a show of fools for me.The people who are captured in a chamber are just screaming and pretend to be scared. Their acting skills can just be applied in performing as a lunatic running about and crying. There is not enough arrangement in the story to provide more opportunities to show off their acting skills.moreover, the movie is so disgusting as the people have killed someone and look for the key for unlocking the killing tool on time through the intestines. I think the movie-making crews should bare in mind that the movie may concise people with evil information and consider whether the movie is offensive to virtue.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Following the death of Jigsaw, a detective discovers that Jigsaw's horrendous games of torture are far from over, as Jigsaw has even more victims tied up in his sick traps, that are more than ready to horrendously kill those trapped by them. While searching for those in need of his help, the detective discovers that one of his men is also being forced to take part in Jigsaw's sick game &amp; is being forced to make a decision regarding saving the lives of those who have found themselves unfortunate enough to become one of Jigsaw's many targets &amp; what's worse is the fact that although Jigsaw is dead, he may have another accomplice to continue his grisly work. Upon hearing of SAW 4 I was skeptical on how this movie would really work, since Jigsaw died at the end of Part 3 &amp; therefore I knew that since he was not immortal, he wouldn't be "alive" for another SAW picture &amp; figured this sequel would be a dud. However after finishing SAW 4, I'm happy to say the total opposite is true, SAW 4 actually turned out to be pretty good! In fact I found myself enjoying it more than the last entry. TOBIN BELL returned as Jigsaw in very interesting flashbacks to show how an innocent man turned into such a monster &amp; of course the acting &amp; directing were really good too! The gore is pretty gruesome in this one, as blood shoots out of various victims caught in very neatly rigged traps &amp; of course no SAW film would be complete without a very interesting conclusion with shocking secrets revealed &amp; neat plot twists abounding. Highly recommended to horror fans. The SAW series has proved to be well worth a horror fans time &amp; money. Followed by SAW 5.**** stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must first start off by saying that i enjoyed saw 1-3 and i was very excited to see that there was another saw coming out. so this analysis is coming from a big saw fan who felt disappointed at the end of saw 4.i must say that one of the main problems in this movie is that the traps are not explained too well.art and trevor's trap consists of no tape of any sort and the trap is not explained at all.the girl in the hair trap's reason for being tested was very unclear( the pics that were shown of her soliciting young girls were very vague and quick) in the theatre i had no idea what was the reasoning. also throwing in the aspect of her trying to kill rigg was weak and lame. it doesn't seem practical the "guy who gauged his eyes out" trap was weak. in the theatre i had no idea what was going on.the wife and husband was a pretty good trap to me(mainly because it was explained and we had prior reference to these people) also cecil's trap was good being that it was the first trap, and the purpose was thoroughly explained by jigsaw as far as the storyline goes...the whole parallel story with saw 3 was introduced very poorly and it seems like it was forced. i believe the writers could have been more clever.so many different stories going on at one time made the movie hard to follow and slightly boring.saw lost its claustrophobic feel: rigg seemed to be able to go anywhere he felt like going. there were no constraints the ending comes before expected and leaves a lot of cliffhangers. what is Hoffman's purpose,etc.even still, the movie still is an okay installment into the series and i believe that the story to saw 5 will have to save the series and bring more relevance to saw 4. i will be watching saw 5 oct 24th 2008 because i still have faith in the series</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good horror flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, i really enjoyed this movie. The traps set up to test people were well thought out, new and horrifying. There were no boring parts, i was always sitting on the edge of my seat or with my hand over my mouth scared of the outcome.Jigsaw and Amanda are dead, but their work continues on in the form of another bitter and twisted person. When will this end? Well, not some time too soon i hope , as i am looking forward to the next Saw movie. Australian creators Leigh Whannell and James Wan have done such a great job on these movies, it makes me proud to be Australian. Good on you guys, keep up the good work as i would recommend this to any horror fan. Well done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every Halloween I look forward to the Saw movies, Saw 3 left us with questions with no answers. Luckily enough this movie does answer most of mine.I personally enjoyed this movie, and cannot wait until the next one comes out. It goes into the story of John the 'dead' man who started this entire thing, and reasons why he does this to people he believe are un-deserving of their life. I think the right people were brought back, However, there was a small part of me that wanted John to still be alive, and the body be a dud. WRONG!! The torture scenes are awesome, and creative all in one. I love the saw movies because of the torture scenes, and the thought process he goes through to put them together. Every time I watch the movies I find myself questioning if I am deserving of my life, is anyone for that matter? What would John do with the negative choices each and every one of us make every day. With the choice of driving our cars and polluting the air, Eating fast food and contributing to an overly obese society... and the list goes on and on.Saw movies are made for the gore, torture and of course to make MONEY! The movie is great, and answers A lot of questions, but also made me question myself as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>terrible absolutely terrible!!! can't believe they are still producing these. There are a few good executions throughout but the plot is all over the place, there is no real twist at the end of the movie because you have no chance in guessing the end anyway! Maybe I'm being a little bit harsh or dramatic but this was not what i expected and they should of stopped producing these after number two. If there is gonna be a fifth movie to the franchise then i will definitely NOT be watching unless it scores a 9.9 or higher on here! I was blown away by the first in the series, number 2 was good with another great twist at the end but now they just get worse! to think there will be a lot of movies to follow this genre and disappoint us all over again.(and again and again).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest Horror Series to ever exist takes a small stumble but nothing catastrophic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit my expectations for the next installment of the superb Saw series were really high and that's tough for a movie to match especially going into it's fourth installment. And it's not that the film disappointed me to any great lengths I just felt like maybe it stumbled in it's honest and worthy attempt at being not just another slasher flick but rather the best and goriest and most intense and most importantly the most intelligent of the genre. Unfortunately there is a thin line between making something intelligent and stimulating and overly confusing and Saw IV unfortunately does the latter in a lot of the scenes. Darren Lynn Bousman returns to helm his third Saw film having done the first two sequels. He has done an incredible job, in fact the series has been even better since he started. The only play where Saw IV really stumbles without giving away the full blown twist is the chronology of the film. In fact I'm still trying to figure out how this film plays into the others and how the time line fits.Thankfully they still found a way to bring back Tobin Bell as one of the greatest horror icons of all time...Jigsaw/John. Bell embodies the psychopathic killer while still unveiling his human side and where he came from which really unfolds in this installment more than any other. Bell truly is the Saw series and I hope they continue one way or another to find ways to incorporate him into the series or it wouldn't be the same. Lyriq Bent plays the latest cop to be lured into Jigsaw's games. Bent does a good job and appropriately draws you in to the world that he is being forced to experience much like the actors before him did. Considering his game is to not save various victims of Jigsaw it is pretty intense and Bent does a good job. Also returning in various cameo roles from the previous installments of Saw are Donnie Wahlberg, Betsy Russell, Shawnee Smith and Dina Meyer.Much of the film is told via flash backs not necessarily or entirely flack backs of earlier installments but rather new flash backs to fill in more of John (Jigsaw's) past with his wife and his mental break down and also further story on each of the characters we've seen throughout the series. The problem with the film from my perspective comes from the twist because they throw the entire twist at you in the last five minutes of the film and it's a lot to digest and try and figure out and it's also exceedingly difficult if you haven't seen at least Saw II and Saw III immediately before this one. I think if I had seen Saw III I might have had a better grip on what was going on. Saw is synonymous with blood and guts and the goriest craziest contraptions and there is no shortage here, I won't say it doesn't have those things by any means but I think they toned it down. It felt scaled down compared to the previous installments and maybe that was to create more story and background but I think unfortunately it caused them to slip a little. I still think this is one pretty amazing series and I eagerly anticipating Saw V and any others they can crank out until they're so bad I'm in tears. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let sleeping Saw lie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved the first three installments of Saw. They were clever, well-written movies with astonishing twists (though they were a bit predictable), and tons of creative torture-scenes. Personally, I think Saw is a trilogy. I've got every answer I needed, all things have come to an end, and so Saw could be the eighth wonder in my personal film-world. However, as money talks, Hoolywood thought otherwise. They sought out to destroy a monument, and replace it as a never ending franchise. My basic problem is the script, and it is one huge mistake as it has always had a major role in the Saw films. Here, the story is really forced, we don't feel that there is a catharsis to achieve during the film, and it neither has characters to care about nor a story to keep us attended. We can smell the sweat of the writers as they were eager to add something to the Saw-saga that wasn't needed. First of all, they attacked the ideologist Jigsaw's figure, and from a preacher, who was enlightened after his tumor and sought to re-give a meaning to people's life, he turned into an avenger, someone, who made up his work after a personal incident. Secondly, it is the identity of the Jigsaw killer itself. The fans of films like Saw like these movies for the mystery that surrounds the killers, to find out their motivation, and to let themselves amazed and shout that "I knew it would be him!". However, here this is taken away. The final twist gives us a nobody, who is Jigsaw's apprentice, but we don't even know why, who he is, how he got into the whole thing. We get a fact, but not a thoughtful solution as it was with the case of Amanda. Oh, yeah. The twist. It is must-have in all Saw films, so there it is one in Saw IV as well. But, as the movie itself, it is forced, full of idiotic and unnecessary things that offers us large plot holes. Not only will no one be astonished by the twist, but no man will say it is creative, or really motivating for a sequel. Not to mention the fact that this movie is really illogical (huge mistake as neither of the Saw-films were), and leaves us without any satisfaction. Saw IV finally turned the series from a clever thriller franchise into a dull, average horror-saga. I dare say that this franchise has reached its limits, and so everyone should let sleeping Saw lie.</fullReview>

Because the movie was filled with a repetitive plot. but is was that there was a twist a twist at the end that won me over. There was more drama than gore which was very unexpected but it that feature that made give it a higher than i was going to give it, there were many surprises which made it good but a bit boring at some stages but still enjoyable to watch. This film has been panned by critics saying there was so little gore that even children could watch this film, i don't really understand why this film has been underrated. But I can guarantee you this if you buy the DVD it will be money well spent.***/***** 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>saw &amp; non-saw fans won't enjoy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge Saw fan and have been following the film from beginning to now and am horribly disappointed in this film. It starts out pretty normal for the first 20 minutes, but once Jigsaw's main game starts, till the end it doesn't make sense. The first three Saw movies made you leave the theater saying,"WOW! I did not see that coming!". Saw IV makes you leave the theater saying, "Wait...What the HELL?!?". Now Saw IV does uncover some of the secrets about Jigsaw that you want to know, but nothing really big. You can see how Saw IV could have been a lot better. The thing that you probably want to know is why the great Saw series you've known or heard about has become so bad in this film? It's because the series changed writers, and these writers have never worked on a Saw film before. Saw V will be written by the same people as Saw IV, so the series might curve in another direction and work better than Saw IV. I will advise Saw fans to see it, and people who have never seen a Saw movie to watch the first three.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw IV, what a bore!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never saw myself wanting to bother to see any of these movies, but now I've found myself in the cinema watching them all. We've reached Saw IV and to be honest, I was hoping for something a little different.Saw IV is Jigsaw back-story time, and frankly it's a bit boring. We all know he's a freak, and all we really learn this time is the consequence that led him to start killing people.I was pretty certain after Saw 3 that there was going to be a new twist, and a new turn, but there really wasn't. It's more of the same.Nobody wins except Jigsaw. We kind of figured that out after Saw 2, yet it continued in Saw 3. From Saw 3 I started to believe other people were going to take over his work, but with Saw IV its back to Tobin Bell. And I'm bored of Tobin Bell. They should bring back a real star, like Danny Glover. His appearance in the original Saw was fantastic!Saw 5 is just going to be more of the same. The only thing that'll drag me to the cinema to see it is if I'm certain there's some famous, like, REALLY famous people in it and THEY'RE going to get mashed up.Back to Saw IV though, sure, it's fun, there are great moments, but the detectives this time round are boring. The SWAT guy is lame. Tobin Bell provides the best performance but he's still old news. Also, all the integration of time and how it all links in with Saw 3 and such just left me confused &amp; bewildered, and left the cinema thinking - what the hell? I just hope Saw V has some real star talent (bring back GLOVER!), less Jigsaw, and something completely unexpected.None the less, Saw IV is worth watching if you want to know how the story is progressing.Saw: Shocking! Saw 2: Fun! Saw 3: Gruesome! Saw 4: Boring!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cherish your life?Saw IV</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Besides a misstep with episode II, I have to admit that I have thoroughly enjoyed the Saw saga. From the get-go, I was intrigued by what these young upstarts, James Wan and Leigh Whannell, were bringing to the horror genre. While the original had its moments of bad acting and campiness?sorry Cary Elwes, I'm still a big fan?it was unique, uncompromising, and began a new genre of film coined torture porn. While the two gents decided against creating a series on their own, they did stay on to produce and write the subsequent entries. This is a great thing because it allowed a cohesiveness and plot continuity that could not have existed otherwise. With that voice intact, as well as the willingness of actors to stay onboard for necessary cameos, the series has been a pleasure to watch, thematically of course, it's not like I take my enjoyment on a sadistic level by any means?well maybe a little.I will be the first to say that by the conclusion of Saw III, I was ready to say goodbye with a smile on my face. What more could be told? Important characters had died and loose ends had been tied. I had all but written the fourth entry off?that is until I heard Darren Lynn Bousman decided to return for one more go. He saw something in the script to forego retirement from the franchise, even with it being the first without credit to the creators. Between his reversal, statements that the killing mechanisms were the most gruesome yet, and just a plain wonderment at how they would pull it off, I was back onboard to witness Jigsaw's new puzzle, Saw IV.Once again, we have secondary roles from the previous films becoming our central "contestants". SWAT leader Rigg, played effectively by Lyriq Bent, honestly the best performance of the bunch, acting alongside some amateurish people, has been recruited to discover the destructive quality of his obsession. Why Jigsaw would care about this, or in actuality even know about it, is answered by the end, along with more background to his mastermind sadist. Besides the degenerate society he is apart of and his diagnosis of cancer, it now appears a broken marriage, a miscarried child, and a failed suicide attempt have all culminated into his mission to "help" others see what a gift life is. This look into his past is an interesting glimpse to help shed light on previous moments from the other films, as well as set up the interrogations with his ex-wife and involvement of helpers during the course of this current segment. Tobin Bell is creepy as ever, but in fact it is the early moments via flashback, which truly scare. He was a man in love, with a business about to flourish. To see him happy, and in control of his emotions, while still containing a bit of an edge, just makes the transformation into the Jigsaw we know and love more staggering and almost forgivable.We are allowed back into scenes from the third film as well as the characters from the past two. Everything comes full circle as we finally see who is behind all the new games with Jigsaw out of commission. The ending is a great twist as usual, also setting up what can be a successful sixth movie. To see that Jigsaw's new apprentice is not untouchable in his traps is a welcome viewpoint and continuation of his unflinching scruples to never allow anyone the opportunity to take what they have for granted. Once more, all the past roles are seamlessly integrated back in, and the ability to keep everything relevant and possible leads me to think Whannell and Wan still had input in the script, even though they didn't receive formal credit. If anything, new writers Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan have only improved the story with their brand of torture. With the plot able to evolve, they breathe a bit of freshness into the killing machines. Between a scalper, spike stabbed arteries, limb removal, and knives to the face?the blood is by no means scaled back. If anyone still has questions about what might be coming, they must have had their hands covering their faces during the first scene. The tug-of-war between a man with eyes sewn shut and another with his mouth clamped gets us right back into the action.This is a pretty generalized review, so as to not give too much away. The beauty of the series has always been its twists and turns. If the second film got anything right, it was the ending for showing us what the writers were capable of. While that one failed by having way too many characters and plot threads, the third redeemed the series by going back to its roots of two distinct story lines destined to converge at the end. Saw IV succeeds by once more not going for the bigger is better mentality when it comes to story. The deaths may adhere to that way of thinking, but the story itself sticks to the mythology and only serves to enhance all that came before it. The decision to shoot both the fifth and sixth movies together will be an interesting experiment. While I look forward to seeing new ones after a lengthy period to hone their tales, there is still the chance that taking a year off might give the people a chance to forget and no longer care about the franchise. For churning out an entry every year for four straight, I must say the level of quality has for the most part stayed high. I for one will still be around in 2009, waiting anxiously to see what is in store for Detective Hoffman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is actually funny. The acting is so poor, it is laughable at times. How many more Saw films are they going to make? The first one was awesome. It was unpredictable and gory. The second one was OK. The third was also OK. This one is so awful, it's good.You're supposed to be drawn in because Jigsaw, though dead, lives on. My question is how. He's dead. Why is the detective guy afraid of him and how did he get all those tapes for Rigg? Had he planned it out perfectly before he died? This goes with the moral of the story. The detective guy's catch phrase is "let go." So you're telling me the moral of the story is that since your friend has disappeared, do not look for them or even hold out hope they are still out there? Great moral of the story. If you like gore, watch it I guess. If you want gore, watch Jason or something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film wasn't what i thought it would be. I think maybe i should see it again. I've been waiting for this for a year now. I think "saw 3" was better. I'm a gorehound so you probably know why. I've heard and read a lot about this film. That it's supposed to be so cruel and bloody. Then they must be talking about the unrated director's cut DVD that i hope someday will be released. Compared to saw 3 this is nothing in comparisan when it comes to gore. ' It was also a little confusing towards the end. Maybe i'm a little slow but wasn't Jigsaw on the table in the beginning? I know that there must be something i'm not seeing, but again. Maybe i should see it once more :) Actors do what they need to do. Tobin Bell is by far the better actor in these films, and showes here that he's not just a character actor. Transitions are cool. I see a little filmschool in them, but they work out great. Bousman know's what he wants...I truly hope that five and six will be better. I went in to this expecting more i guess :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Falls flat on its face compared to the first three</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike II and III, Saw IV simply feels as if it is a 'money sequel', having lost the drive that made the original trilogy so compelling. The story is weak (and often nonsensical) and the traps are simply unimaginative and bland compared to Jigsaw's previous contraptions. The twist at the end is also predictable, and finally, Jeff and Det. Eric Matthews, two of the best characters in the series, are completely used the wrong way. Eric dangles from the ceiling for maybe fifteen minutes of screen time before finally getting unceremoniously killed, and Jeff makes a two-minute cameo before getting shot dead. The characters deserved better. The actors, however, all did well in their respective roles (except for maybe Scott Patterson), and Tobin Bell once again steals the show in an extended flashback sequence that delves deeper into John Kramer's origins, including before he became the vigilante Jigsaw. You really feel for Jigsaw, and this flashback sequence is ultimately the best part of the movie and almost worth the ticket price alone. Almost.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacks the gore of Saw 3, but its superb storyline make it better!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of the Saw series, and as a result of this have been condemned by some of my friends as being sick and being a fan of this new genre apparently called "torture porn." Now you see that terminology infuriates me, the term "torture porn" and the way critics condemn the Saw movies even before they have had a chance to see them. While the movies are violent it is not the violence that attracts me to the films, of course the deaths are interesting and are why many people like the films, but I much prefer the storyline and characters in the entire movie. Movies like Hostel are sick and admittedly despite me thinking they are half decent they are a bit too much in terms of gore. However the Saw series in my eyes a entertaining, twist ridden movies that I enjoy thoroughly. But the ending of Saw 3 left me confused as to how they could make a sequel. Its no longer a spoiler to say that both Jigsaw and Amanda (the assistant) are dead. At first I feared the worst and was worrying in case it turned out Jigsaw "faked his death" or it was all a dream or something ludicrous. Thankfully they never do that, Jigsaw and Amanda remain dead, so who is the new Jigsaw? Well that would be telling wouldn't it. Saw 4 in my eyes is the very best of the Saw series to date, mainly because of its surprisingly not as gory as its predecessor. In fact this seemed the least violent to me since the first movie. This will irritate a few people, but its because of this lack of gore that the concentration seems more firmly on the storyline, and boy is it a storyline. The storyline is fast paced and intense and the final twist so brilliant that it rivals that of the original. Admiteddly I half guessed the big reveal, but there were a couple of smaller twists along the way I really did not guess. Overall Saw 4 is a superb movie that once again is being massacred by the critics for no other reason than its violent.So lets start with the cast of the movie. Tobin Bell does return in this movie as Jigsaw, but don't worry he's not alive. We see him in a series of flashbacks which are some of the best sections of the movie. One of the movies weaknesses I suppose is the fact as a result of his death we get a lot less of him on screen. A shame as his scenes in Saw 2 and 3 were definitely their highlights. Thankfully his past is still a intriguing enough to give Tobin Bell something to do and his voice still chills to the bone whenever the tapes beginning playing and the traps are explained. The man actually having to take part in the traps this time around is Lyriq Bent playing Rigg, a detective who has popped up in previous Saw movies but has never had anything to do. This time we get him for the majority of the movie. He's played very well by Bent, but admittedly he's just one of those characters that you don't really care about. His storyline is interesting but its much better when the twists are being revealed or we see Jigsaw's past unveiled. Costas Mandylor plays Hoffman and delivers a very good performance, Scott Patterson too plays yet another detective hunting for Jigsaw and has some good moment. Donnie Wahlberg makes a welcome return to the series and has a few good scenes to look out for, a shame he has little screen time. So what of the traps I hear the gore hounds desperately asking? Well as I've said before the traps don't seem as gory, but there are a few memorable ones. There is the knife trap that really made me cringe quite badly and seemed more disturbing than most of the traps in Saw 3, the hair trap that was a bit nasty, a bit involving an eye ball that wasn't as bad as I feared it would be, a two people trap that is superbly executed and I won't spoil, a bit involving a melting ice block that I cannot spoil oh and the sowed up eyes and lips bit that a majority of people have seen. The traps here might not be as gory but are certainly very memorable and well executed. The nice thing as well is that each of the traps have a certain amount of importance to the plot and lead up to the big reveal at the end that had my friend I saw this with in complete awe. What I also appreciated about this movie is that the traps this time round don't make you feel ill but do actually disturb you a bit more. This seems closest to the first movie in terms of tone, a nice thing in my eyes as it prevents the films from getting to repetitive. The only ways this movie disappoints I suppose is the fact that some things are not tied up enough, the ending, while brilliant and superb after thinking about it and finally understanding it, left me a bit confused at first and didn't tie things up enough for my liking. But my guess is that they're waiting for the inevitable Saw 5 to explain things that little bit more, and as a Saw addict I am happy to wait one more year to find out what happens next.Saw 4 is the best of the Saw series in my eyes and there is definitely life still in this series for it to go on for at least two more films. Not as gory as its predecessor, but the storyline and that superb final twist make the movie more than worthwhile. A great Halloween treat and a film Saw fans will relish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gruesome, suspenseful, but lacking substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I read that Saw 4 had new writers for its screenplay, I was leery. Being a huge fan of Saw 1-3, I was hoping some of the original writers would stick around for this latest sequel. But, when I discovered that Darren Lynn Bousman was staying on as director, I figured it would retain at least some of its charm and decided to see it in the theater instead of waiting for the DVD.This latest Saw edition was true to the gore and sadistic suspense of its predecessors, each act still involving a "save yourself or die" theme. The lead character, Riggs, is lead on a quest to tackle his inner struggle with wanting to save every victim in the world, and his inability to let go of what he cannot save. As he is lead through twists and turns of horrific proportions, the viewer is also treated to a side plot depicting Jigsaw's developmental years and what led him to become the twisted psychopath/savior of the Saw series, which proves interesting and compelling.My problem with this sequel is lack of character development. In all previous Saw movies, the audience experiences the anguish, torment and inner complexities of Jigsaw's target, who we get to know more and more throughout the films. When those lead characters are put through each test, the audience feels it more and more. In Saw 4, Riggs character is not given enough attention to really feel for what he's going through, so it makes his tests more gore than emotionally disturbing. That, coupled with a more confusing conclusion than previous Saw endings that gave closure but dangled sequel, made me leaving the theater with mixed feelings.Overall, this edition of Saw will please the franchise fans that love the new torture methods and shocking gore, but may leave fans of the moral dilemmas and inner torment of the movie's characters leaving the theater indifferent and confused.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Formula movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was my least favorite Saw movie so far. The previous entries were clever and complex. This one was just complex. It seemed like the main purpose of this installment was to provide supplemental information about Jigsaw's origin and how he became acquainted with his victims from the previous installments (mainly Saw II). This alternates with a plot line in the present which happens simultaneously with the events of Saw III.The present plot line seemed like it was forged to fill the time between the flashbacks of Jigsaw's origin. The twist wasn't exactly a twist, it was more or less a resolution to a mystery that was hinted at from the beginning of the movie. It was also somewhat recycled. The contraptions were less absurd than the ones in Saw III, but the story never really went in an interesting direction. Instead of having a solid original plot, it seemed like they just tried to milk the complex mystery and torture aspects for all they were worth.All in all, this just seemed like formula movie that cared more about catering to the fans than having its own unique plot. Of course it is left open for a sequel, but I fear Saw V will be enter the gray area between sequel and rip-off.If you see this, make sure you have Saw II and Saw III fresh on your mind, because there are numerous references to characters and events from these movies that you are expected to understand.</fullReview>

However, when SWAT Commander Rigg is abducted and thrust into a game, the last officer untouched by Jigsaw has but ninety minutes to overcome a series of demented traps and save an old friend or face the deadly consequences.So it's another October month. There's another "Saw". And there are more traps. And there are more victims. And there are new characters. And there is a similar plot. This all sounds so too...familiar. If this is going through your head when watching the TV spots or trailers for this movie, and you're not okay with it, you should skip this. On the other hand, if you just want to know, if you have to know the truth, watch it.There are two types of people for this kind of film. People who won't watch it because it's basically a repeat of the previous films and people who just want to know the truth. I'm in the group who just wants to know the truth. I don't care if this is a torture porn movie. I don't care if it basically repeats itself with a "been there, done that" scenario. I just want to know."Saw 3" could've been a great ending for a trilogy. But you know the studio will make more just to cash in. Of course, that's the reason. But "Saw 3" could've also left us (fans) in a cliffhanger. When we last saw "Saw 3", we don't know what happened to Jeff, our protagonist. I'll just leave you there because it'll ruin the movie if I tell you.On the other hand, this movie starts with Jigsaw dead (yes, he's dead and no, he's not going to be alive) in the hospital where the doctors are performing an autopsy. They find a tape in his stomach that says his work will continue even though he's dead and that's how it all begins...like the previous films.Should a fan of this franchise be willing to watch six movies to learn the truth about the who's, why's, when's, how's, and what's in the film? If it stays like how "Saw IV" played it, I'll definitely be watching more "Saw" films in the future. What makes "Saw IV" so good, in my opinion, is that you are put on the spot. You see what Jigsaw sees. You feel what he feels. You judge what he judges. This film is more or less like a origin film for Jigsaw, if you want to call it that.What I found really good/bad in here is that the film's pacing is fast. The good in that they think the audience is smarter and the bad thing about that is that it gets us confused while it continues on with the story. There's even a point in the film where I considered this to be the best film in the franchise so far. But there are some weaknesses in the film that prevented this to happen. It's very apparent that this isn't a simple story where you can find a simple solution to resolve it.What you want to know is the twist, right? Well, I suppose it's depressing and encouraging. The twist(s) have already been used in the previous films but at least they didn't try too hard to top off the ending for the original. And I like that there are enough twists to satisfy the freshness of this film.Everything else pretty much is the same. The flashy cinematography is still here. The famous music is still here. The very depressing characters are still here. Let's just hope the movie will end in a happy ending(?)If there's a fourth movie to a franchise, you'll think it has gone down the drain by now. Yeah, some will think that. For me, I think it's getting better and better. My expectations were so low for this film because I thought it would be the same thing over and over again. I was right but there were some few surprising things in here that I really liked. "Saw" fans will love this. As for people who don't care about these films, just walk past it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the previous Saw **Spoilers**</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reveal at the end was lame. Who is this Agent Hoffman and why do we care that he's evil? Why add so many new characters and kill off all the old ones? I liked Kerry. I liked Rigg. I couldn't give a rats ass about Hoffman. And it looks like Perez and Strahm aren't gonna make it to Saw V (which is inevitably going to happen) and neither is Rigg. And Wikipedia implies that that Hoffman guy killed Jeff's daughter, so... yeah. How much longer can they continue this 'Jigsaw kills through his apprentices and tests them from beyond the grave!' stuff? If you ask me, they never should have killed John off at the end of Saw III. Not to mention they still have several loose ends to snip off.On the bright side, the traps are finally getting good again. They finally teach us something about the characters and have something to do with their 'sin'. Morgan breaks her dependency on her husband by pulling those rods out of her body, killing the abusive Rex. That was cool. The Knife Chair made me wince, but it was the only trap that really did so in the movie. I like John's ex-wife Jill, although I don't know what such a hot woman sees in an old man with cancer. She will hopefully be in Saw V.All and all, it was better than the abysmal Saw III, but still didn't surpass the original, or even Saw II. The ending of Saw II was unexpected, and it surprised me because I kind of cared, but this ending was disappointing because we didn't get to know Hoffman before he turned evil. 'Bout a 5 out of 10 I'd say.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SAW.... one of my fav. movies of all time. Had everything in it i wanted to see in a horror. my only dream was that it would not end there. SAW II came.... and i was disappointed. traps were lame...it was nothing like the first...... but i did like where it took the story. SAW III... PUT SAW BACK ON THE MAP... this was the first movie in a while that made me turn away..... and it followed through withe the awesome twists and turns...... now...SAW IV... lets talk about the negatives. i felt the movie was edited way to fast. i felt half the time i didn't know what was going on until it was over. half the time you had to read something, i never got it...OK donenow the movie was really good other then that. story followed all the twists and all the turns. played with the world of time, and had traps to enjoy. suspenseful, and gory it was what a saw fan wants. so if u liked the first one and the 3rd one.... you will like this one and see how SAW IV.. is just the beginning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remember the Rules: Cherish life and Save yourself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When viewing this film remember these facts about the now Saw franchise. 1. The movies are about suspense 2. Crazy twisted characters 3. Gruesome torture mechanisms 4. and not the twist ending. if you remember these things you'll enjoy the movie as much as i did. I enjoyed the movie much more then 3 because i went in with the notion that saw isn't about an oh my god ending. The first film was about who's jigsaw. leaving a jaw dropping ending that no one could've predicted. All the movies to follow are about what moral dilemma these characters have gotten themselves in to deserve such punishment. The movie in a nutshell is about Cherishing life and Helping yourself. It also puts many characters in ungodly situations trying to stay alive as we the viewer try to figure out why and who is doing this. jigsaw is long dead and at the beginning we are treated to an autopsy of him. Gory stuff. A tape is found and we see that there are more murders and games to be had. The story shows flash backs of the jigsaw character and really gives insight into why he choose to pursue such a means of moral justice. The movie displays the slogan "cherish life" as we see multiple characters neglecting theirs out of stupidity or an obsession. The main character is the swat team leader "the black guy" from 2 and 3 who is now the victim of jigsaw's next set of home made justice. The theme of cherishing life is showed through jigsaw's own personal experiences in dealing with death and tragedy that he faced through out his life. It shows that jigsaw was once a humanitarian. He owned a clinic for people with substance abuse problems. He spent a great deal trying to help others. He also was a wealthy man with ambition and plans for the future. At the same time, Jigsaw was always a creepy man who constantly planned and plotted his next move. Jigsaw found all his plans destroyed with a few horrific acts. One in particular that altered his life leaving him to believe that you cant help others, they have to help themselves. The movie's ending wasn't anything special, it just showed that there will be more sequels and more murders. We also see how many people are place in the situation that they're in. You see, not all jigsaw's victims are placed in torture traps or locked in rooms. Some of his best victims don't know they are one. We see the swat team leader frantically search for his partners as he grows more and more obsessed with jigsaws game "think Danny glover in part one". We are also treated to a few surprises along the way via people we thought were dead "no not jigsaw or Amanda". I got to say this pleased me thought i can quote a guy leaving the theather as the credit rolled "i don't know if i can do another one".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw it was the cinema last night, its actually quite gripping, thought provoking &amp; entertaining as far as horror films go. The acting maybe lets it down, script is clever although slightly rushed &amp; it leaves plenty of unanswered questions for Saw V :P. Actor Tobin Bell deserves a mention, as Jigsaw, he gives you a great insight into this characters state of mind which come in the form of flashbacks. I recommend it if you are a saw fan, it does provide hope for a brand i thought would be declining but if they keep going at this pace - lets hope we don't have another Police Academy on our hands :) Enjoy it, and respect your life! ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Plot to String them All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loathe gore. I hate watching the cruel sadistic nature of the sheer enjoyment people get out of watching fellow humans getting dismembered. But this movie, as sick and strange as it may be...The plot is still in our minds. Now, I believe whole-heartedly that the first one was the BEST ONE, and probably could've left it at that. But when Saw II rolled into theaters, they had to finish the story. Saw IV was just a "piece" of the Jiggsaw Puzzle. It merely said the catalysts of Jiggsaw's "insanity", especially to how some of the ideas came along. So the end of life that hadn't even begun was the true start of this. However, as well as the plot is turning out, each twist and turn is to be expected. Seeing the "first" scene in the movie showed the audience that...it's still just the beginning. Amanda and Jiggsaw are dead, yes. But hey, Jason keeps coming back and Mike Meyers has a few breaths left in him. Saw V will NOT Be the end. I just hope they try to go back to how the first movie was...Less gore, more suspense...More thinking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This does contain spoilers....1. I'm guessing correctly that the beginning of the movie (finding the tape inside jigsaw) is really the end and that the detective is just listening to the "beginning" of a new saga? 2. The end of this one shows the dad from Saw III and the woman with the bomb around her neck. At the end of Saw III the dad was screaming and the movie cut to credits. But in IV it shows the FBI guy going inside the room ultimately to be locked up by the detective? 3. So all the stuff that was going on in IV, one could say was already happening in III? Any help would be appreciated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This might be the fall of SAW. I expected more. In the flash backs, it seemed that what turned John into Jigsaw was the death of his kid, not the fact that he was dying.Also, it looked to me like there was a time paradox in the film. In the start of the film, they got John's body, and know that Amanda was his student; yet at the end, John and Amanda are were they where at the end of saw 3. Am I missing some thing? Maybe it's Just me, but this Saw film did not feel like a saw film at all. Sorry to say, but this film is a huge let-down, and gets thumbs down. 'game over' for the saw movies? in summary the I thought the movie was let down. I joked that the writers must have gone on vacation and let their interns do the writing. As a fan of the series, i feel somewhat betrayed and the content of the movie was not as well depicted as in other movies.I would have like to seen the writers tie up the events of previous movies. A "tie-up" maybe wasn't done in the fashion I expected if they are thinking of a Saw 4. Well we'll all just have to wait and see if there will be another film, but I'm not sure this fan will be as anxious to go see it&gt; just my opinion.</fullReview>

If you are a SAW fan and like the films so far then you should go see this. Plenty of blood for the violent craving. The thing I loved was the origin of Jigsaw,truly the reason to watch this. I had an idea for a film called SAW 0 that they pretty much did with the flash backs for the main man in this film. Thank god,do to these we get plenty of Tobin Bell in this movie.But for me with this fourth entry the Saw films have begun their decline. But bring on the next one because I feel the franchise has a little left to say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw IV</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you thought the tests were over after seeing both Jigsaw and his accomplice Amanda dead by the third film's end..nope, think again. A third accomplice is now putting several people through a test, and a black cop wanting to find his partner, will hold the lives of others in his hands, as he follows the guidance of Jigsaw(?)in order to do so. This fourth film in the series further explores the evolutionary process in what motivated Jigsaw John into setting up his method for testing those who do not appreciate life in a positive way..a philosophy that developed primarily from a series of factors we see happen in this film such as meeting John's wife, a self-help psychologist who runs a clinic designed to assist people with emotional problems, how her disrupted pregnancy at the hands of a vile petty thief(..and John's cancer diagnosis)provoked his mad design, and her interrogation by Agent Strahm(Scott Patterson)needing answers as to how to find Jigsaw's workshop/factory. The black cop, Rigg(Lyriq Bent), told by his superior, Hoffman(Costas Mandylor), to step away from the case(..attempting to find Eric Matthews(Donnie Wahlberg), a returning character from the second film), is provided with a chance to help "others save themselves", in an ambiguous lesson he has yet to learn..he's the "hero who wishes to save everybody" while his personal life has been ignored during such an impossible quest. Meanwhile, a lawyer, Art(Justin Louis)survives a grueling test, only(..it seems)to be working for Jigsaw looking on as Hoffman(..who, it seems, was kidnapped as well)and Matthews are caught in a trap designed to keep both of them alive until Rigg reaches them. Agent Strahm and his partner Perez(Athena Karkanis)are investigating crime scenes once Rigg has been there believing the cop could possibly be seeking a vendetta with criminals he's been associated with in the past. Betsy Russell is Jill, John's ex-wife, who relates her former husband's story to Strahm, threatening to prosecute her if she doesn't help him find Jigsaw's whereabouts. The story also coincides with what took place at the end of SAW III as Jeff(Angus Macfadyen)runs into a detective, while attempting to find his daughter, after executing Jigsaw John, failing his test.Convoluting as ever, SAW IV has several alternating story-lines, keeping you plenty busy. The camera work and editing process will be certain to give you a headache sometimes, particularly during Rigg's(..and others)tests where director Darren Lynn Bousman can not keep the action still long enough for you to see anything clearly. There's a really nasty autopsy at the very beginning where a tape recorder is found in Jigsaw's body relating yet another message from the mastermind, even after death. The traps are just as elaborate and painstakingly designed as ever before, and I stand amazed at Jigsaw's ability to plan so well in advance just exactly how characters would react to their tests. And, the revelation of Jigsaw's second(?) accomplice is a nice touch no matter how ridiculous it might seem. Let's be honest, it's highly unlikely that anyone could create such a fool-proof design where characters would precisely follow every step without fail, and end exactly as he has planned. I find it hard to believe anyone, no matter how brilliant, could create such a design so perfectly, setting up the process without one wrong detail. But, the SAW series has always operated this way..characters are kidnapped, provided options to escape certain death, while concealed in a trap of some sort, reawakening their abandoned appreciation for life, tested concerning personal weaknesses that prevent them from living a better, more fulfilling time on earth. Rarely do any of these characters survive due to their own moral/emotional inadequacies and imperfections. And, as often is the case, those assigned to catch Jigsaw(..and his partners)wind up trapped as well. Just prepare for a lot of plots interconnecting..many viewers will perhaps become so frustrated, they'll throw their hands up. It can become tiresome after a while, and this sequel, as the others in the past, demand a lot out of the viewer because we are asked to believe that Jigsaw's scheme could operate so incredibly well, depending on peoples' predictably due to their flaws in character. I think the series is starting to loose steam, and implausibility stands out more than ever before.</fullReview>

It literally makes mistake after mistake after mistake. Ones that are far to obvious to any one of slightly above average intelligence. First, it starts of with the brain being removed from the body isn't attached in anyway, I guess our brains just float around in our head.Come on...then to point out the obvious ones apparently the writers didn't watch Saw 3. When the "agent's" ribs were torn open in number three, her chest was wide open to which you could see the lungs and what not. No in this its her stomach. Not only that but her chest is still there you know the area where the breasts usually are. Well suddenly her breasts up and left her body leaving her flat chested.Apparently the director has very little in the way of ideas or style because as soon as the normal writers disappeared he suddenly started using the same cliché fade outs over and over and over. I couldn't take it after the 4th time. Apparently he needs someone to tell him EXACTLY what to do.To top it off a strong muscular black man who's supposedly part of Swat is knocked out by a plastic bag? It has to suspend belief in the real world to work and I just can't get into a movie that requires that much effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beats number 3</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the title, I mean beats it at being total crap, which is some feat. Saw IV is one of the worst films I have ever seen, and I can't believe James Wan doesn't protest at the fact that the latest 2 sequels actually title themselves "Saw". They have absolutely nothing in common with Wan's excellent original. No. 2 also had little in common, but at least it was just about decent. Now all logic has been swept aside, the story is terrible and the traps are poorly designed. The director hired to take Wan's mantle, Darren Lynn Bousman, has once again proved he has no talent for the horror genre. Saw 2, 3 and 4 aren't scary in the slightest, and he can't even generate decent suspense, due to the fact he can't think of anything new to replace people jumping out of the dark.Once again, Jigsaw's past has formed part of the storyline, presumably to try and show us why he does what he does. But why would we care? The first film tells us his basic premise - he wants people that he feels do not appreciate their existence to show him that they do. We also found out later that he himself has contracted cancer, which started off his motive. That's enough surely, why does 3 and 4 try to make us sympathise with Jigsaw by trying to show him as a normal person? Tobin Bell is also a really poor actor, and displays the same emotion during every scene, whether he is killing, or in an 'emotional' scene with his girlfriend.Also, the story has again been neglected for horrific torture scenes. Although the first installment was marketed as being violent, it actually contains minimal violent scenes, and had a genuinely interesting idea. Saw 4 contains many traps, but at no point did I care about any of the characters - I didn't know anything about them, as no time was spent on developing them. The storyline is basically identical to that of Saw 3, and it really is a boring film - any supposedly scary moments are predictable. Another thing, why are some of these people even being put in these stupid games. The main character's reason for being there is 'he wants to save everyone'. What? Is that a crime? Surely thats a good thing. Why does Jigsaw claim he is doing the right thing and then torture a person who is 1) doing a respectful job and 2) arresting the very people he originally tortured because he thought they were bad? *SPOILER*The story also makes little sense. If the new 'apprentice' guy knows Jigsaw is dead, why doesn't he just shout to our "hero" Rigg and tell him not to walk into the room before 90 minutes, so they can survive, instead of relying on him not doing the thing that he has been specifically told to do.*SPOILER OVER* Also, what is with the lighting? Why do characters walk around their houses at night without switching lights on? Yes, darkness can be scary, but when characters are having regular conversations there's no need to build suspense, and we would like to actually see what is going on when we go to view a movie! All in all, this is one of the worst I've ever seen. Not only does it rely on gratuitous and disgusting violence as a sole reason for entertainment, the story is absolutely awful, and the 'twist' makes no real sense and is completely stupid. Hopefully people have realised this increasingly abysmal franchise has nothing to offer, and its days of making a nice profit at the box office are over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my eyes this is a self destructive film that lays to rest the Saw Franchise for me and various others. Although the people who get off to seeing people tortured to death will still go to see the subsequent films, I have reassured myself that the Saw series is dead. The twists are amalgamating into one, ambiguous twist, each one being near impossible to define specifically from the others. Plenty of blood and gore are present in Saw IV, and Jigsaw seems to live on via flash backs. His past is almost being re-created in a disparate attempt for some overly zealous newbie horror director to come along and be able to salvage enough story for a fifth (oh god) movie. Hardcore Saw fans will enjoy this collaboration of barely watchable blood, torture, and gore...as for everyone else -- don't waste 1.5 hours of your life.</fullReview>

I mean the puzzles are just stupid(spoiler) I mean the scalping machine it would hurt like hell but it wouldn't kill you and I hate it when they have other people do the puzzle for the person getting the punishiment I mean saw 3(spoiler) was all to teach the guy something but in this case its just not fair. The saw movies just need to stop they've already made one to many and I think that their just milking it out and for all they can get for it with out caring about quality. Saw 5 will be the first saw movie I won't see in theaters theirs just to much story and not enough of what the true saw fans crave and that's the cleaver puzzles and gore something that can actually scare me not this trying to tell a story crap (spoiler) I was fine with knowing only what they told me in saw 3 and their was no need to have a whole movie about jigsaws life with just a little bit of horror added in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Scary voice* "Stop saving people officer, the only way you can truly save them is by KILLING THEM!!! BAHAHAHAHAH!!!! I'm a psychotic bastard who cuts himself open in order to insert a pointless tape in my stomach!!!" Saw 4 is a dead end to what was a great series. Saw 1 and 2 were 2 of the best horror films of all time. Not only were they original, but the two movies combined crime with sheer terror, and not just sheer character stupidity. In the first two Saw movies the psycho babble bullshit was there, and there were mild hints of stupidity involved, but both movies delivered. Saw 3 and 4 just had rib cages and scalps torn apart.The plot of this Saw 4 was that a man was to be punished because he saves people, and correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't a cop SUPPOSED TO SAVE PEOPLE!!??!?!?! For crying out loud Jigsaw, you don't save people, get it through your gross torn open head and see that a cop is supposed to show concern for his fellow citizens and colleagues, he isn't supposed to sit and wait while they get torn apart, maimed, burned and dissolved in acid. I wouldn't blame the guy for trying to save people, THERE IS A LITTLE THING CALLED HELL! Why the heck is Eric Matthews in yet another trap!??!?!?! Didn't the poor guy learn his lesson when he had to cut off his leg, have his son trapped in a room with a poison leak, and stabbed with a needle by some psychotic bitch?(with whom I'm glad to see dead....finally)! Now he's standing on an ice block with a prosthetic limb and he can only be saved if A COP, yes A COP! Decides to be lazy and decide to let the guy rot. OK, who the heck is going to find out that the guy is going to die if he tries to save him? The movie is long and pointless, reveals nothing, and spirals out of control in what seems to be an attempt to be soaked in by audience members. You lost me at the third, I'm not following the series from now on... You hear that? You lost yet another fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really not bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hey all. I just want to say that although I have to watch this again (It's playing right now in fact) ... so that I can better understand some twists and turns, I rather like this movie. Generally through it I thought it couldn't hold a candle to the others. Like many others SPOILER ALERT ... I wanted to know what happened to the little girl - if John/Amanda/other ever REALLY had her at all - who was supposedly in such great danger at the end of Saw III. There's no payoff involving her, because of course by the end of this you just end up wondering what happened to her. But despite some confusion and discrepancies, I thoroughly have enjoyed this movie and I am surprised to still be looking forward to Saw V when I had no real hopes for this one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the first two, better than the third</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw. It's starting to be a yearly event much like Harry Potter and some of the other returning series. I was not entirely willing to head to the cinema to see this since I was so very disappointed by the 3rd part but a very bored evening was reason enough to go see it anyway. This fourth installment is better than the third. Story has even more plot holes but there are some bits in it that just work better than the previous part. It doesn't touch on the strokes of genius portrayed in the first two films but it still works out.So, another episode of gore. People meeting their end in the most gruesome ways imaginable and a leaky story added to it to slide show everything together. I hear there's another two in the making and I'm more or less happy about it. I will probably see the next one.6 out of 10 limbs torn apart</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will Satisfy Your Horror Fix</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Did anyone ask for a 4th Saw film? Well, not really. Saw III was a fantastic ending to a great trilogy. Did that fact stop Hollywood from moving forward with a new installment? Take one freaking guess. And while Saw IV was the worst entry in the series, it was still better than the hundred money-grabbing horror sequels we've been bombarded with this year (Hostel Part II and The Hills Have Eyes 2, I'm looking at you). Obviously, the originality is totally gone. The traps are becoming repetitive (but still as gruesome as ever), the plot twists are fairly predictable, and the new characters are boring. This movie is strictly for hardcore Saw fans. If you haven't seen the first 3 flicks, preferably in order, you'll feel completely lost in the second half. On the other hand, I think most fans will be pleased. The film, which sheds some light on Jigsaw's (Tobin Bell) backstory, is bloody, brutal, and has some great suspenseful moments. In fact, the movie opens with one of the most shocking, disturbing, and explicit things I've ever seen. Saw IV won't be winning any Oscars, but it can come in handy if you want to satisfy your horror fix.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an amazing movie, most probably the best (so far) of the Saw series. I am sure a lot of fans hated Saw III (but I loved it!), but this movie will satisfy them and make them love Saw again. I loved the storyline. It is very interesting. In this movie, you will know a whole lot about Jigsaw. New characters come in, which even makes the movie even better. But definitely, the best part of the movie is the ending. It was a brilliant twist that made me scratching my head for days. I really think this is a real horror film which keeps the balance between gore, drama, humor and twists/confusion. This is why I think might the best horror movie I've ever seen. But who knows.But I must warn you, whoever haven't watched this movie, you MUST watch Saw 1, Saw II and Saw III first! Without you watching this three movies first, you might get lost be very confused in this movie. I'm lucky I watched all of the films and now I have a better understanding of what's going on. I hope you will enjoy Saw IV as much as I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched Saw 4 expected the same as the previous two films...and it was exactly what i got, the same old same old twistful story with yes interested ways of killing people that do make you want to throw up but just... strangely too unoriginal now. And i find that they introduce too many new characters in each film. And i really couldn't distinguish between many of the male detectives...they all looked the same in this film.I really enjoyed the first film, it was something fresh and new and extremely gripping, then the second was slightly good but thats when i began to get a bit bored of the story. And now we've come to the 4th and i am sick of it. How long will they actually drag this storyline on for. Its obvious its becoming the modern horror franchise that Nightmare on Elm Street and Halloween was.And then just as i think maybe its over...ITS NOT Saw 5 is in pre-production. GREAT.I really am sick of this grimy, stupid set of films now please end them they are getting worse as they go down the chain. They were good but the sparks gone.</fullReview>

Lionsgate must be so pleased with themselves because of these films! A lot have people have commented on what they think of the new writers for the 4th film, they said it was bad.

This movie really answers all of our questions. This movie is very bloody and suspenseful and kept you guessing just what every Saw fan loves . This movie is littered with more traps and more twists and it really unveils the legacy of Jigsaw and how he became what he is. This movie is not for the queasy at all. This movie is probably the bloodiest along side SAW III. The traps are also really thought out in ways you'd never expect. This movie is by far the best Saw film yet! Go see it you will not be disappointed ! I know I wasn't!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has Saw run out of steam?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About this time of year in 2004, I went down to the cinema to see a low-budget horror film called Saw. Dark, disturbing, it got under your skin and had me walking about of the cinema open-mouthed with a shock ending. Three years later, I found myself walking to the cinema again, this time dizzy with expectation. I was desperate to see Saw IV. Having loved the previous films, and with an irresistible ending of the previous installment, I couldn't wait. So many questions needed answering, so many threads to be tied together...As I said, I left the cinema in 2004 open-mouthed. I remained in this state throughout the walk home (which got me many strange looks on the way, it has to be said). I left the cinema this afternoon very disappointed. Were the questions answered? Some, more were asked. Were the threads tied up? Not a hope. But still... the irresistible ending... surely there must be something there? No. The storyline goes off on a tangent, pushing the conclusion to Saw III in the background. As for the new traps, there's a couple of good inventions, but nothing as sinister as before. Tragically for Saw IV, the film seems to have lost it's invention.There are good moments. A glimpse into jigsaw's past is always welcome, although there's not much that we haven't seen before. References to previous films are always a nice nod to the fans, and the acting and direction are very good.Sadly, there's just too many flaws in this film. The ending is poor, and the main story just doesn't make enough sense in places - you're left wondering exactly how senior FBI agents can be that dumb in a couple of places. An ignored storyline and a lack of invention do not bode well for Saw V. I'm hoping they learn from the failures, and get back to doing what they do best - a group of people placed in extra-ordinary and inventive situations. Get back to the dark industrial hell of the previous films, and they have a chance. The invention of the Saw films is what has lifted the series above the normal "madman with a knife" dross, and I'm hoping they can get back on form.3/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I came in with great expectations for Saw IV and boy did it ever live up to those expectations! My friend thinks the saw movies will go downward but he will be sorry when he sees this masterpiece. Whoever didn't like this film probably didn't pay attention to the story or they were expecting a bad movie because everyone died in the 3rd one. I can hardly wait for 5, 6, and 7 to come out! DLB took these movies to the top and i expect the same with the remaining ones. The other three had great plot twists and this one was no exception. These films are known for their twists and I felt although this one was more easily guessed, it still gave me shivers and goosebumps. Relating to my friend he thinks it is going downhill because his sister told him she didn't like it. The real reason is because he is jealous that these movies are so well made he has to base his opinions off of what his sis who hates blood said. Enough ranting.

		<shortDescription>bodily harm for a possible survivor?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the first two Saw films, I think Jigsaw made traps that would sometimes cause serious bodily harm to the victim even if he/she survived (i.e. lose a foot or an eye) but wouldn't cripple them for life. You can get around without a foot, and you can still read, watch movies and function normally with one eye. The traps in the third film weren't made by Jigsaw really, so I won't comment on those.But as for part IV: Did Jigsaw mastermind nastier traps in case he was killed? For instance, the one where two guys are pitted against each other, one having no tongue and the other no eyes: even if one of them survived the trap, he would be SERIOUSLY handicapped for the rest of his life (either blind or mute). And here the choice is not theirs, they have been maimed BEFORE "the game" even begins. Any opinions on this?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Saw IV</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For fans of the Saw trilogy, you'd thought that the end of the third installment had wrapped up the franchise quite neatly, and there's absolutely no way another movie can be made except to go backwards in time with prequels. Well, surprise surprise, director Darren Lynn Bousman brings forth the fourth movie of the franchise, and so long as it continues to churn profits, you can bet your last dollar this isn't the last you see of the Saw movies. To be cautious, here's a little spoiler warning for you if you decide to read further. And one reminder, please refresh your memory of the earlier Saw movies, especially Parts II and III, before you go for 4.This is the beginning of a new franchise so to speak, with the obvious signs that it has attempted to be all encompassing, being a little timid to boldly create something fresh with a new direction, as it had to still fall back on Jigsaw to provide some stability first. And from the get go, Saw IV never lets up on the blood, starting the movie with plenty of plasma, and scenes directly reminding me of Unrest, with an autopsy being performed on our favourite cinematic serial killer. But things are always not quite they seem, especially when the signature tune gets played.As I mentioned, Saw IV goes for a two-pronged approach. One, to continue exactly where it left off from Part III, and thereby reintroducing us to characters and their demise from the earlier installment, and the constant mystery of just who exactly was the mantle passed on to, given this becoming a plot point left dangling. Two, given the relative successful creation of the enigmatic Jigsaw, now comes the time to fill up on the meat to his background story that we get a glimpse into from the past movies. In parts, this was like an origin story, about who he is, what he does, which circumstances occurred and drove him over the edge, and what actually provided that spark to his devilish creations and philosophy of twisted chance.I had mixed feelings for this movie, as I would for almost all movies caught in the middle of different methodologies and approaches. What I liked, was this origin portion, although it was played out sporadically, and left you clamouring for more. We even get to see Jigsaw's earliest designs, which were quite primitive but no less effective, and his pioneer victim, thus appreciating how complex the later traps have evolved, but yet keeping to his mantra and modus operandi, an immensely important part which distinguishes this villain from others. What I didn't appreciate, and this was in part due to the earlier movies with recurring and surviving characters, was that they all get lumped together here in too big a life-and-death game boiling down on coincidence and plenty of sheer luck. It was a necessary evil though involving so many characters, to keep you constantly guessing until the last minute, and to close up all the gaps that the earlier movies posed, so as to set the stage and move the franchise forward, probably in a different way in Saw V.You will be confused if you haven't seen the earlier films. This film is not standalone, and is very much integral to all the earlier stories. If you go into this fresh, you will not know who's who, and what's what, and will definitely be confused and not appreciate anything beyond the bloody creative traps. For those who have seen the earlier movies (Part II in 2005, Part III in 2006) you might have forgotten certain details, but fret not, just pay healthy attention to the dialogue, and keep your eyes peeled during the flashbacks, and you should do just fine.Saw has come a long way from being just a cleverly played out movie in one critical locale with just 2 players duking it out, and with the ditching of the iconic grimy toilet for Saw IV, it's an indication that it wants to shed itself of past inhibitions. While the key figure might have met his demise, he had already set in motion his ideas and philosophy that have its fair share of supporters, and the concept will outlast the man himself. What Saw had spawned was a series of torture porn movies (Turistas, Hostel franchise, Wolf Creek, the list goes on), but what makes it truly memorable, is how easily its ideology gets transplanted to other wannabes, and as a sign of it reaching legendary and cult status, its momentous theme song is one of a kind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked the first 3 Saw movies, but when I reviewed Saw III last year, I said at that time they should end the series there. Unfortunately, the producers felt differently and decided to make another....During an autopsy being carried out on Jigsaw an audio-tape id discovered in his stomach. Detective Hoffman listens to the tape, and discover's that Jigsaw's work will continue... Meanwhile after the body of Detective Kerry is found, SWAT team officer Rigg is lured into playing a new game created by Jigsaw, with the possibility of saving missing detective Eric Matthews and Hoffman from death...I won't reveal much more of the plot, except to say this movie isn't strictly a sequel. The events taking place in this on are actually happening at the same time as the events in Saw III.Although directed by Darren Lynn Bousman like the previous 2 Saw movies, this movie doesn't have the same intelligence the others did. One of the success's of the Saw franchise has been how clever not only the traps are, but also how the plots of each movie tighten like a noose at the end, as the twists and turns collide in the movie climax.Here however, something is missing. The first of many faults is that there is so much flashbacks happening, that you are never quite sure where you are. As for revealing the reason's for Jigsaw doing what he does, I'm not sure why they did that. To create sympathy for him? Make you feel better about only apparently bad people suffering at his hands? This doesn't fit with the end of Saw III that left Jeff trapped alone with his daughter trapped elsewhere, apparently doomed. They were not bad people,and didn't fit in with Jigsaw's own rules (I bring this up as the end of Saw IV collides into the end of Saw III, and has relevance).The 2 FBI agents who show-up don't really get a chance. One is given a warning about her partner, and is then put into hospital for the rest of the movie, thus unable to prevent what she was told about! the other agent, interrogates Jigsaw's ex-wife (and thus the flashbacks), but when he finally figures out an important plot, rushes off ALONE to confront him!! A killer remember who could have traps all over the place! Sloppy writing.The big 'twist.' Words fail me. The twist at the end was revealed far to early, if you've seen the previous movies, but worst off all makes no sense, at least not in this movie... it ends suggesting there will be more......but the biggest mistake made for me, and this is why I mention SAW III here, is the way it resolves Jeff's situation with his daughter. Simply put it doesn't. It's as if the writers and director have forgotten all about her. Again this may be resolved in another movie at a later date.I'm told there is talk of perhaps a Saw 5 and possibly 6. I thought 3 was enough, and nothing in this movie convinces me otherwise.</fullReview>

The plot at points is far-fetched and sometimes quite annoying. The traps in Saw 4 are good and there is lots of gore. But thats not why i rate this movie an 8. I rate it 8 due to the overcoming of a seemingly impossible task, make a saw movie without the original writers. The twist is good but not great, they could've gone in a better direction but it's still good.Saw 4 is a must watch for Saw fans. If you are new to saw movies, i would probably avoid this one, you might end up disappointed and confused because you haven't seen the others.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll start off with the bad; the acting. Besides the acting of Tobin Bell and Jigsaw's ex-wife, the acting is rather average in this movie, but perhaps the characters are just too flat to give the actors a chance to really get them right. There's no real protagonist except for Rigg, and even he appears to have his flaws, and his acting just doesn't have the same effect that a Danny Glover or Cary Elwes does.Now with the good, the plot is completely unpredictable with many twists and turns that really keep you on the edge of your seat. Jigsaw is dead; but his character appears is many flashbacks that explain how he got where he was sand such. His wife is also seen a lot in this, and really creates an uneasy feeling by being so timid. The traps are great as well, and much is explained in this movie, however there is clearly more to explain. After seeing this movie it took a minute to comprehend everything, but now I just can't wait for Saw 5, and 6! There's over 20 James Bond films, so as long as the Saw film makers keep up this kind of great work there should be no reason for the Saw series to end any time soon.</fullReview>

Besides it is watchable if you are a saw fan. Because, in these days, really good horror movies are not available. (Maybe few exception) So This one is worth watching.

		<fullReview>Of course this can't be as good as the first two, but is certainly an improvement from the inadequate Saw III, from Saw II and III director Darren Lynn Bousman. The film opens with the corpse of the infamous John 'The Jigsaw Killer' Kramer (Tobin Bell) having an autopsy (you need a strong stomach to watch), and when they open his stomach, they find a tape that detective forensic Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) plays, and it is obviously him saying that even though he's dead, his work will continue. Then we get back into the swing of things, a quick game with two victims, I'll get to that later. Officer Rigg (Lyriq Bent, the only one left from the first film, as far as I know) is the only one who hasn't been "tested", and of course, he is. After being knocked out, he wakes up back in his apartment, but it is filled with clues, and tapes saying that he has an obsession with finding him, but he has to learn to let go. As you'd expect, he is on a timer, and he must follow the clues, and each trapped person he must decide whether they deserve to live or not. Eventually, he gets to the final trap, where Agent Strahm (Scott Patterson), Art (Justin Louis) and still living Eric Mathews (Ransom's Donnie Wahlberg, first seen in Saw II) are waiting. I won't give too much away, but after seeing them, he overhears Jeff (Braveheart's Angus Macfadyen, from the previous film) killing John, and you realise that this is before they found his body, and the opening sequence is after all this. In flashbacks, you also see the relationship of John and his ex-girlfriend Jill (Betsy Russell) a little before, and soon after discovering he has cancer, aka the day he became Jigsaw and wanted to test people. Also starring Athena Karkanis as Agent Perez, Shawnee Smith (from the first film) as Amanda, Sarain Boylan as Brenda, Simon Reynolds as Lamanna, Saw III's Bahar Soomekh as Lynn and Dina Meyer (from the first film) as Kerry. Much bloodier than the previous, especially the autopsy sequence, and Bell (even being killed off) as Jigsaw is even more icy and emotionless. Traps include: the two guys chained together to a pulling device (one with his eyes sewn together, the other his mouth), the woman in a device that will pull her hair (ripping the top of her head off), the man chained down on a bed who must stab his eyes to get out or get ripped apart, the man and woman held together by pipes through their bodies (the guy dies of massive blood loss, and the woman gets out), Mathews standing on ice (with his broken ankle is a metal case) and if he falls off he hangs himself and electrocutes Strahm, blocks of ice above that smash someone's (I won't say who) head in, and the man who has to push knifes across his face to release his hands. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>saw 3 was looking a little tired although it did have some creative deaths and some gruesome endings. saw 4 shows the franchise in decline. We knew all we needed to know about the motives of jigsaw from the first three films. Now Jigsaw is dead we are subjected to a sequence of largely pointless and frankly dull flashbacks to flesh out his story further. It also removes all the remaining mystique of the character. I don't feel I need to know jigsaw acts the way he did primarily through his wife losing a child. As a narrative arc it just lacks any involvement or cohesion.In the purely visceral category of gruesome deaths and drawn out torture scenes I found the film also largely lacking the impact of the other three films. I found the most disgusting part to be at the start wherein Jigsaw is subject to the autopsy. But if thats all you want from film, Go on youtube and find the real thing.In general disappointing and a departure from the other films I thought. The most horrific thing in general is that the end leaves the door ajar for yet another sequel and with the way this is performing at the box office I wouldn't be surprised if we got one.

		<fullReview>As I walked out of the theater at the end of "Saw IV," I was faced with a quandary that quickly deflated any possible satisfaction from the situation?I desperately wanted to tap out a text message to someone, telling them how abhorrent the film was, and then realized that most of my friends either A) hate the series; or B) gave up on it two sequels ago. Nothing is quite as bad as making yourself the lone victim to a bad movie, but even worse is having nobody to relay the badness to.(Expect an excess of rusty spoilers from this point forward.) "Saw IV" is not a sequel I was awaiting with great enthusiasm. After the series high point of "Saw III," I foresaw a difficult road ahead for the inevitable future installments. In the year that has since passed, mainstream horror has been quietly regressing back to the fetal position?films of the "torture porn" sort have seen diminishing returns ("Hostel: Part II" and "Captivity"), and I was curious to see if there would still be an audience for "Saw IV" (knowing I would see it regardless). After yet another king's ransom of an opening weekend (which will drop off substantially in the weeks upcoming), the franchise has become to the new millennium what "Friday the 13th" and "A Nightmare on Elm Street" sequels were to the 1980s: cash cows that subsist on formula and name recognition alone ("The McDonaldization of horror," as Wes Craven puts it).At this point, the series has become contemptuously patronizing of its audience, and series auteur Darren Lynn Bousman (whose "visionary genius" mandates "A Film By" credit prior to each sequel), taking a cue from fellow torture-brat Eli Roth, has created a film where he plants his heel in our necks and smears our faces in grue with bullying delight. Granted, this was the calling card of the previous "Saw"s, but "IV"'s bloodshed comes off as nothing more than a desperate race to the bottom, showing less narrative function than an egomaniacal desire to glowingly boast of what the censors allowed in the final cut. While there were some tongue-in-cheek ironies to accompany the traps in "III" (a sleazy lawyer spattered with ground-up pig carcasses; a fleeing witness whose cold heart is given a deep freeze), new screenwriters Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan ("Feast") seem hell-bent on populating the film with characters so scuzzy and irredeemable (the overweight pederast; the young hooker) that their Ginsu-edited fates are neither cathartic nor affecting nor scary, just numbing.Gone is the terror of an ingeniously simple scenario (two men chained in a room, a dead body between them) that propelled the first "Saw" from a direct-to-video renegade to a box office success. In "Saw IV," Bousman's excess-laden direction is the nadir of music-video obnoxiousness: endless jerky pans (particularly of a man suspended on a block of ice), endless flashbacks that coalesce into the present with diminishing credibility, and that strobe-lit, sped-up "360" effect that occurs whenever someone trips a convoluted trap. It makes the distracting flourishes of "III" seem graceful by comparison.But perhaps what is missing most (and most missed) is the relationship between Amanda (Shawnee Smith) and John "Jigsaw" Kramer (Tobin Bell), a diabolical pair?not without humanity?who made the second sequel such an endearing high point. In a desperate attempt to salvage the sloppy script (and ultimately mislead the audience), "Saw IV" demystifies John by delving into his background (a successful architect, it turns out), even bringing his ex-wife, Jill (the awful Betsy Russell) into the m?lée (she co-founded a drug clinic with him). This backstory isn't peripheral to the ongoing plot?it's simply a way to establish Jill as a red herring, tastelessly show a bloody miscarriage, and get a glimpse of "Jigsaw"'s first victim?a peek "behind the curtain" that renders the moral madman a run-of-the-mill murderer.There are plot points involving characters who died and/or disappeared ambiguously during the previous films (they spend the film either hanging or rotting or both), and a pretzeled timeline that is particularly annoying and confusing this time out. By the time we see a rerun of the climactic events of "Saw III" and the convergence of 3 characters in the same place at the same time to instigate a Closing Revelation That Will Blow Our Minds, I had long since lost respect for this entry. By its very design, "Saw IV"'s intention is not to horrify, but to trip the audience up in a tangled plot so minor characters (played by Costas Mandylor and Lyriq Bent) can initiate the requisite last-minute plot twists that will give way to the Soft-Focus Flashbacks That Will Explain It All.I guess it's hard to deny the contradiction of being a (former) "Saw" fan?even with the formulaic closing revelations of the initial trilogy, the events stood their ground confidently, and made for interesting character-driven horror (something often shortchanged for gore these days). By comparison, "Saw IV" is a pathetic, gore-driven torture show that barely qualifies as horror: at this point, seeing a body cut up for an autopsy, revealing everything beneath the skin in lingering close-up, is simply par for the course. This year's much-derided "Captivity"?itself a borrower from the "Saw" school?is a far superior example of this subgenre.The Jig is dead, long live the Jig!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The biggest letdown of the year. The traps were alright, but they were too far spaced apart because of uninteresting story lines. There is much going on, none of which is engaging. I loved Saw 1 and 3, and 2 was also great, though not quite up to par. With new writers coming on board for part 4, the tone, pacing, and everything else was not the same. I won't buy part 4 when it comes out on DVD and I won't see Saw 5 in the theater unless Leigh Whannell comes back on board to write it. What a disappointment, never would I have expected to hear the crowd booing at the end of a Saw movie, but it happened in my theater and I from what I have read and heard, it is like that everywhere. After seeing this movie, I really, really wish they had just left it as a trilogy. Guaranteed it will die a quick death at the box office despite its 30 million plus opening weekend and Saw 5 will not make nearly as much as the others did. Lionsgate has killed their franchise with this piece of junk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than Saw III!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the midnight sneak preview of Saw IV and I completely disagree with the other user saying that it was the same ol' same ol'....it wasn't.The traps this time were MUCH more innovative in the sense that most cases the punishment fit the crime. I think the first couple of movies, they were being hurt to try to get them to survive but what did each specific trap have to do with the person it was intended for...nothing until Saw III and even then, they weren't set up for the specific intended victims.I don't want to give anything away because I feel that any type of spoiler that anyone reads about before seeing the movie will ruin the whole experience.....isn't that why you're paying big bucks to see it at the theater....so you can experience it the way it is meant to experience? So, don't read all of the spoiler comments from everyone until AFTER you have gone to see the movie. And if you liked ANY of the Saw movies, you are sure to enjoy Saw IV. The storyline was by far the best so far and while there may have been lots of flashbacks, if you watch Saw III before watching Saw IV, I don't see how you could get confused or lost in the movie with what's going on. (Saw III viewing is a prerequisite as far as I'm concerned as they are intertwined during several points in the movie...perhaps the one who posted the comment hadn't recently viewed Saw III and that's why he got lost...)'Nuff said. Go see the movie! :] Artic Vixen</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 4th installment of this tailspinning franchise is not getting any better. It's going to be hard for me to write 10 lines for this, since the movie can simply be summed up in one word "Garbage".We all know that the majority of people who will go to see this movie are teenagers aged 13-17. It's too scary for people younger, and too immature for people older.I sat through this movie, of course filled with 95% 13-17 year olds with their girlfriends.Though the original "Saw" was decent, the series since has gotten boring, stale, and monotone. I kept looking at my watch on this one, wanting it to end. Worst of all, with the theatre filled with 13-17 year old teenage females looking for attention from their boyfriends/crushes, I had to endure an ear pain-inducing bloodshot scream from them roughly every 10 seconds, even if the scene WAS NOT SCARY. For example, there would be a calm conversation between two characters on screen... SCREAM! AHHHHH! This only made me hate the movie more.This series has gotten stale and has worn out its welcome.

Do writers and producers no longer understand the philosophy called "Suspension of Disbelief?" Why can't Hollywood take a good idea, make a movie or two, and let it end there? Saw 1 was great. It was different and had you wondering what the real deal was. 2 was OK, 3 was a bore. 4 is nothing new and from what I can see, it's another Friday the 13th, where only a few devout followers will keep sinking money in the toilet and Hollywood will do another lame sequel and lame sequel.</fullReview>

Gore, for me, usually is not a problem but from the start I could tell it was gonna be a little much.For the most part the movie just made me and the person I was seeing it with just comment on how it seemed that they needed a movie asap so they slopped together a story that had some small resemblance to the previous Saw films and threw it on the screen.

		<fullReview>I really liked the twist in the end of the first two saws and they are the main reason why I liked them but the third was a bit disappointing because it was like a recap of the first two and the twist wasn't amazing.In the forth they started a new story and setting which didn't work and gave an OK insight of Jigsaw's past. The movie started off really interesting but then wasn't going anywhere. There where quite a lot of signs telling the police &amp; victims what to do but I can't hardly see it because they didn't give us enough time to read even if it was a few words.Also was really confusing that I went bold by scratching my head because it had about 4 or 5 settings e.g. the past, present, victims, and police. I'm not saying that I didn't like the film because there was not enough blood, gore or violence but because the story was poor, quite boring and the twist in the end was not really good. The writers are different which is mainly the reason why it's a let-down. James Wan &amp; Leigh Whannell were doing a great job.My list from best to worst is: 1) Saw II 2) Saw 3) Saw III 4) Saw IV</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw 4 is a decent movie with a good storyline that make take some bad turns but is overall still enjoyable,but the cast dosen't follow through as much with the dialog they were given.The story as cast is certainly much more weaker.If you haven't seen Saw 3 and are planning on watching it I would suggest to stop reading now as I am about to spoil the ending.I think it was a big mistake to kill of Tobin Bell so early in the series,they shouldn't have done it until maybe the final film,because he still trying to throw in as much of him as they can throughout the movie,because they know the film wouldn't be the same without him,but all his flashback scenes felt very forced,I think Bell felt like he has done enough with his character and that there wasn't much more he could do with him,although he was still without a doubt the best actor in the whole film and I would probably would be giving this movie a four if his scenes wern;t in it.My biggest issue with the movie is that the focus a lot more on blood and gore instead of being genuinely scary,most scenes were just hard to watch more so than frightening.If you're looking to watch the whole series of films,then you should watch Saw 4,but if you're looking for a good horror,I wouldn't recommend it.The Jigsaw Killer is dead but detectives still manage to get caught up in his posthumous,grisly,murderous games.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now, first off, this review is coming from a man who has been staunchly against gory, disgusting movies. That being said, I would like to say that this series, on a whole, has mostly changed me from that man.I am willing to agree that Saw IV isn't as good as Saw and Saw II, but I have to say that I found it to be as good, or even better, than Saw III. I'm more of a fan of movies with plot and twists. And that is exactly what this movie brings to the viewer.I have to admit that I didn't know for most of the movie what was going on. The final bits which reveal the time line that it took part during were a big shock to me. And I think that anyone who is more cerebral than visceral will agree that it was an amazing plot addition.I also really enjoyed the flashbacks that explained more of John Kramer's a.k.a. Jigsaw's past. I now understand more of his thinking and motivation. I can almost sympathize. Now, I don't believe that killing people, or allowing people to kill themselves, is okay, but that's another issue.On the whole the movie is fantastic. It's gory, but it makes you think. Well, it made me think. And this is all from a guy who used to hate the stuff that makes the Saw series fantastic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Saw franchise is my biggest guilty pleasure, and I enjoy all of it's aspects. Sure, it is very gory, but I find it all very effective, and it has some of the most inventive deaths seen on screen. For that same reason, most of the criticism of the films comes from the label 'Torture Porn', and while I cannot disagree that it is bloody, what the hell is torture porn? Isn't porn a good thing, so why the two together? Saw IV was another entertaining and bloody good time to add to this franchise. The twists and turns that Saw has to give ALWAYS shock me. I love the new Jigsaw assistant, and was very entertained and squirmed like always. I am always impressed with how they mix all the story lines from previous Saw films together, and this was no exception. I also like how insignificant characters in the first films become important in the newer Saw films. While I thought the writing was flawed at times, as well as the dialogue more heavily than before (due to the new writers) they still did a great job. While I thought Saw III was overall better, this pretty much ties up with the 2nd (which is kinda overrated, the best sequel to me was 3)). I will always follow this franchise, because of Jigsaw and his apprentices and their always new games. Now on to 5 and 6!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw I-III were excellent movies, a real highlight in the horror-genre. I liked the third one even better than the second one (the first is the very best, can never be topped) but I also thought this was a trilogy (like the old Star Wars movies). Because come on: Both Jigsaw as Amanda are dead, the game is over !!Saw IV has the same director as the third one, and the story seems to pick up right after Part III. During John's (Jigsaw) autopsy, a tape is found in his body which sets the game once again in motion. But also this time the story is linked to the previous one's with yet another unexpected twist at the end. The killings are once again surprisingly entertaining and yet sadistic.I really like these kind of movies if they're well done with lots of thrills and when they keep you in the dark until the end. Some people call this and movies like Hostel "torture-horror" or even "horror-porn". I totally disagree, it is still entertaining make-believe: this is NOT "faces of death" !! We're watching special effects here, I love them ever since I saw "American Werewolf in London" and it's Making Of when I was still a young boy. These movies are not made for some kind of "underground group", if that was the case, they would not be working on Part VI right now. Go see it if you haven't already, Part III was certainly not the end..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw IV is an awesome horror movie! Although Jigsaw is dead, his work WILL continue! I love Jigsaw's autopsy at the beginning. The police find Kerry's body and Rigg is very upset. Later that night, after his wife leaves for a few days, Rigg is attacked and forced to play a game. Rigg has a few tests. His ultimate test is to learn how to let go and truly save Detective Eric Matthews and Detective Hoffman before 90 minutes. After Rigg tries to save a female pimp from dying, she tries to kill him. Later, Special Agents Strahm and Perez arrive at Rigg's house and try to figure out what is going on. Later, Strahm and Perez visit Jigsaw's ex-wife, Jill Tuck. We see in a flashback, that Jill is pregnant and because of Cecil, a junkie, accidentally slams a door on her stomach. When Jigsaw learns that his unborn baby has died, Jigsaw decides to teach Cecil a lesson in the Knife Chair, which is one of my favorite traps! Flash forward to the present, Rigg is still looking for Eric and Hoffman. Strahm tries to get Jill Tuck to tell him more about companies that Jigsaw owns. Will Rigg succeed? If you love the Saw series, you will definitely love SAW IV!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is Where the Saw Franchise Starts Getting Confusing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now that Jigsaw and Amanda are dead, how will the games continue? Well, you'll have to wait and see. But trust me, they do -- Officer Rigg is in a race against time to save his fellow detective, Eric Matthews (no, not the kid from "Boy Versus World"). But how many must die so one man can live? I'm going to be blunt: this film is a complete mess. The plot doesn't make a lot of sense. The traps are very elaborate. And maybe I'm thinking too hard, but I just don't see how Jigsaw could expect Rigg to follow the clues exactly as he has to to move from step one to step two. There are probably fifteen occasions in the film, if not more, where a character has to act precisely as Jigsaw would predict or the whole scheme falls apart.The blood is there, the traps are there. And the best part about this film is the attempt to explain Jigsaw's origin (if you have no other reason to see this movie, that's the one reason I can suggest). I really liked the backstory. But with each new film, the "life lessons" Jigsaw was teaching get more and more vague or seem to disappear altogether. And a serial killer who sets traps is fun, but how is that different from every other horror film out there? Jigsaw was a man of ethics, however twisted... he's lost that now. (Although, being dead, i suppose he doesn't much care now.) You watched the first three, you may as well watch parts four, five and six. Sure, they'll never regain what the first film did for the fans. But we're in too deep now. And who knows, they may reverse course and get better... "Friday the 13th" had some bad years but came back. I'll let them give me five and six... but after that, if things don't improve, they're going without me. (But, I'm rambling -- you should see "Saw IV".)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw 4 opens with John, the Jigsaw killer, dead on a coroner's worktable. As soon as the movie started, I saw a man about to perform an autopsy on the first movie, hoping that somewhere within its lifeless corpse he might find something, anything, with which to fill up another movie. And can you guess it? He found it. Apparently John swallowed one of those little tapes sometime during part 3, and the games, unfortunately for us, are not quite over. Maybe he owed the producers a favor. Saw 3 had no reason for being made, so we know that the series is as dead as a doornail by now, so unfortunately I have to say that anyone who sits through this thing can't really complain. Yes, the movie is pathetically bad, but you can hardly feel tricked. Personally, I was just curious to see how they would continue a series that is now so clearly being done only for the profit. There is still the same tired formula of this guy putting people in horrendous situations to punish them for certain moral crimes, generally for not "appreciating their lives." It was easier to overlook the ridiculous irony inherent in that premise during the first two movies, which were original and fresh, if a little disturbing, but now we are two movies later, the guy is dead, and still there is nothing new. I don't expect to see something new and innovative in every single movie I ever see, but anytime someone makes a good movie, if they make threes sequels they had better be doing something new, and Saw 4 definitely is not.The first big torture scenario involves two men chained together. One man's eyes are sewn shut, the other man's mouth is sewn shut. The man who can see notices that in the middle of their chain is a machine which will slowly reel them in, ultimately tightening the chain and, I suppose, beheading them. He can also see that there is a key attached to the back of the other guy's neck, which he knows without being told will open the padlock around his own neck. He must have seen the previous movies.Immediately, they start fighting with each other with various metal implements lying around. Why do they start fighting? I don't know, maybe they're evil by nature and respond to confusion with violence. It's their undoing though, all they had to do was twist their chains and the machine would have snapped it like thread. Then again, this would not have resulted in enough footage of two guys doing horrible things to each other, and the producers would have been unsatisfied. Are you catching on to who the real sadists are here?Soon we see Karen, whose ribs were torn off in part 3. It's a terrible sight to see her hanging there with all of her organs exposed, and I am frightened to consider the fate of the soul of the person who came up with that idea. Granted, all she had to do was pour out the acid and take the key out of the bottom of the beaker with minimal acid burns. Maybe she was too scared to think straight. Then again, I would have been more concerned about how the machine was attached to my ribs than how to get the key, which was a pretty simple riddle if I've ever seen one.I'll admit that I had no problem watching the fat guy in part 4 get his eyes put out and then get quartered. If anything new is done in part 4, it's that it has one guy getting punished for a crime for which he deserves brutal punishment. He violently raped however many women and collected the bloody pictures of them. I didn't catch whether or not he killed them, but it doesn't matter. Seeing someone deserve their punishment was a unique experience in the Saw movies.Then again, later we see an abused wife tied together with four foot rods pierced through their bodies, holding them together. Punishing an abusive husband AND his wife? Come on. All the wife has to do is pulls out the rods, which will leave her relatively unharmed but which are piercing crucial arteries and organs in her husband's body. Yes, abused wives often have a terribly hard time leaving abusive husbands. Making it this painful is not going to make it any easier. Maybe it's a message to abused wives in the audience, but I doubt there are many.The biggest problem with the movie is that at the end, instead of giving us a good twist like the first two movies did, the story folds back on itself and, in the space of about three seconds, the timeline of the story completely unravels and makes no sense whatsoever. You will be thoroughly confused by the time the end credits start, but the upshot is that you won't care, at least it's over?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw IV is the improvement upon its predecessor that one couldn't quite be sure it would be. It restores the fast-paced, tangling plot weaving that is at the same time both jittery and brooding, that which was the storytelling niche of the first two Saws. The way the first film was claustrophobic in that it put us directly in the characters' bone-chilling situations, the third film was claustrophobic in that it was missing something by not expanding further. I kept feeling like there was supposed to be more to the story, more to the action, more to the violence and the horror, but there wasn't. Saw IV fills in those blanks.It's one thing to withhold from the audience in a way that keeps them guessing and keeps them at your beckon call, but when your third film fails in the fright of the first and the mayhem of the second and you're only outlining for what is to come in the fourth film, the confidence in the consumerism of wide-release gorefests is being taken advantage of. However, I was very entertained by this fourth film. Where the last Saw had too little going on, Saw IV comes millimeters away from tying itself in knots. Multiple knots. There are inevitable inconsistencies. For example, the spine pincer was an unusually ineffective set piece for the Saw films, as its victim briefly bends his head, clearly showing that he can get his spine out of reach of the blades intended to slice through his neck if he fails the completely unfair test, meaning the pincers can't extend, meaning the victim has no commitment to the stupid test. Yes, the perfect atmospheric effect of terror, Jigsaw's anonymity, the audience being put in the same naivety of the situation that the characters are in, all the impressive and more than satisfying effects of the first Saw will forever be spoiled by the continuing series. But the filmmakers have more often than not provided some very twisted cinematic thrills.The Saw films are not simply a slasher franchise that churns out what might as well be empty celluloid each year for a profit it doesn't deserve from a knowingly dissatisfied crowd that deserves the rip-off. They transcend the usual brainlessness by giving its series a great deal of density and wit in a continually unfolding story. When will Jigsaw's games end, and what will it take? In each Friday the 13th, Halloween, Scream, and I Know What You Did Last Summer, the killer dies, yet somehow dying does no good. The Saw films, to put it generically to protect you from spoilage, do not cheat in that regard.In this fourth Saw film, the amount of plot strands has the film's narrative format resembling a Guy Ritchie film like Snatch or Lock, Stock, yet it has the gruesome depravity, morbid-to- the-gallows sadism, and voyeuristic and fatal manipulations of a go-for-broke gorefest. This is why the Saw films merit their annual return and the continuing franchise. I welcome the dreaded Saw V and already announced Saw VI, because these filmmakers strenuously weave contrived yet provocative webs that end with usually admirable twists, this one being the most admirable yet coming in second to the original film's traumatizing finale, that leave us authentically hungry for another film, that will conveniently attract us next year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not without production flaws, but quality overcomes quantity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who has ever visited the House of Jigsaw forums or the officialsaw.com forums knows how many fans were up in arms against the release of this film. This was because of the sound ending that Saw III had, killing Jigsaw and Amanda. However, the show has "gone on", and with Saw V, we will see what David Hackl can bring to the table.I truly enjoyed this chapter of the saw series more than I did the last two, and believe that it had the best ending since the first for a few reasons. One: there were no ridiculous heartstring-attempted moments like there were in Saw III. While Amanda was an important character, she was a murderer and a drug addict, and I don't believe that there is any real sympathy to be had for someone in her position, especially when she's waving a gun around at everyone. Two: The focus was on the games and the flashbacks. The exact same formula from the first movie is used for the first time in a sequel, and, oh my gosh, it works. Saw's strength was that it had character development and focused on the traps and had flashbacks to further the character development and explain the events going on, since it starts en media res. Even though Rigg isn't fleshed out, which is a small disappointment, Jigsaw is the focus, and we may finally have a full picture of exactly who he is. Finally. Three: Three: the ending, though it may have been slightly predictable, is the strongest of the sequels. Why? because it hinges on what is going on with the storyline, not another jaw-jerking plot twist thrown in there just because. Saw II's ending was very strong, but only half of it was based on what was going on throughout the entire movie, and Saw III's ending was even moreso, since we had no idea about any of it the entire time. Saw IV's ending (aside from the whole "same time as Saw III" aspect) is entirely based on the plot, and is very shocking if you haven't figured out why these things are going to happen. It's just too bad we don't know who the next Jigsaw is yet, but hopefully Mr. Hackl can enlighten us next year.Overall: 8/10 for production mistakes, but it gets additional points for being so very enjoyable and not merely shocking on a level comparable to Hostel.Therefore, 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>typical SAW feeling, surrounded by a bad story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I'm a big fan of the hole Saw series. I liked part one the most, followed by part three, part four and in the end part two.Yea Saw IV is a pretty entertaining movie, it contains some new kinds of traps and machines which are partly even more brute than in the first three Saw movies. Allthoug the movie is entertaining well, the story gets pretty lame after a fast and bloody start. Don't misunderstand me, the story itself is not the problem, but nearly every ten minutes there are sort of back flashes, which tell you the story of the younger Jigsaw, the man he was before he started to treat humans. These parts are just too long and you are not able to follow the real story properly while trying to understand the life of the younger Jigsaw.In part three, there have already been sort of back flashes and I really liked them, 'cause they just gave you a short information, like a piece of a puzzle and you could just make your own summary. In part four this is already done for you, you're just watching and get so many informations about the mystery of Jigsaw, that he looses his diabolic era if ya know what I mean...Another point is, it seems that the producers try to get bigger at all in every part. Part one was in a single room, part two in a house, part three already in a hole industrial building and in part four the main person has to walk around in the hole town to survive. What will it be in part five? The hole world? Not only the locations increased, but also the number of actors. You've absolutely no chance to keep the overview, who is who, and who is involved in the main story, even not who's good and who's evil...6 out of 10, but nevertheless I wasn't really disappointed, 'cause I'm just a real fan of SAW. I don't care whether it's commercial bullshit or not, the trap-scenes are always interesting and fascinating, and in the end the traps are what SAW is all about, aren't they?R.I.P Jigsaw 2004 - 2006^^</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw IV</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the original Saw hit the screen in 2004, it gave the horror/thriller genre a much needed boot up the jacksie. Audiences had become tired of the same homicidal maniacs picking off scantily clad teenagers. Whereas other horror movies had big hulking supermen who refused to die, Saw came along with a more thoughtful look and refused to even reveal the killer. Saw also heralded the rise of the intelligent serial killer, (although technically he never actually killed anyone) who used brain over brawn in a new and even more scary way. Through the by-the-numbers Saw II and the gore-fest of Saw III it seemed the franchise had travelled too far, raising the blood and guts spilt in ever more ingenious ways then its prequels but lowering the intrigue and suspense which provided the backbone to its success. The beauty of an unknown murderer being ruined by a succession of gruesome deaths which took centre stage. The originality of the first film was lost. Saw IV, although continuing down the path of ever-increasing violence, has a more-rounded plot then its predecessors. Saw IV opens with the autopsy of John/Jigsaw which asks the question where does the film go if the Jigsaw killer is already dead? That question is answered when a cassette tape covered in wax is removed from Jigsaw's stomach. When played it states 'the games have just begun'. In typical Saw fashion, everything is not as it seems and the twists and turns in the plot lead the viewer on a wild ride of blood and guts.This instalment mostly concentrates on Lieutenant Rigg (Lyriq Bent), who having seen colleagues go missing is welcomed into Jigsaw's game. Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) sees his obsession to protect and save others as a punishable offence as he believes that people should be made to save themselves. The film then comprises of showing Rigg the error of his ways and teaching him to wait and allow those in peril to save themselves. A concept he seems unable to fully grasp. Following Rigg every step of the way Agents Strahm (Scott Patterson) and Perez (Athena Karkanis) who are led to believe that Rigg is in fact Jigsaw's latest accomplice.The story leads to a thrilling climax at the meat-packing plant owned by John were all the clues become apparent, leading up to the final twist which explains some of the questions and then proceeds to ask many more neatly tying it up for a further sequel, Saw V, due next year.The development of John's character as the man behind the clown mask provides a humanistic story of the mayhem that descends around them. This film delves into the reason why John became the Jigsaw killer even producing sympathy for him. One of the best parts of the Saw films is the discovery of why the victims are in such situations and the irony of the situations they find themselves in. In Jigsaw's eyes he's not killing people; he is trying to help them save themselves, as such there is always a way to escape the sadistic traps that Jigsaw has prepared. The franchise which has often been described as pornographic gore continues with extreme violence amongst the most blood-curdling traps that have ever been set, however the beauty of them is the reason behind each trap. It boggles the mind to think how the writers continue to come up with such horrific traps that constantly shock and thrill in equal measures. However, one of the main problems with Saw IV, and in fact, all of the Saw franchise, is the need to believe that John can continually evade the police and continue his games with unsuspecting players, despite being at death's door himself. The complexity of the storyline throws off many tangents along which the story runs without fully exploring some of them, for instance who is the man with his eyes sewn shut? There is also the need to believe that people will happily assist in his games merely by being told that they will die if they don't and never challenging him upon it. Despite this though, Saw IV is an engaging and thrilling sequel to the other three Saw films, and continues the story towards a probable complete ending in Saw V. It delivers on all counts with regards to blood and guts, ingenious methods of torture and other violence. The back story of John is a pleasing sub-plot whilst the continuing brilliance of Jigsaw's mission to punish those unworthy of life maintains all the bravado and creativity of its predecessors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To start my review, I would like to say that when Saw came out in 2004 i thought it was the dumbest idea ever and it was very stupid. When Saw II was released I said, well another dumb remake. Finally, when I heard about the third movie I said, well I'll take a look at it and when the credits started to crawl after the first film i though how wrong I was, and watch Saw II as well. I went opening night to Saw III and was blown away by how good it was, not as good as first two but compared to "The Grudge" and "One Missed Call" it was good. When Saw IV was confirmed I bookmarked the IMDb page and kept up on all the news until October 26th. I loved it. It has everything I wanted to keep these movies fresh. I will definitely be going at midnight to Saw V and VI.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One hell of a sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw came out in 2004 and amazed people with its sicko way of portraying a horror/crime story, it blew away every last piece of your insanity, and kept you wondering what just happened. After the mega hit came the second in the story and began placing small pictures of what more happened but also to confuse even more. The third came out later on but didn't seem to use the story factor as much as it were before, yet still it showed a lot of the story maybe not as much but still. Now for the fourth piece the story returns to how the start began with telling a story testing your insanity to the limit. Many seeing this movie will ask themselves these questions (How,Who,What) and still be amazed at what just happened after the ending is portrayed. If you are like me you wont ask though, my logic is very wide so i actually understand almost every part but still only almost and for that i want to praise this movie course i never pictured the ending like that.If you like horror flicks and just in for a kick then don't watch this, yet if you are the person who loves a story that you will want to wonder about for days to come choose this. it is amazing how they can keep making sequels that still works, and i hope to see the fifth as another great release and also mind blowing.I don't know how many more there are going to come in this series but i could picture it maybe. I think the ending to everything of this story will end in maybe Saw 6 or 7 i don't think the 5 is going to end it.And because i think that is well the next Jigsaw has begun and we would want to know what happened between the pieces and i don't think it all could be told in one more movie, and i hope not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was a little let down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was and still really am excited by the way Saw III had ended. Several of my friends had come up and asked because I am a really big film buff "Is there going to be a sequel?" and I was pleased to tell them yes. However, as soon as I started watching Saw IV, I really wished director Darren Lynn Bousman had rethought this idea and just left it with Saw IV. Now don't get me wrong, there's still a lot of good things about Saw IV. Characters are intense and Tobin Bell (known to all as "Jigsaw") still returns in flashbacks for the movie which is probably the best element of the movie. The traps are still really wild and gory but, some really don't seem scary more along the lines of an action/fight scene which isn't bad just not what you expected from the Saw series. Ultimately it's greatest flaw comes from its story: there are plot holes everywhere, and more importantly the film doesn't really tell you much, just really leaves you confused and seems like they're trying to say "Don't worry, we're going to patch it up in Saw V". I don't believe that the series is dying but this just left me confused and disappointed. Unless you're a big fan of the Saw series, don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the best in the series, but good enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can still remember it like it was yesterday. Freshman year of college and meeting up with my friends on Halloween weekend to see the first Saw. Just from the looks of the commercials, I could tell I would like it but from the looks of it, it looked like just another psychological thriller. I thought my thoughts were right once they revealed Zep was the kidnapper and thought "Guess this wont be a whodunnit thriller." But then at the end when Adam pulls out the recorder after killing him and finds a message from Jigsaw on there I thought "Well, who else could have done this?" and that's when the dead body that was in the middle of the room the whole time started rising. Me and my friends were just in complete shock afterwords, because we had just seen the best psychological thriller since Se7en! Then came the sequels of course. Saw 2 was just as awesome, and a nice twist as well. Saw 3's twist didn't blow me away as much, but the traps were just grueling in this one! But after seeing S2 and before we even knew S3 would come out, I said to my friends "They should just stop at number 3, cause there's only so much they could do with this!"But was I disappointed when I heard the news of Saw 4? Nope, because there were some stuff in #3 that kinda confused you (What was on the letter than Amanda read? Why was Jigsaw pouring wax all over the mini cassette tape?). So I go to this movie last night with high hopes. Was I impressed? Yes, of course. But I wouldn't go as far as saying it's the best in the series. For one, the twists are almost becoming predictable. Saw 1, we didn't except too much of anything, and Saw 2 we thought we were paying lots and lots of attention but apparently not. But now we're pretty much looking all over the place. The twist was a nice one, but let's be serious, nothing, I MEAN NOTHING, can outdo the first movie's twist! Now let's move on to the next best thing about the Saw series: The traps! Well, first I just wanna say this movie's tagline was kinda weak. "It's a Trap!" No duh! Are we trying to sound like a Star Wars character now? "Oh Yes. There Will Be Blood" is so much better! But to the traps now. I still say Saw 3 had the best in the series (All about "The Rack!" Brrrrrr!). None of the traps in this one made me wince as bad (but then again I've seen tons of these types of movies), but still gory and good enough! Nothing like seeing a man get his head crushed by two blocks of ice! Yeah!I will gladly go see Saw 5 &amp; 6 when they come out, but I do have a bad feeling. IMO, the series is kinda regressing. The first had me smiling from ear to ear while this one...not so much. Hopefully they prove me wrong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing new to the fourth in the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Saw was a pleasant surprise, but part 2 was a disappointment. I missed part 3 because of the disappointment of part 2, but decided to go see this fourth installment because some people said it was pretty good. However, Saw IV adds nothing new to the series, and wasn't even psychologically scary like the first film.The plot is simple because it's the same thing repeated over again. Jigsaw and his apprentice Amanda may be dead, but that doesn't stop Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) from planning another trap involving SWAT commander Riggs. Riggs is kidnapped and thrust into Jigsaw's latest game, giving him 90 minutes to save two familiar people. I won't say anymore because it might be seen as a minor spoiler.The fourth in the series is grisly like the other films. It is a gross out movie, but without the scares or psychological attack of the first film. Many of the scenes are effective, and I found myself getting a little queasy, but if you've seen the other films, you won't be surprised by what this film offers. I was not scared at all.Yes we have the usual twist at the end, but like everything else about this film, it's no different then what happened in the other films at the end. They'll be a part 5 I'm sure, but I won't be going to see it unless it offers something new. I cannot recommend this film, but I'm sure the gore hounds will be pleased with what it has to offer. Me, I like my movies scary, not just gory for gore's sake. Gore is nothing if the movie itself isn't scary.</fullReview>

Not like it was a bad thing, but it certainly feels like the fourth time we're seeing this. And of course we are faced with a Twist Ending...which isn't all that surprising because you expect a twist...it looses it's "OH MY GOD I DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING!!!" shock factor from the first movie. I can't knock this completely because it's not all bad, it's just it's the FOURTH TIME! the other thing that's sad about this is that there are a FIFTH! and SIXTH planned...I hope they can pull off some miracle and make the series fresh again.

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly not bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) is dead (That's made VERY clear at the beginning). However he has left a few traps in his wake. Lt. Rigg (Lyriq Bent) has had most of his friends on the force die at Jigsaw's hands. He's racked with guilt--but it seems Jigsaw has left a few "tests" for Rigg to save two more of his friends who will die if he doesn't get there in time. But how has Jigsaw set up all these traps if he's dead? Also we get to know Jigsaw's origin.Surprisingly not bad. They found a way to continue the series without insulting the audiences' intelligence (like the "Friday the 13th" or "Halloween" series with got increasingly stupider). Like the previous ones the tone is grim, the traps set by Jigsaw very gruesome and this REALLY pours on the blood and guts. There were twists and turns I didn't see coming and it all ends with a satisfying conclusion (even though it left open the door for more sequels--which we're getting). The only bad point was Bent. He was TERRIBLE as Rigg and lessened the impact the movie might have otherwise had. Still, if you have a strong stomach this might be for you. Be warned--there are references to the previous movies so this might be hard to follow if you never saw them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most emotional and twisted Saw yet.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was skeptical when I first saw Saw IV. Even after it was over, I was worried that I didn't like it. As I viewed it, I didn't get that "Oh, God, that's sick!" feeling I had with Saw II and Saw III. Maybe it's because I'm desensitized to this type of violence after seeing the others in the franchise, or maybe it's because the Saw crew are running out of ideas. But by the end of the movie the only thing on my mind was: "Dude, that was a mind trip." And to this day I'm not sure I understand everything that happened. Unlike most clichéd thrillers, Saw IV does not tell you everything that is going on and if you don't understand it, it doesn't care. It actually puts it up to the audience to understand, and makes YOU use intelligence, instead of having a hundred pointless conversation scenes as would be typical for this genre.A day after I watched it, and let it settle, I realized how amazing this movie was. It's quite different from the others in the franchise. I cannot even complain in the slightest about the camera-work; it was the best I have ever seen from Saw. The plot, as I mentioned, is a true mind trip. It's not just another "Hmm, that was a little weird" like Donnie Darko, but a truly ingenious, twisted plot.Don't listen to people who say this is the worst in the series. It is just as good as the original was, but for different reasons. And, though I personally found Saw II to be the most brutal of all four, there is more blood in this movie (unrated version) than most any movie out there, period.I don't know how anyone who is a fan of the Saw series wouldn't like this. I also don't know why most people don't realize the pure intelligence Saw IV has. It is not absurd as some have come to call it, and nothing about it is unbelievable. My father is a cop and I can tell you firsthand he would have done exactly what Rig did, right down to the final door. Those of you who call his actions unbelievable simply do not understand human nature as well as you think. That's your problem, not the movie. I think you should get off your pretentious "I'm intelligent" trip and understand that this is not a cliché movie that is going to play into your dumbed-down idea of human nature, or your simplistic view of morality.10/10</fullReview>

The detective wouldn't of ended up in that situation without the tape from the stomach but the situation means that this has not been found yet.

		<shortDescription>The Best of All The Saw Movies So Far!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw IV is the best of all the Saw movies so far.The best part of Saw IV is that it spends lots of TLC exploring John Kramer, the man. The first Saw movie barely developed John at all. The second and third movies started to develop him a bit more, which was great. But Saw IV goes all out with that and gives him by far the best development yet. It will help you love him all the more by the end of the movie. After seeing all the great stuff John does in this movie, chances are you might wish he was your friend in real-life so you could go out and have a drink with him at the local pub on the weekend.Saw IV solidifies John Kramer and his alter-ego as one of the very best (perhaps even THE very best!) horror villains of all-time. For this reason alone this movie deserves nothing less than 10/10. Try to think of any other horror movie where the villain is *anything* more than a "generic evil entity who randomly murders everything under the Sun". You might be able to think of one or two, but chances are it will be a *very* short list! Not so with Saw IV. Saw IV gives you a legendary character in the making, and by horror movie standards, that is golden.In addition to John Kramer's great development in Saw IV, you get all the usual stuff that fans of the series want: devious traps, vast conspiracies, lots of gruesomeness. Saw IV will meet all your needs in this area too.There is some criticism about Saw IV because nitpickers who watch *every* Saw movie with zeal (not that there is anything wrong with that!) and then expect all the separate movies to fit together *perfectly* will be able to nitpick out some minor plothole details. These nitpickers *are* technically correct with their nitpicks, but the thing about that is they are missing the boat and depriving themselves of the great entertainment at hand from the movie itself. If you don't spend many hours consciously looking for things to nitpick about how *all* the different movies don't fit together *perfectly*, then chances are you are not even gonna notice one single plothole or anything to nitpick. It won't even enter your mind. *Of course* all 4 Saw movies are not gonna fit together perfectly, but that is a trivial issue that should not be blown out of proportion, as it often is by die-hard Saw fans. Note: I'm not dissing die-hard Saw fans, I'm just saying that nothing is perfect and so don't expect it to be else you are only gonna ever get disappointments in life. But compared to most other horror movies out there, Saw IV is *indeed* perfect by comparison.So I say, enjoy Saw IV for what it is - a great movie on it's artistic merits that is head and shoulders above 99% of any other horror movies to have come out in recent years - and an entertaining movie. What more can you ask for. As Jigsaw would say: "Learn to appreciate your life!" Accept the Saw IV movie for it's great value, and don't let your enjoyment get bogged down in trivial nitpicking over minutiae that doesn't really matter at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i think this was the best of all saw movies. even better than the first one. because even we know the story it s still surprising. and it makes u happy in a way slightly psychopathic. i guess it s a sick part of human nature but that s why we like this movie. not only the brains it has but cause we like to see the human flesh naked against the machine. in the first movie until the end we waited for something that we don't know and we thought it wouldn't be something for us. we wouldn't mind. but it was so cleverly designed that it made us feel different. isn't that what we want from a movie. what we pay for. what we live for. to feel something that we will like. i didn't like the second and the third as much as first but the last one was even better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>saw 4 wins me over.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw IV won me over right from the beginning. As i am a die hard fan of the Saw trilogies, i try to find and collect as much information as i possibly can on these films. They are certainly interesting and well thought out. Saw IV showed a more human side to the characters (Especially Jigsaw/John).. It has a twist that's readily unexpected. (of course, thats expected in a Saw film) And it has a lot more interesting traps. It's tons of fun to watch.But i strongly STRONGLY recommend that in seeing this beforehand, you should watch the first three. Even if you've already seen them, watch them again. Its good to have a refresher rather than thinking after watching the movie "What just happened?" 11 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why did I bother?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third sequel in this now formulaic franchise sees a cop with a superhero "save everyone" mentality have his beliefs challenged by someone out there continuing the now deceased Jigsaw's legacy. While police are doing everything they can to catch him, the neo Jigsaw has some murderous fun.Well one thing I can say is that I didn't see the ending coming. I don't know what I was expecting out of the end when the beginning was a pointlessly long autopsy scene followed by the murder of two characters we've never seen before and never will again to remind the audience what this film is, but I guess for some reason I was expecting a smart twist. What I got was a comepletely inane and ridiculous twist that insulted my intelligence.You know a film is bad when we see a flashback within a flashback within a flashback. You know a film's bad when the ending makes the protagonist comepletely irrelevant(you'll see what I mean if you see this)You know a film is bad when a character who is supposed to be intelligent does something so stupid it leaves your mind boggled. You know a film is bad when you're laughing at human depravity.For those looking for gore you'll find plenty of it here, which is probably the only thing I can really recommend. The film had a few interesting ideas but ultimately fails.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>excellent job by Rigg, Hoffman, agent Perez,and Straham.. i personally loved rig's performance, his facial expression was mind blowing thank god no overreaction by him i mean he understood what was going on with him..I'm looking forward to watch him in Saw V...Tobin Bell was great in flashback so was Jill even though they had brief role. John had it to transform loving husband into Jigsaw not as Serial Killer...brief roles by victims were OK. all the the victims did deserve to die. since I'm big fan of gruesome none of the traps bothered me at all..all the traps were winnable...the girl Brenda she was real bitch man just like Amanda...rig saved her and she decided to attack rig..why would you do that if someone comes to rescue you...how stupid was she....it was fast pace film with good twist, traps, storyline, directions, flashback of every person..its obvious no more Det.Eric; we learned his fate...no expectation from him...this film did not let me down i had lots of expectation...some scenes was confused like climax and the wax tape was revealed....each victims did survive there games and rig tried his best to save them...that's good rig didn't same that fat bastard who was a pimp..he did deserve brutal death since he torture a women.....Cecil's character was average, John even explained to him but he did not listen to it...he could've learned his lesson..... Unanswred to our Question: Why did Jigsaw put Det Eric in trap again since he escaped? What was written on the letter was given to Amanda by Hoffman? in opening scenes we see John's autopsy and at climax we see his dead body in same room where Jeff and Agent Straham was locked in..without talking why did Straham shot him.. Rigg,Straham and Fisk was in same warehouse where Jeff was playing his game and was it Rigg and Jeff playing games at same time or what? 95% sure Hoffman is not new jigsaw...his a pawn to jigsaw's new game just like Amanda; john's say's at the end You cannot leave without untested it i think that's how it goes..so I'm dead sure Gordon is the one who's a jigsaw since he passed his test...I think Saw V, Hoffman is playing a game, Agent Perez and Rigg is still alive,so that means his in a trap....Better then last 2 saw...Saw 2,3,4,5 and 6 are one story it just divided into 5 pieces.. if they come with good story and twist they should expand the franchise but they killed off good and strong characters....I'm praying they don't kill rig...his a man, i wanna see him as a jigsaw John Kramer aka Jigsaw is truly mastermind..he proved it that his not the killer..people push themselves to situation where they have to make choice Live or Die..Jigsaw doesn't force his victims to die he just wants them to learn their lessons...some of the victims in the movie do learn and some don't...it depends on us how we react to it Big Applaud to our Daddy Jigsaw and his Real Intention Overrall 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe I need to watch this again. It seemed totally out of sync with time lines. I know the other saw films have adopted this and that's fine, it worked well. But what is the deal with Detective Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) getting the tape in the autopsy room telling him what to do and then ending up in the room at the end of saw 3 with jigsaw's body on the slab. Am I retarded? I sure hope so coz apart from that major plot hole it was a pretty decent movie, although elaborate deaths and gore are starting to substitute for good script writing. But hey, since when did good horror require a good script? Anyway, if anyone who's seen it more than once or paid better attention than me the first time please let me know what the @$!# is going on!?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Play it Again, Saw ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>These "Saw" sequels reproduce quicker and more merciless than a couple of rats! With each next visit to your local video store, there's a new "Saw" movie on the shelves and for some reason you feel the need to blindly purchase them although you know it's going to be a bunch of nonsense. This fourth entry in the series should have been titled "The Legacy of Jigsaw", as John Kramer is undoubtedly dead but his sick and sadistic torture-porn games continue. With each new entry, the character of the Jigsaw Killer also proves to be more intelligent and undefeatable. Here we have a guy with an intellect and general knowledge so immeasurable that he easily could have developed a cure for his own terminal cancer, but instead he wasted his time making the lives of ungrateful people pure hell and subjecting them to complex physical ordeals and puzzles they can't possibly solve. Now he's finally and irreversibly dead ? unless he's strong enough to survive an autopsy ? but the dissection of his corpse results in the discovery of a recorded tape in his intestines. The whole bloody race against time starts over, as the tape reveals that several more people are facing horrible upcoming deaths in Jigsaw's previously prepared traps. SWAT commander Rigg is put to a test challenging his obsession to save people, there appears to be another Jigsaw accomplice at large on the streets (other than the equally deceased Amanda) and the script draws a portrait of John Kramer's ex fiancée and the unborn child they lost together. Like all parts in the Saw franchise directed by Darren Lynn Bousman, number four is an incredibly incoherent miscellany of semi-processed ideas and derivative themes. The writers have one major advantage here: the target audiences for this type of film simply crave for loads of blood and sickening set-pieces, so this provides them with extra space to camouflage inexplicable twists and completely screw up logical thinking patterns. The script is full of holes, far-fetched absurdities and plain stupidities. How could Jigsaw punctually predict his new victims' moves and reactions or even be aware of the sinister facts of police investigators that were charged with the case AFTER his death? The biggest omission is an acceptable explanation regarding the personality and motivation of Jigsaw's new accomplice, but I suppose this was done to lure the fans to cinemas for Saw 5, 6, 7 and God knows how many more sequels. The gore and bloodshed is adequate, I suppose, but it's no longer shocking or involving since none of the characters are likable and/or properly introduced. The nightmarish atmosphere of the original Saw ? written and directed by James Wan ? has entirely vanished and the franchise simply revolves on grotesque yet meaningless human suffering. It's a sad evolution but, admittedly, one that is brought on by the expectancy patterns of nowadays horror fanatics.</fullReview>

More of the same....and it wasn't THAT good the first time through. The entire series has been a decent idea presented in a mediocre way, with poor acting and few believable scenes.

		<shortDescription>Entertaining Saw outing, but it's not for the faint of heart.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw IV is a movie that surpassed my expectations, and managed to be an above average Horror sequel, giving me the thrills I needed for the most part. Saw IV helps itself immensely by giving us a solid background story of Jigsaw and Jill|Russell| and to why John is doing what he's doing. The traps themselves are some of the nastiest I have seen, and to say they are gory is a complete understatement. I'm very hard to be grossed out by, but some of them made my stomach churn. Unlike Saw V, Saw IV does the right thing by giving us a solid hero who is likable, and one we can really feel for, that was very smartly done. I liked the flashbacks to number 3 so it gave us a better understanding of what was going on as well, they were quite chilling to watch. Saw IV was the starting point though unfortunately, to where you could tell the series didn't have much energy left, and it was getting tired. With that being said they did a very decent job, and gave the fans and Horror fans in general an overall good Horror film.Performances. Tobin Bell is as solid and chilling as ever as Jigsaw. As a human being I sympathized with him, I felt his pain. As Jigsaw I was frightened by him, not only because he was a mad man, but one that spoke the truth. Costas Mandylor doesn't have nearly as much to do as he does in number 5, but you can see the potential his character possesses. Scott Patterson is very good, and downright intense as Strahm. Betsy Russell pulls of a sympathetic performance as Jill, and had great chemistry with Bell. Lyriq Bent is very likable as Riggs. His stubbornness made me like him even more, because he always wanted to help everyone. Athena Karkanis is decent as Agenet Perez. Donnie Wahlberg basically just sits there and looks tortured, and does a good job of it.Bottom line. This was much better than Saw IV, even if it was a little tiresome. The traps are fun, there's lot's of good characters, the gore is great, it manages to squeak on by. Recommended for Saw and Horror fans.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More like a whodunit thriller than an horror this one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since John Kramer and his apprentice Amanda are now truly death, the movie is more about who is the new Jigsaw now. Not that this makes the movie bad or anything but it obviously diverse a little from the Saw concept, as best got featured in part I and III.The Saw franchise is never afraid to kill off its main characters, with as a result that each movie remains unpredictable to watch again. New characters get constantly introduced all the time and even those who died in previous Saw movies can return in its sequels, since the movie often use flashbacks, as does this movie. The movie more goes into detail why John Kramer became Jigsaw and more ingenuously as it turns out in the end- "Saw III" and "Saw IV" are two interconnect movies.Perhaps best thing about the entire Saw franchise is that are of the movies are genuinely tense to watch, or at least in some parts of them. Its ingenuous writing also always makes sure that the movie offers plenty of surprises. Even though all of Saw movies are of course more or less the same, each movie is still original and great to watch in his own way. This is the reason why the Saw franchise still has more than anything potential- and is interesting enough to provide plenty of more movies. Part V and VI are already in development and why should they be the last of them? Because all of the Saw movies are so cheap to make and cost so little time to shoot (as of yet this is the most expensive Saw movie with its $10,000,000 budget) and all of the movie continue on making so much money all over the world, it's also likely that many more Saw movies will get made.The games still continue in this movie. The gruesome deathtrap games the Saw franchise is so well known and appreciated for. So even though this movie takes a slightly different approach it still features plenty enough gore and other hard to look at moments. Hard because they are so stomach turning. In other words, there is plenty to enjoy for the Saw fans in this one. The traps are as gruesome and complex as ever. Seriously, how can people come up with this stuff? It's the first Saw movie that didn't got written by Leigh Whannell or any of the other persons involved with the previous 3 Saw movies. Nevertheless, the story feels just as ingenuously written as any of the Saw movies and its done in the same style, with all of the twists and one big main twist at the ending again.It's also shot in the very same fast style as the previous Saw movies, which is no big surprise since this movie got also directed by Darren Lynn Bousman again, who also directed the previous two Saw entries.Still the series feel like it could use some fresh blood again. With a new Jigsaw and different directors at helm for the future Saw projects, it looks like the franchise is going for some fresh new changes to keep the Saw franchise original as well as interesting. I have confidence in it that the future movies can be just as good and original as any of the previous 4 Saw entries.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another unnecessary sequel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rigg (Lyriq Bent)?a policeman whose dedication to helping others has become detrimental to his personal life?will not rest until he can find his abducted colleague Eric Mathews (Donnie Wahlberg). In a bid to teach Rigg that he cannot be responsible for the safety of everyone (and, in certain cases, that he shouldn't even try), an unknown accomplice of the now-very-messy-and-definitely-dead Jigsaw sets the policeman a test: one involving lots of vicious machinery and some unwilling victims.The first Saw movie was a breath of fresh air in a genre that had grown rather dull and predictable: a clever, extremely twisted movie which kept you guessing right to the end. Three sequels later, and that air has become incredibly stale .Saw IV opens with a disgustingly real autopsy scene, in which the body of Jigsaw is opened up and examined in stomach-churning detail; eventually, a tape is discovered in the psycho-killer's stomach, having been ingested before his death. A jaw-dropping way to begin a film (there was a time that gore this yucky would never have been allowed past the censor's scissors), this is unfortunately the only part of the movie that genuinely impresses, with the remainder being nothing more than a rehash of elements from the first three instalments.With die-hard fans of the series all too happy to see 'more of the same', Director Darren Lynn Bousman makes absolutely no attempt to break the (financially successful) mould: as in the previous movies, those unlucky enough to be strapped into one of the killer's contraptions are torn apart, scalped, and generally made to feel very uncomfortable, and the carnage continues until the inevitable 'surprise' ending, when the new accomplice's identity is revealed.The result is an admittedly bloody, but ultimately pointless, unnecessary, tedious, and creatively vacuous exercise in money making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last year,Saw 3 had disappointed me.It was so focused on showing extreme gore that it kinda forgot of the story.Also,it was extremely far away from the excellent first part and from the second part,which was not great and was also far away from the first part,but it was a fun film.Now,Saw 4,without being great,is fun,better than the third part and it finds a correct balance between the gore and the story.First of all,I have to admit that for seeing this movie you have to remember perfectly the three first parts.And that's a fail from Saw 4.The story is very united to the other three films,so there were elements I could not understand and the story is way too complex.With such a complex story,I was very confused on some moments.But,there are good elements on this movie:Saw 4 never bored me and it has a delicious gore(specially,the autopsy scene).Saw 4 is a fun horror movie,a little bit confusing but better than the third part.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The meticulous Jigsaw has finally met his demise, but unfortunately for the police and the FBI the games have only just begun. The plot centers around SWAT team officer Rigg, a dedicated cop and staunch humanitarian who has the misfortune of losing all those close to him, and his attempts to save the lives of his fellow officers when he's drawn into the deceased killer's deadly game. For the most part this fourth addition of the grisly horror series is an exercise in violence and gore?as one would expect?but it's not as unrelentingly mean or deplorable as previous installments. A few interesting twists here and there, but a slasher film nonetheless. **</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw IV is the 6th sequel in the series of Saw series. Sawriously. This time round The Saw man has captured a collection of do-badders and placed them in an abandoned fairground, forcing them to take part in a series of fiendish traps based around fairground rides. This time though certain parts of Saw's past life are tantalisingly revealed; how he was an orphan, sold into a travelling circus troupe where he learned to hone his abilities at tricks and stunts and traps. Growing up was tough as his only friends were freaks who could bend themselves into 10 inch squared boxes, dwarfs, acrobats, giants, and other unsavoury types. Eventually a bearded lady joined the group and they fell in love. Unfortunately just before they were to be wed, doctors informed Saw that he had Cancer due to over exposure to clowns and that he could not be cured. Devasted, his fiancée decided to leave him for the strong man. Saw began to get angry and hate the world. Over time the bearded lady realised she truly loved Saw and told him that she wanted to marry him. He was over-joyed, but that night there was an accident in the circus. Due to contrived series of events, an audience member accidentally knocked into the cannon as it was firing a trapeze artist out. Instead of flying into a net, he flew into the bearded lady, in one side and out the other, leaving her with a giant man shaped hole in her middle. She died in Saw's arms, choking on her blood and beard. Saw began to hate the world, watched people wasting their lives, and wanted to show them true pain whilst giving them a chance at redemption as that chance was beyond his own grasp. Naturally the people he has been selecting in this and the previous films have all been connected to his wife's death in some way.There is a group of about 10 characters here, mostly annoying, and ranging from drug addicted teen to corrupt big wig, from disgraced sportsman, to college dropout. They wake up together chained to dodgem cars. After a few moments of screaming and arguing and working out who each other is, Saw plays a tape with one of his usual riddles. 'I want to play a jest' he says. Each of the cars is rigged with dynamite, the dynamite covered with knives and stabbing weapons. The people must bump into each other as many times as possible within two minutes. Whoever did the least damage in the two minutes remains locked to their seats while the other nine are released. They move on while the loser explodes. The survivors move on to the next group. Over the next two hours we are treated to gore, frights, laughs, and some ingenious set pieces as the group are whittled down to bits. Coincidentally one of the traps involves whittling- the group enters a new room and each find someone hanging from a hook. They have to whittle, or skin their person until only flesh remains. Whoever is last gets chopped up by a giant scythe. We see a trap on board a ghost train, with acid dripping from the ceiling, and bullets flying from the walls; there is a hall of exploding mirrors; a deadly lava filled maze; a terrifying roller-coaster with loops and turns, but no harness; it all ends with the survivors climbing inside cannons to fire themselves out of a window to safety. If they miss they will smash into a brick wall and be trapped forever. If they escape they will be scarred for life with cuts and burns, but will at least be alive.Unfortunately this was the last Saw film until Saw V. It has some of the best moments of the series, but is quite confusing. At times I didn't know who was a baddie, or why anyone would set up such elaborate schemes and I began thinking I was watching Scooby Doo instead. The next film toned down the story and upped the blood content as it is simply 90 minutes of a man in a blender.Best Scene: When they all had to climb up the big slippery slide while blood was poured down onto them. It was funny when one of them slipped down the slide into the grinder at the bottom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw IV starts as Detective Hoffman (Costas Mandylor), SWAT team leader Officer Rigg (Lyriq Bent) &amp; their team find the dead mutilated body of Detective Kerry (Dina Meyer) in one of notorious killer Jigsaw's (Tobin Bell) traps. FBI agents Strahm (Scott Patterson) &amp; Perez (Athena Karkanis) both feel Jigsaw has some sort of accomplice &amp; are determined to find out who it is, meanwhile with Detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) still missing &amp; the bodies continuing to pile up Officer Rigg just can't let it go &amp; somehow feels responsible &amp; helpless. Later that night in his apartment Rigg is knocked out &amp; comes round in his bathroom faced by Jigsaw on his telly as Rigg finds himself part of the horrific games that Jigsaw likes to play. Jigsaw gives Rigg ninety minutes to save both Detectives Matthews &amp; Hoffman who are now both at the mercy of Jigsaw in one of his deadly traps but Jigsaw makes sure it's not easy for Rigg who has lots of difficult decisions to make along the way...Like Saw II (2005) &amp; Saw III (2006) this third sequel to the surprise sleeper smash hit horror thriller Saw (2003) was directed by Darren Lynn Bousman &amp; I have to say that at this point I am still enjoying the Saw franchise. While maybe not quite as good as Saw II or definitely not as good as the rather excellent Saw III one has to say that I enjoyed Saw IV, it moves along like a rocket, there's a few decent twist's &amp; turns although if you have seen the previous Saw films they will perhaps seem a little familiar but they are still good twist's. Now, I think the main problems with Saw IV are that it tries to shoehorn too many bit part character's from the previous three films into the script, there were a few times when I was confused about who was who &amp; what connection they had to the series if any. While Saw IV works as a stand alone film for the majority of it's 90 odd minute duration it's definitely an advantage if you have seen the other films prior to watching this &amp; then there's the ending which I liked but it could have been scripted a little better so it was a bit clearer about what had actually happened &amp; this is the one aspect of the film that pretty much relies on you having seen at least Saw III. Basically the twist is that the film is actually a flashback after the gruesome opening autopsy which makes the audience think they are watching a straight chronological sequel to Saw III when in fact you are not, the events of Saw III &amp; Saw IV take place simultaneously in a rather neat &amp; clever twist that a lot of viewers (judging by the IMDb message board for Saw IV &amp; a few of the User Comments I have read) don't seem to understand, get or even comprehend which is partly down to the filmmakers as I have already said since the ending is a bit abrupt, a little underwritten &amp; relies on the audience having seen (&amp; remembering) Saw III. Overall though I liked Saw IV, the character's are good with yet more back-story for the character's especially Jigsaw &amp; the relationship between him &amp; his ex-wife, the plot is pretty clever &amp; it does all come together nicely at the end without any apparent plot holes &amp; there's some more crackingly gory set-pieces that I personally just can't get enough of.Well one has to say if your looking for some blood, sadism &amp; gore then you could do a lot worse than Saw IV, it starts off with an extremely graphic autopsy sequence the likes of which I have never seen in a major film before. I was amazed at how nasty the autopsy scene is, from the skin on Jigsaw's scalp being pulled back over his face to the top of his skull being sawed off &amp; his brain removed to his chest being sliced open, his ribcage opened up &amp; his stomach removed. It's actually pretty gruelling stuff &amp; if your easily squeamish you may want to give Saw IV a miss. Other gore highlights include mutilated rat infested bodies, a woman having her scalp torn off, a guy getting his eyeball pierced, some guy's head being crushed between two huge blocks, two people are skewered with metal spikes with predictably bloody results &amp; a scene which even made me wince a little when a guy has to free himself from a trap by pushing his face through two columns of razor sharp knives therefore slicing his face to bits. If that wasn't enough the poor guy then falls into a cage full of barb wire! Ouch. Having said that I don't think this is quite as gory or brutal as Saw III though. Apparently Saw IV was given the green-light before Saw III was even made or released as both were commissioned at the same time shortly after Saw II opened to huge box-office business.With a supposed budget of about $10,000,000 &amp; apparently shot in just 32 days in Ontario in Canada Saw IV took over $31,000,000 during it's opening weekend at the box-office, the production values &amp; special effects are slick &amp; I particularly liked some of the neat editing transitions between scenes. The acting is fine if nothing spectacular, quite a few of the cast return from previous instalments.Saw IV is another great entry in a pretty good horror franchise which I suppose you will either love it's twist's &amp; scenes of brutal torture &amp; gore or simply hate it as sick pointless rubbish, in my opinion I'd vote for the former any day of the week. Being such a big financial hit Saw V (2008) was guaranteed while yet another sequel Saw VI (2009) is in production.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the "Saw" series because the "Scary Movie 3" DVD notes say that it was based on the "Saw" series. Otherwise I wouldn't have gone beyond the first one. I am not commenting on the series because I endorse all that the viewers who hated this had to say.But dear Americans, please be warned! The writers, directors and producers who did this series are obviously mentally sick and need to be in an asylum. No healthy person will be able to imagine these vicious, cruel, inhuman, disgusting, gruesome, murderous devices and methods of torturing people. -Spoiler Here- Or the sickening scenes where people are forced to cut their own legs, delve into their own eyes in search for a key etc. ... -Spoiler Ends- Since they are sick they need help...may be this is a way of crying out for help and the Americans citizens need to put them in an asylum (they might protest...but it will be for their own good and they will thank you for it when they are healed) On the other hand, their neighbors.....have you ever thought whether they have had fantasies of torturing you and your loved ones? How safe are you and your loved ones in the same neighborhood?Tip to the law enforcement officers- If you were to search the room of a murder suspect and you found sketches of people being tortured, wouldn't you intensify your search? So please see whether these guys have a connection to any unresolved murder cases. If they could imagine such horrendous scenarios and were bold enough to film them too, how can you assume that they wouldn't have done a small scene in real life too? I would say they are prime suspects in unresolved gruesome killings.The bottom line is that this is not about movies at all....this is about a few sick people in the USA and the need to cure them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SAW IV {Unrated Version} (Darren Lynn Bousman, 2007) *1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Darren Lynn Bousman must be doing something right to be handed the reins of three successive entries in the SAW franchise; for the life of me, however, I can&#x2019;t figure out what the damn thing is because it seems to me that the series is getting progressively worse with each new sequel. The fourth film, therefore, is the worst of the lot &#x2013; not because it is the goriest (which I don&#x2019;t think it is, curiously enough) but because it doesn&#x2019;t make a lick of sense &#x2013; at all! The film-makes clearly assume that whoever ventures into this one is already familiar with the earlier movies but, frankly, I lost the plot completely a couple of times while trying to remember who every newly-introduced character is (or was supposed to be in the prequels).As far as I know, the character of Jigsaw (finally) expired in SAW III (2006) but he is all over the place in this one, too! &#x2013; both under his real, normal identity (in a series of flashbacks depicting the miscarriage of his child, etc.) and in any number of his silly costumed video messages from beyond the grave (or whatever). I don&#x2019;t really need to go into all the gory details of the various torture sequences seen throughout but the dismemberment of the sadistic fat slob is perhaps the (comic) highlight; still, Jigsaw&#x2019;s schemes are always so incredibly tortuous that, more than anything else, they make him seem like an elderly, human and more successful version of Wile E. Coyote!! Angel of vengeance-cum-serial killer, my eye&#x2026;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No one but a pervert could enjoy this flick. I bought it cheap on DVD and thought what harm in a Saturday night's home watch.Believe me, the gore of this is only for sick sick and sicker minds. In fact, if the government finds child porn offense enough to suspect one who has it may be a pervert, why not suspect someone who is a fan of this sick and degenerate material is not also a threat.No, I threw it out and did not watch it through. Now I know SAW fans are masochistic perverts.Will I descend again into such degenerate entertainment? I indeed hope not, and I would never have a friend who enjoyed this sort of perversion.It says, our society is sick and growing sicker !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SAW IV (2007) * Tobin Bell, Costas Mandylor, Scott Peterson, Betsy Russell, Lyriq Bent, Athena Karkanis, Justin Louis, Donnie Wahlberg, Angus Macfadyen, Shawnee Smith, Bahar Soomekh, Dina Meyer. Anemic continuation of the graphic serial killer franchise this time with Bell's reprised Jigsaw playing mind-trick life-or-death games from beyond the grave with truly tedious results. Filmmaker Darren Lynn Bousman, who lensed "III", trowels on the gore factor by the buckets but overcompensates with his seizure-inducing camera-work and editing that only causes a migraine. Although there's an opening for another chapter hopefully it won't happen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film, but the Saw films are starting to get old and need a break</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing Saw III in the theater last year, I was interested on how they would continue the story since the end of the third Saw, they killed the jigsaw killer. So I saw it last night with my friend and afterwards I felt like this was just an average thriller with the ultimate gore. Now, don't get me wrong, I love a good gory film, but it seems lately like that's all that Saw now has to offer. Just a good gross out gag, so it's just getting old. While the story worked pretty well, there were still some things that were a bit confusing to me. Some of the film either moved too fast or moved too slow. For the most part I think I got most of the film, just the story could have been edited better I think. But I believe that if you are a fan of the Saw films, you will not be disappointed with this story.Now that John is dead, the detectives are trying to figure out how the jigsaw murders are still happening. Officer Rigg in particular is still looking for his fellow policeman, Eddie. His obsession with saving him gets him into more trouble than it's worth when he is picked to save Eddie's life who is hanging over a block of ice with a chain around his neck. Rigg has 90 minutes to find them and save them. We also take a deeper look into the world of John, the jigsaw killer, we find out why he became the jigsaw killer and who he was before he became so and who he's recruited to carry on his work.Saw IV will not disappoint you on the gore or scary moments, story wise, I think they over all carried it pretty well. I think the way the film was made though makes it a little much for your head to handle. Either that or I think that these films just need a slight break; I was telling my friend how funny it will be when our future kids will say to us "I'm going to see Saw 28 with my friends", and feeling so old just because we've already been through now four of them. Anyways, for the Saw fans, it's a film worth watching, but if you're just looking for a movie to watch, I don't know if you'll get into it.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SAW 4, I'll be back for more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I attended an advance screening of Saw 4 in Melbourne, Australia.To get an idea of what I think of these movies, although I was able to score a free pass as a fan of the series was likely to be a paying customer.I will go into some major spoilers later on and I will clearly identify when for now I will write what I deem as minor spoilers. After an initial autopsy scene with some moments to make some people turn their heads, the movie actually holds back on the gore compared to Pt 3. Nothing prolonged like the brain surgery or bone twisting device. The autopsy scene (which reminded me of Re-Animator) reveals a Jigsaw audio tape which kicks off the movie and another "game". From memory virtually all traps involved more than one person. There were a few traps with two victims stuck in the one predicament. One trap had two victims chained to each other. One of the victims had his eyes stitched shut and the other had his mouth stitched shut. Another had 2 victims back to back with arrows through both of them. Other traps had one victim and another who was a spectator who could choose to be passive or active (similar to Pt 3). This was to "SEE HOW I SEE", "FEEL HOW I FEEL", "SAVE AS I SAVE" etc as written in red paint on the walls of the traps.It involved another race against time scenario for the main "game" in the movie. We get to see further back story on Jigsaw. This is prior to him suffering cancer or his car crash. We see his first workshop, first trap after an incident which pushes him over the edge. We see his first version of the pig mask. These scenes had potential but weren't as satisfying for me as they could've been.His ex wife is interrogated during the film, is she innocent or guilty of assisting Jigsaw? Darren Bousman's direction was as expected. The acting in the movie was between wooden to mediocre to pedestrian. The gore FX were decent but the editing was sloppy. The sound in the cinema I attended was shocking so I couldn't assess that aspect. By the end of the movie a fresh character says the infamous line "GAME OVER". Once everything is revealed it makes you think of plot holes. Overall I enjoyed this movie on about a par with Pt 3. To give you an idea I have rated these movies a little less with each release. It was enough to keep me interested for Pt 5. If you have questions, ask in the message boards and I'll try to answer. Here are some major SPOILERS SPOILERS Spoilers......- The movie takes place in main prior to the end of Pt 3 ### Eric Matthews is still alive and is a victim of a game ### The Jigsaw autopsy scene at the start of the movie is actually the conclusion of the movie ### No Doctor Lawrence Gordon in Pt 4 ### We learn no back story to the new person who seems as though they are taking over Jigsaw's work.</fullReview>

This movie would have been better if this was the only puzzle. Congratulations you have completely ruined the Saw saga, if you make another one of these damn movies im gonna put your balls in a bear trap. Well IMDb isn't letting me post without putting 10 lines of text so i guess I'll talk about how Saw 1 - 3 was awesome and this movie blew my shorts off, its like the writer was writing this movie during a week long coke bender in the back of a garbage truck making routes through afghanistan. Honestly I would rather be put in one of Jigsaw's death traps then see this dogshit again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pulp Serial</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's just call it what it is. The SAW series has become a comic book serial. Each movie adds new twists to lengthen, but not necessarily deepen, the overall story. This time out, they left me hanging (pardon the pun) so to speak. The intersecting timelines that were so surprising the first time around were more confusing than shocking. Also the motivations of Jigsaw were much less righteous, if that term can be applied, than in previous games. I half expect Saw V to put a person through a test because he didn't help Little Johnny with his homework and instead watched The World Series of Poker. As far as traps go, this was the least cringe-worthy of the bunch, even if they were brutal and inventive. More important than that was the back story, which finally built the John Kramer character from the ground up and put us in his creepy head (both literally and figuratively). By the time you've survived the latest game, you'll be left wondering if there is an end game or if all the cards have been played. I think the serial nature of these movies is fresh, but the latest installment, stretches the premise about as far as it can go. It's a miracle it doesn't snap and fall in on itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was another great movie I loved Saw IV it was perfect. I haven't seen a great horror film in a long time and this movie did it for me. It was a very disturbing movie but thats what Saw is suppose to be. I felt the film-making was incredible with this film, the editing was masterful and the effects were ingenious. I thought this film was close if not better than saw three. It definitely was much better than Halloween....i feel this film will go down as a great horror classic...i will definitely be first to buy this film when it comes out on DVD I may even go see it again thats how great i feel this film is...wonderful job on the film i am very pleased.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw 4 (2007) * (out of 4) Jigsaw is dead but his deadly game is passed onto a cop who has 90-minutes to save two fellow officers but to do so he must go through various deadly traps. Okay, perhaps I'm a dumbass but this film didn't make a bit of sense. It seems they were really pushing things to bring Jigsaw back but I'm not sure because I don't have the slightest idea what was going on. I think this film was meant to be going on at the same time as the events in Saw 3 but I'm not certain and I'm not going to think about it any more since the screenwriters didn't bother to think it out. I don't mind the film not making any sense but the real torture in the film is on the viewer for having to sit through it. This is clearly the worst in the series as the story has run out of fresh ideas and even the torture scenes don't carry any weight. The entire cast is forgettable and I didn't give a damn for a single one of them, which isn't good when we're suppose to be going through this stuff with them. The direction is pretty bad throughout and the editing is even worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Same Ol' Saw = Uninspired</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just got back from the midnight showing of Saw IV.And what can I say? Confusing. Very confusing. Moreso than the other Saw movies.This one did keep you interested to see the motives and back story of characters, but there were so many side-plots and flashbacks it became too hard to figure it out or care.There was a good amount of gore, but to me, the traps felt uninspired. It wasn't as gut-wrenching or hard to watch as the previous three movies. In them you really wanted to see people succeed or push through the terrible situation they were in. In this movie it was just kind of "here's a trap, here's a death, let's move on." The ending was how all Saw endings are. The side games get pulled into one game that fits with a nice bow, but still confuses the heck out of you for what's going to happen next. Definitely prepared me for Saw V.Problem of that is that it felt like more questions rose than were answered in this movie which kind of upset me because then it just felt like I was watching two hours of filler just to move the plot from III to V.But it's Saw, so I can't complain. Still like the series, and I will watch IV again because I want to see if I can figure out more of the clues, but overall, I prefer I and III more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most confusing out of the 4</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a good movie but very confusing. One of the strange scenes was when the FBI agents were in the room investigating the crime scene, and for some reason a trap goes off and an ARROW shoots through a co workers face. So, the two main FBI guys just look at each other and go about their business as if nothing happened. That was not right. Also, the main FBI guy was a big time jerk to Jigsaw's wife. The Donny Whalberg character was not really all that great in this one either. However, the grossest part was in the beginning during the autopsy scene of Jigsaw. Now, I am not a hardcore Saw fan, but this was gross. What was ALSO gross was how I was not able to figure anything out. The end did NOT make sense to me. You obviously have to re-watch the prequels before attempting to understand the fourth installment of SAW!!</fullReview>

I wont spoil anything for you but what i can tell you is that you can expect some new traps, rather gruesome in my opinion.The traps were the only thing that really kept me watching, that and the story which kept you interested, until you get to the end and you think to yourself, "What the hell?".Overall, by all means check the movie out, its worth the watch, however i feel i probably need to view it again because i feel i have missed something.

		<shortDescription>Extreme violence doesn't make up for lack of everything else.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw IV was a pretty entertaining movie. It was dumb, and very violent, and had a bunch of twists and turns leading to nothing. Again somehow this was entertaining.This Saw outing has my favorite of the openings, with more blood and guts than any of the other Saw films. Then the movie, like the other ones, introduces a few characters, has a lot of gruesome deaths and an ending that may or may not surprise. The acting in this was really terrible. And not only was the acting terrible, but to make matters worse the dialog was extremely stiffly written. Some of the terrible lines comes from people figuring out clues through nothing (Four Walls Makes a Room). It actually made me cringe listening to some of the stupid dialog. The direction, like the other 3 films, grows tiresome after the first 30 minutes, but if you've seen any of the other movies you know what to expect This was a dumb movie with no point, but I was entertained by the stupid violence and the hard to predict, but nonetheless tired plot. My rating: ** out of ****. 84 mins. R for strong violence and language.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>rating will slowly go down and this movie will settle where it belongs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll be the first to admit, I wanted to hate this movie, but they made it SO easy for me. People criticized the last few installments (especially the third one) as showing their true colors as rush jobs, and while I welcome criticism of the Saw franchise because its just WAY to much of a good thing, I didn't think the later installments were as amateur as others said, although I hated the third one for other reasons. However, this one really deserves the label of hack job, and DO NOT let people fool you into thinking otherwise by saying how complex the movie/twist is. Granted, you'll have to sit there at the end and piece things together for a few minutes, but that doesn't mean the movie is good or even clever. The main twist (who the new jigsaw is) isn't even explained very well; its just there. And unlike Saw I, the characters in this movie react as unrealistically as...well, as characters in a bad horror movie. Any thoughtful provocation about Jigsaw's message are completely abandoned here; there is practically no reason for the events in the movie to occur and no payoff for these characters, regardless of what choices they make. Jigsaw's "lessons" are becoming so thin that he seems to be picking relatively innocent people and deciding that they need enlightening, just so he can put all his puppets and small tape recordings to use. I think that the best thing the Saw creators could have done is wrap up the series with one victim FINALLY outwitting Jigsaw, maybe even voluntarily being drawn into a game just to reveal for the twist ending that they've been stringing Jigsaw along the whole time. The reason I've grown tired of the series is mainly that it just got more and more unrealistic, with Jigsaw apparently becoming clairvoyant in his ability to predict what people will do. That's why I'm glad to see the series end on a sour note and as time goes on, people will recognize the steady decline in talent linking one Saw movie to the next.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, just came back from seeing Saw IV. It's pretty much just the same as all the others (with the 1st Saw as an exception since that was something new). Though there were a lot of unanswered stuff from Saw III, but i felt that they really should have ended with that one. Number IV is somewhat to me... forced into the series just to make money. Basically, if you have seen it, you'll realize it's pretty obvious that there's going to be Saw V because FEW NEW CHARACTERS have been now "forcibly" been added into the storyline to be involved with Jigsaw's intelligent life lesson games. Whenever new characters are introduced into this movie U WILL know that there's gonna be a sequel because there's obviously gotta be someone continuing the legacy of Jigsaw. Overall, I rate Saw IV only 5 stars because the storyline is somewhat forced to blend into the others. I know they are trying to fill in the loopholes from the previous SAW's, but this is just too much because it makes you feel the series will go on forever and ever and ever. Like seriously... What happens to Dr Gordon from the 1st one? Maybe he'll be back someday in SAW VIII to carry out some life lessons like JigSaw? Haha.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very disappointed... they should have stopped on SAW III</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw III was fascinating... goring, but with bright ideas to develop Jigsaw history. It had its goofs, but it had good characters too. So, that's the main reason SAW IV is so disappointed. It starts with a bloody and strong scene of Jigsaw's autopsies... and guess what! He swelled a tape recorder! At this point I thought: all right, it is exaggerated, but somehow possible...During the film, another unbelievable (or at least improbable) facts goes on, mainly the traps that work as if Jigsaw could predict everyones reacts... even six months after he is dead. Of course, there are good isolated scene, but it is too little for a series intense like SAW. To tell you the truth, the thing that most annoyed me in the 3 past films (besides the fact that Jigsaw seemed the strongest character in the screen, even when he was about to die in the hospital) is how he could manage to build, to assemble and to hide all his traps? To be honest, in this film they dare try to explain it (thumbs up!), but I guess they could have emphasized the idea. Well, if you like the series, go see it. I will see SAW 5 next year too. But I bet you too will leave the theater with the sensation that the should have stopped on the 3.</fullReview>
