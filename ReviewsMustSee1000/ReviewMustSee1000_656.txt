		<shortDescription>The King Who Talked To The Trees - And Claimed They Talked Back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>He was our last King, and the one we are raised to hate the memory of. And he was actually a hard working monarch, wrong headed at times, who had the longest reign (for any monarch - until Queen Victoria) in English history. He was George III (reigned 1760 - 1820 - the last nine years incapacitated by insanity and blindness). It was while he was ruling Great Britain that the American Revolution occurred, the French Revolution occurred, Napoleon rose and fell, and the industrial revolution hit Western Europe and the Americas. His is a key reign of modern history.We are taught he was a tyrant. Actually he was a conscientious supporter of the British Constitution, but he believed the colonists were disobedient children who should have been punished for their own good. Once it was obvious that they had won on the battlefield, George offered to abdicate. He was talked out of it, and eventually faced up to accepting the papers of the new Minister from the United States, Mr. John Adams. But he never really fully accepted it, and in his last decade the two countries fought a second war (the War of 1812).George III was a good, but strict family man. He and his wife Charlotte had seven sons and six daughters. But his sons were disappointments (the best one, Frederick, Duke of York, was a second-rate army commander who got involved in a scandal when his mistress, Mrs. Clarke, sold army commissions "in the name of the Duke of York" to undeserving men). The German Georges had a tradition of hatred between the Kings and their sons and heirs. George I was hated by George II because the former had imprisoned his wife (George II's mother) for life for infidelity (see SARABAND FOR DEAD LOVERS). George II was hated by his son, Frederick, Prince of Wales, and kicked the son out of the royal palace. Frederick died prematurely in 1758, so his son George III succeeded in 1760. His son, known as Florizel or "Prinny", had a long standing relationship with Mrs. Fitzherbert, a popular actress who happened to be Catholic. It was actually known by King George III that Prinny had an illegal marriage with Mrs. Fitzherbert. As head of the Church of England, George III resented this act. He also disliked Prinny's support of Whig politicians Charles James Fox and Richard Sheridan (and sometimes Edmund Burke). The King was a good Tory - he never realized that Prinny's politics were a way of annoying him, and Prinny was even more reactionary than the King was. Prinny's gambling and drinking debts also annoyed the King.George was able to support the wise government (to 1789 anyway) of William Pitt the Younger. So supportive was he, that Pitt would reciprocate. For one day, in 1788, King George got out of his carriage in a forest, walked over to a tree, and had a long conversation with it. The tree, you see, was not a tree, but actually the now dead King Frederick the Great of Prussia. George III was showing signs of dementia. He was the first really certifiable monarch since Henry VI back in the 15th Century. George's son Prinny was ready to back a bill to remove his father and lock him away. Pitt saw Fox ready to replace him, and fought a long delaying action on the Regency bill. It worked, as Dr. Wills managed to bring the dementia under control.It would only be in 1811, when Pitt was dead for five years (and Fox for four) that a Tory Government passed a Regency bill, but by then Prinny was openly anti-Whig. It was politically allowable for the Percival Ministry to chance Prinny as Regent by then. After George III died he would become George IV and reign until 1830.This film has followed the tragic illness that incapacity (and eventually) destroyed George III, but only to the conclusion of it's first appearance in 1789. Nigel Hawthorne had performed the role to international acclaim on stage. He repeats it here, showing a thoughtful monarch (witness why he is upset about the errant colonies gaining independence - the valuable natural resources are lost, and he is aware of this). He is puritanical when normal, but with a son like Prinny who could blame him for being sorely disappointed. From the start you find yourself rooting for Hawthorne's monarch, who was not the evil tyrant that Thomas Paine and Thomas Jefferson painted.Rupert Everett shows the callousness of the Prince of Wales, who is so selfish that at one point (when safely alone) Pitt and Fox wonder if their American cousins were right about abolishing the monarchy. Ian Holm, as Dr. Wills, is properly a mixture of early pioneer of psychology and tyrant. A wonderful film of how a national crisis was met and overcome peacefully. And timely too. Within weeks of the recovery of George III in 1789 the Bastille fell in Paris.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great performance from Nigel Hawthorne makes this movie very enjoyable. His portrayal of the 'Mad King' is in turns entertaining, poignant, sharp, and commanding. The rest of the cast back him up well. The conversion from stage play to screen works well here... the production design is excellent, and the direction is dynamic enough to ensure that the movie never drags. Best of all though is Alan Bennett's script which is full of wonderfully comic and intelligent soundbites. This is a sumptuous period drama which is never too intense, but at the same time never too pithy, and it makes for very pleasant viewing. The film never takes itself too seriously or gets bogged down - after all, what other 18th century costume drama can boast such lengthy discourse regarding the constitution of a British monarch's fetid stools?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great fun story full of colourful characters and performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Already upset by the loss of America to independence, King George III of England's position is made more difficult by the onset of an illness that causes him to act wildly and babble uncontrollably. While the Prime Minister places him in the hands of Dr Willis to keep him in power, The Prince of Wales and the leader of the opposition both plan to replace the king with the prince by way of a parliamentary bill.Based on the great little play that is historically based, this film went down very well with the awards season since it is very English and well acted. The plot is well written, I'm not sure if it is totally accurate but it is surely based on facts even if it has been coloured for artistic and entertainment reasons. The film embraces both the internal workings of the royal family and the politics of parliament really well; again, it may not be totally true but it is colourful, dissenting and enjoyably. The film is involving but yet still manages to be enjoyable and funny. It is a great story and it is lavishly brought to the big screen in this great production.The sets and costumes are really good and establish the period and setting of the story very well, but it is the performances that really make it work. Hawthorne is wonderfully cast and delivers a great performance in the lead - both as the cruel monarch or the madman. He is totally believable all the way and never lets his performance become comical or silly even when it is amusing in delivery. Mirren and Donohoe both have less to do but make impacts in their scenes. Everett, Holm, Wadham and Graves support the film to great effect, their performances are colourful, impacting and very enjoyable.Overall, historical films will quite often be viewed as lifeless, dull and overlong. Here this film goes against all those old clichés and is lively, colourful and enjoyable. The rich sets and costumes add value to some great performances in an engaging story that is very enjoyable.</fullReview>

The scene where the two of them meet for the first time is one of my favourites of all I have ever seen &amp; always moves me.The film never takes itself too seriously, and the cast is a veritable who's who of great British actors that Hollywood largely ignored.

		<fullReview>THE MADNESS OF GEORGE III (called MADNESS OF KING GEORGE in the States because of reported studio concern, probably not apocryphal, that most Americans would wonder why they missed MADNESS I and II) begins with an act of lese majesty, a look behind the scenes as the family and ministers of George III prepare for the ceremony to open Parliament in 1788. We see the confusion of an equerry who has no idea of what his duties are, a royal attendant hurriedly spit on and cuff-polish a jewel on the kingly crown, the boredom of the king's eldest sons who would rather be just about anywhere else than waiting for their father in the chilly anteroom. ("Colder in here than a greyhound's nostril," mutters the Lord Chancellor.) It's a theme that will carry through the entire film. Kingship and royalty are shams, it seems - magic acts that require faith on the part of the audience. A peek behind the curtain of noblesse oblige and it's all likely to fall to pieces.The story remains fairly true to the facts. Late in 1788, George III is taken by a mysterious illness (lately surmised to be porphyria) that strongly resembles the then-popular conception of madness. Chaos ensues, mainly in the desperate efforts of the Government (headed by William Pitt - Julian Wadham) to hush the whole matter up lest the forces of the Whig Opposition (led by Charles James Fox - Jim Carter) use the power vacuum to place the king's eldest son, the Prince of Wales, at the head of a regency sympathetic to their political cause. But Alan Bennett, who originally wrote the script for the theatre, is wise enough to treat the potentially tragic story as essentially comic even while raising the question of the basic insanity behind all pretensions to royalty. ("Some of my lunatics fancy themselves kings," notes the "mad doctor" who undertakes the case. "But he IS the king. Where shall his fancy take refuge?")The power of the film radiates from neither history nor comedy but from performances, and Nigel Hawthorne, who sharpened his characterization of George III over months of playing it on stage, dominates a roster of top-notch actors. Whether brow-beating his older children with admonitions of "Do not be fat, Sir! Fight it! Fight it!" or, freed from his self-imposed strictures of kingship by illness, slipping the reins and pawing under the stays of Lady Pembroke (Amanda Donahoe), Hawthorne is both maddeningly and appealingly autocratic. Perhaps his Farmer George, England's prime example of husbandry both in his knowledge of horticulture and in his brood of 15 children, is more sympathetic than the historical personage, but in the end that matters little. It's a superbly nuanced performance.And he's given able support by Helen Mirren as his faithful Queen Charlotte, who's devoted her life to supporting the man who rescued her from the obscurity of a small Germanic kingdom and married her despite her rather spectacular lack of good looks. Mirren's accent is variable; her etching of Charlotte's desperate groping at every straw in order to see her husband cured is not.The rest of the cast is impeccable as well. Ian Holm is all steely religious conviction turned to medical practice as Dr. Willis, who undertakes to treat the king. Rupert Everett, despite the double handicap of an obviously false stomach and the silliest wig in the film, does a creditable turn as the Prince of Wales, though the script treats Prinny unfairly, mainly for the comic potential of doing so. Ministers of state and Parliamentarians Wadham, Carter and John Wood handle their lines with a panache and wit that would do credit to any authentic 18th-century gentleman. Some of the best lines go to Wood, who as usual gives his unsurpassable style and timing, as when he growls out in church, "I'm praying, goddammit!"The costumes are both faithful and sumptuous, the cinematography is luminous and the sets, borrowed at low cost from various castles and colleges, are lovingly handled. Of special note is the music of Handel, adapted so cleverly by George Fenton that one would swear the old boy in the knee breeches wrote the score himself for every scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Singular outstanding acting job in a most complex role</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm writing these comments about "The Madness of King George" because of the singular outstanding performance by Nigel Hawthorne. This is one of the most versatile roles in films in decades. It surely ranks among the very best of all time. As King George, Hawthorne covers a range of emotions, personalities and temperaments not often found in film roles. His character is a study in transition from the serious to the serene to the silly. It's a role of drama, of hilarity, of ego and stuffiness, of pathos, of sorrow and regret, and of gentleness and kindness. What an exceptional acting job.Most often I watch a movie for the whole experience, taking in the plot, characters, acting, scenes and scenery, location, action, intrigue, comedy, tragedy, as a blend of the whole product. All of these weigh in and affect how much I enjoy the film. But half way through this film, I became aware that I was more engrossed in the lead character himself, and the great diversity and excellence of acting on display. Others have commented that Hawthorne should have won the Best Actor Academy Award for his role in 1994. While I like Tom Hanks as an actor, I agree that his role in Forrest Gump wasn't anything exceptional. Certainly not on the order of "Mr. King" in "The Madness of King George." Indeed, Hawthorne must have had to work on his role -- even as a consummate actor, if not for the variations of mood and portrayals, at least for the vast amount of lines he had to speak in the film. By comparison, the Forrest Gump role had a very small amount of lines, and those were far less taxing to an actor. Hanks' was a role that seemed more fun and easygoing than a challenge or demand. I'm not one to complain about Hollywood (except for the low quality and volume of attempts at humor in the past 20 years), but once in a while I think that many others who make the same observation are right on. Hollywood flops big time in its Oscar choice of an actor, actress or film once in a while. It seems to me that the California-based Academy at times doesn't look as objectively and honestly at films produced outside the U.S. Nothing else produced in 1994 even came close to the outstanding acting by Hawthorne in this first rate film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nigel Hawthorne's Crowning Achievement.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The late Nigel Hawthorne received his only Oscar nomination for his outstanding role of King George III of England who developed a mental disorder that created chaos for the the nation's leader in the 1700s. His wife (Helen Mirren in an Oscar-nominated role) cannot cope and it turns out that no one can really help the king as the medical profession just lacked the modernism necessary to assist. Ian Holm is a genuine scene-stealer as the physician who uses some unorthodox methods to try and cure the titled character. Nigel Hawthorne, who sadly passed away recently, was one of the truly great actors of his time and this was his finest role. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A darkly film, not quite your Three Musketeers "history" piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I positively loved Hawthorne in this movie, thanks to him King's madness is quite palpable, emotional rather then clinical. Ian Holm charms as always - this time as a rather driven/bordering on sadism "doctor", whose elaborate system of punishment was impressed on King George by sadistic and yet so well meaning party of the King. Nice thing about this movie is the absense of the clear-cut villains - even the Prince ain't that bad. It's rather a story of one's power slipping away from everywhere but the very surface, a fable of the King in no more than the name, driven to the edge of misery by intrusive politicians and abusive doctors. As such it has it's depressing moments - don't expect a Hollywoodish romp of the Iron Mask or Musketeers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It's 4 O'clock! Six hours of sleep is enough for a man, seven for a woman, and eight for a fool." &lt;George III to his attendants&gt;</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>According to the history books, George III of England went hopelessly mad by 1811. This film, which appears largely historical to this non-Brit, begins in 1788, and King George (Nigel Hawthorne) is still indignant over losing the "colonies", now known as The United States. He has already begun to display unbalanced behavior, and his oldest son, Prince of Wales (Rupert Everett)is plotting, along with his cronies, to have a bill passed which makes him Regent, basically acting as king without being king.The tagline at the end of the film asserts that George III was suffering from a particular illness, as evidenced by references to blue urine in the script. In the film, a doctor who has established some reknown as a healer of "mad" people is retained, and forceably takes the King to his compound. There, every time the King acts unseemly, he is bound to a chair and gagged. Eventually, right before the bill is to be passed, he returns to his subjects, and exhibits normal behavior. He begins adding "what-what" to the end of his sentences, as he had done before he became incapacitated. I wonder if that is where it came from for the movie, "Chicken Run?"A very good movie, done in good style with appropriate humor. Nigel Hawthorne and Rupert Everett are both great in their roles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful, entertaining Britflick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've recently revisited the third Blackadder series. Nigel Hawthorne doesn't play his George III quite as spoony as that of the Curtis/Elton BBC series who wants his son to marry a pot plant, but it's close.The film works because of three things. First - always first - is Alan Bennett's screenplay which is succinct and hilariously funny. It is also unbearably sad at choice moments. The actors - the second success story of the project - throw themselves at the pathos as furiously as at the comedy. There's camp and potty humour (literally) juxtaposed with the bare quoting of King Lear and it all works.Thirdly, there is an attention to the detail which goes beyond costume and design. Hytner has got his cast to play out humans inside 18th century character roles - there's no false reverence or mannered acting.Nigel Hawthorne is brilliant, playing out a human despite the vastly inflated ego he has to inhabit either side of sanity. All others aspire to this lead, with only Ian Holm (naturally, as his temporarily domineering doctor) matching it. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>George III: a decent man who suffered from bad timing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A superlative drama. By now, most sophisticated movie-goers are aware that King George III's sickness might very well have been a result of porphyria, a hereditary disease that some doctors have traced back to Mary, Queen of Scots (i.e., George III's great-great-great-great-great grandmother). Whatever the cause, Nigel Hawthorne gives the performance of a lifetime as the tortured king. The conflict between George III and his heir, the Prince of Wales (the eventual King George IV), is brutally and unapologetically portrayed: the director does not spare us in his vivid reenactment of the combative and sour relationship that actually existed between the two men. As an American, one might suspect I'd be unsympathetic to the British monarch who presided over England's attempt to brutalize its colonies -- but George III's almost-wistful resentment of his errant "colonists" generates some sympathy for the man himself - a sympathy which is unexpectedly intensified by Hawthorne's sudden descent into incoherence, his dim, yet aching realization of what he has become, and his eventual recovery. George III was haunted by demons not of his own making; and no human being deserves the fate to which his disease, if such it was, eventually condemned him. "The Madness of King George" enlightened, entertained,and provoked: what more could one ask of a film?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceptionally well-made and exceptionally incomplete</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an exquisitely made film about a sad figure in British history, King George III, who spent much of his reign locked away in a private mental institution. Now, researchers and historians believe that the "madness" was caused by the effects of Porphyria--a rare condition in which a person becomes allergic to sunlight.This film concerns only a very small portion of his long reign. You see George at first as a capable and decent man, but slowly he becomes tough to manage and irrational. What is very interesting but tough to watch are the ways that the barbaric doctors try to treat his malady. Ultimately, by the end of the film, George seems to have recovered and the audience is left to assume everything was peachy from that point on, but this was NOT the case. His mental condition continued to wax and wane for decades and ultimately, his son George IV became ruler long before he was actually crowned because his father was too incapacitated to rule or even be trusted to care for himself.A very sad true story that was too briefly explored in this film. However, I must also admit that the acting was very good, the sets lovely and the film fascinating throughout...but incomplete.An interesting post-script. While George was reasonably rational when the Revolutionary War began, his mental impairment must have affected his reasoning even then. You wonder if maybe the whole situation might have been dealt with much differently if the king had truly been in his right mind. For example, when the Prime Minister, Pitt the Younger wanted to show leniency towards the colonies and reconcile, he was not supported in this by the King. In fact, the King said some rather imprudent things about needing to teach Colonists a lesson. Who knows...and an interesting question for historians.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE MADNESS OF KING GEORGE shows us how mad the ruler of England became at some point in time due to an illness doctors knew little about.How his illness is treated is at the core of this story, when King George III is assigned a doctor (IAN HOLM) to use whatever means are necessary to restore sanity. All the while, court intrigue has everyone in parliament conspiring about appointing a Regent to take over the King's duties. His son, the Prince of Wales (RUPERT EVERETT) is more then willing to replace his father on the throne.Much of it is played for fine comic effect with many nuances and comic timing in spite of the seriousness of the central character's illness. NIGEL HAWTHORNE recreates his London stage role, playing the part of the mad king to perfection. HELEN MIRREN is highly satisfactory as his wife who wants nothing more than to see him make a complete recovery and RUPERT GRAVES is fine in one of the more low-key roles as one of the King's supportive aids.As usual in all of these British historical pieces, the settings, costumes, photography, art direction--all are exquisite. The photography is a marvel at suggesting that only candlelight illuminates many of the scenes so that it's like watching a series of fine paintings come to life. Effective use of Handel's music provides solid support throughout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will be Hawthorne's epitaph</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I originally saw this on stage at the Royal National Theatre in 1992 and then I saw it in the cinema when released as a film. I read a biography of the King recently and the death of Sir Nigel Hawthorne over Christmas prompted me to have another look at this.I'm still bowled over and this will always be one of my top ten films, Hawthorne was never better and this will stand as the best of his legacy of fine performances.His portrayal of the King is painfully accurate and largely historically correct in a superb script by Alan Bennett. The King was well educated but not particularly bright and Hawthorne brings his preremptory manner out so well. The scene where the King cross examines the Prime Minister about a minor appointment tells you more than you need to know of the sane man in two minutes.The descent into madness is subtle at first, and might just be eccentricty but then gets worse and the Government are appalled at how they might lose control to the Opposition if there is a regency declared. The machinations become immense as so much hangs on the King's sanity.Meanwhile treatment goes ahead and in a superb scene Hytner parodies the Coronation service when the King is strapped to a chair and gagged to Handel's 'Zadok the Priest'. In the Coronation service this music has since 1727 been used when the monarch is ceremonially led to St Edward's chair and is enthroned at the precise moment the choir comes in on the music.However, the King recovers, though he had separate bouts of subsequent illness before totally losing it (though by then to Alzheimers) in 1811, though he was to live until 1820.Hawthorne was robbed of an Oscar here in my view. Scriptwriter Bennett, one of our best living playwrights, has a small part as an MP.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating...A LITTLE GEM</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* This picture, to summarize, is engaging, sad, humorous and well told. King George III (portrayed exceptionally by Nigel Hawthorne) is a haunted man in many regards. He is, of course, the British Monarch who lost the American Colonies. He also has a very large family, a loving wife and must overcome the delicate hurdles of politics.As we go further, we learn that the King is starting to act bizarre, and this opens the door for internal intrigue, political back-biting and sordid plans. The abridgement of social graces can be found on all sides, some which are truly hilarious.The Prince of Wales,(salaciously depicted by Rupert Everett) stands to gain the throne, if the effective coup works out. All have their reasons for choosing sides. The wild card in the feud, is the Chancellor of the Exchequer. He, like all political folk, wants to stack his cookies on the winning side. The performances are top-notch and the story is interestingly and intelligently presented. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Brilliant and Intoxicating! My #1 Of The 90's!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the moment that this film started, it had me totally captivated. It chronicles King George III's gradual slip into what was thought to be madness, (but was later discovered to be another disease), and, perhaps one of the most impressive things, does so without bending and mangling history.Granted, (now I'm American born and raised and live here so don't think I'm bashing them or anything), many parts of this film might be hard for American audiences to grasp, but if you have the brain cells to sit through it, it's absolutely wonderful.The shining star, to me, is English-born Helen Mirren. Talk about a robbed Oscar! She portrays the originally-German Queen Charlotte incredibly well. The costuming in the film are what add to not only Mirren's, but the entire film's, historical accuracy. Granted, Mirren's German accent didn't stay exactly on key the entire time, but someone who had lived in England long enough, the accent could have begun to fade, no? Nonetheless, a flawless performance by Mirren.The other reason this film is so incredible is its star, Nigel Hawthorne. Every scene he portrays the King in is perfect. He makes you feel like you're part of the movie; the interaction between Hawthorne in Mirren is great, as well.Others who add to the film's quality are Everett (as the Prince of Wales), Donohoe (Lady Pembroke), and Holm (Dr. Willis). A truly great ensemble cast makes this my #1 movie of the 90s.Overall: Just absolutely incredible! Go watch it! 5/5 Stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Looks like "The Madness of King George" is a gem reserved for a strict minority. Without having achieved much success in Spain, having a result "loser" in front of "Forrest Gump" Oscar Edition 1995 was forgotten by many in his time and not remembered today for almost anyone. "The Madness of King George" is a free adaptation, lyrical and honest life of George III, Farmer George, King of Great Britain and Ireland, lover of the noblest arts, the father of fifteen children and husband model. Based on the play by Alan Bennett, The Madness of King George features a stellar cast headed by the magnificent Nigel Hawthorne in the role of the king and the beautiful Helen Mirren as Queen Charlotte, a couple still in love seems to have found the secret definitive marital bliss. Rupert Everett as the sly and wayward Prince of Wales, the beautiful Amanda Donohoe, Rupert Graves and the fabulous and never well enough weighted Ian Holm complete the list of players in a winning film Academy Award for Best Art Direction nominated in three other categories. A majestic starting a heavenly music of German composer who would nationalize English, an extraordinary assembly and an excellent mood latent in many of the frames of the tape, make "The Madness of King George" a true delight for all the senses. The artistic direction that took her Oscar that year, is unbeatable, the crowds and the details are beautiful, the soundtrack is a treat for lovers of classical music and the film well worth, has a mood ironic and acid keeps the pace of the film during the whole film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the viewing of The Madness of King George I never really felt like I was watching a movie. I was absorbed into the characters and the representation of the factual events. If that does not describe an excellent movie then I do not know what does.The story represents power and power struggle and the concept of subservience. Certain situations and constructs of underlings are built to a fine conclusion to resolve the characters. Befitting power and Royals the end conclusions is not "Disney-esque" for all characters.The sets and characters are fabulously done. There is no sense of egotistical pompousness on the part of the cast and crew (no over the top Johnny Depp-ness here). There is a purpose to the story and the content is more important than the cast and crew.Well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nigel Hawthorne plays his role at the mad King George with perfection, he combines a loud, witty style with a weak and innocent one so perfectly that can't help but both admire and pity his character.Nicholas Hytner's direction is fantastic - providing a perfect contrast between the King's fragile state of mind, and his powerful position. He does this be combining an upbeat, almost patriotic score with visions of the King's madness.Other roles including Helen Mirren, Ian Holme and Rupert Everett also play their parts well.****/*****</fullReview>

It is a beautiful depiction of an interesting historical period and the dilemmas faced by countries lead by accidents of genetics. The script is magnificent and the filming gorgeous, but it is the incredible performances of the leading cast that set this film apart. Historical dramatic film at its best.

		<fullReview>I cannot begin to describe how much I loved the Madness of King George. I am very fond of period dramas, and this was a truly great film, funny, moving and pretty much immaculate. George III is married to Charlotte, yet he dallys with Lady Pembroke and fathers 15 children and an empire. The thing is, Farmer George(the king's nickname) is starting to show signs of madness, the rest.. well you'll have to see it for yourself. Nicolas Hytner directs impeccably, and while the screenplay has some sardonic jokes and colloquialisms it ensures that the film is essentially a serious study of 18th century politics and the monarchy. The period detail and art direction is nothing short of sumptuous, exquisite costumes, scenery and settings, and the use of music by Handel was appropriately fitting. Then there is the acting, it was top notch. Nigel Hawthorne's performance here is so exceptional, he pretty much embodies the film, in a performance that is funny, moving and charming. Helen Mirren and Amanda Donohoe both do wonderfully as his wife and mistress, they both are great actresses and both look lovely here. Rupert Everett is suitably detestable as the foppish Prince of Wales, Ian Holm is brilliant as Willis in some of the more harrowing scenes of the film and Rupert Graves is entertaining as Greville. Overall, this is a truly great film, so worth seeing for Hawthorne's performance alone! 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A moving exploration of mental illness masquerading as a costume drama. THE MADNESS OF KING GEORGE tells the story of George III, Britain's 'Mad King', whose life was beset by repeated ill health until his son, the Prince Regent, finally ruled in his stead.This is far from your usual costume drama (something like THE YOUNG VICTORIA), because it's written by and based on a stage play by Alan Bennett, who immediately brings events closer to home. He focuses on characters, personalities and feelings throughout, and isn't so interested in the pomp and splendour that other directors might have favoured. Instead, this is a glorious rebellion put on film, showing with childlike glee the way one man fought back against the social constraints of his era.Of course, that's not to say that this isn't an authentic-looking film; the costumes are splendid, the locations even more so, and the cast of British thesps are all very good. Nigel Hawthorne, in particular, gives one of his best-remembered performances (he'd played the same role on stage many times, which is why he's so confident in the part).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not your run-of-the-mill historical movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched "The Madness of King George" yesterday; I really enjoyed the movie. It had some amazing acting in it, and the 'madness' never once strayed into being comedic (which it could have easily done I imagine). Yes, it's a bit of a frock-coat and wigs fest? but if you allow yourself to look past all of that there is a sensitive, and deeply moving story of human nature, and the nature of human relationships.Of course, Freud's Oedipus complex is hard to completely brush aside considering the actions of the Prince. Though it cannot be a term used without hesitation? indeed, the son attempts to usurp the Father, but not with the Mother. Perhaps if you consider the old idea that a monarch is married to the country ? then the allusion works quite well.Even if you are not sure on the rights / wrongs of continuing to have a monarchy in the UK I don't feel that the republican agenda is pushed too strongly. For me I guess the fact the plot is concerned with royalty is a by-line for the main theme of relationships.In madness the King portrays traits of teenage antics, and requires (in the end) a disciplinarian approach to combat his outbursts, and help him grow into the man. It's also an amazing love story? with a wife torn between medical advice, and wanting to be beside "Mr. King's" side (which she knows is possibly the best medicine). If you get a chance this summer ? do rent it out!</fullReview>

This aspect to the story had significant meaning to me because I find any form of psychotherapy that remotely resembles behavioural...science (if you will) absolutely fascinating, and the way it was represented makes me wonder if the portrayal were conceived out of mere fancy. It is almost unimaginable--I can hardly believe that psychotherapy would be so advanced at that time, and yet why can't it be plausible for science to be so advanced when warfare was moulding the history of the world.</fullReview>

The movie works on several levels--a commentary on the barbaric medical practices of the day, a love story between King George (Hawthorne) and his Queen (Mirren), dispute between the generations, and most importantly, of the overcoming of hurdles. Like many British films, this is one is well acted and directed but the pace is sluggish for most Americans. Overall, the general character of the movie is uplifting and when combined with the fine performances make it Academy Award material. Four and 1/2 stars out of five.</fullReview>

The movie is filled with some humorous moments, dialogs and characters.Only problem I had with the movie was that it focused on way too many and unneeded characters. Also because of this, Sir Ian Holm's character gets seriously underused. A bit of an ungrateful role for Sir Ian Holm.

		<fullReview>It was a random movie for me. Just about a tag in the historically theme. But when i watched, it became some sort of lost masterpiece with a soft theater look. All I can say that is all about perseverance in elderly life. Yes, its about a king, but it is about how you can maintain your strength and will in some difficult situations in life. I'm about thirty, and i have a daughter, so i understood how some of the funny moments of managing a family in this movie developed in a bizarre way, the family struggle vision, and everything happening side-by-side with corruption and power desires (its a kingdom, anyway). So, for me, its the kind of movie that some of the older members of your family would love to watch. Most because its an elegant movie about how an old man that lost his moral due his condition can return to power, proving that everyone has a chance to reclaim a second chance in a younger, greedier world. Unless you want the crown, so... don't show them this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Happens When a King Goes Mad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Madness of King George is a good movie. It is enjoyable to watch and you will no doubt come away glad that you did. Though the Madness of King George is a movie about political struggles, there is a lot of light hearted comedy that adds a very colourful flavour. The comedy is quite good and the story is quite interesting.The Madness of King George is set in 1788 in England. Britain has just lost its American colonies and this plays a major part on the health on the King. Though it is difficult to see due to the King's behaviour throughout the movie, the blurb says that he is beginning to act strangely. Nigel Hawthorne plays a rather cheerful and eccentric king but as the movie progresses the eccentricity becomes more and more extreme. It is at this stage that the king is believed to be mad and the movie turns into one of a political struggle. Yet right from the beginning of the movie one does sense desire coming from the kings eldest son so it is not surprising that he wants to take the throne.The acting in the movie is extremely good and Nigel Hawthorne plays the role of the king brilliantly. The film makers have managed to capture the atmosphere of the aristocracy and have portrayed the era and the customs accurately. One aspect that I was particularly impressed with was the allusions to Shakespeare's King Lear, which is another story of a king gone mad. Unfortunately it seems that the movie probably followed the plot of King Lear a little too closely. Though the play and the movie do end differently, there is a number of simulates. The movie does though acknowledge King Lear near the end. The plot of the ambitious prince wanting to take the throne of the king is also an overused plot point but that happens.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was something I wanted to see when it came out in 1994 and I was only nine years old, so of course Mom didn't allow it. I remembered the movie tonight and got a hold of it. I think that had I watched the movie that young, ratings aside, I would probably have appreciated Rupert Graves' handsomeness more than the tale the movie was trying to tell me, so I'm glad I waited. The movie was horribly slow-paced at times. It could have used a rewrite and a tightening up of the script. However, the acting from everyone was wonderful and anyone else playing King George III might not have saved the movie from its script. I also felt moved by the predicament of having a nervous system condition that IMDb claims I'm misspelling when I'm not misspelling it in an age where modern medicine thinks that giving you boils will cure something and modern psychiatry is locking people (some of who aren't actually legitimately mentally ill) in an asylum. If you're looking for something that is somewhat thought provoking, has wonderful acting, and is set during the Regency, this would be a movie to consider. On that note, if you do not have patience for a slow script, occasional too much dumped on you at once before meandering again, then reconsider.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this when it first came out, very much enjoyed it but my memory of it had grown foggy so, when it was shown tonight at my public library, I made a point of seeing it again. Good choice and I see why I remembered it as being so good.Hawthorne as the king, Mirren as the queen, Holmes as the doctor are all superb with Hawthorne the star shining brightest. The view of court life, loyalties, disloyalties, hidden agendas, was excellent.For those wishing more background of the era, I commend to you the viewer's comment of theowinthrop's (21 May 2005), "The King Who Talked to Trees..." which concisely summarizes the history of the era; this film is more loyal to the facts than most historical films. Most people seeing this will miss its delineation of the "Moral Treatment" movement in mental health. I'm a retired clinical psychologist and my internship was in the late '50s when psychotropic medicines were just coming in. The techniques of Dr. Willis were consistent with those of the "moral treatment" movement. These were later used at Topeka State Hospital, KS, (and a few others -- in the USA they originated at Pensylvannia Hospital with Dr. Benjamin Rush). This was "state of the art" during a few decades of the late 1800s but it began in Europe more than a century earlier. MT had many variants but generally demanded hard work, appropriate behavior, rewards and consequences, etc., and while its effectiveness was not equal to those of good treatment facilities in the 21st century, it was FAR better than other alternatives of that period -- and of many later periods through the 1940s. While many mental disorders (schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, etc., and the porphyria of King George) have a biological basis, the symptoms can be somewhat ameliorated, sometimes controlled by psychological forces. I found this account completely believable on a temporary basis. For a history of the MT techniques, please Google "Moral treatment" asylums; the Wikipedia article is quite good.This film is listed as a comedy. I view it as a drama with tragic and comedic overtones. I've worked enough years with psychotic patients in hospitals and in private practice that the loss of control of one's mind and its impact on one's family and associates never strikes me as comical. It's not that funny things don't happen -- as sometimes they did in this film -- but that's certainly not the overall arch. This film ends on an apparent upnote, at a point when the king was seemingly restored to his mind but before a later recurrence from which he did not recover.(As an example of briefly "funny" happenings in a tragic life, there was my episode with "Julian", a schizophrenic in his 20s who was in my therapy group. One day he didn't show up and I found he'd been placed in seclusion for groping an attractive (female) nurse. I visited him while he was in seclusion to continue our therapy relationship. When I questioned Julian why the groping had happened, he explained, "Aw, Doc, what's the use of being schizophrenic if you can't get some kicks out of it?" Somewhat funny, yes, right after the moment, but the overall arch of his brief life was closer to the tragic.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frivolous but immensely enjoyable entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is based on a totally frivolous but delightful stage romp which depicted the political machinations in London in the late eighteenth century when King George III first showed signs of mental instability. The ruling Tory government did not want to see him replaced by his son acting, in accordance with the constitution, as Regent (i.e. as King in everything but name) because the Prince tended to be a political supporter of the opposition Whigs. Conversely the Whig leaders recognised that if they could force through a Regency Bill to effect this replacement, the grateful Prince should give them a great deal of support. They made every effort to draw attention to the king's problems and simultaneously introduced the Regency Bill into Parliament. The Tories countered by stalling tactics on this bill combined with attempts to bring the King into public view at times when he would do nothing to suggest possible mental instability; and later with drastic attempts to provide medical support to correct or minimise the King's problem. Little was understood medically about insanity at this time but history shows that the very unconventional treatments devised by the appointed Court Physician finally proved successful, and the King recovered for quite a long period, although his insanity eventually returned to become clearly evident to all, so that his son did finally become Prince Regent for the last nine years of his father's life. The play, and this film on which it is based, portray events during the Kings earlier period of mental instability from which records show that he appeared to make a fairly complete recovery. The comedy lies mainly in the re-creation of the political manoeuvring of the period, and the way in which this was accepted by London Society, although many sequences showing courtiers and other attendants relaxing after the king left a room were also very amusing.. This may not sound a great deal, but I found it made a most satisfying film. There were also moments of real pathos and drama which showed the Queen (played by the superlative actress Helen Mirren) supporting her husband in every way she could, and I for one became sufficiently involved in the story to experience real pleasure when the king won his struggle and resumed his normal duties. The film itself is inconsequential, but, if comedies of manners and situations appeal to you, you should not miss any chance to see it.The comedy is not limited to the actual film but extends also to its title. It has been reported that the Studio planned to release this film under the title "The Madness of King George III"; but at the last minute they were advised that this title might drastically reduce the audiences in the United States where viewers who had not seen "The Madness of King George I" or "The Madness of King George II" would probably decide to give it a miss, and it was therefore decided not to identify which British monarch was the subject matter for this delightful romp.Nigel Hawthorne starred as the King and Rupert Everitt played the Prince of Wales. Dr Willis, the unconventional physician who had such an important role in the events, was beautifully played by Ian Holm. This film avoided the common trap of transcribing a stage play to film so literally that many of the sequences become unduly lengthy and much too static. The original play by Allan Bennett was very successful in England and he was fortunately (but unusually) asked to prepare the film script from it himself. On the basis of this example I would recommend that the authors of most plays intended as the basis for a film should be given the opportunity to have a much greater say in the preparation of the film-script. The several awards won by this film were all well deserved, but it remains dominated by the superlative performance of Nigel Hawthorne. (This was also the general verdict on the original London stage production and it will be a brave theatre manager who brings the play back there with a different lead actor.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Certainly the American tradition casts "German Georgie" in a far different light than the real life English King who for all his foibles was much loved at home. George III enters upon his mania to the dismay of the royalist faction but the very threat of losing the throne to his erratic son the dissipated Prince Regent and future King George IV (the English King George IV to be distinguished from His Majesty's weakling American knock-offs George IV The Bush and George IV jr) prompts a recovery."I seem more myself," remarks old King George introspectively as he puts aside a reading from Shakespeare, "I think I've learnt how to seem." Yet George III did much to shape the American image of what a ruler should be. He's so moral that the Queen blames the regrettable illness on his refusal to take mistresses. "There are model farms and factories," George Rex tells the Royal Family, "we must be a model family." On American independence, George IV decides, "It's an idea we must get used to." Will that ever happen? See the film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More a drama than a comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I'm honest with you, than I must say that I had some serious doubts about watching this movie. I knew it was a comedy and normally I'm always in for a good laugh, even (or perhaps especially) when it means laughing with some royals. But the main problem that I had with the movie was the fact that it was situated in the eighteenth century, a time period for which I don't really care. Still I gave the movie a try, hoping the best.Apparently the story was not only based on a play, but also on some actual events. That of course makes it all more interesting, because a king who goes mad isn't something you'll experience every day. And this movie does more than showing why and how King George III started to loose his senses (he had just lost America to independence), it also shows how the man became the victim of political and royal back stabbing, because not only the members of parliament, but even one of his own sons wanted to see him removed from power. It also shows how marginal and primitive the medical practices in the eighteenth century actually were and how it almost was a miracle that the King conquered his disease...What surprised me after seeing this movie, was that it was more a drama than a comedy. Sure it offered some good laughs, but in the end this was a very serious movie with a serious subject. It was more 'normal' than I expected from it at first. That doesn't mean that I didn't like it of course, it was just something different. The decors and the costumes however were exactly the way I imagined them to be. They are really good and make sure that you know what time period this story is set in. But what I liked most were the performances by the different actors. Especially Nigel Hawthorne is not to be missed as King George III. He's interesting to watch, as well as when he is the 'normal' king, as when he's playing the madman. Perhaps I enjoyed him even more when he acted like a crazy man, even though it's hard to tell when he was at his best. Other people like Helen Mirren and Ian Holm did a very nice job as well and make this movie worth watching.So, even though I had my doubts about this movie, I must admit that it wasn't bad at all. It wasn't as much a comedy as I had hoped for, but even the more dramatic parts were nice to watch. I give this movie a 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sad tale of our last King</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great, touching and strangely intimate portrait of our last King, George the Third! We in the United States reviled him but to his countrymen in Britain he became a figure of pity due to the disease which eventually left him blind, deaf and quite insane. This movies is also a good look at the state of the practice of psychiatry in the 18th century!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>George III: I am the King of England! Dr. Willis: No sir, YOU ARE MY PATIENT!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview> `The Madness of King George' is an interesting and entertaining film. The behind the scenes look at the royal family and their retinue, as well as the antics of the king as he loses his wits make for a compelling and often risible story. A strong cast led by Nigel Hawthorne and Helen Mirren serve well this look at Britain's George III and his mental problems. I'm not sure of the film's historical accuracy, though it seems that most aspects (the King was indeed ill and the rivalry between Pitt the Younger and Fox definitely existed) are based on fact. I'm sure the liberties that are taken in the details are venial as they enhance the enjoyment of a colorful movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deserving of Praise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rarely give out praise for a film, but here is one that I have enjoyed watching the second and third time. Excellent story, rooted in reality, well crafted, great acting by the world's best, great and accurate costumes, comportment, sets, historical accuracy.The story guides you to the seminal moment when George is reading King Lear with the Minister from government and regains his sanity in one of the finest moments in cinematography, which could only have been portrayed, ironically enough, by elite stage acting. Why is this so? Because the Royal Family would have carried themselves like stage actors back in the 18th century. Whether the directors and actors knew this or it simply came together, it's absolutely brilliant.In short, kudos. I give only 9 out of 10, because I thought the machinations portrayed in Parliament and of the Prince were a little exaggerated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad but not mad enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The madness of king george is a commendable piece that ambles along quite nicely without actually hitting the right notes. Call me a masochist but i was expecting the king to be a little more potty than he was. It was ok as period drama's go but much over rated i think. One very funny point is that this film was going to be called the madness of king III but it was thought the American's would not watch it because they hadn't seen part I or II !!!!.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot of nice acting in this historical drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an under-educated American, I was totally unaware of the Regency crisis of 1788, or for that matter any information about the health of the tyrant George III. (Although to be sure, he fell far short of modern tyrants, the Stalins, Husseins, and Pots of the world.) And since I do not get my history from feature films, it may not be true. (Take that, Oliver Stone) There was a lot of nice acting in this historical drama however, particularly from the inimitable Nigel Hawthorne. Would that Helen Mirren had a larger part, as she is always superb. One of the things that most struck me was how everyone of that period, even royalty was held hostage to the ignorance and barbarism of medieval medicine. I wonder what people will think of current medicine two hundred years hence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>period drama that leaves a few questions to be answered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>!!!!!SPOILER!!!! While King George begins to lose his sense of reality the English parliament and the Prince of Wales plot and connive to fill the power vacuum.What this film boils down to is a drama about 'pulling through', or the 'light at the end of the tunnel' type of affair that is not unlike the excellent 'Shine'. But one thing that is successful about the film is the portrayal of the politicians, doctors, servants and ministers who all scurry around trying to take advantage/cover up of the situation for their own benefit. By the end of the film characters that you considered 'good' by being kind to the king during his dark days, lose their jobs and the king is back to his old arrogant and inhuman self.But it also seems that there was more to loose by having the king not on the throne then there was having him on. What happened to parliament reform? The abolition of slavery? These were the things the Kings enemies in parliament wanted to bring in by throwing him off.Very complicated and it left me a bit cold.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My brief review of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An interesting lavish costume drama with the period depicted as well as one would expect, it nevertheless suffers from only providing little background information. The film has elements of drama as well as comedy, and they do not really clash well, plus a mix of half-developed supporting character parade through film. Still, it is all quite well made, and Hawthorne plays his part quite well, though not brilliantly so, plus there are some ideas brought to light about how appropriate a monarchy system is. Is the film then a satire on the monarchical system of Britain? It is hard to tell. Either way, the film presents George III's madness in a relatively interesting manner, and with good production values to add to realism, even if not much else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the title even made for something that I wrote in 5th grade history class</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had never known about King George III before "The Madness of King George" came out, but what I saw in the movie sure blew me away. I would say that George's mental state, more than anything, is an example of what happens when these monarchs refuse to marry outside their boundaries: they end up with all sorts of problems.But even ignoring that, the movie does a fine job showing what happened. And they know that even when dealing with a serious topic, there's always room for a joke or two (and not particularly clean ones). Through their performances here, Nigel Hawthorne, Helen Mirren, Ian Holm, and the rest of the cast all reaffirmed themselves as some of the greatest actors of our era.As for what I wrote in the 5th grade history class. We were studying the American Revolution (you may recall that George III was king at that time in history, and some people blamed his mental state for the loss of the 13 colonies). I wrote a story about two brothers in Virginia arguing about whether or not to break away from England. One of the brothers called referred to "good King George", and the other called him "mad King George". A lame joke, I admit, but that's what I wrote.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some Impressive Elements In A Movie That Comes Up Short In The End</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want to say right off the top that there is a lot about this movie that was impressive. As a political statement, the movie makes valid points about the problems of hereditary monarchies. The performances of Nigel Hawthorne (as George III), Helen Mirren (as Queen Charlotte), Rupert Everett (as the Prince of Wales) and Julian Wadham (as William Pitt, the Prime Minister) were excellent, the portrayal of the era's manner of dealing with "madness" seemed very realistic, the sets were wonderful, and the closing caption left one wondering about the current royal family, since they are direct descendants of George III! So, there was a lot that I liked. Unfortunately, in rating this movie I also found that it was a difficult movie to really sit down and be drawn into.One of the things that kept coming into my head the entire way through was that there just didn't seem to be anything really vital at stake here. I know that sounds unusual when you're talking about the Throne of England, but it's true. Even in the 1790's, when this seems to have been set, the power of the English monarch was increasingly possessed by Parliament, and the monarchy was well on the way to becoming the figurehead it is today. (George III's grandfather, George I, didn't even really want to become King in 1727 because of the limited powers the King of England possessed.) Whether George III or the Prince of Wales was on the throne didn't matter much more than whether Elizabeth II or the current Prince of Wales is on the throne. The Prince may have wanted the trappings of power, but that was all he would get, because there was no real power to be had by being King. I realize that, at least in the movie, the Prince promised the office of Prime Minister to Fox (Jim Carter) in place of Pitt, but this had more to do with the dynamics of Parliament than it had to do with the King (or regent) being able to choose the Prime Minister. If the bill to make the Prince of Wales Regent had passed it would have meant that the majority in Parliament was now in the hands of the opposition, and a transition of power would occur. So the Prince wouldn't make Fox Prime Minister; Fox would make the Prince Regent. I also went through the whole movie not really being sure what my reaction to George's predicament should be. On the one hand, as you watch him being subjected to the grotesque "treatments" of the day, you want to feel sorry for him. Even in history, George III truly was a tragic, King Lear-like figure. On the other hand, the whole movie had a rather overt "anti-monarchy" feel to it, and it was hard to feel sympathy for any of them. I was unclear where the movie was going on that point. The repeated "joke" about the former American colonies - "they're gone, just let them go" - also started to bug me after a while. (As an aside, thinking about those former American colonies, it's always intrigued me that there seems to be far greater fascination with the Royal Family in the United States, which rebelled against the monarchy, than there is in Canada, which remained loyal. That, however, is another story!) As to the movie? It's a middling movie - certainly not a disaster, but nothing to write home about, and I certainly wouldn't watch it again. 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What What?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe seeing a 1994 film in 2013 changes perceptions on things. Maybe because I'm American and not British I didn't "get" what they were trying to do. All I can say is that this film shockingly wasn't very good. I wanted to turn it off my DVR after about 45 minutes or so, but because I thought the critical acclaim had been so great at the time (which I verified on IMDb after I saw the movie), I watched it all the way through to make sure I didn't miss anything. I was expecting to see a phenomenal performance by Nigel Hawthorne, who won the BAFTA Best Actor Award for this. Instead, I saw an over-the-top, overly theatrical performance, which while appropriate for this mostly-theater actor, didn't work in the film. I actually thought the film wasn't too bad UNTIL he was in the scenes. It also took me about half way through the picture to realize that Helen Mirren was supposed to be doing a German accent for her role.I'd like to think that maybe if I saw this in 1994 that I might have thought it was better. But for whatever reason, this was a huge disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Madness of King George</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the play, this is quite a good period drama of a new king of England that has an almost unexplainable madness. I did fall asleep somewhere, probably when Sir Ian Holm was helping cure the king, but what I did see of this film, based in the time of The French Revolution was good. Basically George III (BAFTA winning, and Oscar nominated Nigel Hawthorne) has recently been crowned, and not long after starts a dementia, and becomes more alive and more politically marginalized. All are concerned, especially wife Queen Charlotte (Oscar and BAFTA nominated Dame Helen Mirren), well, unless you count the stupid Prince of Wales (Rupert Everett). The only person who may be able to help the king return to normal "what-what" is Dr. Willis (BAFTA nominated Holm). Also starring Rupert Graves as Greville, Amanda Donohoe as Lady Pembroke, Green Wing's Julian Rhind-Tutt as Duke of York, Julian Wadham as Pitt, Jim Carter as Fox and Geoffrey Palmer as Warren. I can see why Blackadder picked on this period with Prince George in Blackadder the Third. It won the Oscar for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, and it was nominated for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, and it won the BAFTAs for Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film and Best Makeup/Hair, and it was nominated for Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for George Fenton, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Editing, Best Production Design, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Sound, David Lean Award for Direction for Nicholas Hytner and Best Film. Rupert Everett was number 39 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, Amanda Donohoe was number 38, and Dame Helen Mirren number 7 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, and Mirren was number 5 on Britain's Finest Actresses. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard of this film, a highly regarded film by many critics, I decided to watch it because I really like Ian Holm. But it turned out to be a very silly, one note film, about King George's mental breakdown. It's so predictable and juevenile, that its really not funny. A great cast is wasted. I really didnt enjoy it. If you dont like British humor, skip it. My rating: 4.9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have just read Ebert's review of this picture, and it seems he must have seen this one while doing something else at the same time. It isn't as good a picture as Mr. Ebert would have you believe, but it's OK. Ebert even misquotes King George on a very important line: The King says, as he approaches clarity, "I have remembered how to seem," a line of great import, but Ebert misquotes "I have remembered how to seem myself." That reviewer misquotes again on an important line, when certain courtiers are remarking on the new nation USA - one says "the Colonists sent him packing; why not we?" but the reviewer quotes "the Colonists sent him packing; why not me?"The film starts slow - v e r y s l o w - and I almost shut it off and rewound. No getting around it...the first twenty or thirty minutes are boring. But it gets better. Altogether, it's OK - but not great. You'll like Helen Mirren, and you'll like Ian Holm.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining but overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think this film deserved all the praise it received, but it is entertaining nonetheless. Alan Bennetts screenplay has plenty of witty strokes, and Nicolas Hytner's direction is at least brisk. Nigel Hawthorne is quite stunning, one of the few actors to successfully transfer their stage performance to film. Ian Holm is equally fine. What spoils the film for me is the atrocious performance given by Helen Mirren who is my least favourite actress of all time. Her accent varies from line to line, let alone scene to scene, and her acting style is remarkably unsubtle, at least as shown here. I can't believe she was oscar nominated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slight cut above Masterpiece Theater mediocrity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this film, I couldn't help but think how better it could have been. I wished Stanley Kubrick had made a film of this material (rather than wasting his talent on EYES WIDE SHUT, but of course, Kubrick was such an auteur, had to control all aspects of a production and would not deign to stoop to actually using another man's material) as he would have created a real film, with a real feeling of time and place. This movie is not cinematic enough; it is too close to being a filmed play (and a mediocre one at that). It is actually mediocre, despite the good, but unspectacular acting. There is nothing in the dialogue that is interesting, or poetic, or transcendent, or makes you think. What Bertolt Brecht could have done with this material! Another thing that was irritating was the continual reference to the Prince of Wales as fat (historical, he was fat, and several courtiers paid the price of commenting on this fact), but the character was played by Rupert Everett (in a ho-hum performance that bordered on caricature at times), who clearly was not only NOT fat but not even remotely overweight. Such a lack of attention to detail is typical of mediocrity. (A very chubby Peter Ustinov played the Prince and played him well in BEAU BRUMMEL, which also addresses this period and the madness of King George, played by good old Robert Morley.) None of the acting was particularly outstanding; the performances have been vastly overrated. The interiors were nice, but the direction was so uninspired, the film just escaped becoming an egregious bore! And I never really believed that the history was right (I must look it up in my HISTORY OF ENGLAND). All in all, you can do much worse, but beware and be wary!</fullReview>
