		<shortDescription>What Movie Were You Guys Watching?!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know I'm late as hell and I hate to break the overall 'vibe' about this movie but this movie was great when I saw it in the theater and gets better every time I watch it over again. And this is mainly because of the performances by Denzel and Ethan. I don't know what you guys expected but the movie CLEARLY suggests that Denzel is a crooked, burnt-out, streetwise cop and Ethan is a 'wet-behind-the-ears' clueless rookie. So knowing that, WHAT DID YOU GUYS EXPECT, Malcolm X, Remember The Titans, The Hurricane?? If you were, then maybe you all need to be checked out. The reason why this movie was so great is because it wasn't the typical Denzel 'role model' movie. We KNOW that he can play those roles well so it's a testament to his acting ability that he can portray the other side of the spectrum. And my hat goes off to Ethan because he bounces off Denzel flawlessly.I hate to break the news to you guys but cops like Alonzo ARE OUT THERE and need to be acknowledged. Acting like the problem doesn't exist does not solve it. You don't have to go that deep to know that Alonzo was once a good cop who just got fed up w/ 'police procedures.' If you acknowledge that Jake's shallow-mindedness at the beginning of the film only allows him to look at the perks of making detective and how the progress of the day transforms him, you can really appreciate Ethan's portrayal of him. Let's face it, a bad day at the office when you're a narcotics detective differs greatly from that of an office executive and the different stresses can warrant different results.Even the street rhetoric was authentic. Maybe you guys need to get out of the 'burbs more. You guys didn't actually expect eloquent dialogue with little or no profanity, did you? The only part of this movie I struggle with is Dr. Dre's terrible overacting and that isn't nearly enough to take away from the overall result.Next time you guys bash a movie, make sure to try to be objective and rate what you see and not what you're used to seeing!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Denzel's Acadamy Award Winning Moment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In his Acadamy Award Winning Performance,as best Actor.The movie, as the title suggests, follows a single day in the life of rookie cop Jake Hoyt (Hawk) as he is subject to a single day of evaluation by a senior, decorated police narcotics officer Alonzo Harris (Washington) to see if he has what it takes to be a 'narc'. Almost immediately Hoyt is placed on the back foot, constantly caught off guard by Alonzo's nature, his ability to switch between a cold, no-nonsense street-wise player, a genuinely caring and good intentioned leader, and occasionally jovial companion. From their first encounters though, where Hoyt tells Harris he will do "anything you want me to do", the situations Hoyt is taken into become more and more morally ambiguous, from the simple use of excessive force to outright illegal activity, forcing Hoyt to decide which side Harris is truly on, whether to trust him, or whether Hoyt is the unwitting centerpiece of a huge and complex web of lies and set-ups in order for Harris to for fill his own sinister motives..This is the movie that won Denzel the Oscar that year for Best Actor!! A must watch</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic, Denzel Washington's finest hour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before seeing this movie, my impression of Denzil Washington as an actor wasn't especially high. Not to say that he isn't talented, just that ever since Crimson Tide he appeared to be slotted neatly into every stern hero in every serious political thriller to be trotted off the studio assembly line for years. But then came Training Day and his role as Alonzo Harris and all that changed. Shrugging off the overly serious good guy image once and for all, Washington here is a revelation; a barking, ranting maelstrom of police brutality who believes that maintaining order on the crime ridden streets of LA means being even more ruthless than the drug dealers he faces on a day to day basis. His performance elevates the film from standard thriller fare into an exemplary story that has quite rightly become one of my favourite films of all time.Set over the course of twenty four hours, the film whisks Ethan Hawke's naive young police officer onto an introductory day of Narcotics work under Alonzo's tutelage. As the hours go by, Hawke is subjected to more and more violence as the heat and paranoia of suburban Los Angeles combined with his loose cannon superior officer play a heavy toll on his nerves. Consequently, the film is very much a two man story with Hawke and Washington playing off against each other expertly as polar opposites. One young, inexperienced and a firm believer in the rule book, the other older, more cynical and twisted by all his years on the streets into a bull-headed monster.The story itself is fraught with tension. Alonzo forcing his young protégé to smoke PCP at gunpoint is just the start and from there on the pulse pounding never stops. The execution scene where Hawke realises just how far gone his partner is for example is one of nail-biting pressure and shortly after, his encounter with a trio of Mexican gang members is jaw dropping, working as the exact moment you realise how much hot water he has found himself in.The end result is nothing less than a brilliant thriller. Hawke and Washington make for a phenomenal double act and the pace only occasionally lets up to allow the characters time to breathe and establish the depth that makes you care for them more. Highly, highly recommended so long as you're prepared to be absolutely terrified of Denzel Washington for years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning performance by Denzel Washington...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Training Day" was a very good movie. I like movies that shove it in your face and make you deal with it...movies like, "Black Hawk Down"...no clichés, no touching moments, just brutal, bitter realism. "Training Day" was such a movie. However, the one thing that made this film really shine was the performance by Mr. Washington. To me, a good actor is someone who just IS a character...if it isn't obvious that they are acting than they are doing a good job. That was the case with Washingon. He just was Alonzo. Every pantomime, every word, every glance was performed masterfully. Did Mr. Washington deserve his Oscar? Absolutely. 200%. Some people say, "not Oscar material" and I must wonder, what film...what performance were they watching?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Performance of a Lifetime from Denzel!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow! What a superb film, Denzel Washington at his superb best. Denzel plays a terrific part as Alonzo Harris, a cop with a dark personality.From the moment you set eyes on him you can relies that Alonzo is a feisty character, who will stop at nothing to get what he wants.Ethan Hawke provides excellent backup but Denzel steals the show. I don't want to give an plot lines away but there are only three movies in cinema history I have given 10/10, and this one was so close to being number four.I sincerely hope to see Denzel put in another performance like this one.Plot is excellent as it leads you into false sense of securities and even shouting at the TV set.I loved every breathtaking moment of this film and I am sure you will too.Quite extraordinary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you ask me, TRAINING DAY is an excellent film that is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat and blow you away. Harris (Denzel Washington) kind of gave me the creeps. You'll understand why once you've seen this movie. In my opinion, the performances were top grade, the direction was superior, the costumes were perfectly designed, and the cast was perfectly chosen. Also, the soundtrack is really good, too. Before I wrap this up, I must warn you that this movie is very violent if you're going to see it, so viewer discretion is strongly advised. Now, in conclusion, if you're a fan of Denzel Washington or Ethan Hawke, I highly recommend this movie. It's sure to keep you guessing from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's my favourite movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember being lent this on DVD during the summer holidays by a mate soon after it was out. I must have watched it every day/second day for about a month! I loved it so much I could never get enough. Denzel and Ethan are a perfect match for this movie; I can't imagine anyone else playing their rolls. Can you? You will either love this movie or find it just a way to 'pass a night'. If you connect with it then you'll never forget it. I know I haven't and I haven't watched it since 2002 because I can remember every part in detail! Training Day is one of those movies which breaks new ground in terms of how a movie can come across to people. It was filmed in such locations such as Imperial Courts neighborhood which, until now, hasn't been filmed. The talk is the talk... you get a real sense of what it's like for these guys as narcotic officers and for what it's like for these guys as the 'bad guys' themselves. At the end of they day they're "Just people and they always were" (Ethan Hawk in a making of Traning day interview).The movie isn't the fastest paced one around - there are some slow moments but they are played out meaningfully due to some great acting talent which gels the scenes together well. The more you watch it, the more subtle lines and actions you will pick up which make this movie authentic.Overall, to each his own. I have found this to be one of my favorite movies due to great acting, great directing, great casting (Hawk, Washington, Scott Glen etc) and an interesting storyline.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Street Justice Dispensed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ethan Hawke, bright eyed and innocent, reports to his training officer for his first day on the job in narcotics in the LAPD. He never could have fathomed just how much he would learn on that very first Training Day.His training officer is Denzel Washington, a thirteen year veteran on the police who's put in a few years in plainclothes in Narcotics. He certainly has the experience, but just what kind of experience and what he imparts to Hawke is the subject of Training Day.A film like Training Day will rise and fall with the performances of these two characters since one or the other and mostly both is on screen from the beginning. Fortunately both Washington and Hawke complement each other's performances like jigsaw puzzle fit.It is no accident that Denzel Washington won his second Oscar, his first as Best Actor. This performance is working on so many levels it's astonishing. Washington is at all times, charming, capable, corrupt, violent, street smart, and arrogant. What I liked most about it is how the various facets of this character are revealed bit by bit to the audience and to Hawke though not at the same time.As for Ethan Hawke it takes him to realize just exactly what he's dealing with in a training officer. Hawke was nominated himself as Best Supporting Actor, but lost to Jim Broadbent for Iris. Still it remains his career role so far.Corruption in the Los Angeles Police Department isn't exactly a new story. In fact one of the supporting players, Scott Glenn who plays a drug peddler and well, did another film about LAPD corruption in Extreme Justice. LA Confidential also dealt with this issue recently, another fine film.Denzel Washington is a great example in this film of the arrogance of power. He's a guy who dispenses more street justice than going through the traditional system. So with what happens to him here, he gets one of the best comeuppances ever seen on the big screen.And I won't say what it is, but you've got to see Training Day to find out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great acting by Washington and Hawke Excellent Thriller - Action Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie impressed me by its great quality in all ways, the story, thrilling with great police detective action and the most remarkable aspect of the movie was the acting performances of Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke; they put his soul on the characters making this movie a total delight for those who like action films with intelligent scripts and also like for high quality films.About the Movie: Ethan Hawke plays Jake Hoyt, a rookie police officer with a good curriculum that is assigned to a one day trial day in order to qualify for a narcotics division in Los Angeles. Hawke meets then detective Alonzo Haris (Denzel Washington) who was assigned as trainer and evaluator for this rookie. Hoyt wants fiercely to get this assignment, but finds very orthodoxes and quaint ways to "protet and to serve" of Alonzo. In this day Hoyt will meet a true challenge and will face the total opposite way to proceed from the one he learned in the academy; he will also face some of the more dangerous neighborhoods and streets of Los Angeles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Training Day A Solid Action Crime Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Training Day is a solid action crime thriller with exceptional performances by Ethan Hawke and especially Denzel Washington. Director Antoine Fuqua has done an admirable job of making this movie about a rookie cop who gets into a lot more than he bargained for while on a day with a senior rogue detective to prove he's got what it takes to be a narc. Denzel Washington is fantastic as twisted but charismatic Detective Alonzo Harris who takes a big departure from his good guy roles to play the villain in this one. Washington has show over and over again that he's a talented actor. Well he continues to prove just that in Traning Day and then some. Ethan Hawke is equally impressive as rookie cop Jake Hoyt who finds himself in one increasingly dangerous situation after another. Hawke holds his own against Washington on screen and he may not have the flashier role but he goes a very good job as the hero in this film. The rest of the supporting cast including Scott Glenn, Cliff Curtis, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and a brief appearance by Tom Berenger are solid in their roles but none of them are given much to do and are merely given extended cameos. They still prove to be effective none the less in their brief screen time. The music seemed to sync very well with what was happening on the screen and the tone of the film. The brutal action violence is well executed but the showdown between Washington and Hawke near the end did get a bit unrealistic. It was still intense though and the two actors really got to show their off their acting chops in this movie. The vulgar language did get a bit much at times but the good more than outweighs the bad in this one. Despite some flaws Training Day is an entertaining action crime thriller with great performances from Hawke and especially Washington who make this movie definitely worth the time to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First day on a new job, can be stressful...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Denzel is a real chameleon. This is a sinister and likable personality...all because of him. Enter Ethan Hawke's character, officer Jake Hoyt. With the allure of a new job, a transfer to the division that he has been working hard to reach. He is at the top of his game. The Call, from the department head, Alonzo Harris, congratulating him on his promotion, sort of. Denzel Washington, takes on a character, like none other that he has had so far. Sounds like a big business wall street type scenario aye? Not even close, down of skid-row street maybe. This is a story set in Los Angeles, that even when it's daylight, this is the darkest 'beat' in the whole department's city.From the moment that the meet was set at the coffee shop, something is just, slightly skewed. There seems an absence of real concern for Jake's situation and a lot more mechanical rogue cop, trainer 'Doggin' going on here. Alonso wants to catch him up on what's going on, of course, see what he is made of, but Alonzo is dangerous, because he doesn't care, anymore. His soul has departed, and it's simply a matter of time before, he is too. As they departed from the coffee shop, by way of a black Monte Carlo. The director, Antoine Fuqua wanted to show a more real and brutal side of the crime busting business. The place where lines are so blurred...if they even exist anymore. Denzel Washington, should be applauded for the part that he became ' wholly ' involved in. Scary in some ways, it appeared as if there was no acting, just this over the edge ' Narc ' who you just gotta watch like a hawk! Ethan, was the ' newbie ' but a very likable, "Just wanting to do the right thing" type of guy. Some what confused at times about the way in which Harris attended to his profession. Curious about why he would do what he would do. Alonzo, always explaining away the point to a nervous rookie, who in the back of his mind just knew, that there is something here, that won't let him rest until he does the right thing. It almost costs him his life, in the end, Hoyt is a master in his career field...a true Wolf, amongst the dogs. It seemed as though, Hoyt had an awakening. He had to go down into that alley-way because his 'gut' wouldn't let it alone. And in the end, this is what saved his very existence, now that is reasoning with razor sharpness. Plus he needed to get home to that hot wife of his....Recommended, but not for those with weaker film story constitutions. (*****)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A filmmaker's dilemma (some spoilage included)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do you take big money from a studio, thus enabling you to hire the actor that could make your movie great, knowing that the studio will make certain script requirements guaranteed to ruin the whole thing?This movie was so bad, but came so close to being so good. I was thrilled for the first, say, 105 minutes of Training Day. Then, rather than giving us a shocking ending, which would have been ok, or an ambiguous ending, which would have been better, we are given a cheesy formulaic ending. Not only that, the last 15 minutes are an assault on the viewer's intelligence. We are required to believe that Hawke's character would give up his weapon, we are hit with a ridiculous coincidence with the wallet, and it is suggested that our hero would know how to use LA's bus system to travel (quickly, another joke) from Boyle Heights to South Central (for those of you not from here, that would not happen). Then Washington's character leaves Hawke's alive, and...oh forget it, the list just keeps going.But up until that point, I was so impressed. Hawke's internal struggle was great to watch, and pretty plausible. Washington, awful as his character was, was a joy to watch. It was fairly reflective of local issues, coming on the heels of the Rampart police scandal, in which cops in one part of the city (where most of the movie was set) took over the streets, making a huge impact in crime while doing some terrible things. The action scenes (until the latter moments) were fairly realistic looking and fun to watch. The character actors in smaller roles (Macy Gray, Snoop Dogg, and especially Cliff Curtis and his friends) were outstanding. You know, this movie had everything I would have wanted, except for an ending that didn't p*** me off.Go see this movie, but once it moves to the bathtub, feel free to stop.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Awesome, one of the best films ever and Denzel Washington does a very convincing portrayal of the cop who crosses the line, but you have to agree with some of his motives. I love when he shoots Roger and Jake freaks out, he makes a very good point when Jake asks why he shot a friend. "Why was he my friend, because he knew my first name? Roger sold crack to kids and the world is a better place with him dead!" Every point he makes about modern day "street" justice rings very true to modern day crime and justice. It sets the tone very well for an awesome films and all though he is ultimately the bad guy, Alonzo Harris is one of the best characters to every grace the big screen and you can't help but like the guy. There are some great cameos from Dr. Dre and Snoop DoggA true modern day classic. Highly recommended</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not what the rookie expected...but it was ordered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally, a movie where Denzel Washington plays the bad guy! And, wins a well-deserved Oscar for Best Actor. Moreover, Ethan Hawke was nominated for Best Supporting Actor.So, this movie has two great performances to see, as the rogue cop, Alonzo Harris (Washington) takes on the new wannabe narc rookie, Jake (Hawke) on his very first day on the job. And, what a day it is...There are three threads to this complex plot: first, Alonzo has the Russian Mafia after him and must deal with the problem or die ? there's a contract out on him, and those Russian types just don't mess around; Alonzo also has a group of dirty cops who are getting ready to take down another long-time dirty cop who's been supplying drugs for years ? and Alonzo and his gang intend to cash in; and, finally, Alonzo has a do-gooder rookie who thinks he's on the job to actually do good for others, instead of just doing good for himself ? money-wise that is.So, where're the real bad guys, you ask? Well, they're either wearing suits and pulling Alonzo's chain in the big end of town or, they're sitting on the sidelines of the really bad areas, waiting for Alonzo and his buddies to mess things up for themselves ? so that they can then cash in...A big part of the plot is somewhat artificial because Jake's eventual success, shall I say, on his first day comes only as a result of a very fortuitous co-incidence when he saves a young schoolgirl from an attempted rape. It's a crucial event, and I suppose the screenwriter figured that only one unlikely co-incidence was okay. I guess so...Apart from that, it is a fast paced, beautifully edited and photographed, non-stop, rip-roaring, pulsating, wisecracking, boom and bust, kick-butt action movie that left me dazed after first viewing. A second viewing helped to clear up some of the more confusing details. You might want to watch it twice also, but if you like Denzel, then you'll watch this one at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Authentic, Intelligent &amp; Utterly Engrossing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie's a top quality police drama that's not only violent, tense and exciting but also authentic, intelligent and utterly engrossing. It's set in the most dangerous neighbourhoods of L.A. where undercover cops regularly have contact with drug dealers and gangsters and also face high-risk situations on an almost daily basis. The men who undertake this work have to assume many of the characteristics of the criminals they pursue in order to be accepted and in so doing are expected to avoid being sucked into behaving in the same way as the people they're seeking to bring to justice. Needless to say, not every officer manages to do this.Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke)is an ambitious young rookie who wants to advance his career by becoming a member of an elite squad of undercover officers who work under the leadership of Detective Sergeant Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). When Alonzo agrees to take Jake on a one-day ride-along, Jake's thrilled, eager to learn and hopeful that he can show that he has the qualities needed to be a successful member of Alonzo's team.Jake is naive, idealistic and totally unprepared for the events that he'll experience during his training day. He's initially disconcerted by Alonzo's repartee and sense of humour and is later unsettled by some of his mentor's practices, which seem incredibly unorthodox. Alonzo has many years of experience in undercover work and so Jake is reluctant to challenge his methods too strongly.After observing the sale of some drugs in a park, Alonzo chooses not to make any arrests but simply acts in a very threatening manner towards the buyers and then confiscates their drugs. When Jake sees a young girl in an alley being sexually assaulted by two men, he overpowers them on his own and is then surprised when Alonzo decides not to report the incident after viciously beating up the two attackers. Alonzo knows that the girl's related to a gang member who will ensure that the two men are suitably punished but Jake is appalled by the use of this kind of street justice.Later, Jake accompanies Alonzo when he uses a fake search warrant to enter a drug dealer's house so that he can steal the dealer's money and on another occasion when Alonzo and the rest of his squad kill a drug dealer who used to be a cop so that they can steal his money. Jake refuses to take a share of the proceeds but then is forced to change his mind after Alonzo threatens to frame him for the murder.During his day with Alonzo, Jake is forced at gunpoint to smoke marijuana (laced with P.C.P.) and later pressured into drinking whisky and beer. He also learns that Alonzo owes a large amount of money to some Russian gangsters from Las Vegas and that the money stolen from the drug dealers is to be used to pay them off.Jake's recognition of how corrupt Alonzo had become had grown as the day progressed but things then become even more threatening when he realises during a visit to a Latino gangster's home that Alonzo has abandoned him and the gang are determined to kill him."Training Day" contains plenty of action and violence but it's all relevant to the story and is very effective in portraying the level of danger that Jake finds himself in. The way in which the story unfolds draws the audience into identifying with the hapless trainee and in so doing makes the whole drama extremely gripping. The initial meeting of Alonzo and Jake is fascinating and the way that their relationship develops turns out to be both interesting and unpredictable. The inclusion of sequences filmed on location in the neighbourhoods where the action is set, enhances the realistic feel of the whole project and the authentic sounding dialogue strengthens this further.Denzel Washington's Oscar winning performance captures perfectly Alonzo's unique combination of charm and menace and Ethan Hawke is extremely impressive as a young guy who experiences the most eventful and memorable day of his life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With two very engaging actors taking lead roles, in the form of Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke, this movie seemed to promise a great deal. Yet somehow it never live up to its pretensions.The beginning was almost a cliché of the genre, in which Hawke as naive rookie gets treated with cynical contempt by his street-wise bad-ass mentor, Washington. The whole thing has a slightly de-ja-vu look about it, as other equally good movies resonate in one's memory. But just as it begins shuffling towards Boredom Street, the plot quickens and undergoes a dramatic and unexpected shift. A likable bad guy, played by reliable Scott Glenn is ruthlessly slain by the mentor (who has clearly crossed the line) in punctuation for stealing his $4million stash. The whole thing is rigged to look like a shake-down that went wrong. It certainly gets your attention. Needless to say; the rookie wants no part of it and declines his share in the pay-off. You know from that point on that a collision course is inevitable. Later this rookie is left in the hands of a bunch of homicidal Hispanics who have evidently been paid by his mentor to whack him. He survives this experience by a coincidence that borders upon the supernatural and is rather hard to take seriously. Still; he does, and now goes after his 'villain' mentor. After that we are back to formulaic again. The ending is as weak as the beginning. Our rookie survives, the mentor gets wasted (by Russian mafia types) there's a brief off-camera newscast voice-over explaining that he's a 'hero' cop who died in the line of duty, blah,blah, blah.A group of shady senior law officers referred to as the Three Wise Men and who are also evidently rotten as hell - of which Tom Berenger is wasted in a cameo role - are never seen or heard from again. It's a very incomplete and unsatisfactory denouement. I'm left thinking that the money or the celluloid just ran out before the story could be wound up.You can see hints of 'Serpico' - which is more believable, 'The Rookie' - which is more fun, 'Deep Cover' which is more gripping, and one or two others. This work is adequate. The script is decent; acting is mostly good; location, lighting and sound do the business. Editing seems a bit choppy at times. It lights up predictably, shines brightly for a while, but fades without much flair. Worth a watch if you get the chance, but not recommended for any particular quality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fuqua leaves a memorable as police film entertaining and convincing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every day, in the streets of the depressed urban areas of the United States is waged a war; a war between residents, drug traffickers and those who have vowed to protect some of the other. This war has its victims and their torturers, and one of its most important figures is the sergeant "Alonzo Harris" an agent of narcotics with 13 years of experience whose questionable methods make diffuse the line between the legality and corruption. "Jake Hoyt", a young police newly assigned to narcotics, begins her rounds to the orders of "Alonzo" to learn from him."Training Day" is a film that with an aesthetic meticulous and with some elegant, has good sequences of bravado and hardness that give greater force to the film. It also has blunt dialogs that come to him perfect its protagonist Denzel Washington. Few actors convey as much as Denzel Washington, which imposes respect with just a gesture, and makes a film switch to better.After seeing Training Day" what is more surprising is the ability narrative of its director Antoine Fuqua. It's one of the duels between players with more intensity, with two superb interpretations, one of just awarded Denzel Washington, and another is the interpretation of a young and least known Ethan Hawke, which offers a mirror full of enthusiasm and vigorously.We have to highlight the hardness of the shares, the argument, the personality of the characters and the perspective from which is dealt with the world of crime and drugs, including small moments of humour, and flashy scenes as that of Hawke in the house of the band of Hispanics criminals.The film of Fuqua leaves a memorable as police film entertaining and convincing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine acting, but a disappointing movie overall.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was anxious to see "Training Day" because Denzel Washington won the Oscar for his performance. It indeed was an Oscar-caliber performance, but that alone doesn't make it a great film. In fact, to me it is seriously flawed.As Denzel said in an interview this week, when he found out his character met such a finality, he took license to make him a really bad guy. With perhaps noble intentions, this cop deals out his own form of justice to the drug traffickers, in one scene shooting Scott Glenn's character with a shotgun in his apartment, then telling the other officers present how they should relate the incident to authorities. Denzel was also a cheating husband, with a primary family of wife and 4 sons, and a young son on the side with a Hispanic woman in the "hood."Ethan Hawke plays an honest, by-the-book type of guy who is also street smart and capable of handling himself, a good cop. He eventually gets the upper hand on Denzel, after being abandoned for dead among Latino gambler thugs, and prevents him from getting the stolen money to the payoff point.The following comments contain information which may be considered SPOILERS for those who have not yet seen Training Day.The story covers one day, from early morning to midnight, it is Ethan Hawke's first day "training" with corrupt cop Denzel to become a narcotics officer. It ends when Denzel, unable to get the $Millions to the Russians by midnight, is gunned down at a stoplight by a half-dozen or so Russians. But I get ahead of myself.Although difficult to watch at many points, most of the first 3/4 of the film has a realistic, ingenuous feel to it. Then the last parts become disingenuous. After a brutal fight, Hawke drops from the roof onto the hood of Denzel's car? Denzel, instead of getting out and disposing of him does a multiple car-ram routine in the parking lot? Denzel flaunts disobedience of all the rules, even pointing a gun at another driver in mid-day, but at midnight, on a deserted street stops and waits for a light to change to green?? That was obviously done only to stage the finality where the Russians box him in and then start shooting. A rather promising story, once again, ruined by a poor and unimaginative end game. Staged fights, near-executions, saved-by-a-phone-call scene, car crashes, slow-motion execution do not a good movie make.I saw it on DVD. While the picture and sound are fine, and there are a couple of interesting extras, overall the presentation by modern standards is average at best. Overall a disappointment, with much foul language and crude sexual references, and I will not recommend "Training Day" to friends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***********Spoiler Warning************I'll be blunt, Denzel was good but he wasn't an oscar winner. This movie, like so many others, builds up an atmosphere but once you see what's behind the imagery it's all cracked. I often think Hollywood would be better off simply abandoning cookie cutter movie plots and really trying to reach--Training Day would have been just as effective if it had been a story about Ethan Hawke's eyes getting opened at how the world really works, and seeing a dark shadow upon our society.Instead we get some plot contrivances that border on the ridiculous. Bad boy L.A. cop Denzel goes to Vegas and gets it in bad with the Russians? Huh? He has to pay them to get off the hook, so he first robs one drug dealer to buy a search warrant, then uses the phony search to whack another dealer who used to be an old friend of his to steal his money stash, and plans to pin it all on rookie cop Ethan Hawke who was supposedly strung up on PCP. Never mind that people would wonder why straight arrow Ethan would suddenly become a crazed fiend on his first day on the job.Then there's the really fortunate circumstance of Ethan saving a little girl who turns out to be the cousin of the guys who are going to kill him later on, who find out about his good deed at just the right moment. Since Denzel tromps throughout the move like the world is his oyster, and he knew his friend had the stash and where it was, I can't see why he didn't just off him, take the dough, and make it look like a deal gone bad. That way he wouldn't have at least ten other people involved who knew what he was doing, but then we wouldn't have had the story to this movie, either.The only line in the entire film that showed any insight or depth was when Denzel talks about how it's not about good or bad or right or wrong, but what you know and what you can prove. That cynical statement about our justice system could have been made the central theme of this movie, instead of Denzel and Ethan chasing each other around South Central.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought the bad guy was "too bad". Maybe there are people in the world who are that bad, but I don't find movies about them very interesting. I did not see any complexity in his character at all, and no redeeming qualities - the witch in Wizard of Oz was more likeable.As for the "good cop", he was just a greedy wimp. (SPOILERS) Sure, he turns down the buttload of money he's offered after the bad guy kills the drug dealer... but does that matter? Through most of the movie he puts up with or participates in illegal activities "against his will" - why? - because he wants to work his way up the ladder to a better job - why? - for the MONEY. "You should see the houses THEY live in" he says to his wife in the first scene. He acts so righteously offended by the bad cop right from the beginning, but goes along and goes along because he wants to attain his career goals. Some moral high-ground, huh?The bad cop was bad right from the start - the rookie had no reason to respect him, take his advice, or want to follow in his footsteps. I much prefer corruption movies where the bad guy's evilness slowly leaks out into the story, and where the rookie at first has reason to trust and respect him. The moral dilemma and internal conflict of having to change your view of someone is just much more interesting than knowing from the start that he's a jerk.So the two main characters just left me feeling nothing except annoyed.Then, there's the plot. I found too many things hard to swallow - that Washington's character was so very very bad and had apparently never been caught at it (yeah, there are corrupt cops, but this was too much), that he would involve the rookie in THAT MUCH corruption on his first day as a "test" of his character, that Washington's character thought even for a second that the rookie would just buy into his bulls*** and cover for him... I thought it was contrived and basically made no sense.The only thing that I *did* like plot-wise was the most contrived thing of all - the young woman the rookie saved turning out to be the cousin of the man who later would have killed him. Now THAT'S a contrivance I would have liked if the rest of the movie hadn't annoyed me so much. Sure, it's totally unrealistic, but at least it had some sort of point to make.All in all, it kept me awake and provided minimal entertainment. It was interesting seeing Washington being a bad man. But I wouldn't see it again or recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Spoilers*I watched Training Day a few days ago and thought the movie had some major plot holes and wasn't impressed by DW's perfomance."King Kong aint got nothing on me?" come on... I can think of other characters he's played that were much better than his Training Day character...Alonzo.I was wondering why the whole elaborate set-up for Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) to take the fall. Why didn't Alonzo simply shoot Scott Glenn, take his money, and leave the body until someone discovered it and conclude Glenn killed by robbers?Also, after when they were in Glenn's house, they dug a big hole in his kitchen to get the money that had been buried in a chest. They cut through the floor with an ax and dug it out. After Alonzo shoots his partner, they radio the dispatch to tell them an officer has been shot.This would've gotten an immediate response from all cops in the area. How did they fill in the hole in the kitchen so quickly and replace the floor boards they chopped up witht he ax? If they didn't do that and the hole was still uncovered..it seems like a homicide detective would have been somewhat curious about it and would have asked questions.Plus, they tell the officers that Hoyt was shot Glenn and the cops don't take him in for questioning and let him continue on his shift. It's seems like he would've at the very least been taken off his shift until internal affairs investigated the shooting.Next, Alonzo leaves Hoyt with some gangsters, assuming they were going to kill hoyt. How did Alonzo plan to explain that to his supervisors? He abandons his partner on the first day, his partner disappears and no one would think twice about it?Police Chief"Detective Alonzo, your partner is missing, he never clocked out of his shift and his wife and family want to know what happened to him. Can you tell us what happened to your partner and why you never reported his disappearance to us?"Detective Alonzo"Chief, I went to see some Mexican gangsters with Hoyt, while we were still on duty. When I was ready to leave, Hoyt was playing cards with the gangsters and drinking with them. He was having such a good time that I decided to let him stay. I didn't think it was important and that's why I never reported it to anyone."I guess I could go on and on about this movie but I was extremely disappointed with it and expected more out of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If I could only use one word to describe this movie: BADASS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Training Day is a brutal, violent film. But it is a film that doesn't hold anything back and forces the viewer to take it as it is. There are no clichés, nothing feels sappy, and it is a hard experience for the viewer at times to see the reality of the streets of L.A. and its corruption depicted in this movie.Powered by an amazing performance from Denzel Washington, the man's performance was 100% Oscar-worthy. It is one of those few performances that it doesn't feel like the man's acting, it just seems natural and you think that he IS the character. Ethan Hawke is not bad at all in the film, he's actually pretty good but he lives in the shadow of Denzel's performance in this movie.A lot of people complain about the ending, for some reason. I can only say Training Day is as real as a film can get: it is bloody, brutal, nasty and I love every minute of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top-notch 20th century gangster movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With its authenticity "Training Day" shows us that "the street" can yank anyone to the gangster street life, a life that only the most callous killers and criminals are living. It's simple - carry a gun if you want, but it will not help you. There is a rule saying - "It does not matter what you know, It matters what you can prove".This gangster-policeman relationship kind of movie is brought to us by the director Antoine Fuqua, who also after 13 years would bring to life "The Equalizer". Written by David Ayer (one of the screenplay producers of the Oscar winning movie "U-571") "Training Day" unfolds the story of Det. Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington) - an LAPD narcotics officer, and his colleague - the rookie Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke). Alonzo and Jake have to deal with the tough street gangsters and the drugs that they are spreading all over LA."The street", as shown here, can change everyone for less than 24 hours. Once becoming a member of one of the street gangs you can never go back again. There are no law rules on the street - the guns are the law.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gritty, thoughtful police drama with an outstanding performance by Denzel Washington</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This unflinchingly realistic police drama takes viewers into the dangerous world of drug dealing that runs rampant in the streets of South Central Los Angeles and where is a subject on nearly every street of the area. Along the side, this film also gives viewers an inside look at the corruption of law enforcement and police brutality that remains a major issue in the United States today. The film places Ethan Hawk in the role of Jake Hoyt, a rookie cop who ventures on a 24- hour 'ride along' with veteran narcotics detective Alonzo Harris (played by Denzel Washington). Cruising through the dirty, crime-ridden streets of Los Angeles, Harris pulls Hoyt in the grueling of crime and drug-busting. However, when Alonzo's lines between right and wrong become blurred and his bold decisions put Hoyt's life at risk, Hoyt soon find himself in a dangerous game of survival. This film is directed by Antoine Faqua and written by David Ayer who would later go on write and direct many other cop dramas. Not many films portray the harrowing reality of the law enforcement as realistically as this one does, and this film does not shy away from the dark side of police corruption as we watch the characters venture through the sordid streets of the South Los Angeles suburbs and experience the violence and gang activity that consumes these neighborhood. Thanks to Denzel Washington who breaks his usual good- guy typecasting to portray a narcotics cop who suffers significant ethical dilemmas and brings his first-time partner in jeopardy. The intensity of his character drives the plot in a long run, to the crescendo in the last half hour of the film At one point during the training, his character busts two teenagers for possession in marijuana with phencycldine, upon taking it he smokes it and then offers it to Ethan Hawke's character who in response smokes it. This scene immediately leaves you questioning on who his character is and leaves you with thoughts that this character could be up to no good. Denzel Washington gives an outstanding performance as Detective Alonzo Harris. Throughout the film, Washington is just drowned out in his role with such powerful effort. It is quite astonishing to see him play in a villainous role so well after watching him play in good-guy roles in his other works. Ethan Hawke does a magnificent job here too. He is shown to be very committed in what is arguably the best role of his career, and his talent shines bright here.Training Day is a highly entertaining movie and a textbook addition to the police drama genre. Complete with mesmerizing performances by Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke, powerful directing by Antoina Faqua, and a spectacular screenplay by David Ayer; Training Day definitely hits home.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Training Day is a good movie and I think it is a good movie for all of the right reasons.The plot is very interesting.It follows two LAPD narcotics detectives named Jake Hoyt and Alonzo Harris over a twenty four-hour in the gang neighborhoods of North West and South Central Los Angeles and they ride around the block, do some cop work and this leads into a very good and intense ending.The acting is amazing in this film.Ethan Hawke plays Jake Hoyt and he did incredible in all of his scenes, including that fight he had with Denzel Washington at the end of the film and I am surprised that he did not win the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his part. He deserved that Oscar and I will forever be mad that he did not get it.The real credit is given to the man himself, Denzel Washington, who I reviewed as The Equalizer in the 2014 film based on the television series of the same name.Denzel Washington plays the villain Alonzo Harris really amazing and his performance was just top-notch and very amazing and not only he played that part amazingly, he did a great job with the dialogue written for him at the end when all of the gang members turn against him after letting Ethan Hawke's character got home and the scene where he was shot by Russian gang members just had me wanting to cry the first time I saw this film.He won the Oscar for Best Actor and he was spectacular in the role and it is a departure from his usual roles that he played and he would play Frank Lucas in the 2007 film American Gangster and he did a really amazing job.The rest of the cast, nothing more to say about them, but they all do great, especially Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg in the screen time that they have.The music by Mark Mancina is just amazing and I listen to the musical score and soundtrack for this film on my phone and it sounds really good in the film and I could have not been more happier.Overall, I love Training Day.

		<fullReview>One thing I will say about this film is that it has some of the best one liners ever put on film. I would say that you would have to watch this film for the one liners that Alonzo (Played by Denzel Washington) spills.The film as itself is a lot of fun but it still has some flaws. Overall praise has to go to Denzel Washington, who is loving every minute of his performance as the villain. He does all the villain clichés, smiling, laughing and ranting, things you just love to see villains do. However, they don't just make him bad, the brilliant writing also makes him a complex character, giving a twisted morale compass. You actually question his sanity because, despite all the evil things he does, he actually thinks he is doing the right thing, its performances like this that remind me why Denzel Washington is my favorite actor and can do almost no wrong.The film also does well at setting atmosphere, you really get a sense of these places in fact I even read that they had filmed in areas such as Compton. The appearances by Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg were awesome and well place and I loved the Latino gangsters that Hoyte has to face at the end of the film, one of them played by Cliff Cirtus who I believe can play any ethnic group.However, I do have one issue with the film and that is its secondary character, Hoyte, played by Ethan Hawke. Don't get me wrong, I will take nothing away from Hawke's performance but they made the character of Hoyte so bland and predictable, the goody goody, always does right and I know thats what they were going for but they could have made him more interesting, maybe he is tempted by Alonzo and almost turns to the dark side or at the end of the film, something to make him more complex, particularly after all he has gone through.Overall, if you like cop/crime thrillers then you will definitely enjoy this, if you want something with a lot of depth this may not be for you but hey, watch and make your own conclusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different Denzel - and how</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't be misled by the innocuous title of this 2001 movie - for Los Angeles cop Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) on his first day with the narcotics division, this is going to be a day from hell. And don't be caught out by the casting of Denzel Washington as Detective Alonzo Harris, Jake's mentor-cum-nemesis - this is is not the Washington whom we first met in 1987 in "Cry, Freedom" who has since played a whole series of good guy roles. In this movie, he is one real m****r f****r. And, if you don't like this sort of language, don't watch the film because it is replete with four- and six-letter expletives as well as street language that is sometimes hard to follow .Writer David Ayer and director Antoine Fuqua have provided a violent and bloody narrative that grips from start to finish. Both Washington and Hawke are rarely off the screen and Washington in particular gives a capital performance. In fact, both actors attracted Oscar nominations with Washington deservedly winning for Best Actor for his bravura turn. The Alonzo Harris character was loosely inspired by the disgraced LAPD officer Rafael Perez who served two prison terms totalling six years. If he ever saw the movie, he would feel that it could have been a whole lot worse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is about the worst first day at work ever. Must have been a bad year for Best Actor for DW to get Best Actor by giving a "Jack Nicholsonesque" over the top performance as a crooked narco cop who trains his new partner, Ethan Hawke, on his first day on the job. Ethan Hawke is a serious cop (and he plays the role well). Even so, his trainer, Denzel Washinton, manages to get him to, or I should say the "script" manages to get him to, on their first day together as partners, smoke PCP, take responsibility for a murder, release two rapists, shake down a drug dealer in a wheelchair, drink beer and hard liquor on the job, conduct an illegal search, and more. It defies believability. The core of the movie seems to be a vehicle for DW to be the big angry, over the top bossy, black guy, and call his new rookie "nigger" for the first fifteen minutes of the movie. There was no suspense, no tension, just an angry black man yelling at his new white rookie for two hours. Nothing here for me. Why this rates as anything Oscar worthy for anyone is a mystery, more of a mystery than anything in this film... If you have two hours of your life you don't know what to do with don't waste them here. Take Defensive Driving or something...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was eager to see this film, having missed its theatrical release. I wanted to see Denzel Washington's Oscar-winning performance. Unfortunately, it was a waste of 2 hours.Ugly scenes pile up one after the other in this film, one more repulsive than the other. The film makes a weak gesture at introducing an interesting moral dilemma: is it possible to fight the evil of drug-dealing while holding onto one's own sense of morality? But ultimately, it has nothing complex or thoughtful to say about that dilemma. The best performance in the film is actually Ethan Hawke's, a character torn by conflicting impulses. Hawke does a fine job of conveying that inner turmoil. Washington's performance is mostly just showing off, but then his character is largely a cartoon character. The Oscar is a make-up for other better performances that have gone unrewarded.And isn't it enlightening that all of the film's people of color are despicable drug dealer or corrupt cops while the film's conscience is the white cop?I was generous; I rated the movie a 3.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oscar material? Yeah, right...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Training Day" is a third rate cop drama/thriller with an uninteresting plot and not one believable character. The movie couldn't be further removed from reality. If this was supposed to be a brainless action movie it wouldn't bother me that much, but since this flick has won an Oscar one can't be so forgiving.It's good to see Denzel Washington not preaching about American History or Human Rights for once, but that's not saying he can't give any speeches here. He still finds more than his share of opportunities to go on and on about the tough life on the street, what it means to be a cop, etc., etc. His character is a joke. The things he is saying all day are so obviously BS, that no one would buy it. Ethan Hawke's character is ridiculously naive and/or stupid to fall for Washington's excuses every time he screwed up again. Good cop/bad cop are just two of the stereotypes in the movie. Add to this countless "ghetto nigga"-clichés, a peaceful drug dealer who wants to quit the business and start a new life, and a bunch of brutal but honorable "gangstaz". This is no portrayal of reality, it's a kid's (or an ignorant white guy's) imagination of life in the drug squad.What's worst is that the movie isn't even entertaining for the first hour or so. It's not until the third act, when we've finally accepted the stupid nature of the movie, that it gets a bit thrilling. It's still implausible and annoying how all of a sudden every character turns against the bad guy. I can't figure out how this shallow script convinced anybody. There are better dramas and there are way better cop movies out there. This "Training Day" is better soon forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Denzel's brilliant acting on display</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In his Academy Award Winning Performance,as best Actor.The movie, as the title suggests, follows a single day in the life of rookie cop Jake Hoyt (Hawk) as he is subject to a single day of evaluation by a senior, decorated police narcotics officer Alonzo Harris (Washington) to see if he has what it takes to be a 'narc'. Almost immediately Hoyt is placed on the back foot, constantly caught off guard by Alonzo's nature, his ability to switch between a cold, no- nonsense street-wise player, a genuinely caring and good intentioned leader, and occasionally jovial companion. From their first encounters though, where Hoyt tells Harris he will do "anything you want me to do", the situations Hoyt is taken into become more and more morally ambiguous, from the simple use of excessive force to outright illegal activity, forcing Hoyt to decide which side Harris is truly on, whether to trust him, or whether Hoyt is the unwitting centerpiece of a huge and complex web of lies and set- ups in order for Harris to for fill his own sinister motives. This is a must watch! The one thing that made this film really shine was the performance by Mr. Washington. To me, a good actor is someone who just IS a character...if it isn't obvious that they are acting than they are doing a good job. That was the case with Washington. He just was Alonzo. Every pantomime, every word, every glance was performed masterfully. Did Mr. Washington deserve his Oscar? Absolutely. 200%. Some people say, "not Oscar material" and I must wonder, what film...what performance were they watching?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely adore this movie! My favourite Antoine Fuqua film by far. I absolutely love the tensity in Denzel's character, and at the the same time his emotion. Denzel makes this movie. He makes it a success, with some of the best acting I have ever seen on screen. Ethan Hawke also does a great job with the Innocent cop, but Denzel just steals the show. With high tensity and action packed police drama, this is definitely a film to see! Furthermore, there is disturbing dialogue within the film. But once you get past that and get into the world of good cop, bad cop you get into the mind of how Ethan Hawkeyes character is feeling and how he is thinking, and how he is being played for a fool by Denzel. Truly a masterpiece in the making!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Training Day, Denzel Washington pulls out all the stops and delivers a performance. Written by David Ayer and directed by Anthony Fuqua, Training Day grabs you. While the ending suffers from an overload of coincidences and contrivances, the movie still packs a wallop as it asks the question: Can honorable men deal with the worst of humanity on a daily basis without being corrupted?Co-starring Ethan Hawke plays Jake Hoyt, a Los Angeles cop out to become detective. To that end, he tries to join an elite squad led by Alonzo Harris (Washington), an undercover officer legendary for his effectiveness. The hitch is that Jake has only one day to prove his worthiness to Alonzo. Even within his drug haze, the boy soon realizes that Alonzo is not merely an officer that plays fast and loose with the rules - he's a full-fledged rogue cop willing to do anything to get what he wants.Some of the most harrowing moments take place in a neighborhood completely under the control of thugs. Alonzo lives there, convinced he is respected by his brutal neighbors due to his ability to work the system. In fact, they loathe the man and put up with him solely because of his badge and gun.Taking place over the course of a single day, Training Day builds momentum and never backs off. The film creates and maintains a sense of genuine danger. As the proceedings grow ever more dark, you begin to wonder if the key players can possibly survive the day. Until the last 15 minutes, that is, when the story wraps up too quickly and in far too pat a fashion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Drawn Line of Corruption Crossed!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the next 24hrs you will learn about the streets and you will be asking yourself the same question over and over... Is there some kind of code for the police? And in this case when it comes to Narcs. Is there a code and a drawn line for how much you use that you are the law as an excuse to actually break the law? What do you do if somebody crossing that line... Training Day is one of the best and hardest film i have ever seen. When it comes to the violence, blood and such yeah their might be a lot of movies that is wilder on that point. But Training Day is a very cold and also violence experience that leaves you with the code questions and a wild, mixed, weird feeling because you know that almost all of what you've just seen? Is real life and probably happens on a daily basis. Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) is from Valley Patrol, he is married and he's got a daughter an infinite child to be 100% correct. Finally the opportunity to get higher in the police ranges has come which is in a narc unit run by Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington) And Jake has now 24Hrs to show what he is made of. Driving around with Alonzo does that Jake quiet fast finds out that something isn't like it is suppose to be and more than one episode or incident is not handle/played by the book. Soon he is sucked into a world that he didn't ask to be apart of, with dirty cops, tough decisions trapped in lots of dirt where only battle and yourself is your chance to get out! Master directed by Antoine Fuqua and an amazing screenplay/story-line by David Ayer with such an amazing cast where everybody from extras to the leads delivers real solid action through the whole movie. And the film shooting locations which is real ghettos. Number two of my favorite films, if you like/want to be really entertained, if you like realism, cold Action/Thriller Training Day will not disappoint you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing plot and action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion in Training Day and American Gangster Denzel gave the best performance as a villain. There are some clichés like "I didn't sign up for this...". The car doesn't start when they are in danger, even though it's a super muscle car. Seriously, how is it possible that he saved that girl (clearly not 14 years old) from rape and it happens to be the cousin of that anger gang member, who was about to kill Ethan Hawke. The end is great but, when you get shot in the bottom, it hurts, the least thing you do is start threatening others.This movie is great, the plot is great, even with all the flaws, for an action movie, the end is satisfying and the performance of denzel is very good. 10 - excellent</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke both cast against type in this excellent cop movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's easy to look at Training Day as just another action/crime movie with the bad cop corrupting the rookie and dragging him into his world. With Denzel Washington turning in his best performance as the villain and Ethan Hawke as the idealistic, likable and heroic good guy, this is anything but a routine movie. Both actors are excellent in their roles, and Antoine Fuqua does an excellent job bringing a gritty no holds barred crime movie to the screen.LAPD Officer Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) is an idealistic, honest, good hearted rookie who has one day to prove himself that he has what it takes in the Narcotics Division. Jake Hoyt is very eager to make a good impression and earn his place as well as seeing this role as a stepping stone to making Detective. Detective Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington in his Academy Award winning role as Best Actor) is a 13 year highly decorated veteran of the Los Angeles Police Department and has a feared and respected reputation amongst all police officers, friends, criminals, and enemies alike. Alonzo is assigned to showing Jake the seedy underbelly of Los Angeles as well as taking Jake under his wing as a mentor. However, Alonzo Harris is a corrupt police officer to the point where the line is blurred between cop and criminal, right and wrong, good and bad, and what is legal and illegal. Alonzo Harris is not above physically intimidating and assaulting suspects, as well as stealing, robbing, assaulting, planting evidence, and setting up a murder to look like a justified shooting. Though Alonzo Harris justifies this as all in the good of taking bad guys off the street or in his words which he lives by on the streets of Los Angeles, "To protect the sheep you gotta catch the wolf, and it takes a wolf to catch a wolf." Alonzo Harris is also extremely arrogant and selfish who will do anything for money as well as caring very little for anyone else but himself.Once Jake Hoyt witnesses Alonzo Harris' unconventional methods of enforcing the law through his own brand of street justice in which he makes up his own rules, Jake finds that it may be too late to save himself and his career. Alonzo threatens Jake by making him smoke drugs at gunpoint otherwise face being thrown out of Narcotics Division. Jake also witness many immoral acts committed by Alonzo to the point where he questions his own conscience and whether Alonzo is a police officer wanting to enforce street justice or just a criminal wanting to commit acts beneficial to himself.Denzel Washington is well known for portraying a variety of good guys on the screen in movies such as Glory, Philadelphia and The Hurricane. Cast against type in Training Day, he does an excellent job portraying the villainous, down and dirty Alonzo Harris. There was a lot of controversy when Denzel Washington won the 2001 Best Actor Academy Award for his role when Russell Crowe was strongly tipped for his role in A Beautiful Mind. Regardless, Denzel Washington thoroughly deserved to win for his role. This is definitely Denzel Washington's best role in his entire career.Ethan Hawke was previously known for his roles in Dead Poets Society, Alive, Reality Bites, and The Newton Boys. Ethan Hawke, who also deserved to be nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award, comes of age in his role as the idealistic and honest rookie Jake Hoyt who is very eager to make a good impression but finds himself in over his head in an unfamiliar world. Although Jake Hoyt makes several mistakes which end up almost costing him his career as well as his life, he proves himself to be a capable police officer when he saves a teenage girl from being sexually assaulted by two homeless men, which later saves his life. To date, this is Ethan Hawke's best role.Other actors which appear in Training Day include Scott Glenn (The Silence of the Lambs) as a local drug dealer Roger, Tom Berenger (Platoon) as District Attorney Stan Gursky, Harris Yulin (Scarface) as Detective Doug Roselli, rapper Snoop Dogg as wheelchair bound drug dealer named Blue, New Zealand actor Cliff Curtis (Three Kings) as a thug named Smiley, pop star Macy Gray as the wife of a drug dealer, Eva Mendes in an early role as Alonzo's mistress Sara, and as part of Alonzo's corrupt crew of police officers rapper Dr. Dre as Paul (who comes across as a thug than a police officer), and Nick Chinlund (Con Air) as Tim.Training Day certainly left a long lasting impression of me when I first saw this movie back in 2002 which will never be forgotten. In what could have been a routine action movie, becomes an intense, gritty and compelling cop drama. Excellent job all round, Denzel Washington earns his well deserved critical acclaim as the bad guy Alonzo Harris, and Jake Hoyt also deserves acclaim for his role as Jake Hoyt. It's also great to see Antoine Fuqua go on to direct greater movies such as Tears of the Sun, Shooter and The Equalizer. Screenwriter David Ayer has also carved out his own career following this movie and has also made his mark as a director with Street Kings, End of Watch, and Fury.Training Day is an excellent movie which is definitely highly recommended.9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Star Shines in Training Day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In his Oscar-winning performance, Denzel Washington inhabits the role of the street-tough narcotics cop to such an extent that you forget that, prior to this movie, Mr. Washington had begun to be stereo-typed as the perpetual good guy. No one ever denied that Mr. Washington could act, but by casting against type (as is often the case) people finally noticed the depth and breadth of his acting skills.Of course, in order to truly shine, an actor needs other elements to be in place as well. And Mr. Washington has them all here. His co-star, Ethan Hawke, does an excellent job of providing the innocent counterbalance so that Mr. Washington looks even tougher by comparison. The action sequences are well shot and grittily realistic. The plot twists, while not truly shocking, are unique enough to keep the movie's tension at a high level throughout.To see my other reviews, please visit: https://nomorewastedmovienights.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enthralling story with remarkable performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film follows Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) on his 'Training Day' with Det. Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington) Jake has 24 hours to show Alonzo he has what it takes to do whats necessary to get the job done. But Alonzo's methods are questionable and sometimes illegal. This film was amazing. The acting was fantastic, to watch this straight arrow cop have to do things every bone in his body is telling him not to, was completely enthralling. At times Ethan's performance reminded me Bryan Cranston in Breaking Bad just the way he carried and handled himself in certain situations was superb. High praise indeed from me. Denzel Washington gives an Oscar worthy performance. To see somebody switch from borderline criminal to genuinely caring mentor and leader, was simply incredible. The story has twists right to the very end and what makes this film so special and separates the good films from the great. Is that you understand what Ethan's going through, how he sees Denzel's character, how he's conflicted between knowing whats right and what he wants. This is due to the marvellous work of Director Antoine Fuqua, the acting of the two lead roles and the script! The script was sensational it really was, it was dark and gritty throughout keeping a harsh realistic aspect to it. The cinematography was great, some of the shots of the gang driven streets of LA were beautifully done. Overall I loved this film and thought it was done incredibly well with outstanding acting, script that was directed really well. A 9/10 from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Impression- This is a very well written film about a man who is taken under the wings of a sketchy and untrustworthy cop. I really enjoyed the dynamic between Ethan Hawke and Denzel Washington, and I'm glad they both got nominations for their work here. After seeing Hawke in the 'Before' trilogy I know he can do dramatic roles and it goes without saying that Washington can act. The only thing I was worried about was that this movie may have that over the top action like some movies similar to this do. I was not disappointed.Praise- Its a high octane thrill ride from the beginning till end. I cant say I didn't predict Washington setting Hawke up, but its still for the most part un-expecting and very interesting. It was one of the first times Washington played a complete bad-ass on screen, and he played it well. I totally bought into Hawke's character being frightened by Washington and him daring to do all the crazy stuff that he is "supposedly required to do". There were also some great cameos by great actors playing small roles. Tom Berenger and Eva Mendes are barely present, but their presence is felt. This movie also has a high re-watch-ability factor. Particularly for the banter that goes on between the lead characters.Complaints- To be honest I felt that some things were unrealistic. Such as the bullets in Alonzo's car. You mean to tell me that nobody at the crime scene happened to notice the bullets in the rear view windshield? I also find it hard to believe that for over 10 years this man got away with going outside the law to put away criminals. But it is a movie, so anyway....Good movie overall with a memorable dynamic between the leads. Very pleased with the outcome.8.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great urban thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "Training Day" Ethan Hawke plays Hoyt, a rookie cop on his first 24-hour training day with the L.A.P.D. narcotics division. Denzel Washington plays veteran Alonzo Harris whose methods seem questionable, to say the least. Harris argues that one has to become a wolf to take down a wolf. Will Hoyt make it through the day alive, let alone uncorrupted?"Training Day" had a lukewarm reception at the box office the first weekend of its release in 2001, but the profits steadily increased for the next six weeks as word-of-mouth spread. The greatness of "Training Day" is not simply due to the intriguing story and excellent writing, but also the superb casting. Hawke is perfect as the naive, but ambitious rookie and Washington is nothing short of stunning as Alonzo Harris, the latter ranking with the best performances in cinematic history, like Jon Voight's Manny in "Runaway Train" or Robert Duvall's Col. Kilgore in "Apocalypse Now," etc., etc.As the training day continues Alonzo's methodology becomes increasingly dubious and you can just imagine Hoyt responding, "I... don't... see... any... method... at... all... Sir." How can anyone withstand the temptations he faces and not give in (and I don't mean the drugs)? Needless to say, the film scores high marks on the moral conundrum front.There's one obviously contrived element but that's par for the course with movies and it could've been worse. Of course, the action and thrills are amped-up, but the tone is thankfully realistic.Additional actors include Scott Glenn, Tom Berenger, Eva Mendes, Charlotte Ayanna, Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre.The film was shot in L.A. and runs 122 minutes.FINAL WORD: "Training Day" is an excellent urban thriller with an ultra-captivating performance by Washington. It's fittingly raw and brutal, so stay away if you don't think you can stomach it.GRADE: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is about the first day of Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke), a young soon to be narcotics officer, at work. It is actually a journey into the real world of the streets of LA as it is presented by prestigious detective Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). Hoyt soon realizes that Alonzo's methods are far from legal. All through his training day, he finds himself having to choose between his ethic and what Alonzo tells him what he should do, because the real world is a "jungle", and one has to be a "wolf" to survive in it. So, according to Alonzo, an officer could co-operate with drug dealers, steal money and even murder as long as he succeeds in his primary mission. Hoyt never seems to agree with this and when he finds out that the training is in fact a setup, he has to come after Alonzo. In the end Alonzo dies as a wolf because in this kind of game there is always a greater wolf.This was a really interesting movie. It shows a completely different aspect than the ideal world of police in the US as it appears in many other movies or TV shows. There is also an excellent performance by Denzel Washington. He surely deserved his Oscar award for that one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Training Day" tells the story of young cop Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) assigned to Narcotics, partnering veteran cop Alonzo Harris (Washington) on his first day. As he tries to improve Hoyt's "street IQ", Alonzo appears to push the boundaries of what is acceptable policing to their absolute limits, forcing Hoyt to question both his own motives and those of his superior. The film is all about asking yourself one question: how far would you go in order to do the right thing? And without trying to sound righteous, this is a question that all of us must ask ourselves from time to time. Do I do the right thing and refuse or capitulate and go with the flow? It is this theme of morality that lifts "Training Day" beyond the mire of most cop movies. The other huge bonus is the performance of the two leads - both Washington and Hawke are brilliant, utterly compelling and believable in their respective roles. However, I think that the Oscar went to Washington for two reasons. One: he is playing totally against type. Washington isn't known for playing characters with a prominent dark side, let's be honest. Two: Russell Crowe didn't deserve a second Oscar after "Gladiator". Hawke, I feel, was probably a little peeved at not getting as much recognition as this is easily the best film I've seen him in. But Washington is at his scene-stealing best, especially towards the end. Most other actors only appear for short periods of time (Dr Dre, Macy Gray, Snoop Dogg, etc) and don't really contribute that much.Unlike most other cop movies, "Training Day" feels a much more realistic picture than others in its stable. LA isn't the playground of the rich and famous that we expect in the movies - it's a scorching hot-bed of drugs, gang violence and simmering racial tension. And it looks great. This is a wonderfully shot film, drawing you into it's shady suburbs. For the first time in years, Los Angeles looks and feels like a real city and not just a main street full of skyscrapers. For all it's accuracy, I confess that some of the "hood" dialogue lost me (I'm a pasty white boy, can't help it!) and this marred the ending slightly, which did feel slightly contrived and hurried to fit the time frame. What it did do was leave me wanting more and I haven't seen a film in a while that left me like that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Training Day Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Antoine Fuqua did Training Day justice in this crime drama. The story starts as a rookie narcotics officer Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) first day with a corrupt veteran detective Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). Jake is stunned by the methods that Det. Alonzo uses in his daily routine. Because Jake wants to become narcotics office he follows Alonzo instructions. As the story unfolds it is found out that Alonzo is in debt with the Russian mob and they have a deadline on when he must pay them back or he will be killed. This causes Jake to be thrust into Alonzo world of using drugs, stealing, and even killing. This film is centered on the theme good versus evil. Jake is the naive rookie narcotics officer trying to bring down the overbearing corrupt veteran detective Alonzo Harris. The cinematography was great in showing this. The camera angles and lighting were great for the fact that it showed the desperate measure that Alonzo was willing to through in order to pay back the money and save his life. A few scenes stood out as very powerful scenes in the movie. In the beginning of the movie Alonzo with a gun forced Jake to smoke PCP. Little did Jake know that this was part of a big plan Alonzo created to get out of debt. The use of slow motion was awesome as Jake smoked the PCP. There was also the use of different colors in the lighting. It showed how zoned out Jake was. Another scene in Training Day was where Alonzo was cornered by the Russian mob there was misty fog. The lighting was very dim and then the gun shots rang out. Hundreds of bullets were let off. This was a very powerful scene in the movie.This is a great must see movie. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic crime film with legendary performances.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Temptation and falling down the wrong path can end a long streak of devastation and horrendous outcomes. "Training Day" reflects a day in the lives of two L.A. cops who both lead into two different directions. Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) is a new police officer with a great heart and string conscience who starts his first day with experienced and dirty police officer Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). Alonzo takes Jake into the brutal and corrupt crime world of L.A., which causes Jake to question his morals, his opinion on Alonzo, and what line in life he will be headed for. The two are faced with many experiences that are both used in a way to train them, but not all experiences will be responded to wisely. Denzel Washington gives an absolutely gritty and flawless performance who swears better and yells louder than any actor out their. His "gangsta" attitude is not overdone or forced at all, and provides entertainment from just watching this lion roar. Ethan Hawke is also brilliant as a wide-eyed cop turned determined warrior who always seems like a new character in every scene. Director Antoine Fuqua portrays the dark world of L.A. perfectly with amazing action sequences and a setting that looks like hell. Filled with criminals, drugs, and violence, you see some of the most disturbing landscapes in the history of film that will make you nervous from just watching. David Ayer's script is a monumental work of art. Filled with rich dialog and interesting characters, he takes a simple plot and turns it into a moral compass for doing what's right and not giving in. "Training Day" is one of the greatest cop films of all time and can be used as a template for making and developing a story about good and bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Deed goes Unpunished</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this Modern Film Noir classic, Denzel Washington is Detective Alonzo Harris, who runs an elite narcotics task force. Ethan Hawkes is Jake Hoyt, newly "recruited" to it and even eager to join.Hoyt immediately sees that Harris is not your run of the mill detective, he appears to have a unique style of "detecting" - Which involves all kinds of bullying and fear tactics- And he does not limit this to suspects, he uses them on Hoyt as well.In reality Harris has a specific agenda. Hoyt goes along with it but each activity of their day raises the red flag level higher and higher.Harris actually rules over a small section of hell, a gang-ridden neighborhood called "The Jungles" where his son and girlfriend Sara (Eva Mendes) live. Harris expressly instructs Hoyt never to enter "The Jungles" by himself. Harris appears to be the "benevolent protector" of this neighborhood and we get that impression as well. Remember, this is all appearances- This whole film depends on our "First Impressions" and how they are wrong.We get to meet many of Harris' "friends" and acquaintances, who are either "retired" drug pushers who have served their time (Scott Glenn as "Roger") or Judges and DA's (Harris Yulin and Tom Berenger and Doug Rosselli and Stan Gursky respectively). In fact, the two categories of people are interconnected in some way through Harris. And Harris plays them like finely tuned instruments.And now Harris has chosen Jake Hoyt. The only question we can ask as the body count rises is "Why"?Alonzo likes Hoyt because he has a good eye for what is happening around him, this is proved when Hoyt sees a rape happening in the corner of his eye, jumps out of the car and takes on the two gang-bangers who are piling on a hapless girl. In the process she loses her wallet and Jake picks it up: File for future use.This film puts a new slant on the words "Patsy" and "Double/Triple/Quadruple Cross".Washington plays this as if he's the guy, just like he does any other role, Hawkes follows suit with the "Innocent Look" that hides the fact that he's seen more than he lets on. Look for the likes of Dr Dre and Snoop Dogg, and veteran character actors Nick Chinlund and Raymond Cruz- Several real gang-bangers from the LA neighborhood called "The Jungles" were used as well.Antoine Fuqua mimics Tony Scott's style of directing with a great score by Mark Mancina peppered with some decent Rap tracks and other interesting music.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Instant Classic....haters gonna hate cause they want a heroic Denzel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are so many movie morons out there giving this Oscar winning performance at 1 star rating. Seriously?? A 1 star. That right there should tell the viewers how many haters are out there in movie land. I seriously don't know what they are thinking. They probably smoke PCP and got busted by crooked cops one too many times. I mean come on, Denzel won an Oscar for this movie. They don't just hand those out in cereal boxes. If I could give this movie an 11, I would, not because I want to boost the rating up, considering how obnoxiously low it is, but because it totally deserves an 11. There are so many amazing scenes in this movie. I don't want to give anything away, but just remember never give your sidearm to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review of "Training Day"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Training Day" is the story of Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke), an LAPD rookie who is looking to join a top-notch narcotics squad led by Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). Harris gives Hoyt one simple task; accompany him on a one-day ride-along where he must prove himself worthy of enlistment. Now from this point on the movie maintains a steady level of immense entertainment. The most noteworthy aspect of this movie is Denzel Washington's awesome, and Academy-Award Winning portrayal of Alonzo Harris; the rugged cop that has seemingly blurred the line between what is right and what isn't. His performance is as charismatic and imposing, as it is chilling and antagonizing. Every line that Washington delivered was either intensely funny or incredibly demented (but still funny). Which brings me to the script; "The Fast And The Furious" writer, David Ayer, delivers deeply provocative dialogue, as well as a compelling narrative that delves into some very insightful themes. The main theme of the movie, however, seems to be a blend of the "Crime doesn't pay" and "Power corrupts". So, in a sense, this story not only provides an incredibly accurate depiction of Inner-city LA, and exceedingly tense performances from its actors, but it may also serve as a cautionary tale - a cautionary tale that would not have been told sans the tremendous direction from Antoine Fuqua. Fuqua really did an impeccable job at delivering methodical, and aesthetic visuals. Fuqua also used his personal connections to access parts of LA that most people has never seen, in a sense, giving these parts of LA a voice. All in all, I found "Training Day" to be a steadily enjoyable film with great performances across the board, a wonderful story and script, and a solid direction. Remarkable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Denzel Washington at the very top of his game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every great actor has a defining performance. A performance that they will always be remembered for. De Niero's was Raging Bull , Pacino's was Scarface and Tom Hank's was Forest Gump. I believe Denzel Washington will always be remembered for his role as Detective Alonzo Harris in Training Day. This was the first time we had really seen Washington play a bad guy and you have to say , he took to it like a duck to water.Training Day is one of my favourite movies of all time. Movies don't get much grittier than this one. Director Antoine Fuqua pulls no punches when telling the story of a rookie cop's first day as detective. Ordinarily we would be raving about the brilliant performance of Ethan Hawke as Jake Hoyt but such is the personality and expertise of Denzel Washington , Hawke is overshadowed. The scene in the kitchen when he is left alone with the card playing gang members is a memorable one.This movie is 10 years old now and rarely has there been a film since to compare. Maybe The Departed has come closest.If you have never seen Training Day , do yourself a favour and go out and rent or buy this now. You wont regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where One That Supplies Various After-Thoughts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the end of the Oscar-winning movie "Training Day", one must ask, "where's the fine-line between doing what's right and the tactics one must go through in accomplishing it?" The hero in the story faces this enigmatic question from the moment he wakes up till he goes to sleep at night. Getting tired of the usual routine of parking tickets and arresting drunk drivers, Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) is young cop who has bigger aspirations into the police force. His ambition is crack down on bigger game like muggers, murderers, rapists and all other assorted weirdos plaguing the streets of Los Angeles. Thus he en-rolls in a training session with LAPD's finest narcotics detectives Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). During the process, young Jake learns more than he could chew when he discovers that detectives are not always prone to play-by-the-rules. Now he's in a position where he must decide if he wants to continue or if he wants to end it. The script is very well researched and very easy to grasp at. The dialogue is fast and furious and can be very witty at times. The pace is at its most convenient and though the action is wild it still offers room for plenty of mind-numbing twists. The only real flaw is that it gives a negative view of how unlawful the more advanced law enforcers can be. Those alleged people who protect us from crime are no more criminal than the people they arrest. In many true story films like "American Gangster" (another film Washington was in) proves my point. Denzel Washington deserved his Oscar here as he takes direct command in this movie. Even in the scenes where he's only mentioned by name, he still makes his presence felt. Denzel who can play good guy roles to near perfection does something that few actors and actresses can do: take a u-turn to type-casting and play a more tyrannical character. Ethan Hawke is equally impressive as a cop who must have long restless nights wondering how did he get himself into this mess and how to get out of it or if there is a way out of it. Sadly the supporting cast are mostly underdeveloped fillers with really no depth. For an action movie, the action is quite scarce. Most of the tense scenes are through the unsettling of Jake's inner conscious. The real story isn't about Jake's fight for what's right, but just the inner emotions that are screaming at Jake every moment he goes to work or training. You want thrill-seeking shooters rent "Lethal Weapon". The violent scenes are not for the squeamish and the gore is very believable. Sure it has plenty of action for the action-junkie, but it's also a very intelligent film to back up on as well. The theme is who should you trust, your soul or your mind? With stunning action scenes and a believable premise, this has got to be the best heart-warming thriller that will leave you stunned for a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Didn't like it when it first came out, now i remember why.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie when it first came out. I liked it a lot, the setting, the acting, the storyline was fantastic. But I never really got hooked on it like some people who still to this day, worship it like some kind of cult movie. Back then I didn't fully understood the ending, but I just didn't like it.Today I rented it to watch it again because even to this day, people still bring it up for comparison like with Street Kings, so it seems like it's set a standard for this particular genre. Well, now I remember why I didn't like the ending back then. It was unrealistic. Training Day is all about realism, all about the streets. So how the hell did Denzel get beaten by the rookie, who somehow survived getting killed by the 3 Latino's because one of them decided to grab his wallet before popping him, checks the wallet, sees the photo of the schoolgirl who somehow Jake had saved earlier that day. Unbelievable... and why didn't they just kill him? Why beat him up, why not choke him to death then take him to the bathtub. Won't leave much of a mess either.So Training Day is a very good movie with an Oscar-winning performance from Denzel, but the ending was typical Hollywood "good cop wins" ending. I guess I'm spoiled by the more modern films which are much more gritty and cruel. Jake (Ethan) wasn't just a good cop, he was NAIVE. I wish there was some kind of twist were Jake screws Denzel over at his own game, without having to resort to pure luck and inconceivable behavior from Denzel where he spares him on the rooftop rather than finishing him off. Unfortunately, unless Jake smartens up and "becomes the next Alonzo", he will get killed within two months if he goes on to pursue a Narc career. I just hope that for his sake, he gets a desk job or goes back to patrol.The ratings are fair, Training Day is good but nowhere near Top 250 good. The people who go all ga-ga over it and the ending are all teenagers, or equally naive people who still think good people have good things happen to them. Wrong... it's the SMART people that live. Jake was a liability to the force, even if he lives by the end of the movie, if he continues his do-goody ways, he will most likely get popped by some other bad cop. It's unfortunate but nowadays it requires a hell of a lot more than integrity to become, and survive as a good cop. You need to learn politics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Setting it straight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start out with this: This movie is amazing. End of story. I've read through the other reviews here, with people nitpicking the movie and finding minuscule "plot-holes" that are too stupid to be repeated here, and let me just say: WHO CARES?!?! Training Day is a great movie, and here's why: Denzel Washington. This film is the Greatest Actor in the World's shining achievement, and that alone makes it great. The character of Alonzo is one of the most menacing villains to hit the screen, and it's all because of Denzel. He BECAME Alonzo - almost everything that Denzel says in this movie is purely his creation (and I know - I've read the script.) For those of you who said Denzel was not Oscar-worthy in this film - you are extremely wrong. Just sit down and watch all the clever things he says (that he made up), all the subtle nuances. The scene in the car after they kill Roger is one of my favorite scenes of all time, because he goes from ghetto and evil to sweet and almost fatherly. The shift is brilliant, and Denzel pulls it off completely.Like I said above, picking out irrelevant "plot-holes" is pointless...every single plot-hole that was brought up in other reviews has a logical explanation, but people are so against this movie that they feel they need to find some need to tear it apart, and since they can't tear apart Denzel's amazing performance, they focus on minuscule plot elements. This movie is GREAT. It's a gripping tour into a side of the streets we aren't exposed to, and Alonzo is our guide. And try and tell me it isn't classic cinema when Alonzo, broken and beaten at the end, puts a cigarette into his mouth and says "I'm still winnin'...I can't lose..." Denzel's greatest performance, and if you know anything about his acting skills, that is SAYING something. Please don't turn away from this movie. It's worth your time, believe me.</fullReview>

When the film got underway, I found myself enthralled by the characters. The screenplay seemed to be set at just the right pace, and I was quite enjoying myself.Just when it was starting to get really good-BANG! Voila, we have ourselves John-Woo-esquire action sequences, ending all semblance of plausibility.The performances were great. Denzel Washington was terrific, of course, but the standout for me was Ethan Hawke's honest performance as the idealistic rookie.I'd say its worth a watch, just don't harbor any great expectations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would have given it one star, but I wanted to be fair just in case the second half of the movie that I failed to see after I stopped it and took it back to the video rental store was any good.This movie reads as a compendium of every sick thing you can think of to make a cop do, and it's done to the point where you almost have to laugh because you're waiting for the point where Denzel steals lollipops from babies and kicks widowed and terminally ill old ladies out of their homes for failing to pay rent just so they had their bases covered to show just how screwed up Denzel's character is. It even starts off with some really cheesy smart-ass talk about Denzel having his morning paper interrupted by Ethan Hawke and so Ethan had better have a really damn entertaining story to justify interrupting his "entertaining" newspaper.I dunno. I mean, if you are a real bad ass like Denzel's character who is bored to tears by Ethan Hawke's traffic stop story and you like to routinely shoot people and split their ill-begotten cash, what exactly do you find entertaining in the newspaper? The recipe section? The legal notices? Or is it just some dribble from a screenplay writer who was churning out a gun porn film that is one of the dime a dozen that hover somewhere above the straight to video benchmark, and are mostly forgettable as they are paint-by-numbers plots with a mildly interesting twist and stocked with at least one recognizable name? Pah! At the point that the Russians showed up, I was completely lost. I turned it off and went to bed.</fullReview>

Its probably more of my problem then it is the films but it never really caught my interest. I kept expecting the 2 characters to run into a big plot, but that never happened. It was more of an assortment of things, which I wasnt prepared for. And (I dont care if he won an Oscar for it) I really hated Denzel Washington's character. And not in the good way that they wanted me to (i.e. Tom Berenger's Sgt. Barnes in Platoon) but more just in an annoying "Oh my god, why wont you die already!?!" way (i.e. That spoon kid from Mimic). It just seemed like he was TRYING to win an Oscar for it. I never really believed him as the character (that was problem with Denzel in John Q too. But I did happen to like that movie a lot better then this one.)It did have some good movies. Some of the situations they got in were very cool and I did like Ethan Hawke's character and some of the other supporting cast. So it wasnt a total loss. But still I didnt like it much. I give it a 4, maybe a 4 and a half out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Shocking Farce</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing this movie I was convinced that the Academy Awards is fixed. Where do I begin with the absurd implausibility and script of this film? What starts off with a decent premise disintegrates about midway through the movie where the "rogue" cop can somehow get away with virtually everything. Denzel is a baddie that is not only untouchable, but seems to have been unnoticed by everyone, including the press and those who are not involved in the corrupt underground. The plot holes are gaping, especially where he leaves his partner to an uncertain fate for reasons unexplained and with an escape that gives a whole new meaning to the words "deus ex machina." The ending, where a white man can simply walk through a tough black neighborhood and then get their backing, was about as awkward as John Goodman on a tightrope. Worse is how Washington's partner is able to pull of physical feats that rival those of coming back from being pummeled more than Rockey and being able to leap tall buildings in a single bound *and* showing strength and "stickum" like Superman and Spiderman. You'll wonder who thought up this tripe. Denzel Washington is a fine actor but the script was so awful that Denzel was left with the memorable tag line "you shot me in the a**!!!!" I fail to see how any actor could win an Oscar with such a poor script. The "all black win" at the Oscars was unquestionably pre-scripted for this warm fuzzy feeling of accomplishment to America. Denzel may deserve an Oscar for another film, but combine this tripe with Halle Berry (and there were plenty of other films and performances that were far better than hers) and you can understand what kind of contrived garbage you have here. If you want to see another fine black actor who hasn't won an Oscar and should have that appears in an awful film that should, unfortunately, prevent him from receiving an Oscar, go see Morgan Freeman in "Along Came a Spider" -- another contrived piece of garbage.</fullReview>

Must have been for the money. I know that they got my (and my wife's) 18 bucks and I want it back!!

		<fullReview>I have never walked out of a movie before. I don't intend to start doing so. But, man alive, did this flick try my patience.Training Day is about Jake Hoyt (Hawke)'s first day in training to be a narc. His ?mentor' is Alonzo Harris (Washington), a veteran of the LAPD narcotics beat. Now, Hoyt isn't a true rookie ? he's been a cop for over a year, but he wants to be a detective. One good way to become one is by training in narcotics. Alonzo has been on this beat for years, and is considered one of the best. What better training ground could there be? During his day of training, Hoyt learns to disregard the 4th Amendment, lie, use drugs, and all sorts of other things a good cop shouldn't do.Now, there is some validity to having an undercover cop or narc be familiar with the quality of drugs, but they must also remain above the culture. Donnie Brasco and Rush both showed this very well. Training Day does not.I have a host of complaints about this movie. I'm going to address them in no particular order.1) The story made no sense at all. It starts off fine ? Alonzo is a typical hard-nosed narc with little to no patience with a rookie who wants to be a do-gooder. The street has no patience for those types. Ok ? I'll buy that. But then, all of a sudden, we're in the middle of a mystery, and we have no idea where it started or what the details are. We know that Russians are involved, and some other guy, and then all of a sudden we make a bust that makes even less sense, and then, the movie doesn't end. It keeps going, adding new subplots, and don't even think that any of these are going to be resolved at the end. And then the movie is over.2) Alonzo is not likable. Yes, he's a tough cop. Yes, he uses methods that aren't exactly legal. But Washington gives the audience nothing about his character to like. We grew to like Sgt. Hartman in Full Metal Jacket. We liked Darth Vader. We saw the humanity in those characters. Washington is a very good actor, and has the awards to prove it. I don't know if it was the way the character was written or what, but we are given nothing about Alonzo to like. We aren't allowed to see his humanity.3) The pacing is terrible. This movie went on and on and on, and just kept going after it had stopped making sense. Now, this, I don't understand. Fuqua started off directing music videos (This is not a bad thing ? David Fincher, who directed Se7en and Fight Club started out the same way. As did Spike Jonze, who made Being John Malkovich.). He should understand pacing. He directed The Replacement Killers, which starred Chow Yun-Fat and Mira Sorvino ? he can obviously work with actors. So, I'm not sure what happened. Perhaps the editor should be canned. Or the writer. Someone, anyway.I'm done making my list. There are just too many things to go into with this movie. I'm not about to write a spoiler for those of you who still insist on seeing this movie, but I will advise you to reconsider. There are plenty of other movies opening this week.I'd go into more detail, but, this movie was so frustrating that it made my brain hurt.</fullReview>

This questionable sentiment is how rogue LAPD detective Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington) justifies a heavy laundry list of dirty deeds, scary volatility, sociopathic backstabbing and a complete disregard for the badge that he wears on a chain like dog tags. And indeed, inner city Los Angeles can seem like a war zone, but its like he's in fact more part of the problem than the dark angel of justice he sees in himself. Antoine Fuqua's combustible crime drama Training Day rightly won Washington an Oscar for his unsettling runaway train of a performance, and he owns it down to the last maniacal mannerism and manipulative tactic. The film takes place over one smoggy L.A. day (hence the title) that feels like an eternity for its two leads, as well as all the colorful and often terrifying people they meet along the yellow brick road that's paved with used needles and shell casings. Harris is tasked with showing rookie cop Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) the ropes in his neighborhood, in the hopes that he'll pass the test and achieve Narc status. Jake is prepared for a run of the mill crash course, but as soon as he's treated to a verbal beatdown from Harris in the diner they meet at, he has a feeling it ain't gonna be anywhere close to a normal day. This is just another day for Harris though, as he drags Hoyt by the scruff through drug busts, gang warfare, the worst neighborhood in town and pulls him deeper into his very dangerous world. Fuqua has a knack for getting the atmosphere of his settings just pitch perfect, and the feverish nightmare of the inner city comes alive, seemingly possessing the characters themselves until the atrocities just seem like a way of life. The trouble really starts when they run across Harris's old drug lord buddy Roger (a wicked Scott Glenn in a role originally intended for Mickey Rourke), who proves a valuable asset later, though not in the way you might think. Harris introduces Jake to his equally crooked and scary team, including Peter Greene, Nick Chinlund and Dr. Dre who struggles in the acting department, especially in a room full of such heavy hitters. Jake is aghast at the horrors he sees and cannot believe the streets are like this. Harris devilishly assures him that this is the job, mutilating the symbol of his badge even more by justifying such behaviour as necessary. Tension reaches unbearable heights during a visit to a Latino gang household run by Cliff Curtis, Raymond Cruz and the eternally scary Noel Gugliemi. This is the heart of darkness fpr the film, a story beat from which there is seemingly no escape, until it becomes clear that Jake has somehow evolved a step up the food chain as far as LA goes, and is now ready to put down the dog who taught him, a dog who has long been rabid. People complain that the final act degenerates into a routine action sequence. Couldn't disagree more. With a setup so primed with explosive conflict, it can't end up anywhere else but an all out man to man scrap, which when followed by no flat out action sequences earlier in the film, hits hard. Their inevitable confrontation is a powerhouse, especially from Washington, who finally loses his composure and yowls like a trapped coyote, his actions caught up to him. In a role originally intended for Tom Sizemore (who would have rocked it in his own way) I'm glad Denzel got a crack at it, for he's absolute dynamite. Watch for Harris Yulin, Raymond J. Barry and Tom Berenger as the three senior LAPD dick heads, Eva Mendes as Alonzo's girlfriend, Macy Gray as a screeching banshee of a ghetto whore and Snoop Dogg as your friendly neighborhood wheelchair bound crack dealer. Fuqua keeps attention rooted on the dynamic between Washington and Hawke, who is excellent in as role that could have easily been swallowed up by Washington's monster of of a performance. Hawke holds his own, and the film is really about how two very different guys view a difficult area of town, how it changes them both, and ultimately how their moral compasses end up on a collision course. One of the best crime framas out there, and quickly becoming timeless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Street Justice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With his hopes for one day making detective firmly in mind, a young Los Angeles cop by the name of "Jake Hoyt" (Ethan Hawke) is excited about his new transfer to the narcotics division. To assist in his training he is accompanied by the man in charge of the division, "Detective Alonzo Harris" (Denzel Washington) who shows him the ropes for the first 24 hours. During this time he quickly learns that the rules he has been taught at the police academy do not apply and that his life is in jeopardy if he fails to adapt. He also learns that there is another sort of justice other than that rendered by the courts?street justice. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was movie offers a no-holds-barred glimpse at the "war on drugs" and gang activity from the perspective of those living in the eye of the storm--and it isn't very pretty. The movie, on the other hand, was certainly entertaining enough with Denzel Washington performing in an excellent manner as did Ethan Hawke to a lesser extent. That said, I have rated the movie accordingly. Above average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Training Day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my thoughts, 'Training Day' had a great visual, such as eye capturing cinematography, street productions and costume desighing. I felt like there were some unnecessary close ups on the fantastic portraits. On the other hand, the balanced cinematography was suitable for each scene. To Add, the title had apprpopiate music for the street theme film, for example electronic and rap smash hits. The soundtrack was played when needed. In addition, the storyline explored youth gang coulture and corruption in communities but it could of dug into a massive picture on the criminal subject matter. The black humour made my face burst into laughter because the dialogue and body language. David Ayer did a brilliant job with the screenplay. I am triggered to giving Antoine Fuqua's directed picture a 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK so not a chick flick. That's for certain. One of my all time favorites about a experienced cop that takes on a rookie for a day of training, the twist as we soon find out is that this veteran cop seems a little jagged. Yah let's leave it at that jagged. Not your standard protocol blue suit version of narcotics officer. If you have never seen this movie I envy you because you are going to go on a roller coaster of an adventure full of all the best stuff that makes for cop movies but not with the standard plot. There is no who done it. There is no damsel in distress, but instead a plot that will have you saying: "holy smokes what an awesome movie." You'll love the banter in this movie it's awesome, some of the best cop dialogue ever written. Realistic. And the delivery...wellIf you are a Denzel Washington fan, it's probably a stronger performance than "Flight," although they are diametrically opposed as movies. Flight is far more internal and cerebral where as "Training Day," is unmistakeably in your face. You'll love the banter, the plot, you'll cheer for the protagonist and most of all you'll have all the popcorn you yourself when Your wife nods off to sleep.Take care and enjoy the flick Seebs</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The films of Ayer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a review of "Street Kings", "Training Day" and "End of Watch", three films by David Ayer.Ayer's best film since "Harsh Times", "Street Kings" stars Keanu Reeves as Detective Tom Ludlow, a burnt out cop who spends his days dodging bullets, taking down bad guys and dealing with a corrupt law enforcement system rife with scumbags in uniform. Sounds clichéd? Ayer's film moves like magic. He captures the tone and tempo of sleazy pulp fiction, revels in the genre's trashiness, writes in a baroque, pulp-prose style and volleys dialogue back and forth like Howard Hawks on cocaine.Ayer, who started out as a screenwriter, also has an ear for snappy noir dialogue. His characters don't talk, so much as they play ping-pong with words, prose hurtling along with staccato intensity; like drumbeats. It's trashy, but it knows it's trashy; 1950s B movie sleaze filtered through a modern prism.The film's all hand held cameras and snappy cuts, pausing now and then only to capture noir infused, sun drenched shots of California. We get convenience store shootouts, foot-chases through LA's Latino quarter, ominous nighttime skylines and the bloody haze of downtown ghettos. In Ayer's films, California's a war zone.The message here is also less problematic than that of Ayer's other work. Here Keanu plays your typical loose cannon of a cop. He's a modern Dirty Harry, a fascist with a badge, a ruthless authoritarian who breaks the law and shoots up punks, all in the guise of doing the "greater good". To eliminate evil, Keanu believes, you have to employ risqué tactics, perhaps even the mendaciously immoral and outright illegal. The ends justify the means. Deal with it.Only they don't. Keanu eventually realises he's a messed up dirt-bag who's been used as a violent blunt object by both the good guys and the bad. Ticked off, this little pawn visits his king, a chubby Police Chief who's house, in a nice bit of symbolism, literally has money, drugs and blackmail tapes leaking out of its walls; the up-scale veneer can barely hold back the corruption.Ayer also wrote the screenplay for "Training Day". Another cop thriller, it stars Denzel Washington as a vicious LAPD narcotics officer who takes an ambitious rookie (Ethan Hawke) under his wing. Washington's a criminal and crooked cop. Ethan, in contrast, is our great white hope, representative of Good, white American values, family and strong morals. Faced with the multi-ethnic criminality of both LA and Washington, Ethan opts firstly to simply walk away. Let the animals kill themselves. But Washington won't allow it. He attempts to corrupt Ethan ? first with marijuana and later with harder vices - before provoking him into righteous violence. Even then Ethan refuses to deliver the kill blow; its up to the people of the slums ? Latinos, Russians and blacks ? to finish off their own kind. Ethan's hands remain clean. Whilst the film's first hour is thrilling, it becomes increasingly racist and stereotypical as it progresses.Racism and stereotypes are precisely what gush forth from Ayer's "End of Watch". The film finds actors Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena playing a pair of LAPD cops. They're young, macho cowboys, high on testosterone and hungry for action. Much of the film juxtaposes the goodness of our virtuous heroes, their family lives and desire for peace, family and domesticity, with the wild savagery of LA's underclass, who actively hunt our heroes and violently intrude upon their private lives. It's your typically racist Cowboys vs Indians story. Our cops are a fraternity of hazing, backslapping, well-meaning frat-boys (they shoot and kill only in legitimate self-defence; yeah right), who hold the line against the savage chaos that is the Other. It's a jungle out there, which Ayer fetishizes and salivates over, his cops finding black kids tied up in cupboards and butchered limbs hidden in basements. You can find similar scenes in early films which demonized those pesky Native American Indians; monster's gonna getcha.As this is a millennial police drama, two generations removed from Rodney King and a bevy of other scandals, Ayer's cops are more thankless grunts than boys in blue. They're soldiers. The film, with its pseudo documentarian shaky cam aesthetic (which, bizarrely, makes the film feel manufactured and fake rather than "authentic), as a whole mirrors "Saving Private Ryan", the poster boy of modern cinematic fascism, which likewise masked bigotry, blood-lust and hatred behind patriotism and seemingly wholesome values. "Black Hawk Down" for cops, the film's a love-letter to the thin blue line, a blood-and-guts glorification of "those who keep the savages at bay", which is to say, it's total propaganda and trades in bogus mythology.Crime films routinely demonstrate no social understanding, and routinely ignore the systemic causes of the appalling, violent conditions underprivileged minorities find themselves in. Others focus on "corrupt policemen" and "rotten apples", which itself misses the larger point that all law enforcement is systemically corrupt. The police/polis has a repressive function, its goal is to make politics disappear, for as long as there is no politics, a hierarchal distribution of power remains intact. The police, including disciplinary institutions and their various ideological components, are there to uphold the status quo and make sure that equality doesn't interfere with the hierarchal distribution of power; these social institutions are inherently inegalitarian. Today people have no problem accepting that the thin red line, the armed forces, does not act in the interest of You or Other, but it's the same with the thin blue line. Indeed, the dollar value of crime stopped by police infinitely out-weights that caused by the same. Borne of the desire of the wealthy to restructure society, to manage the urban poor and potential workforces, the law doesn't exist to prevent injustice acting upwards (the old notion that police protect the happy middle classes from the crazy, lazy lower classes), but largely to promote injustices acting downwards.7.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Denzel Washington, a bad cop, cons Ethan Hawke, a rookie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Denzel Washington puts in a bravura performance and Ethan Hawke handles a tough role quite well, and the result is a strangely attractive movie about a cop gone very, very bad amid a bunch of other cops also gone bad.Denzel is a narc and his unit is dirty, the temptations of the money and power to push everyone around being great. Denzel is a cruel, manipulative, fast-talking, smooth-talking, calculating man who knows how to con the rookie Hawke. Hawke is ambitious and Denzel uses that against him. He reinforces Hawke as a "wolf", not one of the "sheep". But Hawke's conscience is too strong for that, although tempted. Denzel is the devil of the piece. Denzel cleverly gets Hawke to smoke some strong drugs and uses that against him as a threat. He wraps Hawke in a much more sinister plot in order that he can rip off $1 million from a drug dealer and save his own skin.Washington improvises at every turn, placing Hawke on the defensive. The critical scene occurs when Hawke participates in the drug money ripoff. Will he go for it or not? At this point, Washington has to decide whether he has succeeded in overcoming Hawke's resistance or not. His ego takes over. The pleasure of having broken the mind and conscience of Hawke takes over. Or is it a death wish? Is it his own lame conscience active? Does he see himself in Hawke when he was younger? He says so. This is one conversion to the dark side that he very much wants to make to gratify himself, because Hawke represents a challenge to him. Denzel is a man who has had his way for so long that he must get his way against this challenge. It may prove his undoing, but he must do it.I've watched this movie twice. It does grab you, because Denzel does such a terrific job. Hawke's part is tough, because he has to be reasonably smart but also naive, affected by drugs to some extent, swept along, intimidated, confused, and hypnotized by Denzel. He manages it mostly by showing he's a street fighter and by using a suspicious look in his eyes. The role easily could have fallen apart, but it didn't.Good use of ghetto and barrio scenes and characters, and good photography and use of locations make the movie very realistic. Harris Yulin and Tom Berenger appear in one scene as mature bad and cynical cops.The writer, David Ayer, did a superb job.</fullReview>

Has one try out day in which Alonso should see if he is good enough to enter his team. As the day continues he begins to see that Alonso is quite different form how cop should be and that he not only bend the rules but thrown them all together. But worse thinks will come. This experience is going to change him forever. Story of his film is very good, and a few times I was really surprised by what happened. Acting is good but everyone pales in contrast to Washington who in the role of baddie is great. I think he should play bad characters more often, this one really suited him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alonzo's betrayal . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is one quick line in this feature that is pivotal to the plot: when Alonzo takes Jake to see Roger, the dealer, Roger asks Alonzo about the Russians. Roger says, " . . . you know I've got your back." So, think about the irony: Roger was promising Alonzo protection from the Russians; if Alonzo had not killed Roger, he would have been safe! This, I believe, is the supreme irony of Alonzo's reckless campaign to save his life by killing the one man who was prepared to save him. The hubris that Alonzo demonstrated is a symptom of his arrogant self-reliance - he planned everything in order to get his money, with no thought for the lives of those whom he used to achieve it. And this ties back to the joke Roger told Jake about the snail: Alonzo is like the snail in that he thought he could go anywhere or do anything without being stopped!</fullReview>

Directing was superb and the storyline is believable. My only complain about the movie was that some scenes were just unnecessary. They could have been left out. Definitely a recommended for anybody!

The script is brilliantly acted by ethan hawke but denzel steals the show here he makes the alonzo character his own and no ther acter could have played a better part.There are also some good cameo roles from snoop dog and Dr. Dre all are played well.One of the best films i have seen i watched it in 2001 and can still watch it today.

		<fullReview>raining day was pretty good Sunday night entertainment for my family and I. After watching this movie I am not sure if this met my expectations of this movie even 9 years after its release. Alonzo(Washington) and his role really makes me wonder how corrupt and crazy our law systems and society is in the streets and the suburbs. The movie was a pretty long two hours but it kept you in it so it did not feel like it was dragging. Many people say they are unhappy with the climax or the big turning point but i was content with the ending if that helps at all. Everything was realistic, the actors were awesome and the movie really makes you have a connection for whats going on. It is sort of a movie where you actually have to pay attention and it is not predictable unless you ruin it for yourself. Overall, I do recommend seeing it, I have the DVD where I am not sure if I will watch it again anytime soon but it is a movie Id like to watch a second time to see what I missed thats how much was involved in this movie</fullReview>

This film does explore the nature of good cop, bad cop between Washington &amp; Ethan Hawke but more interestingly shows a corrupt drug crime fighting unit that Hawke as LAPD Cop Jake Hoyt alone must battle. Truly scary stuff with the thrilling situations Hawke finds himself in including a very traumatic bathtub scene. Washington is definitely the bad guy but you can't help liking him because of his smooth talking &amp; heroic type lifestyle as Detective Alonzo &amp; his black 1979 Chevrolet Monte Carlo lowrider.

		<fullReview>"Good Cop / Bad Cop""Training Day" throws the rules out of the window and hits you in the face with a brutal and highly entertaining story of good cop/bad cop as we are taken on an urban trip of one day on the job for rookie narcotics officer Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) and his training officer Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). When Harris begins to cross the line, Jake finds himself willing to look the other way.Amazingly set over the course of 24 hours, the movie is a look at the seductive nature of corruption, how deeply it can bloom and how its ruinous consequences permanently stain anyone who comes in contact with it.Washington radiates a wicked, malicious magnetism he's never displayed, by way of contrast with the heroic roles he usually takes on. This is the first villainous turn of his career. Being bad brings out the best in Washington, and his performance elevates "Training Day" past its familiar street-cops scenario into something far richer. Denzel is surely the star of this film and was quite deserving of his "Best Actor in a Leading Role" academy award, even though I am sure many people claim Russell Crowe deserved it more for "A Beautiful Mind". In my opinion, the winner should have actually been Sean Penn for his work in "I Am Sam". However, I also think Ethan Hawke deserves some praise, this is a guy that has grown on me over the past few years, especially with this film and "Before Sunset".Obviously Training Day is an example of a movie that showcases the talent of everyone involved, especially the talent of director Antoine Fuqua who, in my opinion, is not getting enough work but I am absolutely sure we will see more from him soon enough. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An honest rookie cop, Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke), on his first day in the narcotics division, is assigned to be trained with a street-smart veteran, Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). Harris demonstrates through his actions that in order to deal with hard-boiled criminals, it is necessary for the cops to get their hands dirty at times. They visit gang-infested neighborhoods, chase drug-dealers and conduct house-raids. But as the day progresses, Harris's methods become increasingly questionable and Hoyt starts suspecting his mentor's true intentions.The stories of corrupt cops and naive, good-looking, rookie cops gaining an experience of their lifetime ("character arc" in movie parlance) have been told many times by Hollywood. But the performances of Washington and Hawke set this movie apart. The supporting cast is pretty good too. There is plenty of suspense and good action to keep the viewers engaged for two hours. But none of it stays in the mind after the movie is over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Denzel Washington won an Oscar for best actor in 2002 for the movie Training Day. Considering the other nominees and Washington's performance, I wouldn't say he deserved it ? he wasn't bad, but didn't make an impression either. He based his character on Rafael Perez, a former police officer involved in the LAPD Rampart scandal who covered up robberies and murders.Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) has always wanted to be a police officer so he could rid the society of drugs and dealers. On his first day on the job, however, a much more experienced policeman, detective Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington), takes him around town in his car and shows him that being a police officer is nothing like he imagined.I didn't like this movie, even though it's very good. I found the story to be original, even though it follows the classic good cop vs. bad cop scheme and you can see it from the start: detective Alonzo is irritating, violent, full of himself but he's also experienced; Jake Hoyt, on the other hand, is a family man, an idealist and, maybe one could even say, a fool ? but we like him, feel for him and wish his vision of society was the true one. Hawke and Washington both deliver good performances, which makes this movie good since it mostly focuses on their interactions and overall relationship that develops in one day.Training Day is very violent, therefore it would be difficult for me to watch it multiple times. Another problem with the movie is that it becomes boring from time to time ? there are some parts you simply must sit through to get to the good parts. On the other hand, some of the twists were truly intelligent and unexpected. The cinematography and the soundtrack are good too. But the ending seems abrupt, and certain characters should have been more developed, or at least given more screen time ? especially those Alonzo calls "the three wise men". All in all, Training Day is a good movie, and you're guaranteed to like it if you fancy violence and action.Rating: 7/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We all know that Denzel can cut it and performed his role here with unmistakable mastery. However personally I thought the Oscar should go to Ethan Hawke; one of my favourite actors and often under rated. He's one of those actors who is so good in his supporting roles that he often gets overlooked. From the first time I saw him in Dead poets, I've been following his career and in Training day I thought Hawke gave the performance of his life. This is a fantastic gritty suspenseful story that is so refreshing in the face of all the bubble gum thrillers out there that just want numbers at the box office. This movie proves that you can have both realism and popularity in the same reel. Whatever minor flaws this movie had was more than made up for by the palpable screen chemistry between these praiseworthy actors who took the viewer on a roller coaster ride with the sticky plot, thorough script and various unexpected twists and turns. An adrenaline fuelled edge of the seat trip; riveting from beginning to end?10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent acting, but poorly direction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Training Day is probably not a masterpiece. But it's obvious that the acting of Denzel Washington in it, may be among the best of all time. First, let's start with the main problem; the poorly performance of almost every supporting character (except Ethan Hawk of course). This lead to some forgettable moments, like every time we Eva Mendes on the screen.Then we have a plot that spans only in a day, which could be interesting, but takes too long to be enjoyable. Anyway, the themes treated in the movie aren't original at all, but somehow, it's what we expect to see in the genre; corruption, violence, ethic, etc.But, in another hand, during the movie, the conversion from the Det. Alonzo, that goes from the respectful detective to a corrupt cop who's trying to get out of a mess he got himself into is so impressive, that it's hardly to not enjoy it, even though the formula was seen over and over by the years. And let's not forget of course, the performance of Hawk (who was also an academy award nominated) which may be the greatest of his career.So if we resume, we have here some poorly scenes, that could have been erased in the final cut; in a not very original plot, but good enough to keep the attention; a bad choice of actors (Dr. Dre?!?!); but two terrific performances from two terrific actors, that make this movie one of the best of his decade.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A+ This is movie is a hard hitter and definitely not to be missed. It's an urban crime-thriller taking place where else but in the run down ghettos of Los Angeles. Ethan Hawke is quite good as the na?ve protagonist and the cast is also filled with many other well done roles. Peter Greene is always entertaining, and Eva Mendes is always a treat, clothes on or off. The highlight of the movie is Denzel Washington. His performance is a combination of spectacular acting and writing. Half the time you're not sure if he's just an abuser of power or a true demon, and every second of his screen time is just marvelous. Also starring in small roles are many rap legends from the genre's 90s hey-day, namely Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre.The action is pretty intense and the camera follows it gracefully. My favorite scene had to be when Denzel visits his friend Roger, played by Scott Glenn . Delightfully brutal, and also a very plot-driven film I urge all to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Best Characters Of The Twenty-First Century</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Training Day" is an awesome film with one of the most memorable character of the 2000 through 2009 decade.Alonzo is one of the best characters in recent memory and one of the best villains in movie history. He begins the film as a good guy, showing Jake the ropes. He quickly becomes questionable with his techniques that just don't feel right. As the film goes on it is clear that Alonzo is very, very crooked and needs to be put in his place. There is a very memorable line from Alonzo during his drastic downfall, which is, "King Kong ain't got s**t on me!" The way that Washington delivers that line during Alonzo's monologue is magnificent. Beyond the fantastic villain character, "Training Day" has a great script. Yes, it is unlikely that all of this would take place in just one day if this was real life, but I firmly believe that that notion of reality can be stretched at times in cinema. There is little to be said on the plot, but it is just very well written and executed. Jake's good natured personality is a good opposition towards Alonzo, but his character is left in the darkness next to the brilliance that is Alonzo.I highly recommend this film. It is a fun story with a very memorable character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding corrupt cop drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The ending was a bit of overkill. That could be said. And the mano-a-mano fight apr?s the ending was a bit drawn out. That too could be said. But the rest of the film was more than excellent."Training Day" is the best of the bad cop dramas that I have seen, and I've seen a few. Both Denzel Washington as the psychopathic bad cop, Alonzo, and Ethan Hawke as the idealistic rookie, Jake, were full out. Denzel Washington won the Best Actor Oscar for his performance, and Ethan Hawke was nominated for Best Supporting Actor. The direction by Antoine Fuqua was superb. The LA street scenes and milieu were as real and vivid as my old buddy Taco Bender. (And trust me, Taco Bender was very real.) The extras in the crowd scenes should get some kind of prize for macho scary. I've been there, and I still have a few nightmares. There are some streets in LA you don't want to walk down unless you are a homey, or a brother, and some other streets you don't want to walk down, period.Unlike some cop dramas and shoot 'em up thrillers, this one was carefully planned, so that the scene in the barrio at the card table, the rook all alone set up for the kill, came across as real because what had happened before was just about the only thing in the world that could have saved him. The LA atmosphere was like a rush, as stunningly authentic in a different way as, say, that in Chinatown (1974) or LA Confidential (1997), but more contemporary.I wonder how many guys starting in say the sixties or maybe a little before have experienced the kind of initiation that Jake experiences in terms of being fed some dope never before tasted and then "led" on the "trip" by someone wanting to exploit them. Most of the time, for most guys it was an initiation into something other worldly, scary, but something that was only psychological and would be gone the next day. For Jake it was a matter of, first, his livelihood as an idealistic cop, and second a matter of groking to a paranoid view of the world in which the good guys are the bad guys and everything is hopelessly corrupt and there is no good, only evil?and you just found out. And third, a matter of life and death with either acid and grass running all around your brain or maybe PCP and speed, and some suddenly obviously evil person (as Washington so well depicted) giving you the kind of "guidance" you can't refuse. And then finally it is beyond life and death and only a matter of primeval justice and a revenge you must perform.Look for Snoop Dogg in a wheelchair and Dr. Dre as one of Alonzo's posse cops.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"

		<shortDescription>Provocative allegory about good and evil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In re-visiting TRAINING DAY (2001) recently, I have absolutely no doubt that Denzel Washington deserved his Best Actor Oscar. He makes the absolute most of this role and is magnetic as corrupt narcotics cop Alonzo Harris. The main thing that I like about this performance is that Washington played it as a totally corrupt and unscrupulous man who once, a long time ago had wide-eyed principles of doing good and cleaning up the streets. But he lost his way to the point there is no redemption.In walks newly promoted young Detective Jake Hoyt (played superbly by Best Supporting nominee Ethan Hawke, who in reality has more screen time than Washington), Alonzo's new 'trainee'. Jake is who Alonzo used to be with a MAJOR difference...Jake is incorruptible! He refuses to give in to the seduction of the quick buck and giving up on humanity. And in the process, Jake is the one who proves to be the strongest of the pair. Even with his Oscar nom, I feel like Hawke's work goes unnoticed as he essentially is the true heart and anchor of the film. Jake could have easily come across as a fake, stereotypical, do-gooder character, but in the end, he makes the viewer believe in Jake's unflinching valor. We care BECAUSE OF Jake! Initially, a had a problem with the film taking place all in one day. While I still think that it's a bit unbelievable at times, I really appreciate how gritty and realistic many of the characters and situations translate to the screen. While there are hints of preachiness and convolution, the film still draws you into it's dangerous world in a very provocative way; it manages to stay a step ahead of the typical tale-of-the-streets, mainly due to many intense scenes and strong acting. I really didn't appreciate all of this when I first saw it, being totally awed by Washington's transfixing performance and ignoring how good a movie I was actually watching.Director Anton Fuqua did an amazing job not just with Washington and Hawke, but with the entire cast as well, with standouts being Scott Glenn (as the biggest street dealer in LA) and Cliff Curtis as a young Hispanic ganglord who actually shows signs of nobility. Addititonally, there are effective cameos by famous rapper-musicians Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, and Macy Gray. But the obvious standout is Washington, whose powerful performance wholeheartedly deserved the Oscar...And he got it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different Denzel for the better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the years Denzel Washington is known to playing either heroic leading characters or historic people (Malcolm X, Herman Boone), but now he gets to play the villain for the first time where I couldn't keep my eyes off of him when he first made his appearance as Alonzo Harris."Training Day" is really about Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke in a different turn from Indie films), a trainee for the Los Angeles Narcotic Division where he wants to put away the bad guys just like all good cops are suppose to do until he meets Alonzo, a bad-ass happy trigger cop who knows everything about the city of Los Angeles from the Vatos, the druggies, the pimps, the cripples, the gang members who alert Alonzo, and so forth where he also speaks languages.Hoyt thinks that all he's doing with Alonzo is part of a routine...he's wrong about one thing.From one event to another Hoyt is either being dragged or coaxed by Alonzo from taking drugs, being part of a set-up after a murder where now he doesn't really know if being a narcotic officer is the line of work for him."Training Day" is an insane ride where Denzel takes the screen like a madman tied to a bomb not knowing when he's going explode; he takes the term villain to a whole new level especially in cop corruption. Ethan Hawke is outstanding as the new rookie where other performances from Scott Glenn, Macy Gray, Dr. Dre, Tom Beranger, Peter Greene and Snoop Dogg shine out as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Edge of the seat entertainment...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Denzel Washington plays Detective Alonzo Harris, a hardnosed, street savvy narcotics cop given charge of rookie cop Jake (Hawke). As Jake's 'Training Day' progresses he learns that his Police Academy rules don't apply in Alonzo's world, and with increasing concern, not to mention personal jeopardy, finds that Alonzo, some of his fellow detectives and even higher officials in the LAPD, have distinct rules of their own.Not an original premise, but here the delivery is bang on. Washington plays on his past comfortable screen personas, initially coming across as the experienced, tough, no-nonsense, but well meaning, detective. We of course, like Hawke's character Jake, a rookie eager to please, are initially taken in by this, but it is not long before doubts about Alonzo's true nature and agenda start to kick in.There are many disturbing things about this film, not least of which is the fact that no-one has come forward to say that it ain't really like that on the streets of LA ? in fact they endorsed its accuracy by giving Washington an Oscar for his portrayal.However, Washington's performance is electric and worthy of its Academy Award. Alonzo is charismatic, persuasive, powerful, dangerous and downright scary. Ethan Hawke compliments this with a portrayal that runs the gamut from initial naivety and respect, through wary tolerance, to disbelief, terror and finally rage, in a performance necessarily powerful enough to counter Washington. The two are equally compelling to watch and provide edge of the seat entertainment in a gripping, raw and violent tale of lies, betrayal, corruption and abuse of power (sorry to use the old maxims there, but here they actually apply).Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An abrasive but standard-issue buddy police picture with a great Denzel performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Denzel Washington delivers a dynamic performance easily worth an Oscar as a rogue cop in director Antoine Fuqua's gritty urban crime thriller "Training Day," co-starring Ethan Hawke, Scott Glenn, Snoop Doggie Dog, Macy Gray, and Tom Berenger. This unsavory but exciting R-rated law &amp; order melodrama paints a considerably less than flattering portrait of police corruption in Los Angeles. Essentially, scenarist David ("U-571") Ayers has exploited the recent Ramparts police scandal in the L.A.P.D. as the basis for his controversial but contrived screenplay. While he infuses the film with his charismatic personality, Washington goes against-the-grain for a change as a dyed-in-the-wool villain who won't hesitate to double-cross friends. Not only does bad-ass Denzel tote a chrome-plated automatic pistol under each armpit, but also he cruises his asphalt domain in a customized obsidian-black 1978 Monte Carlo. Gear heads will drool over Denzel's ride which doubles as his office. As an extension of Alonzo's amoral character, the Monte Carlo compliments his roguish personality. Sadly, as psychological actioneers rate, "Training Day" lacks the tenacity that Washington imparts to his warlord-like antagonist. Fuqua and Ayer employ sentimental stratagems to align our sympathies with Ethan Hawke's half-hearted hero who turns wimp in the end. Surprisingly, unpardonable logistics sabotage Fuqua's mise-en-scene, especially in a rooftop foot chase! Further, the filmmakers bank on sheer coincidence to bail out the hero. A "Scarface" inspired scene as Latino gangsters prepare to ice our hero in a bathtub illustrates the worst of the coincidences. Ultimately, if "Training Day" constitutes the best Hollywood can offer as a cautionary tale about police corruption, we're all in trouble. Basically, the Darwinian message of "Training Day" is big-fish eat little-fish, or survival of the fittest, so what does it matter if how criminals buy it in the end if justice is served? As cynical as "Training Day" tries to portray itself, it winds up as a formulaic but flawed thriller about legal courtroom justice versus street justice.Basically, this abrasive but standard-issue buddy police picture does nothing countless other thrillers like Sidney Lumet's "Serpico" (1973) haven't done better. Specifically, "Training Day" resembles a white-washed version of director Abel Ferrara's uncompromising 1994 dirty cop saga "Bad Lieutenant," starring Harvey Keitel as a heroin-shooting, trigger-happy, N.Y.P.D. detective in deep trouble with loan sharks. Like the Keitel character, Washington's renegade cop shoulders his share of problems. He has teed-off the Russians (presumably their mafia) during a wild and woolly weekend in Las Vegas, and they want payback. Even Alonzo's police superiors refuse to believe he is anything more than a walking dead man. Alonzo aims to prove them wrong and his narcissism makes him perversely appealing. Some of the problems with "Training Day" is what we learn about Alonzo's off-screen activities seems more interesting than what we see him do. Take the encounter with the Russians in Vegas. Apparently, Alonzo snapped, killed a guy, and the Russians have dispatched hit men to get him the same way the Colombians nailed Al Pacino in Brian De Palma's "Scarface." Nevertheless, Alonzo never loses his cool in "Training Day," because he believes he is in control, particularly with regard to a rookie auditioning for the sixth man slot on his elite team."Training Day" chronicles a 24-hour span in the life of young, idealistic, rookie cop Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke of "Dead Poets Society" &amp; "Hamlet") who wants only to 'protect and serve' the public. Since joining the Los Angeles Police Department 19 months ago, Hoyt has been angling for a big break. Thirteen-year veteran L.A.P.D. Det. Sgt. Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington of "Remember the Titans"), who heads up an elite narcotics squad, provides that break. Harris gives Hoyt the chance of a life-time to prove he can perform undercover without getting himself smoked by a paranoid drug dealer. If Hoyt can make a favorable impression on Alonzo, he assures his young beautiful wife breast feeding their 10-month age, infant daughter they will be bound for a better life.As a typical, formulaic American movie, "Training Day" relies on rewards and punishment to shape its morality. Hoyt interprets this assignment as his ticket to the big time. Not only is Hoyt in for a rude awakening, but also so is the audience. By the time those fateful 24 hours elapse; Hoyt will emerge as an entirely different person. His saintly ideals will be tarnished as well as his own sense of innocence. Anyway, Ethan Hawke gives an evocative performance, but the actions of his character ultimately undercut the brilliance of his acting. He plays a stereotypical hero who balks at doing what a hero's got to do. Hoyt's last confrontation with Alonzo underlines the weakness inherent in Hawke's character. As the young, hungry cop, Hoyt represents hope, so his refusal to rub out Alonzo smacks more of political correctness than dramatic closure. Similarly, "Training Day" compares these two characters and reminds us in no uncertain terms who epitomizes good and evil.Director Antoine Fuqua, whose credits include "The Replacement Killers" and the slick Jamie Fox caper "Bait," gives "Training Day" a sleek, sharp, and snazzy look. Unfortunately, while the movie amounts to a visual feast for the eyes, David Ayer's script degenerates during the second half of the action. The hero stands for law and order, but he refuses to get himself dirty do his job. Clearly, "Training Day" contends that what you sow, so shall you reap. Anton Fuqua and David Ayer have made a passable film that provides reassurances if the cops cannot take care of corruption, then criminals will.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Police corruption is a topic that is used numerous times in films to the point of annoyance, but this one makes it much more gritty and realistic than any example I can think of. I'm always a fan of the 'Good v. Evil' scenario and this one employs it perfectly. The polar opposites that the film creates in Alonzo and Hoyt (the former being completely corrupt, the latter being completely pure) are very interesting and the balance between them kept me engaged the entire film. As we watch Hoyt try to understand this new world that he's been thrown into, while still trying to keep his morality and good nature intact, we realize (just like he does) that there is no right or wrong. You have to create a balance, because the line 'It's not what you know, it's what you can prove.' couldn't be more true, so sometimes that's why you have to bend the rules in order to bring the bad guys down. The ending is one of my all time favorites, as Hoyt leaves Alonzo to be murdered by the numerous men out to get him because he can't arrest him and he can't kill him himself. Brilliant. Both of the lead performances are excellent, and Denzel's win was fully deserved. His charisma and the fact that his character was so against his normal 'good guy' type made for such an interesting and ethereal portrayal of one of my favorite characters. The only thing that I wasn't a fan of was the huge coincidence that the girl Hoyt randomly saved from being raped just happened to be the cousin of the man who was about to kill him. I found that insanely dumb, but it didn't affect my opinion on the film at all.</fullReview>

This is a wonderfully looking film that starts out very strongly and has some really intense scenes that do stick with you(particularly the climax, a scene in an alley, and, well, I'll let you be surprised). There are a couple plot holes and you have to watch and listen carefully to understand everything that' going on, but it's well written with a couple of clever twists in between. The ending is a little formulaic, but that is saved by a powerhouse, Oscar winning performance by Denzel, and an equally intense Hawke. This is the best film on Fuqua's line of action drama's.

		<fullReview>Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke provide excellent performances, but the plot has some obvious holes. Nevertheless, the reason I think highly of the movie is because it really explores the conflict that undercover officers face- to be very effective, one must almost become a criminal. Morality is not always crystal clear. I think the message of the movie is this- Denzel's character crosses the line and it thoroughly corrupts him which leads to his demise. In the course of the "Training Day", Ethan Hawke's character sees what one must do to reach the pinnacle of effectiveness as a narc cop, but in the end, he rejects that philosophy because he sees the paradox. One cannot claim to be an officer of the law, however effective at fighting crime, if one engages in criminal activity to achieve the effectiveness. This is an incredibly profound and compelling concept for all cops. Do you "create" justification to pull over a vehicle you suspect may be involved in criminal activity? Does the end justify the means? Is society better off with cops whose methods may be immoral but whose results are extremely productive? Great food for thought and debate.</fullReview>

It's not a very deep movie and glosses over a lot of its issues and themes to the point that I missed them originally. Maybe I was expecting too much from this 'dark and gritty' police drama..It looks to be a simple story of morales. Nothing to do with law. Just about egos and mainly noting that a criminal is still a criminal with or without a badge. Ethan's character's turmoil seems to be more that he keeps hoping that Denzel's character will eventually show him something through his unorthodox teaching 'methods'. Instead he simply learns what not to do and that he doesn't believe in Denzel.That's all. The ac tings OK, and the direction competent. So doesn't deserve rave reviews, but probably doesn't deserve bad ones either.</fullReview>

First when I heard about this movie I thought that is another 'gangsta movie' with a boring story, a gang war or something like that, in the first 15 or 20 minutes I was a bit disappointed but after this I've realized that is a great movie. I thought at this movie o hole day after I saw it,is so close to reality, it is like a reality show or a flagrant made by police with a hidden camera, i never thought a movie like this is possible,makes us think at the life we livin', at the society as it is, naked, without any clothes on it. The movie has a few errors, but at a movie with such a story does not matter a few issues, practically the story and the mode the movie is made "repairs" the issues keeping you close to screen that you can't see them. Denzel Washington plays awesome, I haven't seen somebody playing so good in this kind if role since Al Pacino in Scarface, I'm sure that if a person that doesn't know Denzel Washington as an actor, watches how he plays, that person will probably tel you that is a men taken from the streets, not an actor. Ethan Hawke plays great to, he was probably deserving an Oscar at the time but perhaps it was just bad luck.It's an excellent movie with a great story that is waiting for entering Top 250, if you wanna see an exceptional movie you should watch this, I can't find my words to describe it so I probably have to end my comment here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although the subject matter in Training Day may be unfavorable to acknowledge, the movie is still significant because of the quality of work throughout this film. One of the most authentic depictions of the streets in recent memory. The gangsters in this movie act like they came right off the corner. I think it is important that people realize that this movie is not at all far fetched when you consider the Rampart scandal and the story of "corrupt cop", Rafael Perez and the "boy scout" detective that eventually blew the whistle on this corrupted department. Rap fans would be interested to know that this same Rafael Perez and one of his colleagues David Mack have been linked to Death Row CEO Suge Knight and many loosely suspect they had some hand in the rocky events that eventually led to Tupac and Biggie's deaths. Great performances by Denzel and Ethan. To me this movie is hard to look at for some people because the injustice it shows never affected them and in a sense they either feel guilty for it in a way or they just despise the whole environment but whether you chose to accept it or not you can't hide from this movie because the subject matter is relevant and the movie's quality is exceptional.</fullReview>

And the violence, i'd say there was not much of it. Oh but there were a few pretty violent scenes. I'm used to seeing Denzel as the good guy and seeing him spouting vulgarities and being kinda crooked, its a surprise.

		<shortDescription>Unbelievable coincidence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Altman's "The Player" there is a subplot that involves a writer of a film who insists that his film retains his dark "non-Hollywood" ending--he is adamant during his pitches that "life is like that" and that people don't always live and that endings aren't always happy. He ends up selling out, and his movie has a stereotypical Hollywood ending in which a character played by Bruce Willis pulls a daring last second rescue of the formerly doomed heroine, played by Julia Roberts, complete with snappy exchange between the characters.In "Training Day" there is a unrealistic coincidence that allows Ethan Hawke's character to survive a situation where he should have died; I immediately thought about "The Player". I can hear the producers insisting that the hero (Hawke) survive, and that the villain (Washington) get a comeuppance. They may have shot an ending in which Hawke dies, and Denzel Washington's character goes on leading his corrupt life, but like in "The Player", it "didn't test well" with audiences in an advanced screening.I also was never convinced that Denzel could be so rotten, the fact that he always played heroes weighed on my ability to suspend disbelief, but that is my own subjective opinion. Denzel certainly played the character well, but I am not alone in my opinion that the Academy gave him the Oscar as a "makeup" for his being passed over before.What ruined the movie for me was the pat ending, and the coincidence that allowed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch it for Washington's performance; some well made, unpredictable scenes and let it just draw you in.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What we have with Training Day is a big mixture of: gangster, crime, cop/buddy and something close to resembling a ghetto drama all in one. Needless to say that all these aspects of the film work together in a reasonably effective way which, in the end, leaves you feeling satisfied. There are individual strokes of greatness but these are limited to things like Denzil Washington's performance who reminded me of a Wesley Snipes character out of something like 'New Jack City' (1991). There is also the element of unpredictability for the best part as relative rookie Jake (Hawke) gets put through some pretty harsh paces for the first forty minutes or so.I came away from Training Day liking it overall but there were some distinct things that had me thinking to myself 'Yeah, I see exactly what they're trying to do here.' And this is relatable to the 'buddy/cop' sequence. Jake and Alonzo (Washington) are the absolute binary opposites of one another: you couldn't get two more different characters. One is a 'desk' cop who books illegally parked cars and probably takes the odd trip to the doughnut shop one too many times (although his build doesn't suggest this) whereas Alonzo is one of those cops you see in films and if you were ever going to become a law enforcer, you'd want to live their lifestyle: guns, girls and plenty of softly earned drug money. Although this is nothing new, it was refreshing to see it done in an unpredictable manner and of course, Washington's performance sees it out.Secondly, the way in which each character acts ? Jake seems sharper and wants to do everything by the book whereas Alonzo's methods include something more reminiscent of: instead of arresting two rapists, just threaten in an extreme manner to shoot their genitalia off if they catch them doing it again and let them go. Jake even talks and dresses differently and of course, Ethan Hawke is a white Caucasian American ? Washington is coloured so these two characters make for great entertainment in an easily explosive situation when you've got two people so different in looks and lifestyles.Thanks to some good film-making, certain situations of tension and spontaneity happen and are carried out well. These situations are also very awkward and since we're supposed to map onto the character of Jake more so than Alonzo, we do sort of feel what he's feeling ? again, this is thanks to Washington's amazing performance; especially when he either forces Jake to take a smoke of some drugs or when someone is unexpectedly shot and Jake is panting heavily or even when they drive though a bad neighbourhood and Alonzo states: 'Don't you ever come here without me' as black ghetto gangsters eye up the vehicle. Although this manipulates our opinions on Jake as a bit of a wimp and further makes us think Alonzo is sort of invincible, the payoff for thinking these things is great ? the filmmakers make us think of one thing so much that all the odds seemed stacked against us later on.What was also clever is the way in which the film can change so dramatically ? although not entirely realistic all the time, one situation or setting can very quickly change in an instant. This could include when Jake is in big trouble with some Mexican gangsters but gets out of jail thanks to a previous deed that he did. Although this was a bit of a fluke, it would still be possible in the tightly knitted world of crime that particular city possesses. Although these changes are unpredictable and entertaining, lines must be drawn somewhere especially in which the finale is played out: where several characters seem to switch sides to team up with a guy who they've known of for about twelve hours, which was a little unbelievable.In the long run, Training Day is a very entertaining film that doesn't cover too much ground in terms of innovation or anything deeper than that but it is a clever example of how to suck an audience in and play with them later on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Denzel deserved his Oscar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had never heard of the movie Training Day, until after I saw A Beautiful Mind. Then I had only heard of it because I could not believe how Russell Crowe could have lost the Oscar for best actor. So I researched some critic reviews on Training Day, got my snacks, rented the movie, and sat down to try to figure out why Mr. Washington beat Mr. Crowe.Boy it did not take me long. The very first scene in which Denzel Washington's Alonzo appears, grabbed my attention and made me stand back and say "Okay, I think I'm going to like this performance". However, not only was I absolutely blown away by Mr. Washington's potrayl of a cooked cop, but I found the movie to be extremely enjoyable. Ethan Hawke was a perfect contrast to Washington, and the director and writer did a great job of capturing the feel of such a neighborhood.It's still hard for me to say that Russell Crowe did not deserve to win, however after seeing this movie and knowing what a great actor Mr. Washington is, I can honestly say that I have no complaint with his victory. It was a tough decision to make between the two, but in the end I am glad Mr. Washington got his Oscar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching this movie, I needed some chocolate, or something fun and silly, to get the "ick" out of my brain. There is really only one, or two movies which I have ever seen which have disturbed me in this way, and this is one of them. (The other was "Death Wish", which I saw when I was 19 yrs. old, so it's understandable why it was so disturbing). Why this movie was so disturbing can be summed up in three reasons: 1) a cop never surrenders his gun. Why? why? why is the gun surrendered? The fact that the viewer can understand, that the young officer is trying to trust the corrupt Denzel, is probably what is so disturbing. We KNOW he is blowing it, he should NEVER hand over his gun. And somewhere in his gut, he knows it too.2) The images of the Mexican dude's house, the home, where the rape/murder was going to take place. There was a wife in the home, there were babies in the home, there were crucifixes on the wall. Yet, a disgusting, unacceptable crime was going to occur in the bathroom. Yuck.3) The fact that I, as a viewer, thought that maybe Denzel really was a good guy, and that maybe his "way" was the way, to get the job done, the job of a good guy. So, in simple terms, the fact that I too, along with the new recruit, could have been tricked.I know lots of folks liked this movie. I guess if it turned as many people on as much as it turned my stomach, it must have something!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, despite the reviews of critics nationwide this movie falls way short of it's target to be a gritty if overdone wanna-be-good-cop-goes-bad story. Are critics afraid to pan Denzel?Denzel never convinces us that he was ever more than a thug with a badge. He plays the character so over-the-top in love with himself that he doesn't even know the boys in the hood hate his guts. The role of narcissistic punk comes way to easy to Denzel (but that is true in most of his roles) and he pushes the character way beyond any belief. Hawke never grabs us an innocent but well-meaning guy, just young and really, really dumb (gives the gang his gun to see?). Why do they give a guy a drop-dead beautiful, could be a cover girl wife when it is no part of the story? I thought the story would get back to her, but she was just a distraction.All the characters, like Scott Glenn's, were underdeveloped. If you are a huge Denzel fan you will enjoy this movie as he is on screen non-stop. If you are a movie fan go see something else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw previews for Training Day and foolishly deduced that it was a film with a message, something about street justice versus legal justice. That's not the only reason I'd see this kind of movie; it was just my preception. I didn't get what I expected but I did stay through the whole thing.Denzel plays a psychopathic police officer (impersonator in my opinion) "training" Ethan on his first day as a rookie narc on his way to becoming a detective. Along the way Denzel spouts philosophical mumbo jumbo about street justice and about how he's the real cops and not the guys helping old ladies with their groceries, that sounds real good on previews -hey they got my seven dollars fair and square, right? Unfortunately on the way to possibly becoming something appealing intellectually, it back pedals and turns into an over-the-top action-suspense yarn.In the end I was not satisfied, though I may have been had my expectations not been contrary to the true intentions of the movie. looking back, the best parts of the movie were probably the ones I enjoyed the least- the silly ones. Were I watching in a different state of mind this movie might have grown on me. But don't go out of your way to see it. There's always cable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I got this DVD to see what it was that Denxel Washington did that was so much better that other roles he has played outstandingly. What a disappointment! Consider Denzel's Oscar this year for his body of work, to open the door for more non-white winners, to avoid the threatened botcott, or whatever but puleeze - not for his outstanding performance in this run of the mill violent cop flick. I am reminded of Sylvester Stallone in Copland which was a much better film in this overworked genre. Denzel's performance unfortunately did not add much.By contrast, Will Smith was robbed because his performance as Ali was great and different. Sean Penn was no Dustin Hoffman but did better than Denzel. And of course, in spite of his off screen behaviour and like him or not, Russell Crowe was the best in A Beautiful Mind.Don't waste your time on this film, that is unless you want to see the real Best Supporting Actor performance, a really great turn by Ethan Hawke.</fullReview>

Washington does a good enough job of it. But the reason the entire "training day" took place as it did isn't introduced for a while. Why, or even IF, Washington's Harris decided to pull the stints he did is unclear. Hawke simply follows him around greedily. Not much to the plot anyhow; the complete disregard to mention what is happening to Harris -- instead of focusing only on Hawke's Hoyt -- makes the movie a dull police flop.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Training Day (2001): Dir: Antoine Faqua / Cast: Denzel Washington, Ethan Hawke, Scott Glenn, Tom Bergenger, Harris Yulin: Action thriller about the faults in the justice system. Ethan Hawke prepares for his first day of training on the narcotics team with a meeting with Denzel Washington who plays by his own rules. He begins by forcing Hawke to smoke pot then Washington proceeds to dish out his own brand of justice on the guilty. Hawke can sense trouble as corrupt law caves in leading to an extremely violent climax. Director Antoine Faqua previously made Bait, which contained similar themes. It observes corrupt justice and plays out many scenes with uncertainty. Flawless performance by Washington who is of the law at first appearance before true nature emerges. This is a very different performance from him and that is what render this film viewable above the violence. What is interesting is his downfall right after he yells, "I am the police. King Kong ain't got nothing on me!" Hawke is superb as a cop wanting to do right but forced to comply with wrong. He will be placed in a difficult position in the third act. Unfortunately Scott Glenn and Tom Berenger appear in flat roles leaving only the two leads to carry the film. Average in terms of production, it plays like a cop drama but states a strong case regarding bad company corrupting good character. Score: 6 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clash of Characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What looks like a classic cop/gangster scenario at first glance is much more fascinating when boiled down to the interactions of two very distinct character types. The hardened, loud-mouth, streetwise detective (Denzel Washington) against the quiet, nice-guy rookie, who seemingly has a lot to learn (Ethan Hawke). I'm sure most, if not all, know the type of person that easily and consciously draws attention to themselves. Sometimes they are seen as obnoxious and loud, sometimes as lively and entertaining, but they are always at center stage. And weaker characters, be it due to personality traits, social standing or whatever other reason, are often swept away in the wake of such persons. The prolonged exposure to such a character and the struggle to overcome him is what elevates this movie beyond the standard fare of the genre. The other driving point is the old-fashioned standing up for what is right even against the odds, and while those two unfold nicely, the logical integrity of the actual story may become questionable at times. The gritty portrayal of police work and the urban scenery strive to offer a good amount of realism and are indeed successful if one is able to look past the classic police thriller at the surface (and the display of questionable morals that could be too readily decried as wildly unrealistic). The acting and the technical aspects of the movie, as well as the good pacing, help to enable a good amount of immersion.Overall Training Day is a solid movie whose merits lie beyond an entertaining storyline. It is definitely worth a watch, at the very least to relish Denzel's performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Reality Paradox</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Training Day" is an intelligently produced police/corruption movie, which presents us with some very realistic, and very scary situations, showing us that in the big bad world, there are no laws, no rules - only the dictates of angry mobs, and guys with guns. And the environment of menace, and grimness is created expertly. And yet, having appreciated this movie for what it is, I could never bring myself to watch it again. That's because, as good as the acting may be, it's very difficult to enjoy this film overall, not because of its' content, but because of its' approach to the subject matter. To be brutally honest, it compromises its' own integrity, in a way that superior "realistic"dramas, like "Taxi Driver", and "Get Carter", would never dream of doing. All of which raises the main problem about the movie: something which I like to refer to as "the reality paradox."Basically, it goes something like this: If a film presented a totally realistic account of street life, or police corruption, then it would not be an entertaining two hours of your life. Real life is devoid of dramatic incidents, of heroes and villains, and of moral boundaries, as well as of generally insightful dialogue. Therefore, to be "realistic", in that sense, means to be dramatically lacking. Realism is often attempted, but more often than not, the writers realise the need to spice things up with those old Hollywood clichés: in "Training Day"'s case, there's car chases, a rooftop fight of ridiculous proportions, in which both Alonzo and Hoyt would definitely never walk away from, and a last half hour which totally dissolves the powerfully mature atmosphere which had been built up. That's why I cannot consider "Training Day" to be a realistic film, although it is peppered with insightful moments.What it is, is a tour of a really nasty city, presented in an extremely threatening and scummy fashion. I cannot fault Denzel Washington's acting, and even Ethan Hawke (whom I rather dislike as an actor) gives a good account of himself. What I can fault, is the narrative of the movie itself. The world of "Training Day", IS believable. It is nasty, and unsanitised. But the story which the movie tells, is flawed considerably, because of its' self conscious theatricality, and rather perverse logic twists. Hawke would not have lasted nearly as long as he did in this neck of the woods. When he's about to get shot in the bath, I sincerely doubt that one lucky coincidence would stop three sinister nutcases from killing him, and it is at this point, that the movie starts to collapse. Hawke has been easily manipulated by Washington's cop all the way through, so his sudden desire to hunt him down seems ludicrous. To be fair, when Roger is killed, I'd find it equally hard to believe that the rest of the cops would not kill Hawke, in best "Serpico" fashion, even if Denzel wants to keep him alive as his master fall guy - which seems a touch Machievellian to be taken seriously. Hawke may be reluctant to kill in cold blood and smoke weed, but he doesn't seem principled enough to risk his neck to take down Alonzo, just to satisfy his own sense of justice. The ending is far too clichéd, and out of touch with the more visceral realism of the rest of the movie. And, I'm sorry, but why would the neighbourhood scum not just gun Hawke down in the final confrontation? Stretching reality too much, for a downbeat ending which makes you wonder whether or not the whole two hours was worth your while, and Alonzo's death seems to be a big, clichéd full stop to a film which, if it had the courage of its' first ninety minutes, would not have had a proper ending, and would definitely have seen Hawke dead by the time the end credits roll. So,is "Training Day" a great movie? It's well made, by a director with a brain, and a sense of the macabre nature of everyday street life. But, it's far too afraid to go all out, and be really realistic. Just enough to make you scared, but not enough to really make you think. As a piece of entertainment, as a story, as an imaginative vision, "Training Day" is definitely lacking, and it's bolted on thriller elements clash with its' grisly realistic moments. Did I enjoy it? Honestly? No. I didn't. But I respected it. An "A" for effort, but a "C" for content.</fullReview>

Washington plays an experienced, but corrupted narcotics detective and Hawke as a rookie, but a very loyal detective. Both did very well in their roles, especially Washington which got him an Oscar. Besides the main themes of this movie, it also shows how people change because of corruption and unreliability, therefore portraying the film very realistically. I also liked the fact that despite differences, Harris and Hoyt got along throughout the movie and during the last part, turned against each other: another lesson to learn - money can break anything, even friendship. Good movie, 10 out of 10, i recommend it, a lot of lessons to be learnt.</fullReview>

The Film Is Shot In Such A Gritty And Compelling Way Which Lends The Film Such Gravity And Realism. David Ayer's Script Is Intelligent, Taut, And Totally Fearless. As Good As The Script May Be, The Performances Of Hwake And Washington Elevate The Film To Riveting Heights. Everyone Knows That Denzel Washington Is A Great Actor, He Won The Academy Award For This Role, But Anyone Who Doubts The Talents Of Ethan Hawke Will Be Stunned By The Great Performance That He Delivers In This Film. The Story Is Compelling, Even If The Ending Is Less Than Satisfying. I Highly Recommend "Training Day" For The Powerful Filmmaking On Display And The Terrific Performances By Ethan Hawke And Denzel Washington.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the first day one would expect to have</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly I must say I am surprised to have not seen this incredible movie till date. But better late than never. So after finally watching the movie i am writing this review. The best part about training day is that it grips you from the very first scene. It doesn't give time for you to sink in and get absorbed in the semi dark appeal of it (which at least i felt). It engages from the first scene and confuses you at various moments leaving you mystified as to what exactly will the next scene be (something i assume that every movie buff loves - unpredictability). Denzel Washington like always delivers an incredible performance. But its Ethan Hawke who stands up and delivers a performance equally good as his co-star. The story is well written and aptly portrayed. My favorite moment in the movie is the conversation of the two leads after having interrogated a woman in her house</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate to break the news to you guys but cops like Alonzo ARE OUT THERE and need to be acknowledged. Acting like the problem doesn't exist does not solve it. You don't have to go that deep to know that Alonzo was once a good cop who just got fed up w/ 'police procedures.' If you acknowledge that Jake's shallow-mindedness at the beginning of the film only allows him to look at the perks of making detective and how the progress of the day transforms him, you can really appreciate Ethan's portrayal of him. Let's face it, a bad day at the office when you're a narcotics detective differs greatly from that of an office executive and the different stresses can warrant different results.Even the street rhetoric was authentic. Maybe you guys need to get out of the 'burbs more. You guys didn't actually expect eloquent dialogue with little or no profanity, did you? The only part of this movie I struggle with is Dr. Dre's terrible overacting and that isn't nearly enough to take away from the overall result.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are 2 scenes in this movie that will just always stay with you:1- The bathtub scene 2- Alonso's "Kingkong" speechThe acting is superb. Denzel seems really comfortable in his role as bad cop and Ethan Hawke is the perfect casting for the insecure rookie that gets confronted with challenge and choice between good and bad every 10 minutes or so in the movie. What I also find really well done is the fact that the entire movie takes place during one day and not more. It really adds to the tension and realism of it all.Wonderful movie...anyone who likes action without too much special effects will love this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Training Day" is a very awesome movie. This is one of the best cop movies to come out of Hollywood in years. Denzel won an academy award for best actor for his role as Alonzo Harris. And he deserved it. Ethan Hawke was nominated an academy award for best supporting actor for his role as Jake Hoyte but he did not win it. I thought he did an outstanding job. In this movie, Denzel Washingtons role was not his usual good guy roles. He plays a police officer who was once a good cop who now administrates his own brand of justice and is fed up with by the book police procedures. He is more mean than the mean streets he is supposed to be shaking down. This movie has a good plot, top notch acting, the cinematography is well done and it is very well paced. If you are a fan of Denzel Washingtons films, I would recommend Training Day. It is definitely worth a watch and time well spent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He Don't Need No Training</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much like Nicole Kidman in To Die For, this Training Day was a Denzel Washington vehicle. Both movies were ho-hum, but held the character of a lifetime and is highly recommended just on their command performance.This is not to underplay Hawke's almost (90%) equally acting ? he was very good, himself, but Washington was so good, that when I first saw this back in 2001, long before the Oscar Nominations were announced, I said: "He better both be nominated and win." On a side note, unfortunately for Washington Fans ? he has tried to recapture this high since and that's made me very sad to say I once was a devote Washington follower. Meaning: almost every role since 2001's Training Day, he has screamed "OSCAR!" without acting much.But, I digress, this is about Training Day, a good (again, not great) film, but one you should see concerning the troubling day both Rookie Hoyt (Hawke) and Harris (Washington) are having.Eager to please and diligent to keep his job for his growing family, Hoyt is joining the narcotics hard-core L.A. team, but he needs to deal with drama-filled Harris, who may (or may not) be on the take with the crooks he's paid to take down. (Watch FX's excellent series The Shield for further adventures on the same plane.) You see, Harris might be in over his head with a deal/incident gone wrong in Las Vegas, pissing off the wrong people, despite his demeanor. And he must trust the Clark Kent'ish Hoyt if he's to get away with it.That's pretty much it. I don't want to spoil much more than that, and the fact I brought up The Shield, which covers pretty much the same ground. That's pretty much it?for the plot. Watch this fantastic performance from Denzel who, up to this point of his excellent career, hadn't played a true baddie. And he does it in spades. It's worth the Orientation Day for him alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Detective Alonzo Harris believes he is in the wild west, having to bend and break rules to keep peace on the streets, but new recruit, Jake Hoyt is not too comfortable with Alonzo's radical approach.This is a film about the mean streets and the things that need to be done to survive, but I did not find this film the least bit interesting, Hoyt character was far too much of a coward, and Alonzo was just annoying, maybe that was Denzel's intention...Eva Mendez was stunning as ever, here her appearance is limited, the one aspect of the film I did find interesting was the deal with the Russians, I felt more could have been emphasised about Alonzo's money problem. Having a bunch of rappers make appearances did not give the film any real credibility..I expected better from Mister Washington....But the end scene was great, as Alonzo met his fate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Training Day is, as you already know, set in only one day in Los Angeles and is about a rooster (Ethan Hawke's character: the rookie cop Jake Hoyt) and a wolf (Denzel Washington's character: the experienced big narcotics detective Alonzo Harris). Is as simple as this: the film begins and is sort of having the experienced big detective who certainly knows how is that world opening the eyes of the rookie who just wants to track down big drug dealers, who just wants to do a good for the society. The transition we have is that Jake stops seeing Alonzo as the type of dude he has to learn a whole lot from to can deal with the new type of world he is entering and be successful and starts seeing Alonzo as nothing but a criminal that well tried to kill him, if at one point Jake smoked some weed because Alonzo said to him, in other things, that a good narcotics agent must know and love narcotics at one point Jake will go for his revenge. Saw bits of the making of documentary from the DVD?incredible level of reality? Unforgettable minor characters? Not quite (the part with everybody turning their backs on Alonzo is like from a kids movie!); the acting of both Denzel and Ethan is good of course, pretty much their acting is the very best thing of the film, I mean I didn't found unforgettable and memorable characters in the ones played by Snoop Dog, Dr. Dree and well anybody else. It's a watchable film that once is over, well let's see, recently I bought the double feature DVD with both Training Day and Fallen (also with Denzel Washington and directed by Gregory Hoblit) just because I wanted to see again Antoine Fuqua's film again after many years (I remember seeing it when it was brand new as a rental). In that DVD Training Day is pretty much the main attraction and Fallen the bonus, minor feature (I never heard a thing before about Fallen), the Side A with "Day" has much more extras and stuff. Now that I saw Fuqua's film pretty much Fallen has all the chances to become the only reason for me to say something like "well, buying that DVD was a great choice" since basically by the end of Training Day I was like "that's all?", certainly for me now Fallen has not a really good contender for being the best out of the two films on the DVD but I will see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent display of corruption.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Training Day is a the perfect example of corruption, violence, and drug dealing issues inside police.Alonso Harris is a character that will be always remembered for it's realism; people like him sadly exist. Is it for low incomes? Is it for the desire of power? "Training Day" perfectly explains Alonso's behavior through many violent scenes that not necessarily deal with phyiscal violence, but also with drug abuse, corruption, sexual matters, and also display situations that start with home.The movie is very intelligent because through Ethan Hawke's character we learn that not every single cop member is the same; in fact, the good cops follow a long hard road before becoming corrupt and more. Through his character, we learn that not only good intentions are needed to fight against crime...So "Training Day" is in my opinion one of the best cop movies ever made because it doesn't follow the typical "cop features" and goes further and insert sub-plots that satisfy the new millennium tendencies.Please watch Denzel Washington's extraordinary performance. Also, there are many interesting cameos like from Snoop Dogg.</fullReview>

The movie is intense and I can't pass on a picture about a corrupt police officer and who better than Denzel. I was gripped to the screen the entire time. He has always done a great performance with movies involving gangsters and the ghettos, the violent sides of society. His being a police officer added a bunch to the movie and really increased the interest. He is actually a gangster at heart yet is a cop so feels he has power over people and may do whatever he wishes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a good movie, but not perhaps for the same reasons as a lot of people will give merit for. Denzel Washington is on form, won't deny that. The film is well shot, a look at the darker side of LA.I think watching this again, that it does look a little silly and stereotypical sometimes. Blacks and Hispanics and college kids. Also, some of the events or shots or scripting does seem a little 'theatrical' and 'staged', rather than flowing in such a way that we can 'buy' the story. That being said, it does deliver the goods. Training day is one of these films that is not really escapism, it is just a fictional story. The real world of law enforcement can be and is (within reason) a dirty and corrupt empire. It's easier to have a Black or Hispanic scapegoat, or somebody to pull over just for kicks or for another notch in the Detective post.It's an enjoyable watch. I'm not sure how I would feel about it if the two leads were not who they were. Washington rules the roost, and the camera. Hawke plays the honest, determined and somewhat under confident rookie very effectively. I like films like this, and No Country for Old men, and Traffic simply because they help remind me that I do not live in a a perfumed world, and sometimes it is merely sugar coated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Denzel - STILL my man !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I could not have picked a better time to watch Training Day as I am going into a career of Law enforcement my-self. From the beginning I understood the situation which a new recruit faces from his superiors and what the pressures are of being a cop as it is. Ethan Hawke does a wonderful job of being a stranger and making us take the ride with him and when he meets Alonso Harris who is unforgettably played by Denzel 'American Gangster' Washington. Training Day is an account of life both for a cop working the rough streets of LA and also if you do your research you learn that it also involves real crips,bloods and various other gangs with their input which means that you get an authentic taste of what life is like for those living and growing up in one of these rough hoods. What makes Alonso Harris scar your mind is that he is not your average Dirty Harry wannabe but he is more like a resourceful , intelligent street wise cop with his Jekell/Hyde tendency's which makes him a joy to watch and no one could of carried this of in style like Denzel. The most shocking thing is that to all of them this was everyday life but unlike us who will be completely blown away by its power . My only problem with Training Day is that it just skips up a notch too fast and misses out some important factors but the stand out performance all the way through are what save this movie. To conclude Training Day is a movie that offers an experience which is hard to put into words , it offers an experience which has to viewed to be felt but all I can say is that this proof why Denzel Washington is one of the most talented black actors to have graced the silver screen , A MUST SEE !TRAINING DAY : 8.6 OUT OF 10THE ONLY MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE LINE BEING CROSSED, IS THE COP WHO WILL CROSS IT...</fullReview>

I read some reviews, on here, and frankly I'm astounded that someone will criticise the performance and the film. Its quite obvious that if you didn't like this movie , this isn't your genre. Don't go see it, don't rent it and don't make your comments know. If this isn't your genre ,you don't know Jack about how well made this film was.

		<shortDescription>How to Enter the Hampa</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Antoine Fuqua does an excellent job. With the big screen as an excuse, he imposes his dark, sinister view on the hampa of the Los Angeles police.Corruption is the main, but that is the work of Alonzo Harris, a great neo-villain, that doesn't value life and has understood it as a grim, violent place and has moderated himself to it. Denzel Washington is superb, mean looks, nasty bad reactions seeming so natural, I cannot believe he isn't a real filthy cop! Ethan Hawke's character is somehow naive, doesn't know what really is going all and cannot adjust to the rhythm Alonzo is accustomed to. Alonzo sets the rhythm, as a matter of fact, so we just ground for Jake (E.Hawke) to survive his rough trip."Training Day" is rough, a good movie that counted on the budget to tell a raw story, with a great cast and some neat narrative skills. Its a bitching' movie, you should watch it.</fullReview>

A diverse city famed for its moviestars and multi-millionaire producers, but also for its notorious gangs and police corruption.Denzel Washington gives a superb performance as Alonzo Harris, an experienced detective whose unorthodox and corrupt methods of dealing with crime are about to come to a stop when he takes on rookie cop Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke). Set in the ganglands of LA over an intense 24 hour period, Training Day is a great look at corruption, deception and disloyalty in the LAPD. Washington's character, where it is often interpreted as the bad guy, is somehow misunderstood. Yes of course, Alonzo Harris pushes the law further and further, and his operations are unlawful but simultaneously he doesn't hesitate to do his job."A top notch crime drama""Denzel Washington is exceptional, in his Academy Award Winning role""Brutal and uncompromising; an intelligent, thought provoking thriller ****"</fullReview>

When i got the DVD i discovered that the extras go a long way in helping to understand the way the movie seems so real and where the director, and all those making the movie were coming from. In an uncompromising way the film shows a world that is totally corrupt (in this case the LAPD). The reason that i love this film is because the world (or at least those in power for the past 500 years, respectively) IS totally corrupt. Nice nation leaders get beat back by all the bullies, all the time, and probably for all time!. I love the US TV show 'Law &amp; Order'. I love the older cop with his droopy face and his 'happy-go-lucky'/zen Buddhist attitude to things.But training day, that's like the real world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed but Entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched the movie for the second time. I wasn't impressed like the first time, but still liked it. This movie hasn't got any depth beyond the plot, this is not Fight Club or Sixth Sense, where watching the film second time around, reveals some details you didn't see before. Here the second watch didn't add anything new to me (except of finding new holes in the plot), but I still liked it and haven't got any disgusting feelings about it as others did. I wasn't bored either.First of all I liked the plot.I liked the idea of the whole movie taking place in one day. And most of all I liked the acting of the leading roles. Specially of Denzel Washington (and I really don't care about the award). I really don't understand most of the complaints people have about this movie. It's not perfect and there are some plot holes ( which most of the complaints don't even touch), but even though it's entertaining. And definitely not the worst movie like some say. Of course there were movies about "bad cop - good cop" , but not in this scheme. I think it had even some originality in it. And if you don't like Violence in movies - don't see it. But don't say you hate this movie because of the violence. Training Day's genre is violence. Finally to the character of Alonzo. I honestly think that Russel Crow should have the Oscar. He had a much deeper character to portray (in Beautiful mind), and did an excellent job with it. Nevertheless, the character of Alonzo was about one of the worst kind of people that there are on earth ( and if you see some documentary investigation, you understand that such people exist). Don't complain that you didn't like the character, I hated him either, that's why I think Denzel Washington made a great effort. Some credit to Ethan Hawke also.Some holes in the plot: 1) I think the most visible one, and the most annoying is the one-to-million coincidence of Lisa being the cousin of Smiley. What chances that Lisa's wallet would save Hoyt? 2) Hoyt isn't used to narcotics and we see it on the effect the drugs have on him. But so strong of an effect should have take longer in time to recover from it. 3) After Smiley releases Jake he immediately goes to Alonzo's house. How did he remember where Alonzo lives? He couldn't remember it from one ride being on narcotics. 4) At the end of the movie Hoyt got serious beating from Alonzo. He was face smashed through the window, got hit with a chair, kicked and punched and after all that he managed to stand back and ready to fight again in a couple of minutes.As I said. This movie is flawed, but still entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me try and explain my feelings about this film. First of all, Denzel Washington was excellent in this. He deserved the award for best actor, and rightly so, for his work in this film. I hated him in this movie because I hated his character. Which should tell you how good a job he did in the movie. When you hate someone's character in a movie, so much, that generally means we're talking Academy Award. However, I don't think I was meant to hate the movie, too.A new rookie on his first day of Narcatics, meets with his unit leader at ten a.m. Already nervous, about making the team, he has no idea just how nervous he'll be by the end of the day. After only spending two hours with his leader, Hawke starts to become aware of what kind of cop he's dealing with, but only by the end of the film, do we really see what we the audience are given to deal with as well.Ethan Hawke was great in this too, and in some ways I think that he's a better actor than Washington. But, to be fair, Denzel is the star of this movie, and you can't take your eyes off of him, because of his performance in it.Again, it's hard for me to even understand how I felt about the film. I liked it and I thought it was well-written, but it just seemed like such a dark film, and I almost wanted to turn it off sometimes, because it was so frustrating. But, I liked it well enough to give it a seven. So, there we are. Definitely not a film for anyone under seventeen, and not only is there some substance abuse, nudity, language, adult subject matter, and violence, but there is also some scenes that are very heavy to handle.Good performance though, and again...I loved it because I hated it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loud, Over-the-Top Movie That Tries Too Hard for Street Cred</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Spoiler Alert in below review)"Training Day" desperately tries to achieve "street cred" and just winds up overshooting its target. This movie would have been much more effective (and realistic) if it'd gone for a more low-key approach. The problem with today's Hollywood is that the first rule of movie-making is always MORE, MORE, MORE. But the subtle, low-key approach has its advantages. It would have given this movie the street credibility that it so desperately tries to achieve. Yes, there are rogue, out-of-control cops in America in real-life. It'd be nice if we could get a half-way realistic film about this problem. But instead, we get this loud, over-the-top, ham-fisted movie that won't have any more real-world impact than the latest superhero/comic book movie. A more subtle, low-key movie could maybe have shed a little light on the rogue cop phenomenon (and perhaps even let us relate to the rogue cops on some level and understand what drives them to act the way they do). In fact, it appears that this movie makes at least a half- hearted effort to achieve just that. But it fails. Maybe some people in the audience related to why the Denzel character acted the way he did. But I thought he was just a one- dimensional jerk who was abusing the badge.A lot of his dialogue was presented as being a lot more profound than it really was. Actually, a lot of it (along with his actions) didn't make a lot of sense (spoiler alert) starting with the premise of bringing a new guy along on a day of outrageous antics that would have shocked the most jaded, crooked veteran rogue cop.This movie not only fails as a work of art, it is an insult to real- life police officers.</fullReview>

Antoine Fuqua is a genius of the action. In addition, the movie has memorable scenes, as the scene of the racketeers, a scene summit of maximum suspense.The scene of the racketeers is really terrifying and scary as hell, it paralyzed me, I've never seen equal ever. Alonzo Harris is a sadistic, disagreeable and unforgettable villain. A truly police classic that you can watch again, again and again. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

This movie should have been nominated for Best Picture. It may have been one of the best films of 2001.This is about a rookie cop named Jake Hoyt and his dream is to be a narc so he can make his family's life better. He gets put into the supervision of veteran narc Alonzo. It turns out that Alonzo ain't like most cops.Denzel Washington deserved his Oscar. If anyone one else won it would have been an outrage. Ethan Hawke had a very convincing performance as well.Overall, Antoine Fuqua directed an action-packed thriller that is one of the best of 2001. I rate this film 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ethan Hawke has a "Training Day" - from hell - and learns that his trainer (Denzel Washington) is way out there in this 2001 film directed by Antoine Fuqua. Featured in the film are Scott Glenn, Tom Berenger, Harris Yulin, Eva Mendes, and Snoop Dogg.Hawke is a young family man, Jake, who is teamed up with a decorated narcotics detective, Alonzo, to see if Jake has what it takes to work the street and go undercover. Alonzo is a very unsettling guy - joking one minute, mean the next - and Jake doesn't know quite how to take him. He just knows the job means a lot to him.Gradually it dawns on him that a) Alonzo is more corrupt than any of the perpetrators he says he's after; and b) he's setting Jake up so that he's part of some dirty work and therefore won't be able to talk.Really top-notch, edgy performance from Denzel Washington, who is always full of surprises, here playing an unpredictable character. This was his Oscar winning role, and it was deserved, though there's no question that he deserved it in the past too. The film is full of action, violence, and really raw characters - one certainly gets a sense of the mean streets from watching this film. Ethan Hawke acts just as a man who doesn't know what's going on would - unsure, embarrassed, nervous, scared, but very determined and quick-thinking, as he realizes what he's gotten himself into.Shocking, violent, bloody, and fast - that about sums it up. Some excellent performances along the way, too, from everyone involved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Performances, Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without a doubt, Denzel Washington's performance in this movies is outstanding. Nevertheless, a lot of people criticize the plot while underlining that ''Training Day'' is not too great a movie to deserve any other acknowledgment. From my point of view, those statements are false because especially Washington's and Hawke's performances make this movie worth watching, plus, the plot much more interesting. Additionally, director Fuqua did a superb job, which is characterized by a magnificent authenticity in the presentation of Los Angeles' suburban areas. Again, I recommend this movie heavily, if you love gangster movies, then you cannot afford to miss this one. Generally, Alonzo Harris' quotes are legendary: ''To protect the sheep you gotta catch the wolf, and it takes a wolf to catch a wolf.'' - ''This s***'s chess, it ain't checkers''.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining Fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is not Donnie Brasco. It is isn't based upon truth. It is more in the spirit of Bad Lieutenant. Denzel Washington plays a corrupt, insane cop. If you overlook the implausibility of this movie, it is still quite entertaining. The acting is great. Washington definitely captures a really insane character. Although his portrayal is fictitious, there is a grain of truth. It must be very difficult being a narc in 21st Century L.A. However, even as over-the-top as Washington's portrayal, you realize that a cop could be more dangerous than a criminal, if "under the radar". Ethan Hawke is also great as a very good cop, but a little naive. Hawke's character is manipulated and charmed into submission by the Washington's "evil cop". The ending of the movie was the best part. Despite having a certain fear of the evil cop's authority, in the end you find out that he was really despised. Hawke's good cop is actually saved in one scene by an earlier act of decency on his part. The evil cop eventually is destroyed and revealed as a power-hungry, sick individual that he truly is. In conclusion, don't expect believability. However, if you want to be entertained, this is a movie to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alonzo and Hoyt - both wolfs and sheep</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Something I think Actors try so hard to do is to change the state of mind of their characters. Alonzo and Hoyt both encounter situations where they have to be scared as well as suck up to people. Hoyt is an uncomfortable, twitchy man when he meets Alonzo and Alonzo is just as uncomfortable when he meets the Wise Men. Their characters change so well it makes me feel great knowing they actually bothered to earn the awards they got. I think all wannabe actors should watch the uncomfortable scenes where Hoyt tries his best to match Alonzo's style and swagger in the car. Alonzo too, plays on Hoyt's fear and nervousness so well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Training Day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen many Denzel Washington films, but this might just be his masterpiece. From watching Denzel in other films, i never thought that i could ever see him play the antagonist. But to my surprise he did a wonderful job. The way that he allowed us to see that his character was this brutal, uncaring person that was only looking out for himself; its what makes him such a stupendous actor.I also have to say that the film was very well directed. this movie was authentic, it shows some of the things that happen in real life and in the real world. some of the pressure that is put on some police officer in the corrupt world of the law.It is good to know that there is some officer that would still rather do the right thing, just like how Jake (Ethan Hawke) did.Nevertheless in my opinion this is the best movie all of the actors in training day have worked in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Denzel Washington is excellent as Alonzo, a tough street wise cop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a great movie. I would put this movie between the best movies for men besides "the good, the bad and the ugly", "pulp fiction", "die hard 1 &amp; 2" and "predator". Denzel Washington's performance as a tough cop Alonzo is terrific. For me there are just 2 movies "pulp fiction" and "training day" that have made me feel an exciting fast ride sensation since the first minute until the end.The plot is about the first day of work of a rookie policeman called Jake (Ethan Hawke)who have to learn about the job from a tough street wise cop named Alonzo. During the day Jake is surprised how Alonzo handles different police's situations in a not by the book way, but Alonzo tells him this is how things are done in the field because you have to be a wolf in order to protect the sheep. Will Jake agree with Alonzo's methods to do the job?..... I think a 7.5 is the correct grade for "training day" for its worth as a movie, but i give it a 10 because of the emotion that made me feel despite its common Hollywood's final. I think if this movie would have had a more realistic final part, "training day" would be considered one of the great movies of the decade and not just as a good action movie. This is one of my all time favorite movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>major problem with this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning! SPOILERS galore!I was genuinely interested in this film to begin with... and I absolutely loved the acting of both Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke.BUT - about three quarters of the way through this thing I could no longer suspend disbelief.There are just too many things that accumulate for this film to be taken as seriously as it could have been...Yes, there are rogue cops out there. That is not my problem with this film. It probably comes extremely close to the truth when showing how corrupt the cops can be - and also probably very close to what the streets and their scum are like.The problem is with what happens to Ethan Hawke during the day in the life ... First problem. He smokes some pot laced with crack. He is totally out of his head... but probably not long enough to be realistic. He should probably have been almost totally knocked out for several hours... but it seems like only an hour or so after being high he is charging down a street and capturing totally by himself two would-be rapists... Not bloody likely. (And while I'm at it, I can't imagine real cops walking away from the perps leaving them with their handcuffs on... they would have at least taken back their equipment!Please remember that one of the rapists kicks Ethan in the side at least two or three times during their scuffle. Second: Ethan gets beaten up a second time by the hoods in the house where he is left by Washington. Sorry, but anyone who has been beaten up once by rapists and then beaten up a second time by these hoods would have been barely able to walk or do anything for the rest of the night. But not Ethan... he goes after Washington, and not only gets into a tumbledown fight that should ALSO have left him totally unable to move - but he actually jumps off a roof onto the windshield of a moving car and is STILL able to walk and operate on a pretty high level. Sorry, but if anyone reading this has ever taken even a quarter of the punishment Ethan does in this film, they would know that he would have been inoperative for most of the day... and certainly not in any shape to get through the last quarter hour of this film; Like, who is this guy, anyway? Superman?Third: How many 4 year old kids do you know that would trust a guy he's never met more than his own father? How many women who greet their man the way Washington's girlfriend (wife?) does when they stop off for lunch - would abandon him so quickly near the end? She grabs up her kid but does nothing to help protect Washington... and there is no explanation of why.I could go on - but why bother? There are so many holes in this film that although I liked much of it - and could believe the angle of the rogue cops etc... there is just no way that someone like Ethan would have been able to physically make it through this day.Oh, and by the way - in a town of how many millions, what would the odds be that the ONE 14 year-old girl who Ethan saves from being raped would turn out to be related to one of the hoods who is supposed to have killed him for Washington? Oh, come on! That is the weakest part of the entire plot. Could anyone who took two seconds to THINK really accept such a corny device? One would have better odds trying to win the lottery!All of this means that the film is really pretty stupid - or taking its audience for dunces... The only reason I gave this film a 6 instead of a 4 is because it is well-shot and well- acted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pointless theme-ride through the LA gutter, despite good acting and production values.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Police and thieves are such a staple of TV that you have to be looking at making something special to make one stand out as a feature film.Here the producers try and make things bigger, bolder and more extreme but, sadly, this only makes the production more hysterical and far-fetched. No cop in the history of the force is quite as down-and-dirty as the one played here by Denzil Washington. Indeed he is probably as out-there as any cop in the history of cinema cops!Excess and success have often been mistaken for one another in the Oscar world and here Denzil took the main prize with this good, but hardly great, performance. The guy can grin and talk in double time (this guy knows about speech rhythm and stress - which is rare for an American actor), but this must have been a poor year. Nathan Hawke is actually just as good as the rookie that may - or may not - be corrupted.Here we are in "blacktown after-dark" (for those that have seen Kentucky Fried Movie!) and you can be sure that the minute they step out of the car there will be gunshots, a chase and a death. Yes it is quite lively and the street hoods do look the real deal, but so what, they probably are the real deal!I feel for Hawke, the cop he is playing is a moron so he can only react not act. Hope he gets his own star gig soon - he looks ready.There are plenty of other movies that leave a horrible aftertaste - Boyz in the Hood, Menace 2 Society, Taxi Driver, to name but three - but there films have some social comment to make. This doesn't. This says: It is all rotten, it is all without hope. Bad places have bad cops so they are part of the problem not part of the solution. There is no redeeming qualities here. It is just a pointless theme ride through the LA gutter. Sadly it won't be the last.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Training Day was a plotless cop movie that is made worse by the fact that it won an Academy Award. Denzel Washington is an over the top, rogue cop that doesn't do anything rewarding of an award. He kills, steals and murders yadda yadda yadda. Seen it a million times in a hundred other movies. And the performance isn't that great. I give Ethan Hawke some credit, for at least his character is believable and he does a decent job of moving the plot along. What little plot there is. Basically, it doesn't make that much sense. Bad cop versus good cop. From there, its up to the viewer to fill in the gaping holes. Overall, there are a bunch of other movies that do it better, one being L.A. Confidential. Go rent that rather than this tired, rough movie totally undeserving of any such awards.</fullReview>

Ethan Hawke flops through his role like a fish out of water, and what is the deal with the "3 wise men"? Looked to be some type of X-files rip off. Anyway, just a waste of time.</fullReview>

Basically, he should have won for Malcolm X, and then he did a bunch of bad movies, so they were overanxious to give him one. Both actors do good work here, and I like Denzel in general, but there is nothing special about these roles.

		<fullReview>In a twist on the generic buddy movie, Ethan Hawke is a naive rookie narcotics officer paired for the day with veteran rogue Denzel Washington. Throughout one twenty-four hour period, Hawke finds himself involved in scandals and corrupt business, all the fault of dirty cop Washington. Fair for its grit and tension between the two lead characters, but unapplausable for its generic approach. Denzel Washington won an Oscar for his role, and it sure shows, and not in a good way; it seems overly obvious that the lead man crafted his role not to entertain, but to obtain a gold statue. His Alonzo Harris character is obviously a corrupt rip-off of Popeye Doyle (from "The French Connection"). Hopeless in some places, while Hawke and a slew of other minor characters save the day in a supporting manner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was hyped up so much cuz Denzel was playing a "bad" guy now. My problem isnt with that. My issue is with the Oscars for giving him the award for this particular movie. He was great, no doubt, but he's done better movies with more compelling stories. It's like it was a handout for playing something more true to his "race". I thought the film was gritty enough and showed that cops can be turned from seeing what they see all the time. The film was good at presenting that side instead of the justice for side. Ethan Hawke kinda took a backseat to Denzel's power in this film. It was necessary however so Hawke could determine for himself if he wanted that life badly enough. It made me wonder how many cops are like that and if there really is any justice left when within the police lie people like Alonzo. Not too bad a film, but you have to have a penchant for films about bad cops, and I don't. Even with Denzel in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic premise, but too much 'bad-Denzel' for the film's own good ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boy, was Denzel Washington good at being bad ! You almost have the feeling that he had fun portraying Detective Alonzo Harris, the corrupt cop and mentor, during the titular "Training Day" of Jake Hoyt, the rookie played no less convincingly by Ethan Hawke. Both actors would be nominated for the Oscar, but only Washington took it home. This is how persuasively villainous he was. The recognition also came from the American Film Institute that put him #50 of the Top American villains, the last spot but to his defense, he was the most recent entry. Anyway, « Training Day » has been remembered ever since as the « Bad Guy Denzel Movie ».Washington had fun and it sure shows, he gives a figure that is not that unfamiliar for cop-movies buffs a larger-than-life vibe, he's on the screen for less than twenty seconds that you know you're onto a great creation, a narc cop dressed like a Black Panther or Black Muslim militant, a gangsta goatee and a black beanie, a smile that would make any small-time thug freeze from fear. How come an actor with such a friendly face can get so intimidating, sure part of the merit comes from Washington's performance, but it also owes to Ethan Hawke who, as Jake Hoyt, is the perfect counterpart to Washington's alpha male confidence. And their first exchanges in the restaurant shows with a few words that these men are separated by experience, equaling in such a dirty racket, to an eternity.Hoyt lives in a modest apartment with his wife and a 9-month daughter, his dream is to climb the social ladder, which in the Police, means he must pass the 'danger' square. The training day is Hoyt's opportunity to make his bones, his career depends on it. That perfectly sets up his character, he's a man determined to succeed and be a good police officer. Part of his learning will consist on discovering that both goals can cancel out one another, yet the film would've been too cynical had it been the culmination of the 'coming-of-age' learning. It's not a movie about the disciple outranking the mentor, but the disciple learning a few ropes from the mentor and still be able to stick to his values. And that's what, in my humble opinion, emerges from the first exchanges, Harris is a static character, Hoyt evolves, and part of the interest relies on Jake's evolution. And that works most of the time.The problem with « Training Day » is that it gets so wrapped up on that premise of Washington being the villain that it is almost used like a gimmick, and Hoyt's evolution is only limited by the scope of that training day, we never get to know what changed exactly in his view and how that will affect his future. The film takes a conventional turn to a personal face-off between the good and the bad guy, which in the final act, is a bit of a let down compared to the whole 'close to reality' card it played right at the beginning. "Training Day" tries to be many things at the same time, for its own good. Let's get it straight, it never ceases to be entertaining, and this is a good movie, but it could have been so much grander had it chosen not to focus much on Alonzo Harris. In my opinion, he should've been the supporting role, which, technically, he was, as he literally 'supported' the most interesting character's arc.God, that whole first hour of « Training Day » is a terrific slice of post-September-11 era, these times I couldn't imagine I'd be nostalgic of. Even the casting of Snoop Dogg as one of the informers gives the film a little edge by encapsulating the post-Millennium day where urban violence, rap and money contributed heavily to Pop Culture imagery, where the sight of death wasn't a taboo anymore. In a way, Alonzo Harris is an efficient villain because he's emblematic of his time, being a Cop with a 'C' like in cynical, corrupt and charismatic. Yet, it's with Hoyt that I related, as a Millennium kid who wanted to believe there's a part of goodness to take from society, wishing he wouldn't fall in that trap Harris kept luring him into. I also identified with the relationship between the rookie and his new boss, something I've had enough experience to appreciate the realistic way it was conveyed in the film.You know these first days at work, where you're being taken by your coach or top manager everywhere and you feel so useless between all these people who know each other. Indeed, that's why the first day is always the worst : each impression you give is the first, and in Hoyt's business, a bad impression is something he can't afford. You're also the most recent newcomer, the one who knows the least people, this is how marginal you are. The wisest thing is to shut up, to listen, to learn. Hoyt has no other choices than listening to Harris, and Harris is no stupid, he takes advantage from it and cunningly toys with Hoyt's eagerness to prove his value, and isn't that the biggest trap you can fall in. And as the day progresses, you can feel the distance widening between Hoyt and Harris, and I hoped the movie could focus on Hoyt because Harris didn't need more screen time to make an impact, it worked from the start."Training Day" tried so many things it got convoluted in complicated plot devices and other contrivances, some of them unfortunately, were too blatant to be even taken seriously. While it started as one hell of a character study mixed with police procedural ? la "French Connection", it ended like "Scarface". I don't mind a good over-the-top performance but the film could've been remembered for more than being that movie with a bad guy Denzel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Training Day" is Denzel Washington's master class in dominating a movie. He's compelling, explosive, magnetic, all of it. In the hands of someone less daring, Alonzo Harris could've been just a cardboard bad guy. But Washington handily makes the role his. He owns this movie. And up until the pivotal scene with Scott Glenn, this movie is a kickass crime thriller. It's here (sadly) that things start falling apart. Til now, Ethan Hawke's internal struggle gives the movie its dramatic weight when Denzel's not on screen. But at this point, the movie's about a thug with a badge buying search warrants with stolen money, and the rookie being asked to shoot someone dead with no provocation. There's nothing left to the character of Alonzo Harris, seeing as he's just a criminal trying to buy his way out of a screwup with the Russian mob. All the b.s. he'd been spewing to Hawke is nothing. And everything from then on (Hawke's miraculous salvation from execution, ridiculous fistfight on rooftops, etc.) is just absurd. The brilliant first half crime movie gives way to the typical contrivances of a David Ayer script. It's all still worth the watch just for Denzel Washington's riveting performance. It's just a shame the rest of the package doesn't live up to that incredible talent.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Training Day starts off great, but by the end, it's ultimately just a very average film. The last act in particular drags down the film even more. Washington commands the screen and blurts out his dialogue in the best possible way, but as good as he is he cannot elevate what is simply a weak script. This material doesn't deserve him. Hawke is also pretty good, but here's the thing. No, I don't really smile at knowing he got a nomination for the Oscar because he was in no way a supporting actor. I'm sure everyone in the Academy knew this, but because Washington is so good and in fear of vote splitting, they carelessly voted for Hawke in supporting actor, robbing a true supporting actor that year a slot. I'm sure they knew it, but once again it shows just how political the Academy can be. This film is ultimately only worth a look for the two leads, but even then I can't recommend it much.</fullReview>

Almost all the movies have one star ratings and also ten star ratings. I don't get why some people, only vote to give a bad rating to movie which is good. If you don't like a certain genre of movies you shouldn't watch them. Some time ago I only liked comedies and I didn't bother watching other type of movies, but since I grow up I understood that every movie genre has at least a one good movie. There are good dramas, horrors, comedies, action movies, science fiction movies and so on. So when I rate a movie, I don't let the genre of the movie affect my judgement. For example I'm not really interested in science fiction movies, but there are SF movies which I rated with ten stars because they deserved it. So, in my opinion people shouldn't let the bias affect their judgement when they rate a movie. Training day is a great movie and nothing will change this fact. Also, Denzel Washington is a great actor and the fact he won an Oscar for his performance proves my point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Training Day makes The Departed seem like a walk in the park</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Talking about defining rolls, try watching Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke in this highly unorthodox crime feature. What starts as your everyday police drama with the trained cop (Washington) showing the new rookie (Hawke) some bad ass moves, fastly turns into a nightmarish all-night experience as we learn more and more about the true nature of Washington's character. Hawke triumphs as the accidental hero of the movie, who is thrust into talking his way out of near-death situations and learns how to survive the crooked streets fast. The final 15 minutes of the movie are some of the more intense and violent cinematic experience I sat through in recent years. There's no doubt abut it, Training Day makes The Departed seem like a walk in the park (and that's saying a lot).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing this movie , it made me realized how good Denzel Washington is great as an actor(probably one of the best actor ever, if not the greatest...) He(Denzel) does a really good job playing a crook , corrupt cop who takes advantage of his position to commit crimes... and he also uses his apprentice , a rookie cop called Jake(Ethan Hawke) to do something the he(Denzel) has set up... Frankly , i seriously think this was one of Denzel Washington best performance ever and that movie should be considered as a classic gangster movie...However, I think that the ending is great but could have been different , less brutal...Anyway, if you are someone who likes crime , gangster movies you'll will really appreciate this movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a well done movie, and it was a good performance by Denzel Washington. OK, well that's not news worthy, because he got an Oscar for his performance. I thought he deserved an Oscar for "Remember the Titans", but I guess people were tired of seeing him play the straight role so they rewarded him for his deviance."Training Day" was more of a credit to the writer (David Ayer) and the director (Antwan Fuqua) more than anyone else. The plot was simple yet involved. The entire movie took place within a small area and within one day. With those parameters, you have to be quite good to make the movie interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive, immense impact from Washington...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I stumbled across this amazing film not expecting anything special. But I was completely blown away by the content and theme of this. Only being revolved around two guys, Washington and Hawke. Washington being the so called mentor for the newbie Hawke. Though as a rookie would expect everything to be by the book and to only follow orders he is completely confused and unaware of what Washingtons true methods are. Methods of violence and brutality against criminals unorthodoxed. To be smarter and more cunning than any criminal they fight against is whats become of Washington.Their 24 hour ordeal is action packed thriller with an amazing performance by Washington and truly worthy of an Oscar. His portrayal of a cop gone completely insane with his credibility of being a "someone" important and big is truly impressive. There's a unique sense of portrayal of the character from Washington. The scene with the Mexican gangsters is thrilling at the same time this movie gave a feel of realism in connection to the present world.Denzel stepping out of his usual goodie good role at the same time playing it with intensity and command. An amazing movie with amazing performances, you wouldn't think much of it just by the title, but try it and it may end up blowing you away. And yes there's that scene with eva mendez!! Now you'll want to watch it more. No? But really this movies worth your time so go see it if you haven't.</fullReview>

He plays as a villain very well and is a very good actor. It seems like he can pay any role he is given very well.A good movie to see if you like action,drugs,gang violence and girls.

		<fullReview>A clearly underestimated movie that anyone of you who loves a good script will need to see. And if you like me thought Denzel Washington is always mama's boy you'll be very pleasantly surprised. Add to that some really nice music and a surprisingly decent performance by an actor I normally like to hate - Ethan Hawke - and you have some solid entertainment to look forward to. Macy Gray does a great scene as a mom in the hood. The story takes place in just one day and that is of course not that credible but the story is so gripping and exciting you will not think about that until after you've seen it. I would definitely put this movie on my top ten list of cop movies and I have seen it three times without getting bored.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh Unhappy "Day"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being nominated for an Academy Award once meant something. While it didn't necessarily guarantee that a motion picture was excellent, you could be fairly certain that it would be at least entertaining; at least a little original, at least a respectable representative of its genre. WINNING an award meant that it was almost surely an instant classic.My, how times have changed. This predictable, over-the-top, been-there- seen-that police "thriller" is SO exaggerated in its character stereotypes, action scenes, plot lines, and situational crises that it borders on camp. Maybe that's what the makers of this dreadful garbage had in mind when they slapped it together. If so, they failed, but not nearly as badly as if being campy wasn't the intent. And I'm pretty sure it wasn't.Probably the best that can be said for Training Day is that it isn't quite as execrable as some other cop movies that have come down the pike in recent years. (Take Takers. Please.) But it's among the worst I've ever had the displeasure to sit through. Two thumbs down. I'd give it more, but I only have two thumbs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good performances , bad and uncooked story !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had read lots of great reviews on this title but unfortunately I have to admit that I was disappointed after watched it. Denzel Washington gave a strong performance as usual but I think for the very first time in his career played a negative African - American role. Ethan Hawke was surprisingly great at his role although his role did not have much of affection to show just many physical action. you may think if the performances were good then how come you did not like it ! Answer to that question is simple , it takes more than just big names or good performances to make a movie that everybody can connect to. the most important element is the story. unfortunately the story of the Training day was kind of childish, very unreal and raw! the writers had to cook the story more and answer basic questions on the minds of the audience about the sequences of the movie. for example we never realized who were those Latino guys ? who was Eva Mendez , a girl Washington sleeps with , a whore or his wife ? why didn't anybody help Washington in the neighborhood? The biggest turn off for me was the scene where Hawke shot Washington! it was so unreal! first of all , in real life LAPD guys are trained to shoot and they don't flirt with the suspect just like Hawke did with Washington , they count to 3 or maximum of 5 and then boom they shoot! they don't wait for your bullshit ! second of all , in real life and in an African - American neighborhood no White has the balls to stand with a gun in his hand shooting another African American while he does not have ANYTHING to show that he is a cop! Another questionable scene was at the same moment , when Hawke was going away with the money , Washington who was shot in the butt was jumping up and down ! who on earth can even stand with a bullet in his butt ???? Or how strong a very average and kind of slim man like Hawke can be to survive all that punches he got from Washington , jumping down from a building and still being the tough guy and standing on his feet and giving the bad guy to justice ! I know it's just a movie but , what I'm trying to say is : entertain us , don't ridicule us!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meaninglessness of Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "Training Days," I see life is meaningless and meaningless. What does Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington) "gain from all his labor at which he toils under the sun" (Ecclesiastes 1:3)? In the movie, I see everything is meaningless. Harris was chasing after the wind (1:14). Harris thought that he was the wise man and he must die. And he is forgotten too quickly. Life is like that. But in the Infinite, we find meaning and enjoyment in life. We are simply satisfied when we eat and drink. That's the gift of God. (3:13) Harris was wise in a sense, but he is foolish in God's eyes. Harris didn't seem to enjoy his work, and he looked sad all the time, even when he did smile. Solomon said, "There is nothing better for a man than to enjoy his work" (3:22). Who is like the wise man? I think Hoyt was the wise man. His wisdom "brightens a man's face and changes its hard appearance" (8:1). His wise work saved himself. His saving work of Smiley's cousin changed the hardened heart of a Latino gangster. Hoyt was the one who really enjoyed his work as a policeman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gripping yet shallow thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed Training Day on a few levels, first off, Denzel Washington is superb as Alonzo and the tough, gritty action sequences make this a very realistic and violent thriller, however apart from Washington's change from the good guy he usually portrays to a corrupt and vicious narcotics officer, I felt the film had no real clear story.There is a story somewhere, a rookie cop on the force to fight the bad guys only to get a wake up call that it's not like that is an interesting idea for a crime film but the movie gets lost in its constant attempts at carrying many different moral themes. In the end this is a good versus evil action movie disguised by a career best performance from Washington and being marketed as a fast paced crime thriller, and if it had presented itself as what it really was I would have like it more.Verdict: The cast do a great job, but it could have been a far greater film had it been directed by, say Spike Lee or Quinten Tarantino.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can usually fill a full page of notes regarding my thoughts on a film as I'm watching it, but this time I came away with only about a half dozen character quotes that sounded cool at the time. Looking them over now however, makes them seem cliché ridden, offered in an attempt to manipulate the viewer. That 'smiles and cries' explanation offered by Ethan Hawkes character was an eyebrow raiser, and how about it 'taking a wolf to catch a wolf'. The topper though was Denzel Washington's tattoo - "Death is Certain, Life is Not". That one prefaced the ending, since Washington's Alonzo wasn't a bad cop in a 'Die Hard' yipee-ki-yay sort of way, he was just a bad rogue cop.Let's face it, if "Training Day" represents a rookie's first day in narcotics, then the bad guys have won. Alternating hits of PCP, beer, and who knows what else, it's pretty amazing Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) even made it through that day. That's not including guns to the head, rifle blasts through the 'office' car, introduction to a Latino bathtub and falls from high rise apartment buildings after being beaten to a pulp. Even with steely resolve and a strong constitution, there's got to be a better way to make a living.Story semantics and odds defying coincidences aside, Washington and Hawke turn in strong performances as cops on opposite sides of the moral fence. It's not enough though to tone down the way over the top situations and confrontations the pair find themselves in and out of, all without a moment's rest. Try this while watching - take a deep breath.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing Story Line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While Ethan Hawke and Denzel Washington each turn in remarkable performances, the story itself disappoints. I found the film overly violent for my taste. (I realize that I am in the minority in that regard. It seems that most movie-goers want the maximum amount of violence packed into their films and Hollywood has complied.) The film is successful in creating an atmosphere of impending danger and edginess. The script is good and the film is well shot. The story itself disappoints. The actions of Denzel's character in the second half of the film seemed out of character compared to the character in the first half of the film. While it provides for an unexpected twist in the plot, I found it unsatisfying. The overall effect of the film was very scary and very disturbing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A B-movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can start off by saying that i consider the Academy Award to be a very dubious award. It seems more like a pat on the back for long and faithful service (and with a little added political correctness) than a true award for outstanding achievement. That being said i still think it's insane that this movie (or rather the actors in this movie) was nominated for two Academy Awards and received one.Now don't get me wrong, Denzel Washington is a terrific actor. I have seen and liked him in many parts but this just isn't one of them. In fact part of why this movie is such a failure is Denzel Washington. The whole streetwise cop-routine just doesn't work for him. He ends up looking like the kind of cop who wouldn't have survived one episode of "The Shield" (to name one similar reference). And still we are to believe that he is a man who has lived well off of bribe money for a long time.And the second issue of credibility is of course Ethan Hawke. I'm not an expert on the American police authorities but somehow i doubt that someone would like to put Ethan Hawke in plainclothes in an all-black/Hispanic neighborhood. Even that issue put aside Ethan Hawke still looks like he's fifteen years old and completely lacks any credibility as a policeman. And for this he gets one Academy Award nomination? And beside these monumental issues? Well it's more or less like one long and quite poorly written episode of "The Shield". The old jaded corrupt cop shows complete disregard for his own and his rookies safety when he plays the streets like an amateur throughout. The technical quality of the movie are OK, as is the scenery. The acting is not impressive though, although i would credit that to poor writing more than substandard actors."Training Day" is a B-movie in every respect except one; it has stars attached to it and one of those stars was long overdue for an Academy Award. This movie could just as easily have been in theaters for two weeks and then gone right to the video store if you replaced Denzel with, say, Cuba Gooding Jr. And an over-acting star in a poorly written role does not a good movie make. Personally i lament that Denzel couldn't get his award for a more memorable performance, also in that regard is this movie a waste.</fullReview>

The first half is almost excellent at times, but a series of increasingly absurd plot developments turn what could have been a classic cop movie into a ridiculous cartoon as Denzil Washington's grandstanding performance becomes less and less believable by the reel as he navigates a nonsensical plot that wouldn't be out-dumbed by a major studio picture until Collateral. If you can ignore the fact that the plot stops making any form of sense you'll enjoy it a lot more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another bad cop movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apparently, the viewing public and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, loves bad cop movies. Now, I know what your thinking. Was that five bad cop movies, or six? Well to tell you the truth, in all this excitement, I kinda lost track myself. You know, the nice thing about the internet is that the ordinary, run-of-the-mill-movie-viewer can express his/her thoughts about the entertainment they've paid for, and not have to think that what the critics think is what everyone thinks. So here's what I think:I can't believe the fuss made over this new bad cop movie.Without a doubt, you will be captivated and even frightened by Denzel Washington's portrayal of Detective Alonzo Harris, an over-the-edge narcotics detective. And you will be equally riveted by Ethan Hawke's portrayal of rookie detective Jake Hoyt, who has the all time worst first day on the job. The movie mixes the fantastically corrupt cops with Godfather (Mafia type) violence with the backdrop one of this nations largest cities, ?the Hood'. This is a case to way to much talent wasted on the tiring bad-cop-good-cop theme. Training day ranks up there with ?The French Connection', ?Dirty Harry' and ?L.A. Confidential'. So, yea it's a thriller, and you can ride with it, but, at least in my opinion, it's far less than memorable.FM</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not sure how to rate this movie, 1 of 10 awful, or 10 of 10 excellent.If you like being frighten and appalled while watching a movie, and enjoy walking away feeling disgusted and dirty, wanting to burn your close and take a shower, and derive joy from having bad dreams at night, than THIS is the movie for you!Training Day depicts the worse aspects of humanity, betrayal, treachery, greed, murder; and shows an unsuspecting trainee cop pitted against this onslaught while he searches to do the right thing; and photographs it all in a horrifying way. This is NOT a feel good movie. This is not a movie for the faint of heart, nor children, nor anyone under thirty who may well be scandalized. This movie is disgusting, vile and is a piece of trash.On the other hand, Training Day is movie making at its Very Best! Denzel Washington is remarkably good with his performance of Detective Alonzo Harris; and Ethan Hawke, the trainee, seems to come out of no where to match Denzel's performance scene to scene with the excellence attributed only to the premium big name heavy weight actors in Hollywood today. And that's not easy to do! Denzel Washington is as good an actor as there ever was, and better then most. Hawke's performance is superlative.Astonishing performances were also rendered by Tom Berenger, Harris Yulin, Raymond J. Barry, Cliff Curtis, Macy Gray, Scott Glenn , Nick Chinlund, Jaime Gomez, and on and on. How did they all get so good?!This movie is an excellent film due in large part to Denzel Washington who makes everyone around him perform better at their work. Director Antoine Fuqua, and actress Macy Gray openly admitted this on the DVD's special feature segment.The intensity of Training Day paralyzes the viewer and doesn't let go until the end. This movie is a ride into hell.So, how does one rate this film, Awful or Excellent?</fullReview>

Because the role is always the same : "A man ho has to run from his family to protect his wife and child and also has to deal with the mafia. or like in this movie he deals with Drug-mafia's and for once he's the Bad Guy!."This one wasn't special although i must admit i have a "Soft-Spot" for the "Beautiful, Foxy and Sexy Femme Fatale" Eva Mendes.This movie just didn't do it for me.Denzel Washington is an actor but is he a great actor?He has won an Oscar, but let me ask you this : Is everyone ho wins an Oscar "Worthy" of winning the Prize?Is John Ruiz truly a Heavyweight Boxing Champion of the world?Is Lennox Lewis one of the all-time great Heavyweight Boxing champions?The answer on the Denzel Washington question will always be a split decision, in my eyes.The best movie i saw of him was : "The Hurricane".That was truly a brilliant performance, but "Training Day" is not.And i think that movie will always make the grade in my book.The "annoying" thing about this movie is that the "predictability" is pretty "obvious and boring".When i mean "Predictability" i mean : Guns, Drugs, Mafia, shootout and This and that.And even if Denzel played the "Bad Guy".There wasn't anything "Special" about that role.Russell Crowe's "Beautiful Mind" but especially Will Smith's Ali are much better "Performance's".Some people on "this Board" seem to think this movie is "real day to day life." or think that this Denzel's best performance.Well i don't think so!Hurricane was his best, Malcolm X i wasn't impressed with and Out Of Time was Good to watch but Sanaa Lathan and again Eva Mendes made it even more Tasty!And all that talk about this movie being real "day to day" life?How "Out of touch" can you be?At the end of the day everyone is in titled to his opinion.So my conclusion : This movie isn't one of "Denzel's" better performance's. Eva Mendes will always be "Beautiful" on the screen, she is a "Very Underrated" Talent.Ethan Hawke seemingly is very popular for his "role", witch was pretty good.And there are a lot of "unnecessary" "Rappers" invited like Dr. Dre and Snoop "Doggy" Dogg.And that doesn't much help the credibility of the "real life case" of this movie, that is put forward by some people on this board.And although the movie is rated "High" by many in my eyes the movie was nothing special than a "Mediocre, Nothing Special Predictable" Performance.For the people ho enjoy these kind of "Action, Drug Mafia and Denzel type movies" I'd recommend it.But for people ho are looking for "more" depth and a better or a more "Real Life" performance, i say : This is not the movie for You!My Score : 4.2"Groeten" from Gerrit</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an Oscar?, what were they thinking ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that I have spent too long watching this film so I do not intend to make this take up more than 3 minutes: I like the director, I love the lead actors, I love the genre, and I have been advised by many to watch this accordingly. But This film was incredibly dull, offensive in its blandness, and predictable and more than anything else what surprised me it has absolutely no intelligence on any level at all. Gee when I think what we got from for example 'the inside man'. Now there was a film: smart, slick, engaging, unpredictable, characters I could believe, and the feel of New York. This movie at most may offer a slice of the dark side of corruption in LA told by a relatively convincing palette of actors but there were far too many problems here that sank this movie for me: Denzel Washington was too self-conscious in many places, Ethan Hawke was oddly more convincing than Washington all around. This emphasis on ''nothing is as it seems'' was played out for me by the first 40 minutes when there just seemed to be no plot other than here is a typical ''non typical'' training day: whatever!!! It was insulting! Surely this film cannot grab anybody with any imagination. I'd prefer to watch sly Stallone or Steven Seagal any day if I wanted mindless dross like this, at least those alternatives can be funny or amusing on a certain level. My time is up, or rather its time is up, and I wasted too much time tonight on this already. Happy to kiss this one off guys (btw I rarely make a negative review but I had to let this one out despite the Oscar for Washington), what were they thinking!!! :)Good luck!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have mixed feelings about "Training Day".The cinematography is excellent, dynamic, basically spot on, as are the actors though one could be annoyed by Washington's performance but I guess this has to do with his character.To me, the real problem is the script. It is dynamic, unfolds pretty smoothly, no overlong passages, but everything is predictable, and there are two big plot holes that completely annihilate the premises of the movie (read the board and you will understand what I am talking about).Overall, Training Day feels pretty entertaining but you probably watched this type of movie a hundred times, nothing new here, and the plot holes mess up badly the credibility of this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has been one of my favorite movies ever so far. To be honest, I don't think I have never seen a better cop drama than this one. Training Day stands out as one those movies that shows the dangers of being a narcotics officer.The way this movie was filmed was excellent with the background music, the shots of the sun rising and the camera angles. The acting is also very good. Denzel Washington plays the role of Alonzo pretty good and Ethan Hawk does a good job of playing the rookie cop. I highly recommend this film for some that is looking for a good action and thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Denzel and Hawke= POWERFUL FILM</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very descent crime, cop thriller, and a shocking ending to surprise people. Washington portray's Alonzo, a rogue cop and up for assassination by the Russian's. Hawke is a new narcotic's detective and on his first day. Bold and catchy, the couple pair up to make an unlikely couple throughout the film. One of them being bad, dangerous and single minded. The other being serious ans sensible, BUT are both day to day cop's.Addressed and directed by Antione Fugue (King Arthur) the film is good and hard hitting and to never trust anyone. Denzal Washington won a best actor award for the film. The 18 certificate, could and could not be displayed as an 18, for it to be an 18 it contain's pervasive language and not to mention strong drug content. BUT were the mistake come's in of not being an 18, is the fact it contains SOME strong violence, which doesn't occur to me. Anyway, still enjoy yourself and have a good time, but don't exit the cinema thinking this was the best film u'd ever seen.</fullReview>

Certainly the finest performance of Ethans career that truly deserved an Oscar. "a genuinely caring and good intentioned leader"!!! What film was he watching? The guy was corrupt through and through.Denzil makes some brilliant movies but he always plays the same character. Don't get me wrong - his I cant criticise his performance.

		<shortDescription>Meandering and Ridiculous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A rookie cop spends a day getting schooled in the ways of street life by a decorated narcotics officer. Washington, playing against type as the epitome of a bad cop, is so over the top that it is not surprising that he won an Oscar for this role. He is supposed to be charismatic but the character is not the least bit likable. The script starts off as meandering, with hardly any sustained narrative during the first half; it then crams in too much plot and ends up as unbelievably stupid, including a key scene that hinges on a silly coincidence. The action scenes are utterly ridiculous, with Fuqua not making any attempt to infuse credibility into them.</fullReview>

Denzel portrays a rough not by the book cop who uses his own philosophy to get him through life. To down play the quality of acting in this movie only because of the content is not fair to the art of film. From the beginning to end you will be amazed by the power denzel sets on the screen. Movies are made to be watched, and that is what I do. I try not to let the content weigh on my reality. I appricate a film of this calibur and do not like to see it classified as a film where the watcher dreams to be like the man on screen. For the author melchiah1644 of the hater comment.

		<shortDescription>It's not just the cop who's corrupt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The acting was good, which is about the best that can be said for this movie. It exploits ethnicity, racial culture, tough talk, and violence for the sake of entertainment. None of what it presents is justified by the highly predictable ending.Did the people who made this want it to be like "Serpico" and "The Departed"? They failed to understand that it's really creepy to make a hero out of the Denzel Washington character. Fans will say that Washington's character is not a hero, that the dialog and script clearly depict him as a bad cop. Despite that, he is the most powerful character in the film by miles, which makes him the hero. His demise is ultimately effected by an anonymous band of machine-gun toting thugs we have not previously seen, leaving the impression that this guy was so powerful that none of the other characters could stop him -- not a very satisfying conclusion.The first two-thirds are slow, consisting of little more than Washington acting uncompromisingly tough and Hawke acting compromised by his ambition to advance. Only in the last third of the movie does something resembling a plot materialize, almost as an afterthought.The action was unrealistic. The dialog -- of which there was so much that a viewer could follow and understand the movie with eyes closed -- was artificial. It takes more than violence and tough talk to make a good film, unless the viewer is only after cheap thrills.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is kind of like the two officers that are the main characters, good and bad. There are scenes that are really good and creative. In particular, the "card game" scene towards the end, very intense. However, there are way too many MTV Music Video scenes as well. No characters other than the main two have any depth whatsoever. You see talented actors like Scott Glenn trying to bring something extra to their scenes, but there is nothing written for them. Moreover, some scenes are just plain silly and you want to groan. Acting tends to be the over the top. However, in my opinion, it is the work of Ethan Hawke that really saves this film over all. Hawke portrays a character that I think most people can relate to, he does what we would probably do if in his situation. Overall, I would give this movie a B-, because it showed potential, but had too many mistakes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Training Day", to me, seemed a bit far-fetched, at least at the beginning. I couldn't see an officer behaving the way Alonzo (Denzel Washington) does. But he's sort of undercover, so I get it. And luckily, the film takes steps to correct his extreme behavior as it goes on, explaining things more clearly.Denzel Washington is widely considered to be at his peak here, and won an Oscar for his performance. Sadly, I think Ethan Hawke gets overlooked. He put in a great performance himself, and is generally not given the credit he deserves. Maybe he's not as high-profile as Denzel, but the man has been in the business as long time and this film really showcased his skills.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The post-September 11 world.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some people say that the country became more violent after Kennedy got assassinated; following that argument, one might say that we got even more violent still after September 11. Certainly, Kennedy's assassination destroyed the image of a squeaky-clean, wholesome America, and September 11 changed the way that we felt that we could do everything.Whether or not we became more violent after 9/11, "Training Day" offers some insight into that. Released right after September 11 (it's release even got delayed because of the latter), the movie stars Denzel Washington as corrupt cop Alonzo Harris, teaming up with rookie Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke). As this is a movie about the gritty world of crime, I shouldn't have to identify that it's pretty violent. By the time that the movie had gotten released, movies had been showing violence for over thirty years. But if in fact we did become more violent, then the movie might have been a look at the future. Movies about corrupt cops are nothing new, but they did an OK job with this one.As for other aspects, Denzel Washington won an Oscar for his role, making him the first African-American to win Best Actor (Sidney Poitier is actually Bahamian). Some may ask whether or not it he would have won had 9/11 not happened, but not me. I say that he deserved the Oscar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The viewer is supposed to believe that all of these events took place in a 24-hour period. If I believed that the cops in my area pulled that much stuff in one year then I would want to have them run out of town on a rail. Worse, we are not given any strong reasons for the characters doing what they did. It was like "let's make a dirty cop movie and throw in all of the ugliness that we can" and the plot went no further than that.I kept waiting for something redeeming to happen in this movie and it never happened. It was an ugly, obscenity-laced piece of garbage that presented black cops in a negative stereotypical light. All it did was further the glamorized hip-hop gangsta lifestyle and pound another nail into some poor viewer's coffin. I usually like Denzel Washington, but in this film I felt ashamed for him. I originally gave it a four, but I'm changing it to a one, now that I've had the chance to think about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once in awhile, a film comes along and totally catches you off guard. Training day,is one of those films. I just had expected a typical bad cop film or something of that nature,but my friends, it wasn't. Denzel Washington has proven, once again, that he is one of the finest actors of his generation. His character,Alonzo,a highly decorated officer of the l.a.p.d.,is charming,street wise,cunning,and dangerous. Now, some actors would have made this guy just a bad ass cop.Heartless.However Denzel gave him a just the right amount of humanity(there's a scene with his son,that briefly gives you a glimpse of that aspect.)where there might be a heart deep within the beast. Ethan.My god. He is wonderful in this film.Playing this first day on the job,fish out of water,and some times confused cop,you see why he,along with Washington, was nominated for the oscar this year. I watched this on DVD and after seeing the deleted and alternate ending of the film, I have to give kudos to the director,Antoine Fuqua. It was very wise to leave out some of those scenes...but at the same time, you got the feeling it was true what the character,Alonzo frequently tells the young det.Hoyt(Hawke),"you remind me of me". Training day is a must see film that may shock and surprize you. It really made me wonder,how widespread is the corruption in the police. Must they,as in the film shows,be criminals to catch crimals??God help us all. See the film. You will not regret it.</fullReview>

However, I could not pull myself away from the screen. Unfortunately, I waited until the DVD came out to watch it and missed out on the big screen action. The characterization and acting of both Ethan Hawke and Denzel Washington were phenomonal. Denzel is an extremely talented actor, but he blew me away in Training Day. He WAS Alonzo Harris. He drew me into this movie so deeply that my heart was racing and I was on the edge of the couch. Both these extraordinary actors are nominated for Academy Awards and they definately deserve them. This movie was about truth and the search for "justice" - street or otherwise. I was astounded by the directing but more so by the script. It is an amazing script. I can't stop raving about this movie! Training Day will now be added to my list of all-time favorite movies - I recommend this to everyone, especially on DVD for the deleted scenes and alternate ending.</fullReview>

I have to say I am VERY disappointed that I didn't get to see it in the theater. This is a GREAT movie from start to finish. Denzel Washington completely deserves his oscar nomination for this one, his portrayal of Alonzo Harris is just incredible! Ethan Hawke deserves a lot of credit for his acting as Jake Hoyt as well, I was truly impressed.The story is very interesting in this film, within the first 20 minutes of the film you're unsure if you should like or dislike Alonzo, but you put up with his unconventional ways for a while, then the movie gets increasingly interesting. I won't go into depth about the story, 'cause I want you to see it as I did, but let me just say that there were a number of times in the film were I was "on the edge of my seat".The only complaint I have about the movie is that Snoop Doggy Dogg, Dr. Dre and Macy Gray were in the film. Their acting was pretty good though (in their defense), but I just don't like seeing musicians in films (unless they are playing themselves/musicians, i.e. Slipknot in "Rollerball (2002)" or White Zombie in "Airheads")I don't want to get your hopes up or anything, but I thought this was an incredible movie, and I hope that you will agree with me. This movie isn't for everyone, this is DEFINITELY a film for adults, there is a lot of swearing and intense scenes. I'm not really sure what else to say about this other than "See this movie!".

		<fullReview>Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington) is a tough Los Angeles police officer who seems to have a mojo of his own when it comes to people. His assignment one day is to start training detective Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) who is being transfered to a new field of police work. Throughout the day, Jake is learning about the horrors of the city, the rough neighborhoods, and most of all, he is learning about his new partner Alonzo.Jake and Alonzo encounter a lot of crimes, but Jake discovers that all of the crimes that are going on are linked to Alonzo. He discovers that Alonzo has a dozen kids all over the city, that he gets high with drugs, and that HE IS THE BAD GUY in all of this. Jake does everything he can to avoid Alonzos deals which is hard because once your involved with Alonzo, your life is officially hell and over.Denzel Washington (John Q, Remember the Titans), Ethan Hawke (Hamlet, Gattaca), Dr. Dre (The Wash), Snoop Dogg (The Wash), Macy Gray, Scott Glenn (Vertical Limit), Tom Berenger (Sliver, Major League) all pitch in together and make one hell of a movie.Directed by Antouine Fatinque (Bait), Training Day is a very powerful and disturbing thriller that it will chill you to death from beginning to the end.Oscar nominations for Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke. Both of them were awsome choices for the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing The Lord Of The Rings, there was no doubt in my mind this flick would get all the main Oscars. How wrong I was! I watched Training Day after the Oscars were handed out and I truly must say I agree on Denzel winning the actors prize. In this movie you will see him as you've never seen before: a really bad cop who doesn't seem to care about anything. Very well played - also by Ethan Hawke by the way - and very nicely 'over the top'. A must see for lovers of police-thrillers. Great!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Motion Picture,"Training Day" should be placed on a do not see list.If at all possible the anti-social opinion put forth by this film should be ruled on as a un-worthy pleasure.The racial as well as contemptible conduct is extremely and grossly terrifying and if need be there is a terribly un-wholesome environment from which to judge as to the fitness level of such a motion picture.There is a "R" rating that this film was given.The "R" rating says the following, for "brutal violence,pervasive language,drug content,nudity".The "R" seems to be less inclusive than this particular opinion would be satisfied by with perhaps politics of its own not providing something more telling than merely this particular "R" rating can a test to.There is here put forth that where this motion picture is to be concerned,this film is a unworthy offerring as an entertainment vehicle.Parents as well as others are advised to read,"The Parents Guide for,Training Day". http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0139654/parentalguide.There is present and this is merely to suggest as a final note to this opinion that there was a legitmate attempt to use the "white boy".The performer was in reality denied the right information as to the lines in a scene thereby providing for a veiled attempt to usurp authority.The target was in fact the "white boy", which this kind of conduct has played into with a dangerous and ominous threat being provided for in a subversive underpining.I knew we as a public should be so much more careful about this because this is where the characters materialize in your own home. Let this be a threat to society as it is suggested it is in fact.This is an attempt to violate the rights of people and indeed this is such a subversive offer that it is Un-American.This is a warning and it is such a warning that this motion picture is a hands off warning.I rated this particular motion picture a "1" merely because of the violent purpose had against society by this film and its makers.I was not able to rate the film as a "0" because there is no capacity to enter a "0" into the ratings system.The dangerously unfriendly purpose had is what required a "1" because the subversive underpining was detected in time.This is in fact an unacceptable motion picture which should be further restricted with a revised rating of NC-17.</fullReview>

I think what made the movie so good was that it wasn't about good cops like most of these movies do. Denzel was great (as always) and it was nice to see Ethan Hawke again. Overall, very good movie.

		<fullReview>What a great movie! Training Day has it all, the action, the guns, the music, the suspense and a great script! A good thing about this movie is that it gets straight into business. There's no hanging about in this film. The film follows a rookie cop (Ethan Hawke), trying to make his way up in the world, but first he has to go through a tough narcotics officer (Denzel Washington) to get there. All seems to be going well until secrets start to emerge and conciences start coming into play! Dr Dre, Scott Glen and Snoop Dogg also star in this action thriller. Packed full with excitment, suspence and some sweet tunes from artists such as Dre and Nelly, Training Day is not for the faint hearted! 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Give back the Oscar, D.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Denzel was totally over-rated as a corrupt cop in this middling tale of street life. He won the Best Actor Oscar in 2002 for his portrayal of a shady streetwise detective, but let's face it- he does nothing remarkable in this film. He just raises his voice and tries to "out-act" everybody else on screen. Ethan Hawke was also nominated, and is actually much more impressive and truthful as the rookie cop (whose first day on the job with Denzel lends the film its title.) Denzel is always competent, but his turn as the bad guy in TRAINING DAY never amounts to anything but a gimmicky career move. I suppose his Oscar win just goes to show how much the Academy loves an actor showing off, whether its Nicole Kidman or Charlize Theron uglying up for their Best Actress wins, or Al Pacino, Tom Hanks, or Dustin Hoffman playing handicapped for theirs. In this case, Denzel was the Biggest Showoff of 2001.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***Spoilers!!!***I started watching this movie not knowing what to expect. At the end I wasn't disappointed. It was a well-structured, well-balanced cop-movie.Training Day is about LAPD Officer Jake Hoyt, excellently portrayed by Ethan Hawke, and Narcotics Detective Alonzo Harris, brilliantly portrayed by Denzel Washington. Jake Hoyt is going to be a Narcotics Detective too, just like Alonzo Harris. He has a great sense of justice and honesty. But before he really starts to work he joins Alonzo Harris on a training day, meant to introduce new detectives to their work and their neighbourhoods. The only problem is Alonzo Harris is probably the baddest character ever portrayed by Denzel Washington. He's just bad to the bone, he steals, he cheats and he beats. He's in this line of work just to get rich. Because Jake Hoyt is nervous and new to this line of work he accepts some of the suspicious behaviours of Alonzo Harris but slowsly he starts to realize what he is doing and most importantly... He starts to realize that he is being sucked into it against his own will.The story line makes up for a good movie, but if properly executed it could be great movie (as with all story lines probably...). Let me tell you this, this movie is executed properly! Alonzo Harris has some cool lines but when Denzel says they sound great! Put some mediocre actor in this movie instead of Denzel and this movie would have been good, but not nearly as good as it is now. He performance lifts this movie to a higher level.Now we are completely forgetting Ethan Hawke. Ethan portrayes his character excellent too. He acts very convincing as the cop who only wants to do good and help people (isn't that their job? :)).Scott Glenn's character Roger is nice too. He plays a bigtime drugdealer who is being betrayed by Alonzo Harris.Musicians Dr. Dre, Macy Gray and Snoop Dogg also have nice parts. Especially Snoop Dogg's part is cool. A crackdealer in a wheelchair!Although she didn't play a big part I want mention Eva Mendes who plays the role of Sara Harris. She is just drop dead gorgeous!!!All in all this is a great movie. I recommended to anyone who likes crime/thriller-movies. I don't think people will be disappointed by it.My Score: 9/10 (It would have had a lower score if it wasn't for Denzel!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All hail Denzel Washington</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Training Day" which stars Denzel Washington in an Oscar-winning performance and Ethan Hawke in an Oscar-nominated performance, is one hell of a movie. Denzel stars as L.A. narcotics officer Alonzo Harris, who is probably the most brutal cop working in the city. Ethan is his young trainee, Jake Hoyt, who wants to become a narc so he can move himself and his wife into a better home. Throughout the day, we see Denzel battle crime with such hostility, that Jake cannot help but think that what Alonzo is doing is wrong. At this point this is where the battle starts...Alonzo Harris is not evil in the usual sense of the word, but he is simply a person who has become corrupted by his own means of justice. The story of "Training Day" is that he has developed a sort of God-like persona and uses this image to put fear into the hearts of those who are against him. Despite all of this, there are higher forces who oppose his power. This inevitably leads to his downfall. Alonzo is a tyrant plain and simple. He has people who do his bidding for him, but not for long now that Hoyt is on the streets. Hoyt will lead the battle to oust Alonzo out of power.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**Spoilers Ahead**I hope you do not watch this movie only `because Denzel Washington's a bad guy'. You need to watch this because it is a fantastically written and directed film with some super performances, namely Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke. After a couple of viewings, you can really see the evil plan that is churning in Washington's head, and what seemed good for upping `street IQ' was just part of the ongoing scheme to bring down Hawke. In short, a must see film. By the way, why was there such a big deal about Washington being a `bad guy'? He is a great actor with a ton of range (hence the Academy Award), so he should play what and who he wants. </fullReview>

The strong point of the movie is the acting, with a remarkable Hawke, who i say he should have won the Oscar, and the very best in the past year, Washington, who gives an amazing performance as Alonzo, who you may like or hate, neverthless always seems to be competely right of what he's doing,it's up to the viewer to decide in which side of the law he is.

Its hard to talk about the movie w/o feeling like you are giving something away. Denzel Washington plays a role where you feel like he is part Saint and part Satan. Eventually your feelings will sway to one side or the other. The intensity builds and the ending delivers a great climactic blow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the last fifteen minutes of Training Day are so average as to almost sink the otherwise fantastic film. this movie went from a 10 to a 9 to an 8 as its closing seconds ticked away. this is not to say you shouldn't watch it but when you get to the part where the ending becomes obvious just rewind it right there so you'll be left with the memory of amazingly realistic dialogue, satisfyingly complex plotting, and some of the best street cop performances ever. no doubt denzel's ferocious alonzo harris clearly thoroughly out-acted russel crowe's jittery timid john nash. the dialogue and plotting are also superior, up to the ending which reeks of the twin taints of outrageous coincidence and typical superhuman heroes and villains in a tired old climatic battle royale. the video offers an alternative ending which doesn't help matters one bit</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is great. Even with its "Hollywoodness"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Soo many critics of this film have talked about its plot holes and unexplained events, and its over-the-top action. First off, in my opinion, there were few of these flaws in the movie. I admit there were a few but no movie is perfect. I have watched the movie three times, not because it was the best movie I have ever seen, but to look for these giant holes in the plot and to watch the over the top action scenes. Nothing I saw and noted was that big of a deal to throw the whole movie into the crap pile which is what many people have done. I guess a lot of people don't realize that when these blockbuster movies are created it's not for the people who will look into every nook and cranny of the story and dialogue to find some piece of imperfection. They write it for the average movie go'er. This average movie go'er isn't there to look for the flaws they are there to, in a sense, be put into this movie.If Ethan Hawke hadn't been beating so badly that he couldn't get up and fight back then the next scene of him being hauled off to the hospital would really make the movie less interesting. On the other side if he hadn't received those brutal beatings then his fighting back wouldn't be as enjoyable. Thats what people want to see a glorious fight back, or a tragic fall. In providing the audience with this the writer has to make some adjustments to reality. Maybe the streets of LA are not correctly portrayed and maybe the way the they went about their police business isn't all realistic, but without these tweaks it wouldn't be a good in your face cop movie. I mean reality can't always be as entertaining as Training Day was.Reading over this I kind of rant, its late and I should be asleep. I hope some who read this can see my point.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers follow.We're presented with a choice, between a policeman who's pure but ineffectual, and one who's corrupt but (as the cliché has it) "gets results". I hope everyone will prefer the former. (I hope, also, that everyone will realise that in real life, the choice is otherwise, and that the most corrupt police forces are also the most inefficient and useless.)Unfortunately, Ethan Hawke's woefully under-described and thin character (the actor does what he can) doesn't have the guts to be pure. TWICE his superior, who might as well have horns growing out of his forehead, offers him the chance to walk back to his old, honourable, by no means unpleasant job, at no cost or risk, without losing face before any third party - and the fool refuses, for no reason at all that we can see. We can only presume he doesn't want to appear na?ve. It would only be possible to warm to a man this spineless if we knew something about him.But the key choice he's offered is a bit less obvious. Only a bit. Anyone ought to be able to see that everything the narcotics squad does counts for nothing - for less than nothing. For every drug dealer, large or small, that they put away, another will leap up to take his place. But the market forces that make this the case do not apply in the case of, say, rape: and when Jake saw a rape about to take place, he had the chance to actually do some good, by dropping whatever shadowy nothingwork Alonzo wanted him to be getting on with and intervene. He chose to intervene. (Successfully - but for some reason he doesn't actually arrest the rapists. Why not? Did he require the co-operation of his superior? Was he merely caving in, once again, to moral pressure? Are we meant to be able to work this out?) And it's fitting that his one good deed turns out to be what saved his life - in fact, to have been almost the only thing that COULD have saved his life, given that he didn't have the sense to walk away from the narcotics squad altogether.I liked this touch. A pity everything that happens after the key scene with the bathtub is just standard revenge rampage wrap-up (so muddled that perhaps I'm being generous in using a word like "revenge", which implies a goal). And a pity that everything leading up to the trap in which Jake is caught is just so flat. Fluid, bold photography, a good sense of rhythm and strong performances can't breathe life into the opening third or the conclusion. Nor can guns. But there's real promise and fire in the middle bit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this in the theater I was amazed. I was so happy the day I heard that my boy, Denzel, was nominated for the Oscar. When he won it, I was right there with Sidney clapping. He deserved it! He ad libbed a lot of this movie!! I mean, Training Day was shot using real ese's and vato's from the Imperial Courts in LA! No cameras have ever been allowed into that hood! This is the best ONE DAY movie ever! Ethan Hawke is great and should have won the award for best supporting actor. However, his time shall come. The best parts about this movie were that everything Denzel said was true (the director points this out). The tension with the ese's at the kitchen table is authentic. I was surprised that the Vato Smiley, is the same dude as the WOLF from Collatoral Damage. He is a New Zealander in real life. However, he plays a very good ese. I bought this DVD and love it so much. This is the best Denzel movie since Riccochet!! 9 out of 10 stars!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not your typical cop flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was surprised by an earlier user comment which stated that this film was a fun way to spend two hours "...without having to think too hard". This is NOT your typical cop/buddy flick with a happy, neatly tied-up ending. It had the necessary action and suspense elements, but it's also a dual character study as well as a sordid tour of America's drug and gang sub-culture. It's thought-provoking and disturbing.Denzel Washington won the best actor Oscar for this, and I can see why--he's utterly mesmerizing as Alonzo, the senior street narc. He's Satan in gangsta clothes: charming, sexy, seductive, manipulative, and larger than life. Ethan Hawke deserves credit for holding his own with Washington; a lot of other actors would have been blown off the screen, but we keep identifying with Hawke's ingenue Jake right up to the end of the film. Great use of authentic locations and lighting, and terrific supporting performances too.This was the best film of 2001 in my opinion. Just be warned that it's like watching a car crash--ugly, violent, and utterly fascinating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jon Monsarrat review: deep &amp; fascinating action film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Training Day" is either a drama or an action story -- you can take the film for either, which is good because as an action film buff I normally don't get into dramas -- too arty, with melodrama bits that bore me, or overly subtle. Fortunately, Training Day avoids both extremes, being a fascinating police story with outstanding performances that won Ethan Hawke an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor, and Denzel Washington the Oscar for Best Actor.The story is gritty and real-world, with an "edge" that avoids campy entirely. Although it's quite violent, they avoid serious gore. And although the premise of the story is not new (what premise is?), how it's played out, especially at the ending, is original and satisfying. The film has both more drama and more action than the recent spate of Robert DeNiro drama / thrillers, including "Heat", which is similar.Who should see this film:-- Action film buffs, even if you hate dramas, even if youare only happy when stuff is blowing up constantly-- Drama / arty types, unless you are turned off by what isperhaps one notch too much violence (less than "The Professional" aka "Leon" (1994)).-- non-action film types who might see one action film everyso often, and have maybe heard about "training day",with the same caveat about violence.I'll give "Training Day" an excellent 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't stop thinking about this movie. Yesterday evening I rushed to the cinema because something told me I just had to see it. Whatever it was, I AM FOREVER GRATEFUL!!!!!! I was blown away in the first few minutes. Denzel Washington' performance left me speechless and a day later I still can't find the right words to use. It was as if he'd been preparing his whole life for this role, building and forming it inside his mind but in the mean time also delivering some of the better performances seen on the big screen like the one in "Crimson Tide" or "Devil in a blue dress"... I think a Slovene critic said it best; The role of Alonzo Harris is Denzel's "Scarface", it's a role, a character, a movie that breaths in the beat of his heart and it's a role that represents a peak in his career.A movie that never ceases to amaze took me for an unforgettable ride making sure that I will never look at Mr. Washington the same again. When his name is going to be mentioned this is the role I will think of first. Kudos to Ethan Hawke as well who represented another major surprise of the movie proving that he is a good actor and that he could easily follow the tempo of his "partner in crime". With the amazing performances by the two actors, a story that kept me begging for more and a bunch of memorable supporting roles (Scott Glen, the surprisingly great Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre and Macy Gray)and a great sound track this is without a doubt the best 2001 had to offer.Denzel winning his well deserved Oscar (although Russel Crowe's performance was almost equally good) proved to be merely icing on a cake that was already amazing.

		<fullReview>This film really got to me like no movie has in a long time. After about the first hour, I was on the edge of my seat and absolutely glued to the screen. The ending was somewhat weak like has been commented here before, but I'm not sure I could have taken another moment of intensity... I was 'in' the picture and lost to the world like nothing in a very long time. You could have grabbed a sample of my blood and come up with nothing but pure adrenaline.Part of the reason might be a past history with a bit of street background in it (yes, I've met lowlifes although nothing as bad as portrayed here)... this brought up the atmosphere of some remembered horrors, and by the end of the film my heart was palpitating and I was physically choking. I went into this film with no 'prior knowledge' whatsoever (as a rookie), and it might have been a near heart attack for this over-35 guy... next time I'll read up on the plot a bit first.For the average moviegoer, the realism may not jump out too much... if you've ever been on the streets sometime in recent memory (even briefly, and not necessarily in LA), this film is like spreading drugs out in front of a former junkie -- not pleasant, but try tearing your eyes away. And Denzel... was truly a surprise. I've never been too impressed by his somewhat wooden acting, but his 'moment' toward the end is up there with the best rant-fests I've seen from Al Pacino. The 'best actor' Oscar was deserved, imho.9/10 (one point off for a weak ending).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was extremely satisfied with Mr. Washington's performance in this movie. He made me believe he was a crooked narcotics officer with no regard for anyone but himself, yet I was mysteriously attracted to him and repelled to him at the same time!The psychological and physical games orchestrated and performed by Detective Alonzo Harris (Washington) on just about every character in the story were both believable and brilliant.The story does teach a lesson, "What goes around, comes around!" I recommend this movie to any and everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very good cop movie. I was tired of seeing Denzel Washington as Mr. Nice Guy in movie after movie so it feels very refreshing to see him get his fingers dirty. But is he a little dirty or very dirty ? Maybe he is only doing what is needed in a society gone bad ? Training Day has a brutal and serious atmosphere. The dialogue and acting is good, the pacing is rather high and there is some good violence and very threatening and suspenseful situations. U.S.A. sure seems to have some really dangerous neighbourhoods. Training Day is certainly better than most Hollywood cop movies. I also want to recommend 15 Minutes and The Negotiator.

		<fullReview>TRAINING DAY Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (J-D-C Scope)Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDSA rookie police officer (Ethan Hawke) joins an elite undercover drugs squad and is partnered with an older cop (Denzel Washington) who turns out to be just as corrupt and dangerous as any lowlife criminal.Antoine Fuqua's cynical crime drama features an award-winning performance by Denzel ('Gimme an Oscar') Washington as the crooked cop who believes in breaking the law to enforce the law ("To protect sheep, you gotta catch the wolf - and it takes a wolf to catch a wolf!"), and whose methods are tacitly approved by his bloated, cynical superiors. Clearly inspired by recent events within the LAPD, TRAINING DAY is told from Hawke's point of view, allowing the audience to share in his escalating sense of outrage, until he's finally tipped over the edge by a monstrous betrayal of trust. But, like any number of exploitation movies before it (even those as polished and presentable as this one), TRAINING DAY is conservative in thought and deed: Washington is sexy, dynamic and evil to the bone, and the movie wallows in his decadence before concluding with an audience-pleasing showdown between Good and Evil. The movie is dramatic and watchable, but it's also trite and superficial, and it leaves a bitter aftertaste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceptional acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by agreeing with those that hail Denzel Washington's performance as exceptional. Twisted and corrupt, at the end of the movie you can't help but hate this guy (a very foreign feeling to attribute to one of Denzel's characters).When I walked out of the theatre after seeing A Beautiful Mind, I was convinced that Crowe should take the Best Actor Oscar, though I reserved judgement until seeing Training Day. And my opinion now...I stand by my original assessment. Washington's character shows a ferocity and intensity of a man who long ago put to death any moral/ethical dilemma of how he enacts justice. There is no internal conflict here, and as such, the character, though being complex, is somewhat one-dimensional. He is what he is, a corrupt cop who has convinced himself and others that the ends somehow justify the means.I think Crowe's portrayal of Dr. Nash, from graduate to eventual Nobel Prize recipient, shows the audience the extent of his illness and the inner turmoil he experiences as he pursues healing. You see the character change and develop and it is a remarkable feat that Crowe was able to communicate that so convincingly.Loved the acting in Training Day, from both Denzel &amp; Ethan Hawke. The second half of the movie seemed a little too convenient for a movie that forces some very key social/political issues.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unlikable Character+Denzel = Good Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Denzel did what few actors can do. Take a thoroughly corrupt, unlikable character, give it dimension and use it to help deliver a very good film. He deserved the Oscar, no one can deny that.The seminal scene for me was near the end when Denzel, outnumbered and outgunned, still holds his facade together with the brothers in the hood like he's still the one in control - very believable.Though, credit has to be given to the overlooked part of the equation, Ethan Hawke who anchors the film by allowing us to identify with someone - and that's really the icing on what might otherwise be an average bad cop story.Kudos to the writer for writing an straight-forward, character driven story (though somewhat slow at times) and to Antoine Fuqua who really delivers as a director this time (as opposed to the Replacement Killers which he fell flat action and character wise).Worth repeated viewings if you have the stomach for corruption or if you want to experience Denzel's darker side.3/4 stars (***/****)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Slick, stylistic good cop/bad cop story where Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke, 'Gattaca') must prove to Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington, who deservedly earned the Best Actor Oscar for this) that he has what it takes to become a narcotics officer - in a very shady part of town. He's got just one day. Training Day. As the two embark on a 24 hour rollercoaster ride through the rough streets, they will avoid death time and time again; bust, break and take down numerous 'bad guys'; steal money; kill somebody; and stab you in the back... and twist the knife.The Hawke/Washington pairing is well selected - the unlikely duo share great chemistry and bounce off eachother covincingly (despite half of Denzel's lines being ad-libbed). Their performances are extremely strong, as are 'Collateral Damage' terrorist Cliff Curtis and also recording superstars Macy Gray, Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre. This movie never drags along at a slow pace - it's fast, furious and ultimately viewer-hooking with a believable storyline, plot and characters. The DVD also features an alternate ending - so for all of you out there who were disappointed at the climax (I'm not one of them) you can take comfort in the extra scenes. An inevitable sequel is probably being planned already - and that's more than O.K. by me!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Oscar for Denzel?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Denzel Washington was finally acclaimed as one of the greatest actors of his generation when he won this year's best male Oscar for Training Day. The question is would he have preferred this to be the role for which he was acknowledged with the greatest of all acting awards? Malcolm X, Glory or Philadelphia are probably the films that the actor himself would have an asterix by as defining roles in his filmography. Yes his performance is great, but the character is one that could have been played equally as well by Laurence Fishburne or Samuel L. Jackson, either of whom have enough suitable menace to be a winner as a narcotics cop gone bad. Detective Alonzo Harris (Washington) is playing out of type as the beanie wearing bad narcotics cop who takes Officer Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) on his training day. Unlike the majority of characters Washington plays, Harris has no redeeming roles. It is a day that is supposed to define whether Hoyt will make it as a rookie narc. Instead it defines the young police officer's desire to do the right thing, seeking firm but fair justice for the good of the community. From meeting his new take no prisoners tutor to toking marijuana laced with PCP, drinking on duty, destroying evidence and ignoring petty crime it is a day that tests the faith of the young cop. The ending is a little loose, leaving you to wonder if Hoyt remains true to character as the police officer his high ideals would wish him to be. A strong performance from both major actors keeps this film moving at breakneck pace, maintaining your attention as the sordid tale winds to its breathtaking, gunshot filled conclusion. Also features guest appearances from hip hoppers Dr Dre and Coolio, along with songstress Macy Gray. Weekly recommended rental: LA Confidential (1997). The best tough guy cop film of recent times. Stars Russell Crowe, Guy Pierce, Danny DeVito, Kim Basinger, James Cromwell and Kevin Spacey. Written by outstanding detective noir writer James Ellroy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should've been an independent movie - Warner messed it up.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Interesting moral dilemma.About the first half way through the movie, the premise was bright. A moral story. A rookie who spends a day training with his new boss narcotics agent discovers that the ways that his boss roots out evil aren't exactly? godly. This reminded me of Boiler Room, because in both movies the `rookie' is forced to make a decision between the morality he has and what is being presented to him as moral. I've never seen Denzel Washington use such foul language. But in the second half, it just fell flat on it's face. ? NO SPOILERS, don't worry. - It looked as if Warner Brothers had forced Village Roadshow pictures to slap on the ending that they did because the moral fable just wasn't enough ? that W.B. wanted it to appeal to lower brow audience, perhaps. Maybe that's why there is such unnecessary violence throughout the movie. In fact, the ending ? no spoilers included ? stylized as to look dramatic, but really it is just low-brow. Should've been an independent movie without the financial backing from WB as WB messed it up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Denzel's Great; Movie's not so Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Denzel Washington took home a well-deserved Oscar for this performance. He seemed to absolutely relish the part of the brutal, corrupt cop. Tremendous job. The movie, however, left some things to be desired. My first thought, early in the movie, when Denzel puts a gun to Ethan Hawke's head to force him to smoke a bowl of PCP-laced grass, would have been to get out of the car, hitch a ride back to my precinct, turn him in, and go back to my previous patrol job. I would not have found that particular experience very acceptable. Just not very believable for me. Well, okay, I was willing to put that aside. Ethan Hawke's character is very ambitious, and he wants to be part of this narcotics unit, so he probably accepts this act as something that may help him in the mean streets ahead. Later, Denzel leaves Hawke vulnerable with a bunch of thugs who decide to kill him. Just as they have him in a bathtub, and a shotgun in his face, ready to pull the trigger, they go through his pockets, and find a pink wallet, which Hawke had picked up earlier in the movie saving a girl about to be raped in an alley. Of course, the wallet belonged to the girl and, wouldn't you know, the girl just happened to be the niece of one of the guys about to kill him. Pretty convenient, huh? Again, not very believable.A movie about a brutal, corrupt cop training a young rookie just going about the every day work of narcotics officers may have been enough to make this an outstanding movie, but there were far too many odd twists, convenient coincidences, and weird peripheral characters (Russian Mobsters, no less) that made this a rather disappointing movie overall. Nothing can take away from the performance of Washington, though. He nailed his character right down the line. He was frightening, charming, inspiring, repulsive, brutal and charismatic, sometimes all at once. An exceptional acting performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome no-brainer film with great acting. Spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To christen my brand new PlayStation 2, I wanted to see my first ever film on the DVD format and I chose this one. I'm glad I did; Training Day is an outstanding film, even if it's a bit of a no-brainer.What elevates this one from others is the acting. Denzel Washington, in his Oscar-winning performance, does a superb job playing Det. Alonzo Harris, a corrupt LAPD officer who is given the task of breaking in rookie NARC Jake Hoyt (played by Ethan Hawke, who was nominated for a Supporting Actor Oscar). As Hoyt slowly finds out that his cohort is the shadiest cop in the universe, involved in corrupt dealings with gangs, drug lords, and stealing of dirty money in conjuction with other renegade cops. Hoyt needs to bring him down to save his own bacon. Still, despite the obvious ending to the story, the ride is well worth it because the acting is uniformly excellent. Denzel plays against type, instead of the amiable types of people or rogues, here he plays a cruel, evil, cocky, SOB; but he doesn't overplay it. Hawke plays the good cop beautifully, but fortunately he's not a goody-two-shoes type, as he goes on his rounds with Washington in the inner-city of L.A. (some of the movie was actually filmed in Compton).A supporting cast with Scott Glenn and hip-hop stars Dr. Dre, Snoop Dog, and Macy Gray will be of big interest to some. The direction by Antoine Fuqua and writing of David Ayer is first-rate. The DVD includes deleted scenes, an alternate ending, two music videos, the usual documentary, and other goodies. While the debate of whether Denzel or Russell Crowe deserved to win Best Actor will last for awhile, I have no plans to see A Beautiful Mind, so Denzel deserved to win in my book. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Denzel is one bad mother?definitely worth checking out now! Great acting and a lot of action keep this good the whole way through.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All of the buzz is true! Denzel Washington's performance in this movie is amazing. This marks his first time as a `bad guy' and he plays it so well. The film is about a lowly suburban traffic cop named Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke), who gets his `break' by getting a chance to prove himself as a narc for a day under the supervision of Alonzo Harris (Washington), a shady vet cop whose undercover tactics are less than conventional. They drive around the rough parts of LA in Alonzo's low-rider Monte Carlo going from one questionable `bust' to another. Alonzo sets up Jake by making him smoke some confiscated PCP-laced marijuana that taints his blood, leaving Alonzo open to changing his story and having Jake as his pawn. Jake quickly sees that this is not the kind of law enforcement that he bargained for, but is stuck with him in every scary moment, at least for the `training day'. While Alonzo runs in a ring of rouge cops, he is not flawless in his procedures. He has some high-ranking city officials behind him, who quickly lose faith in him when he screws up a job in Las Vegas (which is never really explained too well). Jake must then try to get himself out of a bad situation, which only grows worse as the day goes on. Director Antoine Fuqua (`The Replacement Killers') does a great job of keeping the steady pace of the film and keeping the viewer on the edge of their seat. Showing his music video director cred, artists like Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and Macy Gray find parts in the film as well, but not as silly cameos. The writing is top notch and the good cop/bad cop angles are grittier than ever. While Washington has Oscar buzz all around him, it seems unlikely that a movie like this would get nominated, even with his superb performance. It is not a perfect movie and it's not your `traditional' red carpet Oscar contender. But as usual, Denzel never disappoints. For the viewer, this is definitely worth the money to catch it in the theater. Although the violence may be sensitive for some viewers right now, most people should be able to take it for what it is: a good action flick with great acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense, powerful, implausible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film starts with an excellent premise and then sprints straight out into left field, makes a right turn at incredible and lands somewhere between absurd and ridiculous. Actually, I enjoyed the film, but this day of mayhem and corruption is so far from believable that it diminishes the film's value.One of the most important factors in a good cop film is realism. It requires not just realistic guns, explosions and car chases, but realistic and authentic characters and a plausible story. In this film, almost all the characters are way over the top. Rookie director Antoine Fuqua brings great intensity to each frame from his music video experience, and most scenes have an imposing power that grabs the viewer and chokes off his air supply. However, Fuqua's failing in this film is that of excess. There are no moments of calm to create contrast. The film is all storm. It is well done, but exhausting.Denzel Washington is a great actor. I say this without hesitation. However, this is nowhere near his best performance. He was far better in both `Hurricane' and `Malcom X'. He was robbed in 1993 when the best actor award went to Al Pacino for `Scent of a Woman' instead of going to him for his performance in `Malcolm X'. In `Training Day', Washington tries far too hard to be bad. He overacts in spots and he is so intent on being forceful that he neglects character nuances, normally his greatest strength as an actor. So, while I consider this to be a strong performance by any other standard, comparing Denzel to Denzel, this performance is just slightly above average. This year, Russell Crowe got robbed. However, Crowe won it last year despite the fact that both Ed Harris and Geoffrey Rush gave better performances. What goes around comes around, I suppose.Ethan Hawke was also nominated for his supporting role as Jake, and it was a nomination that was well deserved. This is the strongest performance I can remember from Hawke. His is the most credible and nuanced performance in the film, despite being in Washington's shadow. He is helped, of course, by the fact that the character is the only one that is anything like a real person in the entire film.This is a vigorous film that never lets up. The action and the psychological tension are first rate. It is just too overblown to be real. And to be great, cop stories need to be real. I rated it 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh What a First Day!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate first days on a new job. You're nervous, not exactly sure of what to expect and all too often not sure you made the right decision to take the job in the first place. Jake Hoyt is having such a day as he starts a new job in the narcotics squad with his new bad-ass boss Alonzo Harris. Detective Harris is loud, bad and mean and knows the streets like he was born and bred in them. Is he for real? Or is he testing Jake to see if he has the right stuff to make it down these mean streets of L.A., we shall see.wont we?Training Day, the just released on video movie that I just got around to seeing, is a nightmare first day on the job film. It's 24 hours in the life of a rookie who figures on making detective if he joins the narcotics squad and rids the streets of drugs and baddies. Unbeknownst to him, one of the baddest baddies is sitting right next to him, in the form of the devil himself played by now Oscar winner Denzel Washington. Denzel's Detective Harris is the devil incarnate make no mistake about it. He is the tempter in the wilderness, the one who will offer you the world if you would just bow down and worship him.just a little. Okay, just murder for him and he will grant your every wish and devour your soul in the process. In the next day, Officer Hoyt will not know what to believe and will not believe his own eyes. The ideal world he envisioned will disintegrate around him and reduce him to an animal just trying to survive. Detective Beelzebub will show him that the world is a jungle and there is a fine line between good and evil that cops have to occasionally jump to and from in order to survive. The lessons being dealt are tough and cruel, to the extent that the film goes from unsentimental reality to surrealism. No one can be this bad, no one can withstand this kind of punishment and fury, can they?Being good is so much harder then being bad. Being deliciously bad is so much fun and Denzel Washington is almost giddy reveling in the flesh of Alonzo Harris. I could not take my eyes off of him, his line delivery and body language is razor sharp and he is truly one of our most gifted film actors. Every scene he is in, and he is on camera for 90% of the movie, crackles with electricity, talking street jive and howling like a wolf. Detective Harris is the alpha wolf, the leader of men, the prince of darkness who rules hell because it is preferable to serving in heaven. The film is lifted and sustained by him to heights much higher then the pulp fiction it actually is. His performance is mesmerizing and deservedly received awards and much praise.Denzel's partner in Training Day, playing Jake Hoyt, is Ethan Hawke. His job is much harder, he is the good one, therefore the boring voice in the wilderness expressing his concerns and unsure of what to believe and do through most of his grueling first day on the job. Being good is hard work, and Mr. Hawke actually does a fine job delivering the goods. In the past, I've found him too introspective to be exciting on the screen. Too often he blends into the scenery and becomes good-looking Scandinavian furniture. But surprise, he actually holds his own beside the evil one and delivers a solid, respectable performance.Director Antoine Fuqua's Training day is a fantasy disguised as a gritty tough street film about police corruption. Is this really going on to this extent, I don't really believe it. Are there bad cops playing both sides of the fence, sure, but the 24 hours on display here are movie hours. Nothing can be believed but it can certainly be enjoyed as a surrealistic trip thru Dante's Inferno via Los Angeles. Fuqua, much like David Fincher's Fight Club, takes us on a trip through the heart of darkness and I went along for the ride and liked most of it, especially Denzel's turn being so good at playing bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True or lie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It comes at you with such a seething bodily violence and such seeming edge-of-the-envelope street smarts that you would swear, while it was on, that it was as uncomfortably close to the truth as anything you have seen. For that, you have to give the film makers their propers. It is an extremely in-the-moment exercise ala Behind Enemy Lines or Memento. --Neither of which films I liked. The bandwagon beckons, Denzel's Oscar threatens to shame me into hitching a ride on it, but ultimately, it can pass me by on this one. I think it's a lie, and a hammy, heavy-handed one at that.Parallels with far better --or at least as good-- movies bugged me the entire time I was watching this film. Eastwood uttering "--'Man has GOT to know his limitations..." at the end of Magnum Force. Touch of Evil with it's morally weighty and dramatically over-the-top good cop/bad cop frisson. Even echos from the 40s, when Denzel's role would have been essayed by a young Kirk Douglas. You can see him even yet: the razor-sharp grin, a nagging deprecation of everyone and everything in his vicinity, and perhaps most of all, the unassailable self-confidence that makes you practically ache to see him get his comeuppance before it's over. For me, finally, the central character is so repellant for the sake of making him repellant that it is easy to will your attention anyplace else on earth but here, while this flick is on. And the waiting-to-see-him-get-it-in-the-neck format limits the films horizons in a way I doubt the film makers could have foreseen. It is ultimately a little too pat, too see-the-monster-die to qualify as high caliber drama. And what this leaves, after all is said and done, is nothing so much as adrenal melodrama, aka cheap thrills.Five stars. If it had been an unheralded little film, it might have gotten a ten. As it is, it proves mainly that Hollywood throws it's considerable weight behind morally dubious thrill-ride movies that seem more important than they are, and last in the mind and heart for all of five minutes. As if we need to have that proved for us again right now. </fullReview>

Especially the ending with the Russian mob--come on, hasn't the Russian mob been done to death? And the overwrought ending is a basic cop out (so to speak), they don't seem like they could figure out a decent ending so just tacked on a nice execution scene. It's easy to criticize bad writing, but here it's even easier since it's so evidently poor. These guys get paid big bucks, they should at least put out some effort, especially when they've got as much talent as they do here.So disappointing, still if you can sit back and enjoy the Hawke/Washington/Glenn etc. acting it takes the edge off the silly story line.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Denzel's great!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[possible spoiler]If you ever ask yourself if one performance can make a film, all you need to do is take a look at "Training Day." Denzel Washington delivers one of his very best acting jobs ever, as what must be the most corrupt law enforcement officer portrayed by a leading actor. The character is not unlike Robert DeNiro's Travis Bickle; at first he walks a *very* narrow line between sanity and madness, and to his credit he does a fairly good job (up to a point) in barely keeping himself on the right side. We may not like him, or approve of his actions, but we accept him as he is, as well as the fact that he has reasons for what he does that seem perfectly logical and sensible to him.Some critics have been hard on Ethan Hawke, probably because Washington outshines him. That's missing the point. The Hawke character's purpose in the film is to provide a foil, a contrast to his partner's insanity. They are complete opposites, and it's interesting to notice that while Hawke is more idealistic and "upright," he's also a bit naive, and tends to see things in black and white. Washington, on the other hand, perceives the world in shades of gray. While that's probably the more accurate and balanced outlook, he simply goes too far, and pays the price.Is the ending a bit overdone? Yes, it is, but no one will deny it's effective. It was inevitable that his actions would backfire on him. As the film proceeds, he descends further and further into his self-created morass. There is a point in the film where it is immediately apparent that he has finally reached critical mass, and there's no turning back. I was reminded of the Biblical proverb, "He who lives by the sword dies by the sword." The wisdom of that statement is all too apparent when applied to the character.*** (out of ****)Released by Warner Bros.</fullReview>

Perhaps something to the effect of the ending of the Sixth Sense. I thought that the alternate ending added nothing to the movie.

		<fullReview>I recently rented the DVD of this film after Denzel's Oscar win and hearing much positive buzz and when I finally sat down to watch it, I found myself at first enthralled, and later horribly dissappointed.Training Day started off as a promising look at what sort of justice is necessary for a narcotics cop to be effective with Ethan Hawke serving as a young and idealistic cop and Denzel Washington as a jaded cop who seems willing to perform questionable acts in the pursuit of justice. And then we just get a straight up black vs. white (racially and idealogically) battle of good cop against hopelessly corrupt cop who has to be taken down. I was expecting to have my views of justice challenged only to have them confirmed in an annoyingly simple manner. Sure, the film was skillfully crafted. The performances were great (though I still think Tom Wilkinson was robbed considering his great performance in "In the Bedroom" and the fact that Denzel seems to be having a ball hamming it up in this part having done MUCH better work in earlier films), the direction energetic and the overall production was very solid and effectively gritty. I just can't get over how the film degenerated into standard clichés.7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Post-Academy Awards ceremony) On the whole I am confused about this particular species of RACISTS' (academy judges, movie fans, house wives - to whoever the term 'RACISTS' applies.Take your own decision.) attitude. Initially 'they' don't give a single academy award for the Leading Role to the non-white actors for the last 73 years for the only reason that they are black(OK, Sidney Poitier may have been an exception).AND now that the superbly outstanding actor Denzel Washington has won Leading Role award for the first time(after previous 2 leading role nominations. Totally 5 nominations), 'they' are arguing that he won it only because he is a black actor. Now I think its better if 'these people' stick to only one decision and don't row over TWO Boats.All The Best to Denzel Washington for the future. Give us some more mature roles like Glory(1989); Malcolm X(1992); Crimson Tide(1995); and many more...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one was a good one!! Its a good thing Denzel Washington won the Best Actor Award, I felt that Ethan Hawke should have won the Best Supporting Actor Award. He did an outstanding job. No matter what anyone else says, I think he should have gotten the award instead of Jim Broadbent. PLOT: (POSSIBLE SPOILERS) It's the first day on the job for Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke). And what he wants more than anything is put put crooks and cops behind bars....not become one. But that is going to be tougher than anything he's ever faced before, because his parter for the day is narcotics veteran Alonzo Harris, a cop who turns out to be dirtier than the thugs he puts away. All of the actors in this movie were good. The supporting cast includes: Scott Glenn, Snoop Dogg, Dr.Dre, Peter Greene, Cliff Curtis and much more. If you like movies with Denzel Washington because he is such a nice person and such a good actor, then stay away! You will hate him in this movie. But you will be able to relate to Ethan Hawke in many ways. If you like strong brutal violence and lots of language throughout movies, then this one is for you. You will find it interesting as Alonzo and Jake cruise the streets looking for trouble...and find it where ever they go. This is a knockout action film. A great suspense one, and a factual drama. So, I really don't know how to catigorize it. As an Drama Action Thriller? I don't know. All I know is that this is one heck of a movie and that I like it a lot. See it if you are a fan of strong violence. There's plenty of that to go around. TRAINING DAY: 5/5.</fullReview>

It was so very well written, directed and acted and keeps a tight grip on your interest from beginning to end. I think that Denzel Washington won a very well deserved Best Actor Oscar for his role as the villainous narcotics officer and Ethan Hawke did an equally splendid job as the rookie cop that works with him. Watching this film is two hours very well spent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whoa?is all I gotta say! Just when I thought Denzel Washington with his electrifying acting abilities couldn't blow me away anymore than he already has in past films, he pulls up another trick through his sleeve and dazzles me with yet another powerful dramatic performance! Washington plays an undercover cop teaching his rookie protégé Ethan Hawke the ways of dealing with the vicious streets of Los Angeles within a single day. As expected, Denzel is an amazing onscreen presence, but something is quite different here from his previous roles: he is the BAD GUY! Its quite refreshing seeing him stray off from the usual by-the-book-goodie-two-shoe guys I've seen him portray in his other movies. Washington has brilliantly acted any character from a freed Civil War era-slave, a South African anti-apartheid leader, a dedicated Gulf War colonel to a tenacious FBI anti-terrorist agent. Being a crooked officer in "Training Day" is a welcome addition to his fine resume of cinematic acting. Denzel's cop is an intriguing exploration into the mind of a seasoned law enforcer bent on utilizing extreme and unorthodox methods of keeping the streets crime-free. It is quite disturbing and compelling how he attempts to lure Ethan Hawke into his grim underworld of police brutality. You may loathe his character, but you have to admit that Washington never lets up in keeping the audience entranced in the film. Had Denzel failed to win the Best Actor Oscar for his awesome performance, I think the Academy should have been sued! And Ethan Hawke, with an almost equally strong performance (but not quite up to par with Denzel) as Washington's rookie trainee, just as well deserved his nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Here's hoping future cop thrillers will consist of the same caliber as "Training Day!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some flaws but, overall, a very intense crime drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always had a favorable bias toward Denzel Washington.When I first saw him playing the son of George Segal in the horrible comedy "Carbon Copy" many years ago, I thought he was the brightest spot in the film. I've been impressed with his work for many years. Arguably, with some exceptions, his presence in a bad movie, can raise the rating of a movie a few notches. I don't believe "Training Day" was a great crime drama. There were some glaring plot contrivances and a number of underwritten supporting characters made me wonder if David Ayer's screenplay wasn't thought out in its entirety. Despite those flaws, there was a lot to admire in the movie: Denzel's outstanding, charismatic performance as the rogue L.A. detective, Ethan Hawke's fine supporting role as the young protégé caught in a very dangerous corruption web and Antoine Fuqua's stylish direction of the most important characters: the neighborhoods of Los Angeles. Did Denzel Washington deserve the Oscar for this performance? I still say no. I preferred his performances in "Malcolm X" and "The Hurricane". (Of course, Al Pacino deserved it for "The Godfather Part II" and/or "Serpico" and not "Scent of a Woman" and Russell Crowe deserved it for "The Insider" and/or "A Beautiful Mind" and not "Gladiator" and, personally, I thought Tom Wilkinson gave the best performance this past year for "In The Bedroom". But the decisions have been made, they won't be changed in the record books and there will always be disputes on who should win an award for which film. Digression is over. Goodbye!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Denzel Washington won the Oscar for this role as a corrupt narcotics cop. That in itself is an unusual sentence - not the Oscar part, but the "corrupt" part, as Washington rarely plays bad guys. But his Alonzo is most certainly a bad guy, out on the streets not for the greater good but to further his own interests. Even so, while Alonzo's not the most moral of characters, Washington makes him so multilayered that you almost root for him to persevere. Ethan Hawke plays rookie cop Jake Hoyt. Ok, he's not a rookie cop, exactly; he's been on the force for something like 14 months. But he wants to do bigger and better things, so he's signed up for Alonzo's elite narc squad.Alonzo puts Hoyt through the paces - visiting snitches, shaking down people, doing the drugs they confiscate (or at least making Hoyt do them). Through it all, Alonzo seems mean and cynical, but also worldly and supremely intelligent. He's not just some megalomaniacal renegade cop who's king of his own world, or even some Johnny Law with a 'tude. The viewer wonders what's up Alonzo's sleeve: Does he have plans for young Mr. Hoyt? Is he just playing with him? Or is he just completely nuts? You just plain never can tell with Washington's portrayal, and that's why he deserved the Oscar. Always keeping the audience guessing, Washington makes sure you don't pigeonhole his character as purely evil. The events that take place during the day (as the title suggests, all of the action is confined to one day's work) imply that they're all leading up to something - the audience just doesn't know what. If Alonzo is bad and is looking out for himself, what kind of denouement can be expected? If he isn't completely bad, is he going to say the day's just been one long lesson for his newcomer? The crisp script by David Ayer never lets up, relentlessly pounding the viewer with these and other questions. Moral ambiguity is a delicious plot device, but only if the script is well written. There's hardly any lag in Training Day, so that if there were any plotholes the viewer would gloss over them quickly enough. The movie's hard hitting, full of life and excitement, complete with plenty of twists. You can never get completely used to anything in the movie, because few things are as they seem.The one exception to this is Hoyt himself. Maybe he's supposed to be an Everyman; more likely he's just a wide-eyed innocent being corrupted by the Big Bad Veteran. Hawke has the wide-eyed look down pretty good, which is a bit of a comedown from a guy who played a supercool dude in 1994's Reality Bites. It's the meatiest role Hawke's had, and he seriously flubs it. But since he's playing opposite Washington, and since this is Washington's movie, Hawke's inadequacies are easily overlooked, as well they should be. Having said that, there's no way Hawke should have been nominated for an Oscar, as he was. What were people thinking? That Washington was as good as he was because he had Hawke to play off? Hardly. It's an ineffectual performance; Edward Norton would have been a far better choice - and he could have walked home with that Oscar, too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"When you dance with the Devil, the Devil don't change. He changes YOU."--Joaquin Phoenix in 8MMIt doesn't happen too often, that a line from one movie can perfectly sum up the plot of another, but there it is. Warts and all, there's still something about unsung, neo-noir cop thrillers like 8MM, RUSH, TO LIVE AND DIE IN L.A. and FORT APACHE: THE BRONX that stays with you. This may not necessarily be a good thing, but unlike something as insipid as AMERICAN PIE 2, for example, at least they make an indelible impression.Add TRAINING DAY to that list. What makes the movie different from others of its stripe, is no brain-twisting mystery whatsoever. What could've been your usual, by-the-numbers, good cop/bad cop thriller, not worth a hot minute in theaters and even less than that on the video store shelf, is elevated by a ferociously good performance at its center. And that performance, of course, belongs to Denzel Washington, taking his career of noble, high-minded "saintly" roles and giving it a welcome, vigorous shake.To say that undercover narc Det. Alonzo Harris is a bad man, is like saying that Bluebeard could've used a little marriage counseling. There's no way to simplify it in such pat terms. Somewhere underneath the layers of street cred that have hardened over the years into a thick, nearly impenetrable shell, a blue knight who has given over to the seductive darkness of thug life is buried alive. The young idealist who once wanted to "protect and serve" is still in there. You can catch glimpses of him, but less in the eyes of Harris, than in the face of his anxious but ready-to-please "street virgin" partner, Jake Hoyt, well-played by Ethan Hawke.Jake thinks he can do whatever it takes to gain entry into the narc squad, and use it as a stepladder to reach his ultimate goal, which is to someday make Chief, and actually have his own precinct. But young Jake has got to survive his initial trial-by-fire first, and nothing he's learned in the academy has prepared him for what it's like to roll down the streets of South Central, with a truly original Bad Man.The Oscar controversy has left a taint on this picture that is prejudicial and unfair, and the truth is that if Russell Crowe had won, the clamoring din of critics who would've screamed about how it would've been a consolation prize YET AGAIN for his astounding work in THE INSIDER, wouldn't have been quite as loud as the naysayers are now regarding Denzel.Both actors are remarkable craftsmen, and both have never "phoned-in" a performance in any of the movies I've seen them in, regardless of what the genre is. If Denzel didn't deserve the award for this movie, as many have whined, then I say that he should have it for the simple fact that he has been doing great work LONGER than Russell Crowe. Bottom line.Am I biased? I would say yes. Did the Best Actor award smack of a popularity contest? I would say definitely to some degree, but when HASN'T the "you-like-me-you-REALLY-like-me" factor not affected the Oscars? Regarding nomination of the best performance given, let me just say this. Russell, just in terms of acting ability, hits one out of the park as John Nash in A BEAUTIFUL MIND. High profile project, A-list director, a storyline that is virtual catnip to any Hollyweird producer. Personal ethics and public behavior aside, looking at Russell's past body of work, THIS WAS NOT A SURPRISE. This was a sure thing, a SAFE thing.Considering Denzel's past achievements, the very last thing you would count on, is to see him give a Class-A performance in what could've easily been a grade-Z movie. If TRAINING DAY had come out at the same time as BOYZ 'N' THE HOOD, MENACE II SOCIETY, SUGAR HILL or NEW JACK CITY, with a star like Laurence Fishburne or Ving Rhames, there wouldn't have even been a debate. Don't get me wrong; these are both two fine actors, but Alonzo Harris is the kind of part we've seen them both play before. Nothing new there. But Denzel has NEVER played a villain before, let alone one as complex as this. And he did it BEAUTIFULLY. For that, he now has gold for his mantle. Case closed.Ethan Hawke holds his own with Denzel's riveting presence, taking what could've been the cliched, fresh-faced rookie role and putting just enough spin on it, so that when Jake Hoyt is a little more wary, battle-tested and world-weary by the end, we can completely buy it. Very few of today's crop of "youngsters" could have believably pulled it off.Antoine Fuqua (REPLACEMENT KILLERS, BAIT) has been down this road before, and the gritty, jittery, paranoia-laced uncertainty of the streets deposits a ball of tension in your gut from the opening frames and winds it ever tighter throughout the movie. South Central has never looked meaner, and it reminds us that for all the glamour we see on TV and in magazines and, yes, in the movies, L.A. has the same kind of scaly underbelly that all major cities have, and because of cops like Alonzo and Jake, good or bad, you might be lucky enough to never have to experience it first hand.So if there is anything faulty about TRAINING DAY, it lies not in the performances of its award-nominated leads, Fuqua's sure-handed direction, or the almost three-dimensional photographic style of the excellent DP Mauro Fiore. TRAINING DAY'S main downfall lies in the factor that bears at least 75% importance in determining whether or not a movie will get made, even before the budgeting: the casting.For that "extra touch" of street cred, not to mention guaranteeing the attraction of a certain demographic, no less than Snoop Dogg, Macy Gray and Dr. Dre stroll through in cameos, as a disabled crack dealer, a "ghetto-fabulous" hoochie, and one of Harris' men, respectively. All these performers have either lived or seen "the life" in one way or another, and none of them have to go 'Method' or 'find their motivation,' so you expect them to be good, and they are. The problem? Their presence, no matter how fleeting, is a jolting reminder that you are watching a movie, and that is what keeps DAY from being more than just a good film cemented by two great leads.Even more distracting, though, are the other supporting players, all of whom are at the top of their game here, but their appearances toss the hard-won realism right out the window. Scott Glenn, Tom Berenger, Raymond J. Barry, Harris Yulin, Cliff Curtis and Raymond Cruz are among the well-meaning culprits, a who's-who of the type that we used to see a lot of, back when Clint was still busting heads as Harry Callahan. However, to the credit of the casting director(s) and the producers, I think we, the public, are savvy enough by now to know that without these vets, replaced instead by a bunch of no-names, no matter how talented they were, TRAINING DAY might still be a script sitting in the bottom of screenwriter David Ayer's desk drawer.That said, this is no feel-good romp, no buddy-buddy cop thriller where an Eddie Murphy or a Chris Rock will cut the tension with a well-placed, profanity-laced quip or two. Even with its obvious drawbacks, TRAINING DAY is still better than most films of its type, and more than worth your dime and your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grim but riveting cat-and-mouse cop flick with a flashy central performance by Denzel Washington.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A total downer from beginning to end, `Training Day' reeks with immoral, unredeemable characters while filling the screen with unavoidable bloodshed. Yet what keeps it from being just another standard tale of urban terror is its sharp, imaginative direction (Antoine Fuqua), an ultra-tense and engaging script, a jaunty pace, and knockout performances by Denzel Washington as an L.A. narc with dirty hands, and Ethan Hawke as his straight rookie partner learning the ropes.Interesting shakeups begin right off the bat as Washington plays a corrupt black cop and Hawke an honest white one. Jake Hoyt (Hawke) dreams of elevating his young family's lifestyle. He's given a plum opportunity when he's placed in the hands of hotshot veteran Alonzo Harris (Washington) for a trial run as a narcotics cop. Hesitant because of the escalated risk but buoyed by the inevitable raise in pay and respect, Hoyt seizes the moment. If he can pass the muster, he's in. If not, he'll probably end up doling out speeding tickets or pushing papers the rest of his career. But Hoyt is an action man and seems up to the daunting task. He learns quickly on his first day of training that Harris isn't your everyday, by-the-book officer. He's a fearless, arrogant braggart who plays hard ball. Harris has developed his own survivalist style in bringing in the bad guys. His methods are underhanded and he only plays for high stakes. Intimidating, remorseless and just as terrifying as the street gangs he infiltrates, Harris exposes Hoyt to the money laundering and sexual favors, the crooked deals, the set-ups, the frame-ups. Punk-ass thugs and rapists who turn informants are thrown back into the water as bait for bigger game. And Harris is lord of it all, preening about his L.A. ghetto like a peacock, proud of the infamous reputation he's made for himself on the streets. He's an avalanche of cocky confidence and streetwise cleverness out to win every drug game he plays, at any cost, at anybody's expense.Oscar-winner Washington is nothing short of brilliant in a role that completely shoots down the upstanding ?good guy' screen image he's thus far cultivated. What remains, however, is that undeniable Washington charm, charisma and quicksilver intelligence. Ethan Hawke (Oscar-nominated) gives one of the best performances of his young career as a man caught between a badge and a hard place -- trying to fit in without compromising his code of ethics. How far can he go? How much can he endure? His boyishly tough yet vulnerable cop gives the audience something to root for. The character byplay between the two leads is strong, real, and fascinates as Harris draws Hoyt further into his dark world, playing some dangerous mind games along the way.Ravaged, seamy locations and scary, menacing support characters capture the requisite feeling of urban paranoia and moral decay, and surrounds the film with an almost apocalyptical sense of hopelessness and doom. Peripheral characters offered by Macy Gray, Snoop Dogg and, particularly, Scott Glenn as an equally distrustful retired cop, add intensity and atmosphere.In no sense of the term is "Training Day" an urban action flick. On the contray, it is a taut, stark, ugly, complex character study that shows off some powerhouse talent. Those who prefer mindless escapism will probably be turned off by its unrelenting grimness; those who prefer cerebral, realistic character studies will see it as a plus. Repelling and unforgiving, I only wish the conclusion had been a bit more plausible and less grandiose. It much too much for the realistic story presented. Director Antoine (`Bait,' `The Replacement Killers') Fuqua, who began directing rap music videos for such artists as Coolio and Arrested Development has a promising future, at least in this genre. It is an assured move into stronger film territory.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A truly virtuoso performance and well-deserved Oscar for versatile actor Denzel Washington.I always knew he had it in him,but was just hanging around waiting forthe script and the climate to jive.And jive it does,as the viewer is taken in from the get-go on a not too ordinary joy ride with L.A.'s premier narcotics officer, operating very undercover of both the force and even thestreets themselves.Quite a feat,in and of itself,and Denzel portraying Alonzo as street savvy and pistol packin {he carries about 3 or 4 .45 automatics at any one time},to the surprise and jolted nerves of anyone willing to mess with our thick black leather jacket and heavy-chained officer,who also drives asouped-up and street-crazed black malibu.He looks the part anddoesn't dissappoint in the least to back up with gritty talk and devil may care attitude and cynical approach to job.The viewer just knows something is afoul with his blend of casual thug demeanor and philosophical bent towards life and drugs to get stomped out and about with the feracity of a pit bull on Valium. One just knows that nothin is gonna happen to him,at least till further along that windy corridor of inner-city death around every corner comes face to face,and even then he'll be blessed with street justice of an almost poetic kind.Enter rookie cop Ethan Hawk,puppy-dog eager and willing to do anything to get up in the dept.,that is until he spends first 2 hrs. on job with veteran narc trainor and dastardly innoculator of his own brand of street justice,Alonzo.Hawke quickly learns the tricks of the trade and then some by mid-morn and has rest of the day to get shot at, beaten-up,straighten up from dope sample and meet some clients of Alonzo's that jst happen to be part of the neighborhood.This movie is non stop and drop dead serious,with enough credibility and storyline to keep the action from wanning and falling down.Even though both cops do get a sick look about themselves from time to time,but Denzel keeps coming back as fresh and lilly-white/black as a python ready to coil and uncoil his brand of deadly venom and snake handler charm for both a distraction and a lesson in well placed caution of what to expect from undercover work and Alonzo-baiting nastiness.Alonzo rules the streets and rules this movie with atour-de-force performance befitting a man of his talents and savior faire. 9/10 for no cop-out here.Cause Mr.Washington come to LA.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gosh, don't read this comment if you don't want to hear how bad I thought the ending of the movie was.This movie seemed to have good energy at the beginning, and Washington's character kept Hawke's character and the viewer off-balance during the early scenes. But just when I thought I was going to be pleasantly surprised by this film, the ending plummeted through the basement floor and became ridiculous.Washington and Hawke play intriguing characters -- the former possessing few if any standards of decency (aside from wanting to put away the big, big fish in the pond, by any means necessary), the latter showing blind ambition at first followed by an awakening of beliefs.But then, to tidy things up, I guess, there is an outrageous climax in which the two main characters -- who by this point have become overblown images of themselves -- go toe-to-toe (or face-to-windshield, in one over-the-top instance) and "good" manages to prevail over "evil." With the support of the local urbanites, I might add. Sheesh.Washington wins Oscar for this role? Malcolm X, maybe. I could listen to an argument for his "Hurricane" Carter. But for this caricature of a "bad man"? I don't understand it -- or better yet, I do understand it. Pacino's "Scent of a Woman" nod was the foundation for this sort of award: We passed you by for better roles, so here's your chance. I don't like it, but oh well. I saw this movie before the Oscars, so I shouldn't let that add to my negative feelings toward this movie.Bottom line, in my mind: A good idea that became fatally flawed by the last 20 minutes (give or take a few).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing this film on DVD, I was truly satisfied with the film; yes, the whole film. There are no plot holes as far as I'm concerned, although I agree that one should see the film again to catch the crucial conversations that reveal some background plot elements -- but it is isn't too hard to catch on to the storyline. Denzel Washington's performance is incredible; viewers will forget his past "good guy" performances as they are absorbed into the dark depth of this crooked, but experienced, narcotics officer. You will not look at the "crooked cop" idea in the same generic way after seeing this film. He deserved the "Best Actor" Oscar, but it's a bit disappointing (but not TOO much) that it was for a bad guy role, after all of his remarkable previous movie performances. Ethan Hawke's performance as the trainee was very believable as well, for his "training" was a true crucible in deciding whether ridding the streets of criminals took becoming a criminal. Though it's a rough movie in terms of language and thematics, the violence was not as pervasive. The disturbing imagery gives the film a serious but effective tone in encapsulating street life and the moral clashes between Harris (Washington) and Hoyt (Hawke), and their dealings with real criminals. Impressive and disturbingly powerful flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'am pretty with this Oscar festival. Finally Denzel got his gold over that little bad actor Russell Crowe (How hard is it to play a schizo).All the critics who say the film is bad, are just jealous and dumb.Anyone with a brain, can see why this film is so good.I'am only upset that it didn't win Big Picture.On a night where Sydeny Poitier got his special award, Denzel got his.Now if only other minority actors got their gold..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Training Day" is an unique role for Denzil Washington and he won a deserving Oscar.His psycho cop role is miles from his "Preacher's Wife","He Got Game","Philadelphia","Bone Collector","Remember the Titans",etc.Ethan Hawke is rookie cop that gets the 24 hours training of his life.Washington is os convincing as amoral cop that has a drink with a"friend" who's a drug pusher and later sets up murders for drugs with some other crooked cops to snap mup millons of dollars in drug money.The pace washington's fine performance almost made me forget the movie fails to tell how he got that way.Kudos to Denzil Washington for winning the Oscar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw it on DVD Saturday evening and it was an entertaining cop thriller. The story was thin but the acting was incredibly top. Denzel Washington won finally his first Oscar of his career. He is one of the best actors on earth and I am a great fan of him. For all fans this one is a must see.Thank you very much Denzel Washington for all and please continue surprising me.Check out another Denzel Washington movie called JOHN Q.My vote: 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Training Day is a gritty character-based crime drama. It focuses on a rookie cop, Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) hoping to make a strong impression on the leader of a group of LAPD undercover narcotics officers, Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). As Hoyt's training day unfolds he is faced with moral dilemmas with what he was taught in his past training and what Alonzo says and does. Alonzo's policing methods toe the line between "good detective work" and "illegal."The interaction between these two characters is really the heart of the movie, and Washington and Hawke play their roles brilliantly. Washington definitely deserves his Oscar for this performance, as he constructs Alonzo as a very over-the-top cocky veteran who believes that his way is the only way of doing things. Hawke's character is a perfect foil to this, as he's subdued and uneasy as he faces tough choices but also hopes to make a strong impression on Alonzo to advance his career.The plot develops very nicely, and I recommend watching the movie twice because the second time around, there are small details that you notice which all tie in to the "chess game" that develops in the film. Also watch the DVD for insightful directors commentary from Antoine Fuqua. It provides interesting background on the acting of Hawke and Washington and the realism of the undercover cop and gangbanger characters. Strong acting by musicians Dr Dre, Snoop Dogg, and Macy Gray in their limited roles. Each created memorable characters.To sum it up, great acting, great directing, and a great movie. It's a shame I missed it on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally, atlast... Justice has been done. Denzel has won the much coveted OSCAR for himself for the LEADING ROLE after winning it for Best Supporting Role in Glory(1989). But I have One COMPLAINT : Didn't the Oscar juries notice Denzel Washington for his roles in movies such as Cry Freedom(1987), Malcolm X(1992), Philadelphia(1993), Crimson Tide(1995) and ofcourse ...The Hurricane(1999)? That's where my complaint lies: DENZEL WASHINGTON SHOULD HAVE WON THE ACADEMY AWARD FOR LEADING ROLE LONG TIME AGO. Even though he was not nominated for his roles in Philadelphia(1993) and Crimson Tide(1995), his roles in those movies were significant ones. Both the movies were GEM of movies. Actually, my PERSONAL opinion is that BOTH Philadelphia and Crimson Tide should have been nominated in the categories of Best Picture,Best Director(Jonathan Demme/Tony Scott respectively),Best Actor(though Tom Hanks won for Philadelphia),Best Supporting Actor(Washington/Gene Hackman respectively. Gene Hackman has done a great job.) Denzel Washington had actually proved from the very beginning that he was here to ACT and not only to ACT, but ACT in very MEANINGFUL roles. And it was clear from the very start of his career when the movie Soldier's Story,A(1984) was nominated for the Best Picture in which he had acted and was only his second movie AND he himself was nominated for the Best Actor for his role in Cry Freedom(1987) which was only his fourth movie for the big screen. Actually by winning it, Denzel has proved that Substance rules over hype-hoopla and favour.This was the reward he was toiling for, for the last fifteen years.Actually, Denzel Washington is an ideal example of a GREAT FIGHTER/STRUGGLER. The IRONY is that after playing the GOOD GUY for all these years, he has won it for the BAD GUY role. Anyway, a role is either an excellent role or a poor role and not any other thing. Anyway now that he has won the Award, my only wish is that he doesn't rest and works only MORE HARDER in more MEANINGFUL roles. His roles are what attract me towards his performances.

The problem with this movie is the writing.I will give this movies top marks for disturbing imagery, and its hyper-adrenaline feel. But some things just do not make sense in the plot.Denzel's character plays a street-wise narcotics cop, tough as coffin nail, always one step ahead of everyone. Ethan Hawke is a boy scout of uniform cop, that is on his first training day with Denzel.We the audience are then taking for a ride. Denzel puts the rookie through hell, and we squirm watching.He talks/tricks the newbie into smoking pcp, drinking beer, and pocketing confiscated money. If that doesn't push your sense of disbelief, Denzel, then shows him his personal whore, and bastard son. To cap off a typical LAPD first day, training day, Denzel then introduces Hawke's character to three high ranking government officials, all who reveal their high level corruption in casual conversation. From these three they get permission to murder a major drug dealer, and split four million dollars in drug money.When Hawke's character refuses to go along after the murder, Denzel then tricks him into going to a rat's nest of gangsters, abandoning him to be murdered by the gang.At this point we have to figure Hawke's character as a very stupid man.Yet after he is released by the gangsters( for saving the leader's cousin that morning)he stalks Denzel at his whore's apartment, and get's the drop on him.After the completely predictable long fight scene between Denzel, and Hawke, Denzel is confronted by all the gang members that he previously owned, and Hawke is allowed to escape. Instead of killing Denzel they just stare at him as though they very disappointed in him, and go home.In the end, Denzel is killed by some Russians, whom we have never seen before in the movie.Just a few holes in the plot?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I'm the Po-lice! I run s**t here! You just live here!" These are the dialogues I see in a corrupt cop. When I first saw the TV spot, I thought it would be a buddy cop with different ideas and beliefs but in the end it was about being tempted by the Devil and facing him. Somehow Alonzo's principles are right like you have to be a wolf to catch the wolf, yes but provided you know when to stop. But that is not the case, He doesn't stop and is seduced, The Demon is personified in Denzel's character he mixes the truth with lies which in fact the Devil does. I'm very glad Denzel won an Oscar at long last, It's too bad Ethan didn't win. These two carried the film, I just hope the cops in my hometown watch this film, because this film is really happening in the Police Department.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oscar film, no flaws, only great acting and action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, unlike the cheap critic who first wrote the review, for the film, I can say that the film has no flaws. Also Ethan Hawke's characters is not subdued, in fact, Hawke's character (Jake Hoyt) while being sensitive and moral, is at the same intense level as Denzel Washington's.You can't write a review, without describing the plot.The story is very real and vivid. It concerns a rookie cop (Hawke) who is assigned to a veteran narcotics cop named Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington).During hia first few days on the job. Hoyr observes how Harris does his job of busting crooks and drug dealers. Alonzo is like a Dirty Harry movie, everyone in the city knows who he is and is scared to death of the gritty cop.However, underneath, that great cop lies a crooked, corrupt policeman who is playing both sides of the law....This is Denzel Washington best role ever, and I hope he wins the Oscar over that little wimp Russell Crowe.Ethan Hawke is also great as Jake Hoyt. In fact both actors have been nominated for their roles in the movie.I just checked out the DVD, and it's absolutely fantastic!!!Movie of the year, hands down.</fullReview>

What kind of killer-crook involves an innocent person ( Hawke ) and then kills someone in front of him hoping he'll take the blame for it??? Absurd! Denzel should have offed Scott Glenn himself privately and taken all the money. All he basically did was pluck an innocent person out of the police academy and make him a witness to a zillion crimes when Denzel already had enough legitimate dirty goons around to do whatever he wanted. It was completely unnecessary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inner City Reality at it's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of the 43 or so movies that Denzel Washington has starred in, "Training Day" has got to be classified as one of the most memorable character's he has ever attempted. Antoine Fuqua's direction and David Ayer's writing tell the true story of police corruption in the mean streets of Los Angeles. Ethan Hawke's portrayal of Rookie Cop Jake Hoyt was convincing next to the larger than life stature of Denzel Washington. The movie is gripping from opening to close with sharp and realistic dialogue between Washington's character "Alonzo Harris" and Rookie Hoyt. The film is one that should be viewed twice. The second viewing helps to show the "mind games" that Alonzo plays with Hoyt throughout the movie, but also show what happens when manipulation fails. Ethan Hawke's supporting actor Oscar nod is rightfully deserved.Nomatter how you may feel about Denzel when the movie ends, it's a performance worthy of the Best Actor Oscar. Living in Southern, California and growing up in the Inner City, this movie delivers the harsh realities of police corruption by not all, but many L.A.P.D. Detectives. Pay close attention to the dialogue. It rings true. This movie is real.Snoop Dog (Blue)and Macy Gray (Sandman's wife)have small but worthy parts. Antoine Fuqua has come into his own as a Director with this movie. It only gets better from here. Training Day is a must see movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, but Washington not believable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Denzel Washington is a good actor without doubt - I've enjoyed his work ever since St. Elsewhere. But because his characters are always of such stong moral conviction I had a really hard time believing him as a badass. Because he doesn't disappear into the character - as did Al Pacino in Scarface or Morgan Freeman in Street Smart or Harvey Keitel in The Bad Lieutenant - I spent much of the movie trying to believe that Washington was this bad guy, and ultimately couldn't do it. Ethan Hawke was surprisingly good as the rookie, and the plot is good, though the Russian thing seemed underdeveloped and contrived - why exactly did Washington own them the money? I'd recommend the movie, but it won't be remembered as Washington's best work.</fullReview>

It starts off slow, building up the characters in a nice way, but suddenly turns into being a suspenseful thriller. While not being 100% realistic the movie does create a universe we are led to believe in. There's is a surprisingly small amount of stupid Hollywood action or romantic scenes etc., making it more realistic. It's an entertaining, but different and raw movie, which I hope director Antoine Fuqua keeps on making. 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best negative roles that you can feel hatred for.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simply the great! Denzel Washington has done it again and this time he played a character which is altogether different from his all previous roles.Every time Denzel has played some new character he has set standards for other actors to follow.Here too he has lived upto the challenge of playing a bad guy like that of a corrupt,law-breaking sergeant Alonzo for which you could feel disgust,hatred,fearful respect and awe at the same time. Ethan Hawke too is simply brilliant in expressing the character of a cop on his first day of duty who is initially excited about and ready to follow the rules by the law-book but then gets shocked and subdued by the law bending and even law breaking tactics of Alonzo Harris. As far as the movie movie is concerned it a decent flick expressing corruption in the police force but has been made an affair to remember by Denzel Washington. Truly the best negative performance after Norman Bates(Psycho),Dr. Hannibal Lecter(The Silence of the Lambs),Keyser Soze(The Usual Suspects)and ofcourse after that of Alan Rickman in Robinhood and other movies. Finally,though not an Oscar deserving movie but an Oscar deserving acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly enjoyable let down only by being a tad predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll start by saying I really enjoyed "Training Day". It was certainly one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen in this first month-and-a-bit of the cinema year. I'm going to recommend it, with a little bit of caution, and here's why:Firstly big respect to Denzel Washington. Usually he's playing the underdog and we're rooting for him. He's constantly getting the nice guy role and so it's extremely refreshing to see him play the corrupt cop here. His character - Alonzo Harris - isn't necessarily evil, he's just deciding to do a delicate balance of crime and punishment. He takes freely from the scum he prosecutes and has no qualms about doing so. In playing this character Washington is allowed to show far more versatility than his works normally allow. He works well with his attitude to new rookie cop Jake Hoyt (played admirably by Ethan Hawke). Hawke wants to do well on his first day, his "training day" but can't stomach Harris' morale scruples. There is a great line of tension between the two that develops more as the movie progresses.It is the plot, if anything, that lets the movie sag a little. For the most part it's predictable and Ayer, at one very tense moment, uses a poorly scripted coincide to back himself out of a sudden ending. The actual end to the movie is also foreseen and, for that, is somewhat disappointing. It might have been nicer to go a different route but I guess some elements of formula must be adhered to. Having said that there's some great lines of dialogue as Harris convinces Hoyt that the way the world *really* works is not as simple as Hoyt would like to believe and that there is a certain "survival of the fittest" element you must follow. The cop's corruption - in particular the first middle-of-movie-3rd-act climax - is quite harrowing and sharply executed.Antoine Fuqua does a nice job of realizing the script he's working from. The fight scenes, for example, pack - pun intended - a lot of punch. You can feel the pain of the blows. The camera-work generally succeeds without having to be overly intrusive. The lighting is generally subdued even during high noon - adding to the movie's generally bleak outlook and feel and the score never over-plays any sentimental or aggressive moments.Overall I really quite enjoyed "Training Day" and found it a cut above the average buddy-cop flick. With some good performances, a (generally) sharp script and some fine directing I'd give it a 7.5/10 which is well above average for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why do I always favour the bad guy in good &amp; bad cop flicks?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rated this film 7 out of 10. I enjoyed watching it, but it isn't so great as to stick out above the rest of the films in the genre. Personally I often favour the bad guy in good vs evil flicks, and this one's no difference. Alonzo (Denzel Washington)is a real badass slick-talking-smooth-walking copper. He's got "bad cop" written all over him and his wrong car and clothes I liked it. And of course his counterpart Jake Hoyt(Ethan Hawk) is the obligatory goody-two-shoes rookie on his first (and only, as far Alonzo is concerned) Training Day on the job as a narc. [SOME (a wee bit) SPOILING AHEAD, SO WANNA-WATCH-AS-A-VIRGIN TYPES STOP HERE] Believe you me, Alonzo really proves to be a bad number, and of course he tries to drag Hoyt along and prevent a way back to good coppers land. And of course this will not stick in the end. I would like a film on this subject where the bad cop is less obvious and the good cop is a badass himself too. I hate the goody 2 shoes types like Hoyt, it's so, emm well, obvious and thus boring. Enough complaints, it's a good flick, lots of badass action, junkies dealers pimps and ho's, and some no go neighborhood shots! Enough pace to keep you at the edge of your seat for the 2 hours it lasts, a great killing scene and mis-en-scene and a satisfactory getting-rid-of-the-bad-character scene. 'nough said, go watch it an U be the judge! Denzel gets a 9 out of 10, Hawke 6/10. Notice Dr Dre and Snoop Doggy Dog as Paul &amp; Blue (if you dig these fellas)!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE Best Movie of 2001</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Training Day is what I would consider THE best movie of 2001, and the best Denzel Washington movie ever made. However the release of the film hurt its chances of being an Oscar contender by releasing it late summer. If it had been released during Christmas it would have been getting the rave reviews as A Beautiful Mind and Black Hawk Down have been receiving. It is without a doubt, the most underrated movie of 2001.Although, I am glad to have seen Washington nominated for Best Actor in the Golden Globes, hopefully the Academy will carry that over to the Oscars.Acting is superb, especially with Ethan Hawke! With a supporting cast such as Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg -- who were unexpectedly GREAT actors, despite their short screen presence (there are no small parts, only small actors.)The realism of the movie makes you think that the director actually went out on the streets of LA and actually filmed the real lives of corrupted cops and druglords. This movie is a MUST BUY DVD or VHS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great first half &amp; performances/slips in end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Denzel Washington performance has been dubbed Oscar-worthy since the film opened. It is that good. Will the Academy award him the Oscar for such a loathsome character? Probably not. TRAINING DAY opens extremely well. The first half is taut, well-written &amp; directed, with the aforementioned top notch Washington performance. Hawke is fine for most of the film, although occasionally, he seems to be playing the "rookie" part a little too literally. One still has to believe that the character DID make it through the Police Academy and 19 months on the sometimes very tough streets of the San Fernando Valley (believe me, they ain't all dotted with Starbucks!). Around the 2/3 mark however, I think the film makes a wrong turn and becomes the kind of pro-forma cop/action flick that pervades the "action" shelf at your local video store. Too bad, it could have said something more profound about the state of police work in modern day big cities (and no matter how "farfetched" you might think some of the events are, just keep in mind that the LAPD has had just these kinds of scandals). Worth seeing for Washington and a terrific first half, though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In "Training Day", we get to follow young cop Jake Hoyt on his (you guessed it) training day, the day that will decide if he is cut out to be in the narcotic departments, where he so badly wants to be. But his supervisor turns out to be a nightmare, and Jake´s training day becomes a day full of hell."Training Day" turned out to be a real surprise for me, as I wasn´t expecting anything special when I walked into the cinema. But it turned out to be one of the better cop-thrillers I have ever seen, with a script that contains many surprises.The acting is first class all the way. I wouldn´t be surprised if Denzel Washington gets another Oscar nomination, because here he really shines. It´s different from most of his other work, but he´s very confident and believable when he is teaching the viewers the "law of the street" with that lovely accent. Ethan Hawke makes an nice comeback, after a few tough years with not many films worth seeing. Oldies´ like Tom Berenger, Scott Glenn and Harris Yulin have small but important roles, and it´s fun to see artists like Macy Gray and Snoop Doggy Dog in cameos. The director portrays the ghetto with an interesting touch, and the story is strong and shocking at times.The ending feels unnecessary violent and something that´s there to please the action fans, who might have trouble to cope with the rather slow pace at times. But all in all, "Training Day" is a rock-solid cop-movie.4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent Cop/Action Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Young police officer Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) tries to prove himself to a senior cop, Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington), to be admitted into his narcotic unit in LAPD in his first day. The whole story takes place in just one day but what a day that is! From the beginning to the end, they witness all kinds of criminal events as they cruise down the back streets of Los Angeles. Jake is a straight arrow and completely honest, yet equally na?ve. Throughout the day, he desperately tries to handle the situations he encounters in his own na?ve way whereas Alonzo, who is much more experienced in the field, has completely different methods of resolving issues. As a result, they often disagree over how each situation should be handled and Jake realizes that his views are mostly in conflict with those of his senior officer. However, since his objective is to get into narcotics department and since the only way is to impress Alonzo, Jake obeys Alonzo's orders. After all, Alonzo is the expert in the field so he should know better.The best thing about the movie is that it keeps the audience guessing right till the end about the actual morality of Alonzo. Is he really a corrupt police officer as inexperienced Jake suspects him to be or are his ways really how things are handled in the narcotics department of LAPD? Neither the audience nor Jake really knows the answer to that question for it is Jake's (and also our) first day in that field. Who are we or who is Jake to judge Alonzo's morality who spent many years in this field? Can we really say for sure that his methods are not practised in reality? After every argument, when Jake tries to rest his case, Alonzo comes back with a stronger argument and convinces him that his methods are the best. Of course, you don't know the answers to these questions until the end unless you haven't read the complete plotline. I honestly think whoever is responsible with the publicity of this movie doesn't know anything about the art of movie making. The same goes for the person who is responsible with the plotline which gives away everything about the movie. If you haven't seen this movie yet, do yourself a favor: DO NOT READ ANY reviews (especially the plotline in the "Main Details" page) which give away the whole story. Possible Oscar Nominations: Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke both deserve Oscar nominations (Best Leading/Supporting Actor) for their excellent performances. Antoine Fuqua has done a very nice job as a director by capturing the ambience on the streets and with his depiction of criminals' lives, especially of those in the black neighbourhood. Each scene is nicely done and the suspense is so authentic. I was especially impressed by the tension in the scene where Jake sits down at the poker table with the guys waiting for Alonzo to come back. You can find a similar tension maybe in a horror movie.What I didn't like (***POSSIBLE SPOILERS***): I didn't like the publicity of this movie where Denzel Washington was openly declared to portray a corrupted cop which probably is the biggest movie spoiler that I have ever encountered in my life. The best part of the movie is the puzzle it creates over Alonzo's real character because it is not possible for the audience to decide whether or not issues are handled in Alonzo's ways in special narcotic division. Given his real character away is to kill the joy of the entire movie. Even at the end of their day, during their conversation in the car, Alonzo's explanation is very convincing and makes perfect sense. Only thing I didn't like about the movie itself is the scene where Jake jumps from the terrace of the building to the Alonzo's car after beaten up pretty badly. This scene was not realistic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had not heard much of this movie but the storyline, so my expectations weren't that high. But I have to say that I was really disappointed! About 70% of the movie all you saw was Denzel and Ethan sitting in the car talking, not much of an action movie. I am not kidding when I say the guy next to me was actually sleeping most of the time, and I was close to nodding off too. Ethan was not very believable as "the tough cop" in the end, but Denzel was quite good. The film would have been better without the loads of talking, I think people got the hang of the problem within the first 10 minutes of the movie. No need for all that talking. If they cut it all out the film would last about 15 minutes! A lot of "stars" was in it, but they didn't really have much to give or say...the director could have made it more interesting if he had focused more on the environment than just the "problem".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie SHOCKED me!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>TRAINING DAY is a shocking movie! Please, do yourself a favor and DON'T watch it, unless you're at least 16 years old (although 18 seems even more appropriate).It shows life and death in the ghetto without any kind of compromise. It shows a cop who turned into a criminal, because he thinks that this is the only way to deal with crime at all. It shows how another cop's ideals of his job (and maybe the world as a whole) come crashing down in only one day. And most important of all: The movie doesn't give any answers to the questions it arouses; the viewer has to make up these answers on his own and it's not clear whether he will find them - or whether they exist at all.In a way, TRAINING DAY has got a "happy end". But it's one of the darkest happy ends I've ever seen.Ethan Hawke plays well, and Denzel Washington is simply brilliant: He gives the bad guy in an absolutely convincing manner.TRAINING DAY is a true, drastic and important movie: 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't have any expectations when I went and saw this which is why I probably liked it. Training Day is the story of a rookie narcotics officer played by Ethan Hawke, and how he gets a close-up look at the world of police corruption thanks to his superior officer played with intensity by Denzel Washington. Never have I seen a movie that gives such in-depth insight to corrupt cops. The ending is a bit flawed, but it isn't enough to trample Denzel's powerhouse performance.

Nonetheless, it is a movie I would highly recommend to my friends to watch to get a glimpse of the dark sides of life which may be unbeknownst to a lot of people particularly those who live a sheltered life. The movie also has a message that certain individuals like Alonzo given a certain degree of power to influence either positively or negatively other people lives in an unbridled fashion could have devastating effects.

		<shortDescription>Tough cop shows rookie the ropes, L.A. cop style. Great performances. Strong direction. Violent. Eratic plot. 3 Flys.Out of Five</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Denzel Washington sure can play a great bad guy. In Training Day he plays Alonzo Harris the cop you'd just have to hate, unless you were as corrupt and violent as this mean b*****d is. But then he has locked away a good many criminals.He takes into his charge young Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) who hopes to make it into Alonzo's elite drug squad and in one rather hectic day shows Jake the ropes. `To protect the sheep you gotta kill the wolf and it takes a wolf to kill the wolf,' is Alonzo's mantra and he belts Jake about both morally and physically, in the name of justice, L.A. cop styleI hated Training Day for nearly all of its length but certainly not because it's a poorly made movie. It's just that it painted such an unrelenting picture of nastiness, selfishness and thuggery, and presented this message strongly as being the only right, proper and effective way of dealing with Alonzo's environment. The softer side of me just screamed for civility, niceness and the rule of law.But not Alonzo's street law. If the world is or might become really like this, especially in my town, well, we'd be in big trouble.Bad, vigilante cop movies aren't rare. Training Day is a beauty though, graced with a very good cast, a strong if erratic script from David Ayer (The Fast and the Furious, U-571) and exciting direction from Antoine Fuqua (Bait, The Replacement Killer).The performances are remarkable especially from Denzel Washington who discards that kind, lovable, demeanour of his to show just how terrific is his acting ability. Ethan Hawke complements Washington and that's a complement.Cameo's from Snoop Dogg and in particular Macy Gray as an embittered housewife are very strong as is Scott Glenn's as former cop Roger.Training Day often stretches credibility, particularly in it's final stages, but its intensity overcomes those sorts of reservations. It's not the sort of film I'd recommend for entertainment. If you enjoy tension and fine performances and you can take violence not too far to heart then Training Day could fuel your passions.3 Well Trained Flys Out of Five</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the trailer for Training Day last June and put it at the top of my must-see list for the Fall. Well, it's been in theaters for over a month now and I just got around to seeing it yesterday. What the hell took me so long? Anyway, I'm sure that most everyone bothering to read this knows the basic plot of this brilliant action movie (a rare breed) but I'm gonna do a quick rundown without spoiling anything. Rookie cop Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) is starting his first day on the job with leather-clad, veteran, city-reknowned all around badass Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). Things start off uneasy and the director does one hell of a job at making you feel the rookie's nervousness. In fact, you're sitting there wondering why in the hell this baby-faced nice guy wants to be a narc so bad. It's really simple; he wants to protect and serve and be one of the good guys. That's all. Needless to say, throughout the course of the day, Mr. Hoyt may very well decide that being a narc just isn't his cup of tea. But things aren't going to be that simple.You see, Hoyt is about to get way more than he bargained for. Alonzo Harris is one badass, crooked, filthy and downright mean guy, but yet he has an irresistable charm that makes you want to like him. Through him, we learn along with Hoyt, that everything he previously learned about being a cop is wrong and "to catch the wolf, you must become the wolf". This is one of those parts that I SWEAR had to have been written with just one actor in mind. I say this because I can't think of anyone else who could've pulled the part off, except maybe for Samuel L. Jackson. This is, in my mind, the best and most challenging role that Ethan Hawke has ever played. He does a damn fine job at showing all the right emotions and the transformation from vulnerable do-gooder, to hardened-vet over the course of 24 hours (!) is made wholly believable. Denzel Washington plays TOTALLY against type and gives one hell of a knockout performance as the ruthless badass who may have once been a good cop. (I know I keep using that word a lot to describe him, just see the movie.) I really loved the wolf-metaphor that he kept using it was perfect. I give Training Day A perfect 10 here and I will be getting the DVD. Let's see Mr. Washington in more roles like this. One more thing. I was really glad to see Scott Glenn. He's highly underrated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>iron will vs. iron fist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would have thought that every possible angle on the good cop/bad cop treatment had been exhausted. I would have thought Denzel conquered all the risky roles early in his career, opting now for more subdued, sympathetic, and audience-friendly characters like those in `Remember the Titans' and the inappropriately named `The Hurricane'. I would have thought that Ethan Hawke had an open clause in his contract about never appearing without facial hair.But Antoine Fuqua's gritty and sobering `Training Day' breaks all the rules. Having developed his craft early on directing music videos and television commercials, he emerged boldly into the box office limelight in 1998 with `Replacement Killers' and then fizzled with last years' disappointing and forgettable Jamie Foxx action yawn `Bait'. He returns this fall, taking the reigns of a virile and invigorating script by David Ayer, a young writer whose career is still in it's infancy but is already well-established in testosterone-wielding fun with last years `U-571' and Universal Studios summer paycheck `The Fast and the Furious' ($144M at last count).Ethan Hawke birthed his reputation as the quintessential slacker, apparently living in a world where combs, razors, and clothes that fit are luxury items. Dissolving the typecast, he stars (though less brightly than Denzel) as Jake Hoyt, the idealistic straight-edge officer on his first day in a covert narcotics unit headed up by Denzel's Alonzo Harris. Hawke's character quickly learns that his initiation into the squad is a one-way street, and he has one day to iron out the ethics of either turning dirty or fighting dirty.Denzel Washington, as the bad-ass deep-undercover corrupt cop, revamps the powerfully watchful and angrily militant guise that he first debuted in `Malcolm X', extending something remarkably spiritual and endearing to the prospect of a police officer playing vigilante or dipping into confiscated drug money. He maintains the sanctimony and passive aggression that built his career, this time laced with the Tourette's-induced, crazed paranoia that first surfaced in his cop-over-the-edge in `Richochet'. His role here makes you forget that he previously lent his eponymous notoriety to such self-gratifying box-office fodder as `The Bone Collector' or `Virtuosity' and makes you remember that he once took center stage at the Academy Awards (Best Actor 1989, `Glory').This movie also contains notable cameos from Macy Gray and Dr. Dre, the former displaying the most impractical, keyboard-frightening manicure to grace the big screen since Lon Chaney's Wolfman, and the latter serving up the irony as an L.A. police officer (for more information, see N.W.A.'s 1988 release `F*** the Police'). Snoop Doggy Dogg also had a small but all-too-believable part as a junkie, despite a hectic schedule starring in four releases this year, as well as any movie from the last three years with misspelled titles. See `Hot Boyz' (1999) or `Tha Eastsidaz' (2000).At first, the mood leans toward that of philosophical street-smart police discipline, but eventually vents it's energy in the struggle between the main characters, with each pushing the other to unrehearsed limits. The ending feels somewhat like the beginning of a saga - the two battle to a completion that seems eternally incomplete, as the hero and villain confound one another's personalities and seem naturally entwined. This is a must-see for Denzel fans, and a potent oak-hearted battle of wits, might, and morality that can be appreciated by anyone who thinks that society still has much evolving to do. Good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The realness" indeed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We've all seen the corrupt cop flick done before, and done well. But it is not so often that we get much more than the standard good cop/bad cop affair. Training Day often goes beyond the limits of Hollywood with its careful dissection of the moral and ethical dilemma cops face when dealing with "the streets" while still remaining a Hollywood flick.What works so well is the combination of faced paced drama that we and our Rookie cop, Ethan Hawke, are thrown into and the intellectual debate that rages today over "the streets" and "what to do about it." Hawke's ethics relate closely to that of MLK while Washington takes more of Malcom X's position (fittingly so). Denzel's character may be corrupt now, but the film hints at a change from earlier views, almost as if "the streets" showed him that there was no other way of functioning as an effective Narc. Understanding the value of being "real," he believes to be most important in getting things done. A "naive, wanna save the world" rookie cop, in his mind, ain't gonna cut it out there. And he tries to get Hawke's character to understand his views. But while this is happening we are then shown how by being so closely related to "the streets," and even living there, what it has done to him. Who is more right in dealing with "the streets," Hawke or Washington? There we have the foundation for the story.We are pretty much thrown into Ethan Hawke's position of constant wonderment of Washington's character. And for the most part it works. Is this how things get done? Can one be a "good" cop and be effective? Is there no hope for the victims of the situation? And the dilemma plays on to a fast beat. Very good stuff.The only surprise was where was all of the hip-hop music from the soundtrack? the moody score was effective, but they could have added more than one or two tracks from the soundtrack.</fullReview>

There were only a couple places where I was able to start dissecting it, but then the plot would pick up again right away and I'd be engaged. This is a great work of fiction based on events that could actually occur and people who probably exist. After reading a certain "Rolling Stone" article the summer before the film was released about the Death Row Records/Rampart Scandal, I felt that a film like this should be made. And it was.

The ending was somewhat of a sell out and not too plausible. Guns, as in most Hollywood productions, were the center piece of the movie. No wonder we live in violent times. We worship them in movies such as this. I rate the movie highly for its fast pace and good acting but discount that rating because of the gun worship and faulty ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See it for Denzel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say Denzel is the MAN. He just steals the show.Training Day focuses on Ethan Hawke's character (Jake Hoyt), a young LAPD cop. He is on his first day to start off in a new position to work in the narcotics division. Jake is eager, he tells his wife how excited and nervous he is for this assignment comparing it to first day of high school football tryouts. Jake plays by the book, is intelligent and strong, but his world is about to be turned upside down by a hardcore veteran named Alonzo Harris played by Denzel Washington.Alonzo takes Jake on a ride of insanity through the drug plagued worlds of Black and Hispanic neighborhoods in gritty Los Angeles. Alonzo is hard, he is succesful and good at what he does, but he does things differently. Alonzo is essentialy a cop who makes his own rules, and this of course creates a conflict for Jake. After a few minor routine assignments it's easy to see that Alonzo is dirty. In short Alonzo's attitude to fighting crime is simple, to beat the street you have to be harder than the thugs and pushers who inhabit it. But Alonzo has been doing this far too long and is in a lot of trouble.This movie COULD have been a bad exercise in good cop bad cop shlock. But what evolves is a very well acted character study of 2 men with different views on how crime should be fought (in fact 2 polar extremes). Denzel is masterful as Alonzo playing one of the most feared dirty cops I have ever seen on film, and Hawke as Jake does what he does well in most films, playing tormented characters caught in a bad situation and looking very shocked and perplexed. There are great scenes of dialogue between the 2 such as when Alonzo asks why Jake wanted to join the squad. Jake replies that he wants to get drugs off the streets and give something back to the community, and Alonzo only replies what is the real reason you joined narcotics? Jake then says, "Cause I want to make detective". It is this line that is the basis of Training Day.With that, director Antoine Fuqua's work of pictured gang plagued LA is masterful. Black distraught neighborhoods, Hispanic tatooed thugs sitting around a card table, Fuqua creates hell and shows it brilliantly. There is some good cinematography and a good score (but used too infrequently) creating a nightmarish uneasyness. It's also wonderful to see Denzel play a bad guy for a change and play it sooooo well. When Alonzo is interogating suspects you can't help but squirm in your seat while you watch him on screen.The film tries to tie in a plot, so that it can create a conclusion in the end. It isn't that distracting or even neccesary but it only shows the inevitable of Alonzo's work. The film ends unresolved and this is good, because the film isn't about the good guy winning and the bad guy getting his just desserts, it's about how 2 men of different moral belief try to survive and do what is right. There are no heroes in this film, just great characters.While the use of placing 2 well known rap starts in cameo rolls, 1 Snoop Doggy as a wheelchair pushing crack dealer [good acting], 2 Dr Dre. as a cop henchman for Alonzo [bad acting], was really unnecesary. While Snoop holds his own in the spotlight Dre's acting is just so canned. Minor points, but I'd EASILY recommend this for Denzel's performance alone.Rating 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What Denzel Washington does in this movie is similar with whatSean Connery did in the Hunt for Red October, or Al Pacino did inthe Scent of a Woman; he simply outnumbered other casts.From the beginning, like Ethan Hawke, we look at him with a fullawe, such charisma and control and logical reasons towards allthe violence and crimes he does. And sitting on the third seat withthese two characters later proven to be a joyride between realismand idealism flick, similar like what Gene Hackman and WillemDafoe fighting in Mississippi Burning.The mean streets of Los Angeles are well presented, we simplylook at the violence and somehow, with Denzel Washingtoncharm, suddenly we're wondering what kind of life Ethan Hawkelive in, which puts him in such idealism... he's a pure heroschoolboy plunged into a pond of hell which he supposed to knowall the time.Apart from that, the sympathy and charms which supposed to bedrawn into our growing pains towards Denzel character remainsthere. That's the beauty of it, we are so deep with this characterand we can see his madness and his end with some understanding and acceptance.Indeed this is one of Denzel Washington's excellent-steadyperformance. His stare, his goove, his move, indeed casting himin this movie is the best thing the producer have done. And for Ethan Hawke, okay, he's there the way he's suppose to be,the usual boyish purity and idealism. I just hope he can delivermore developing characters as he have done in Alive.As for the storyline, the basic frame is nice, and blend nicely ineveryday's violence, but the pure luck of the rookie somehow blewit up... followed with somehow-a forceful ending.Training Day starts with a realistic starts, but later ends withidealistic standard scripts... but still it's an incredible movie towatch.Highly recommended for evening movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Takes you for a neat ride... and then keeps going when it should have stopped.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** o/o **** "Training Day" is a Drama/Thriller directed by Antoine Fuqua (Bait, The Replacement Killers) and stars Oscar winner Denzel Washington (Remember the Titans, The Hurricane, Glory) and Ethan Hawke (Michael Almereyda's Hamlet, Snow Falling on Cedars, Great Expectations) It is released by Warner Bros. at a running time of 120 min. It is rated R for brutal violence, persuasive language, drug content, and brief nudity. The basic story is as follows: Jake Hoyt (Hawke) is a husband and father who has been a cop for 18 months. He is training to be a narcotics officer. On his training day he is assigned to Alonzo Harris who will show him the ropes. Alonzo at some times is bitter but at other times is fun. But Jake is surprised when he finds out how Alonzo is corrupt and conniving. And soon Jake is intertwined in Alonzo's plan to deliver a large sum of money after a mistake made with the Russian Mafia. First of all this movie is performance based... the script doesn't give it any oomph and neither is the direction anything special. It is simply wonderful performances by Washington and Hawke (though Hawke will most likely be overlooked by Washington). The movie is paced very well at the beginning with Hawke waking up and meeting Denzel... then we get the intensity point as they go from bust to bust. There are surprisingly impressive cameos by Snoop Dogg and Macy Gray that also push the movie along. Scott Glenn also gives a worthwhile performance as Roger, Alozo's "supposed" friend. 1 hr. 40 mins. in I was thinking, whoa that was one of the best endings I have ever seen! And then the movie continued.This is the movies fatal flaw... it should have quit when it was ahead... hell, I might have given it an extra half of a star if it had ended then but it all boiled up to a rooftop jumping and then loud ending. Academy Potential: I am deeming this much too violent for the Academy to choose Denzel for a Best Actor nomination. It's just to much of an action flick to be considered... it would be like nominating Stallone for "Cliffhanger". While the film has a horrible flaw... it's still enjoyable to watch the stars in brilliant performances. So the movie isn't completely wasted, just less than expected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a ride!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the moment I sat in my seat until the end of Training Day, the ride was unbelievable; absolutely incredible. There were those first few quite and terse moments before Ethan Hawke(Jake Hoyt)meets Denzel Washington(Alonzo Harris). SPOILER!!Hoyt's at home with his wife and new baby and is excited at the chance he's been given to join an elite LAPD narc unit. Hawke(Hoyt)meets his would be mentor and it's off the hook from then on. The Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg song is most appropriate as they begin their adventure through the streets of LA. Adventure or nightmare, good cop or bad cop, are questions you ask yourself as the movie proceeds. All the while you watch Harris play serious mind games with Hoyt, encouraging him in one breath and literally punking him out in the next. You should enjoy the breakneck speed of this movie and if you're a fan of Washington's acting as I am, you'll enjoy watching him take it to another level.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful exercise in excess.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>TRAINING DAY goes for broke. Everything about it is over the top, and that's why I loved it so much. It's not a gritty, realistic portrayal of a corrupt police officer, but a story of a man so far over his head that there is no way he'll ever get out. It reminded me of Brian DePalma's SCARFACE, about drug dealer Tony Montana. Realistic? No, but tremendous movie making. Denzel Washington outdoes himself here. He goes over the top so far, but still within the limits of the movie. Director Antoine Fuqua (THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS and BAIT) is not exactly known for his subtley, and TRAINING DAY is anything but subtle. It's like a freight train of a movie. The violence is strong, persistant and off putting, but then again it's supposed to be. (WARNING SPOILERS MAY BE AHEAD). The final scenes with Denzel in the street screaming at all the people he thought loved him so much, are great. Denzel's fate was sealed from the beginning of the movie, it just took him some time to realize it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Denzel Washington is cool, buff, smooth and believable as a tough cop in LAPD's narcotics squad, He takes us on a trip down several circles of that hell while bringing in a rookie to understand the ropes. Narcotics are serious business and lying down with dogs, comes you up with fleas. Wow, I think I need some of that mental floss now. Ethan Hawke, who is ironically being transformed into a wolf, presents a believable rookie on his first days assignment on the streets. The initiation rites are believable but his vengeful bravura needs work. All others, and there are quite a few recognizable performers, are brief and incidental. Words like riveting, chilling and explosive come to mind, as this is quite a wild ride. Follow it carefully or you'll miss the nuance and the plot detail. No spoilers here so PAY ATTENTION to the film. And unless I wasn't, you 'll. not find a subtle message nor any startling revelations. Urban cop action with a heavy dose of (no surprise here) rap.

		<fullReview>I looked forward to Training Day because of Denzel Washington (Alonzo)and I was well rewarded by his excellent, in-your-face acting. In fact, all the acting was excellent. However, the movie grew more and more violent as it moved along, I thought overtaking the suspenseful first half build-up. By the end, I was sorry we took our teenage daughter. More importantly, the movie's plot doesn't stand up to the plausibility test. Alonzo's driving motivation seems to stem from a hazy, out of the movie run-in he had with Russian gangsters in Las Vegas. Coincidentally or not, the day he must resolve this issue is also an orientation day for rookie Hoyt (Ethan Hawke). Over the course of the day, unlikely yet critical events tumble over one another toward a predictable violent climax. One thing I couldn't figure out: Why would Alonzo choose to live right in the middle of the worst drug neighborhood in LA?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, a good movie from Antoine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew that Antoine Fuqua had a good movie in him. Let's breakdown his career: He directs music videos (most notably, Gangsta's Paradise) then he gets tapped to do an American version of the Hong Kong action film. The Replacement Killers was alright, I suppose, but it certainly didn't live up to its predecessors. Then he gets stuck directing a movie with Jamie Foxx in the lead. That had disaster written all over it (Jamie Foxx is absolutely great in supporting roles). But with Bait, you really could tell that Fuqua had talent, even if the material wasn't good. But now, with Training Day, he's given a prime opportunity to show us what he's made of. And it's clear that he's got a good career ahead of him.This movie is a real treat in this time of what seems to be one bad movie after another. It's very funny at parts, but not to the point where it's a comedy that gets all serious at the end. Denzel is, of course, great. I really don't understand why people keep making a big deal out of his performance though. Sure, it's the first time he's played a bad guy, but I honestly can't think of one time when he's given a bad performance. He's always great, so this shouldn't be a surprise. What is a surprise is Ethan Hawke. For once he's not playing the brooding, misunderstood guy. He plays this one like it should be and that was the big acting surprise (not seeing Dr. Dre as a cop).Normally, when a movie has a revelation towards the end, it changes your whole viewpoint on what happened earlier. But, without giving away anything, with this movie, it just makes you uneasy about the events that are to come. I've also read a few people talking about how the very end is a little hard to swallow. It makes perfect sense if you really paid attention to the rest of the movie. And I'm not talking about "if you blink, you miss the key point of information." This film is about setting a certain mood and state of mind. Both from the director and from the characters. If you let yourself get into it, the whole movie is a really great experience.Like I said before, this movie is very funny. But the action in it is some of the best in a while too. It's not all about special effects and messing with your visual perspective. Most of the action is shot in a way that allows you to follow it from start to finish.I loved the cameos too: Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, Macy Gray, Tom Berenger, and that guy who played Redbud in The Usual Suspects. They were fun, but not distracting. Overall, I guess the movie does have it's flaws; it does seem to drag a little in parts. But it is still a great movie worth watching. While this is Antoine Fuqua's first really good movie, I hope he now has the ability to get better and better projects. I've never ended a review with a pun before so I won't call his first two movies training days. That would just be wrong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Searing Work From Washington and Fuqua</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Audiences looking for a big, mindless, action-driven cop flick in Training Day will be surprised by two things: director Antoine Fuqua, who made the dismally mediocre Jaime Foxx vehicle, "Bait", has molded an adult, tense, mature, and engrossing action-drama, and two, Denzel Washington has eschewed his good guy persona, playing a charismatic but unlikable rogue cop.While the story of corrupt cops lurking in the police department may be done to death, a certain timeliness is present with such stories as the recent LAPD Rampart scandal. Ethan Hawke plays a rookie-cop who hopes to work his way up the rungs of the LAPD to detective by working with seasoned undercover narcotics cop Washington. Washington proves, however, to have questionable methods of investigation and procedure. Hawke unwittingly is drawn into the sickly logical and charasmatic musings of Washington until he ends up unwittingly becoming a participant in a coverup.Again, the story has been done before, but rarely has it been tackled with such a tense, uneasy, and guttural realism. Director Antoine Fuqua injects the film with a searing authenticity: LA hasn't been such an uninviting. dangerous, ugly urban jungle in a while, with bleak, rainy shots of the city swimming in dirt, litter, and graffiti. The use of realistic looking and acting gang members, and also the cameo appearances of rap stars helps keep tensions high as well, and also adds striking resonance.Anchoring the whole movie is Denzel Washington, in a refreshing change from his usual upstanding, righteous roles. As the corrupt cop, he gleefully goes for broke in a manic, antihero, larger-than-life performance so unlike his previous work that it will surely garner him an Oscar nomination.While the last 15 minutes almost undo the fantastic work by the cast and crew, Training Day is an accomplished renewal in the cop movie genre, a promising feature in Fuqua's career, and another great performance under Denzel Washington's belt.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's the deal. This movie SHOULD really get a 6 out of 10 from me (I gave it a seven). The problem? The script. The script is pretty good, but it has two major problems. The films these-types-of-cases-can't-go-to-court-type ending really cheapens the rest of the film. And then there is the vice that really gets Denzel Washington's character in trouble ... it just does not jive. Like Snoop Dogg smelling the scent of rookie cop on Ethan Hawke, Mr. Washington's vice smells of plot device (as opposed to character). Now, sure, lot's of films make this mistake but what makes it so grating here is that the film would have been really good without it. You see, Mr. Washington's character simply is too smart for this vice to be a character flaw. It just does not work, and with the easy out ending, it cheapens the whole effect of Denzel Washington, Ethan Hawke, and Anton Fuqua's work. A six out of ten knocked up to a barely passable 7 simply because I know that it is the script that betrays everyone else who worked on this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is refreshing for a number of reasons. Firstly, the plot has some depth and originality, something which cannot be said for the majority of offerings in this genre. Secondly, the characters are solid and believable. This is in no little part due to the excellent performances put in by Denzel Washington (hardened veteran Narcotics officer) and Ethan Hawke (the rookie on his 'training day'). Another reason for being refreshing is that Denzel is the bad guy - he plays the players to his own ends, and not just to put the criminals away.The action flows nicely from a steady beginning to the fateful climax and, even though the film paints quite a bleak picture of what is required to survive and thrive on the streets, there are not a few moments of humour.Definitely recommended.</fullReview>

I feel the same about Ethan Hawk, only instead of 'generally isn't in movies I like' it's 'never in movie I like', but I surely cannot say the same about Training Day. The two actors gave excellent performances, the subplots kept me interested, and the ending was great.There is some pretty strong violence and a lot of profanity (yet it made Washington's character more believable as an inner city narcotics detective), but who ever can't handle the above should know better than going to a movie like this just by watching the previews, so enjoy! 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the first movie in quite a long while in which I walked into the theater with high expectations and walked out completely satisfied. Denzel Washington is beyond a great actor. In my opinion, after watching this film, he is among the top two or three of his generation. If Glory introduced him to the masses, Training Day should cement his place in film history. Very few actors have the ability to be effective as both the hero and the villain. Kevin Spacey, Robert DeNiro, and Robert Duval come to mind also. Denzel was the perfect villian for this film. The atmosphere of this film is very gritty and realistic. Still, it does not move slowly, and every little vignette in the story seems pertinent at the end. The only flaw with this film might be that it was supposedly supposed to mirror the life of a rogue LAPD narcotics officer. Maybe it was a little too dramatic in the end, but again it was well worth my time and energy to see this film. 8.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intense, character driven cop film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most salient component in ?Training Day' is the intensity that stars Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke bring to the screen. Director Antoine Fuqua presents his third and best film yet that weaves a simple yet effective tale of human tragedy and morality. Fuqua's first cinematic foray was the ill-received ?The Replacement Killers'. In the film he proved he was a student of the art in which he displayed his flair for John Woo style visuals in this Honk Kong-type action flick starring Chow Yun Fat. From then on he went on to make ?Bait' a so-called action comedy that failed on almost every level. In this; his most mature film as of yet, he tones down his visuals and uses Washington's acting capabilities to the fullest capacity to create a rich, character driven film that is taut and tense. ?Training Day' is exactly what the title describes it as. The film unravels within the span of one full day and brings us into the heart of police corruptibility. Ethan Hawke stars as Jake Hoyt, a former rookie uniform officer on his first day in the narcotics department. Heading this department is Washington who portrays Alonzo Harris; a deviant and ruthless corrupt cop who has crossed the line of morality. Within a span of one day, Hoyt is literally ?thrown into the fire' as he is exposed to the dark underbelly of the Los Angeles Police Department Narcotics Unit while being ?trained' by Harris. Without spoiling the simple yet efficient script, these two men deliver great performances that catapult this otherwise regular film into a good film. Within the span of one day, Hoyt is exposed to massive gunplay, violent attacks, crooked drug dealers (such as Snoop Dogg), a loud-mouthed drug haven (Macy Gray) and plenty of foul language as Hoyt must come to terms with the disparaging image that being a cop is not all it was supposed to be. In terms of performances, this film packs it in mainly due to Washington's villainous turn as a cop who has crossed the line and who is attempting to recruit others with him. A welcome note is Hawke's turn as a young cop who holds his own against Washington in some tight and well acted scenes that add a certain level of intensity that completely captivate the audience. In addition to all this, a refreshing angle in this film is that unlike other films, we see the relationship between our ?hero' and ?villain' (notice the quotation marks) build up, blossom, and deteriorate before our very eyes. This leaves the relationship unmasked and we as the viewers get to experience first hand the detrimental characteristics of this unconventional relationship. As for the direction of this film, I mentioned it earlier. It is a substantial step in terms of Fuqua's respectability factor. Finally he won't have to be ashamed of one of the movies he has done.

		<shortDescription>Very good tour of inner-city LA</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first movie in quite a long while in which I walked into the theater with high expectations and walked out completely satisfied. Denzel Washington is beyond a great actor. In my opinion, after watching this film, he is among the top two or three of his generation. If Glory introduced him to the masses, Training Day should cement his place in film history. Very few actors have the ability to be effective as both the hero and the villain. Kevin Spacey, Robert DeNiro, and Robert Duval come to mind also. Denzel was the perfect villian for this film. The atmosphere of this film is very gritty and realistic. Still, it does not move slowly, and every little vignette in the story seems pertinent at the end. The only flaw with this film might be that it was supposedly supposed to mirror the life of a rogue LAPD narcotics officer. Maybe it was a little too dramatic in the end, but again it was well worth my time and energy to see this film. 8.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intense, character driven cop film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most salient component in ?Training Day' is the intensity that stars Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke bring to the screen. Director Antoine Fuqua presents his third and best film yet that weaves a simple yet effective tale of human tragedy and morality. Fuqua's first cinematic foray was the ill-received ?The Replacement Killers'. In the film he proved he was a student of the art in which he displayed his flair for John Woo style visuals in this Honk Kong-type action flick starring Chow Yun Fat. From then on he went on to make ?Bait' a so-called action comedy that failed on almost every level. In this; his most mature film as of yet, he tones down his visuals and uses Washington's acting capabilities to the fullest capacity to create a rich, character driven film that is taut and tense. ?Training Day' is exactly what the title describes it as. The film unravels within the span of one full day and brings us into the heart of police corruptibility. Ethan Hawke stars as Jake Hoyt, a former rookie uniform officer on his first day in the narcotics department. Heading this department is Washington who portrays Alonzo Harris; a deviant and ruthless corrupt cop who has crossed the line of morality. Within a span of one day, Hoyt is literally ?thrown into the fire' as he is exposed to the dark underbelly of the Los Angeles Police Department Narcotics Unit while being ?trained' by Harris. Without spoiling the simple yet efficient script, these two men deliver great performances that catapult this otherwise regular film into a good film. Within the span of one day, Hoyt is exposed to massive gunplay, violent attacks, crooked drug dealers (such as Snoop Dogg), a loud-mouthed drug haven (Macy Gray) and plenty of foul language as Hoyt must come to terms with the disparaging image that being a cop is not all it was supposed to be. In terms of performances, this film packs it in mainly due to Washington's villainous turn as a cop who has crossed the line and who is attempting to recruit others with him. A welcome note is Hawke's turn as a young cop who holds his own against Washington in some tight and well acted scenes that add a certain level of intensity that completely captivate the audience. In addition to all this, a refreshing angle in this film is that unlike other films, we see the relationship between our ?hero' and ?villain' (notice the quotation marks) build up, blossom, and deteriorate before our very eyes. This leaves the relationship unmasked and we as the viewers get to experience first hand the detrimental characteristics of this unconventional relationship. As for the direction of this film, I mentioned it earlier. It is a substantial step in terms of Fuqua's respectability factor. Finally he won't have to be ashamed of one of the movies he has done. It is imperative to note that this is not an action film, nor a thriller. It is a pure dramatic piece that pits both antagonist and protagonist against one another that is highlighted by well-written scenes and great acting. Screenwriter David Ayer creates a fairly decent script that allows the audience to view a first hand glimpse at the audacity and cunningness of Washington's character.

		<shortDescription>Very Good -- In Spite of Antoine Fuqua</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't believe the rumors; Denzel Washington was not "over the top". He was to quote Roger Ebert "over the top and down the other side". His performance was wild and out of control--and he seemed to be enjoying it! There is a line that separates a tour de force performance from buffoonery, Mr. Washington skidded all the way to the edge, wobbled violently, but managed to keep from falling over that line. Viewers will love being along for the ride. I have never before seen a Denzel Washington performance worth seeing, let alone mentioning until now. Sure he's a wonderful actor, yada, yada, yada, but he has always been too bland and vanilla for this reviewers taste. But now Denzel has acquired some long needed "flava"Ethan Hawke was good too.Antoine Fuqua on the other hand was not good. He should return to directing music videos at once. Will someone tell him there are more camera angles besides extreme-up-the-nostrils-close-ups. The direction was deplorable. A first year film student could have done better. I kept thinking to myself "when did I direct a movie?" that was the only possible explanation for it being so poorly directed. This film was saved from it's simple script and horrendous direction only by exceptional acting (Washington and Hawke) and an editor who must also be a magician.The acting and editing not only saved this film from it's unskilled director but from the additions of Snoop Dog and Dr. Dre to the cast. I imagine there must not be very many skilled actors in Hollywood since they found it necessary to scavage among rappers to play minor roles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film and Washington's performance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay we've seen Washington play controversial figures before, but there was something about his character in "Training Day" that hit me hard. How hard? It's best if I draw a comparison:Anyone familiar with "Once Upon A Time in the West"? Anyone? Show of Hands? Let me illustrate the opening scene. Typical opener for a Western: Low down, yella bellied, rattlesnake types roughing up a small homestead. Roof burning, windows shot up, family dying. A small child huddles against his parents' lifeless bodies. A shadow looms over him. The boy gazes at the man casting the shadow: From the boots up, up, up, into the leering face of...Henry Fonda.Yes, THAT Henry Fonda."Young Mr. Lincoln" Fonda."Golden Pond" Fonda.HENRY F---ING FONDA.And THAT is the effect Denzel "Detective Alonzo" Washington had on me while watching "Training Day". The exact same shock some filmgoer in the late sixties would have had the first time Henry clean-as-a-slate Fonda was cast as a scummy murderer.Okay, back to your lives now. Thanks for hearing me out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good cop / Bad Cop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Good cop/bad cop.' The police interrogation technique of partners ganging up on a suspect has long been a cinematic staple, but in `Training Day,' the new film from Warner Bros., the competition between good cop/bad cop goes on inside one cop. Narcotics detective Alonzo Harris, played by Denzel Washington in a spectacular performance, is the schizophrenic combination of a streetwise law enforcement crusader and a vicious leader of a police wolf pack that preys on bad guys and good guys alike. He is funny and likeable, ruthless and despicable, hero and outcast. `There are some profoundly evil people walking these streets,' Alonzo says as the film begins. Will good prevail over evil? That is the simple dramatic question director Antoine Fuqua poses here, but the route to the answer weaves erratically through crime-infested neighborhoods and sizzling plot twists, jumping from one spellbinding scene to the next. Harris spends a single `training day' working with narcotics division recruit Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke). Hoyt is a veteran ofuniformed traffic duty in the suburbs, but Harris sees enough in him to offer a chance to make detective on the mean streets of Los Angeles. The two spend most of the day riding around in Harris' `office,' a vintage low-rider Monte Carlo, as the grizzled but suave Alonzo explains the nuances of working undercover and making the big arrest. Harris convinces his protégé to smoke PCP-laden weed, saying refusal on the streets would cost him his life -- `If I was a dealer, you'd be dead by now.' He tells Hoyt not to wear his wedding ring to work, saying suspects would seize on it as a sign of weakness, a vulnerability to exploit. They drink malt liquor like so much bottled water, and even stop off for a few belts of `the $300-a-bottle good stuff' with Harris' shadowy friend (played perfectly by Scott Glenn). Harris boasts of the `15,000 man-hours of incarceration time' that his investigations have led to, but he allows several small-time criminals go free after Hoyt is ready to make busts. `We're not racking up arrests today,' Harris says. Hoyt asks, `Just let the animals wipe themselves out?' And Alonzo replies, `God willing.' Fuqua, who made a mark directing music videos for Arrested Development, Henry D &amp; The Boyz and Coolio, distinguishes himself with his third feature, after `The Replacement Killers' (1998) and `Bait' (2000). The pace of the film never slows, even when the two main characters are simply riding around in a car or sitting in a restaurant. The action sequences are interlaced with driving rap music and feverish editing, and Fuqua keeps the viewer guessing about what will become of Harris and Hoyt to very last. Even with a scraggly mustache and goatee, Hawke still has a hard time shaking off his boyish innocence, but he comes of age as an actor in `Training Day.' With solid performances as a teen-ager in `The Dead Poets Society' (1989) and `A Midnight Clear' (1991), Hawke started landing some starring roles, including the overlooked lead in `Snow Falling on Cedars' (1999). A Best Supporting Actor nomination would not be a surprise, given his stellar work as the tormented Hoyt.As for Washington, he has never been better on screen, and we're talking about an actor who has mustered four Academy Award nominations in his career. He earned his first nod for a supporting role as South Africa's Steve Biko in `Cry Freedom' (1987), and then won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in 1989's `Glory.' He followed that with Best Actor nominations for `Malcolm X' (1992) and `The Hurricane' (1999). (He should have won both statues, losing to Al Pacino in `Scent of a Woman' and Kevin Spacey in `American Beauty.') Some wonder whether Washington took a risk by playing a rogue cop in `Training Day,' but other than the upbeat football coach in `Remember the Titans' (2000), his past characters have not exactly been choirboys. For example, Reuben `Hurricane' Carter was a ruthless boxer and enough a product of the streets to be convicted of manslaughter, and Malcolm X made enemies of both whites and blacks before being assassinated. No, playing Alonzo Harris was not career suicide for Washington. In fact, it's very likely he'll finally win the Best Actor Oscar that his body of work so richly deserves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you can lose yourself in the overall action WITHOUT nit-picking technical issues or plot inconsistancies/holes to the bone, you might enjoy this fast-paced action movie. My personal opinion-from one who has never been on that side of the street-it had a dark, gritty realist feeling. I know there are cops out there who are tempted to cross the line and do so for whatever motives. No shocker there. That one might involve a rookie on his first day and really *(^* with his head, well, hey, I can suspend disbelief if the action is hot.I thoroughly enjoyed seeing Denzel in a villanous role and thought he carried it off to award perfection. DEFINITELY NOT OVER THE TOP- as some have claimed.Ethan Hawke is a good foil as the naive rookie, eager to make dectective grade, who gets an unexpected mentor in Denzel. Worth seeing again in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS HEREIN SPOILERS HEREINAt first glance this movie is really good. Certainly the performances and cinematography are top shelf, the movie is well paced, and individual scenes are very well scripted. But then you start to notice everything seems to be taking place in the kitchen. There's a phone call in the kitchen, breakfast in a kitchen, money in the kitchen, a mistress cooking Salvadoran style in the kitchen, a poker hand and the Mexican mafia hanging in the kitchen, and the movie nearly ends during a shootout in the kitchen. Certainly the LA Kitchen genre has been played to death!My biggest problem with this film is that the underlying premise makes no sense. Alanzo doesn't need the rookie cop to take the fall for anything, and even if he did he risks both the Rookie's life and the possibility of him not being lured into Alanzo's world way too much during "The Training Day". It is unrealistic too to think that even though Alanzo has just gotten in trouble in Vegas he could set up a transfer of a trainee to fill the role of..., the role of,...well I'm not sure what role he is supposed to fill. Renegade newbie who shouldn't have shot Scott Glen and then was killed mysteriously in east LA, allowing Alanzo to skate? If you think back, or try to outline some resolution other than Hawk escaping, I am sure you will get my point.Something is definitely cooking in this film, but despite all the spice, it is really lacking a fundamental principle. Make sure it makes sense. I give it a Seven (7)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is much more than exceptional. It begins cleverly and increases with enormous intensity as it moves to an overwhelming climax. The Academy Award for best actor must go to Denzel Washington for giving what I believe to be the greatest performance of his career as well as one of the greatest performances of any actor in history. Denzel is the character, "Alonzo Harris". He uses every existing talent within himself to make the portrayal of this character as "real" as any character that has ever appeared on the screen. I have always considered Denzel a great actor since I first saw him in "Carbon Copy". He is without question, simply the best actor in the world. "Training Day" is the vehicle that puts it all out there. Thank you Denzel for caring enough to give the performance of a lifetime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Training Day is a dynamic film about the darkest and most intense side of police work. The moral dilemnas and predicaments that arise for the aspiring narcotics officer are real problems that officers must face at times. The movie portrays how some officers find themselves in the "underworld" environment, without ever planning to enter it.The scene in the car, after they do the felony stop on the teenagers, shows how a seemingly strong-minded cop might be manipulated and it all starts there.I was also impressed by the realism as far as police work. The way the suspects refuse to cooperate, the artificial respect of the dealers with the cops, the drug sell hunting, the drug swallowing, the language, etc.If you're a law enforcement officer, especially a patrol cop, this is a REQUIRED viewing.Let's remember that as extreme as the film might seem, most of it happens regularly in the big cities. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard core nightmare for trainees.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a well known fact that the city of Los Angeles is going through its biggest corruption investigation in decades. With 1997's 'L.A. Confidential' set in the early 50's and now 'Training Day' set half a century later in the early 21st century, we can see that people haven't changed one bit in all that time and have always been the same. While the majority of police officers are honest and law abiding, 'Training Day' shows how one cop can do so much damage and that the crooked cop is worse than any criminal. 'Training Day' is designed to keep your stomach in knots from start to finish and features an Oscar calibre performance from Denzel Washington. Ethan Hawke is the subject of Washington's training. A veteran of the force, Washington takes Hawke in, trains him in the narcotics division of the LAPD and tries to justify criminal activity on the part of the police as a necessary part of nailing the bad guys and the film illustrates how corruption goes all the way to the top of the city's law enforcement officials. 'Training Day' has an exceptional look at street life with outstanding cinematography and editing and director Antoine Fuqua has crafted a film with exactly the right touch of violence and street smarts to match its intelligence and realistic look. A brutally honest effort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Training Day" is by far the most enthralling Cop movie in a very long time. Right from the beginning it breaks down every Hollywood cliche involving the genre, and makes very interesting observations on the dynamics between police and criminals in the LA underworld. The good cop bad cop metaphor is taken to new territory in this film.In the movie, the idealism of rookie cop Jack Hoyt (Hawke) is violently juxtaposed with the Machiavelian cynicism of the veteran detective Alonzo (Washington).(In my opinion Washington gives the most stunning portrayal of a jaded cop since Gary Oldman in "Romeo is Bleeding".)I will not delve into a plot summary, however, I will note that Antoine Fuqua's third film is by far his most truthful and memorable. It stands so far above the entertaining but pointless 'Bait' and the just plain crappy 'Replacement Killers', that I cannot believe that they were made by the same man. In the previous two films it was as if Fuqua was trying to make movies that were to seem that they were autered by more prominent directors (John Woo and Michael Bay to be exact).However, in this film, the director has garnered his own voice, and he has some very important things to say about race, right and wrong, cops and criminals, and about the lines that blur between them all.The true brilliance of this film, however may not be the message that Fuqua wants to convey, but rather the sheer mix of subtlety and outright vicery though which he does convey it. This film is not perfect (which films are?) but it is very important, and it is very ballsy and that is what counts.8.5/10.</fullReview>

The way that the different races were represented in this movie gives me little to no hope of racism ever ending....especially when I see the way that Hollywood continues to portray ethnic groups.

		<shortDescription>What's wrong with this picture?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is only one reason why this flick will never have its rightful place in Hollywood history. With great anticipation, I watched Denzel Washington (who I believe walks on water) take on his first roll as a bad guy. Even though his performance was stellar, there was just something significantly wrong with this film throughout. While contemplating the thin line between art imitating life and its opposite, consider the following.A Hollywood good guy who takes on the role of a bad guy is best served by pairing with someone who is also reputed as good. Remember the movie "Heat"? Ethan Hawke is not that guy.While the movie was set in the most notorious urban jungle, the good cop managed to do some things that simply can't be done by a white cop in a real environment of the same notoriety. Even people from the squeaky clean suburbs know that downtrodden minorities have no love (or trust) for white police officers simply because they are white (the oppressor). I could go on criticizing Training Day for other little quirks, but it really would not matter. There truly is only one reason why this potentially great movie (great like Gladiator) won't ever be regarded as such. Somebody made a fatal casting mistake. If Cuba Gooding Jr. had been the rookie, you can bet that this movie would have been in line for several Oscar awards. As fate would have it instead, Denzel Washington's first performance as a bad guy may go down in history as a forgettable moment. Imagine a sequel to this movie starring Ethan Hawke now as a veteran. Would you go see it? What a shame... Denzel did such an awesome job!</fullReview>

The last third of the show went a little overboard, losing some of the believability, but overall it enthralling, albeit sometimes disturbing. (I noticed that Jaime P Gomez from Nash Bridges played the part of one of Denzel's "henchmen" and think that his name should have been on the billing as well as Dr Dre, Snoop Dog, etc.) The entire supporting cast was fantastic, the background was realistic because it was the real thing.

Hawke questions Washington's over-the-line methods at every turn, only to be faced with the effectiveness of those methods. With so many recent headlines referencing scandal and internal investigations of police forces across the country, this film is relevant, and carries a gritty realism that left an impression in my mind.Definately not an action summer blockbuster, but too good to be passed up...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The magic of the movies is that they allow us to see worlds and experience emotions that are sometimes distant from our own and our immediate environment. Antoine Fuqua in Training day brings to us a world of gangs, drugs and corruption that is alien to must of us, but which nevertheless exists, sometimes transcending its own borders and coming to us in the form of news (The rampart scandal) and no matter if we close our eyes and ignore it, it will not go away. In that world we have two police officers, officer Hoyt, a rookie just assigned to an elite anti narcotics unit, and officer Alonzo, a veteran of the force, commanding the unit. Each one of those officers has his own set of values and morality, but no one is completely good or completely evil as absolute evil or absolute good are inexistent (in humans at least), ultimately they just want to take care of their own problems. Hoyt wants to take care of his family, his young wife, his new born child, he wants to escalate positions (don't we all) in the force and this new assignment may be the perfect place to start and he will do anything to nail it. Officer Alonzo has a more complicated set of problems, he has to get a million dollars and he has to do it today; otherwise he will be killed by the Russian mafia, but he has a plan and the plan involves Hoyt (a virgin shooter above suspicion) and Roger (a drug dealer with a lot of money in his kitchen floor). Basically the movie unfolds as Alonzo's plan goes into motion showing us glimpses of a corrupt and disturbing world, a world with its own rules and twisted morality, Smiley forgiving Hoyt's life as a return for having protected his cousin's honor, gang members shooting indiscriminately to protect the sandman's property, Stan and his friends giving Alonzo carte blanch to basically kill Roger and steal his money so he can save himself, etc. Denzel Washington work was impeccable; a well deserved Oscar, showing us a man who has moved the line a little bit each time to the point that he doesn't know where he is now, a man who has moved to the edge in a desperate attempt to save his life. Is he really that bad? After all he is a father, a husband, a friend appreciated by his team (if you think you can get away with it, we are with you) and colleagues. Maybe we just caught him in a bad day...a training day. If we want to make a better society for every one, we have to know what are the obstacles we have to overcome, training day show us some of those obstacles and then some.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Denzel Washington's best acting performance since...."Glory." No haahahhaha! I was just kidding! You thought that I was going to fall into that Oscar trap, huh? No, really, "Glory" was an excellent film, but between the time span of "Glory" (1989) and "Training Day," (2001) twelve years if my mathematics are not failing me, Washington has done other top-notch films, namely "Devil In A Blue Dress," (1994) "He Got Game," (1998) "The Siege," (also 1998) and "The Hurricane" (1999). This film just happens to have Washington as a completely wicked cop. To me, this film contained one of Denzel Washington's top-notch performances as villain F.E.S. Detective-Sergeant Alonzo Harris. Washington is completely wicked as he double-crosses everybody he knows to get the job done and then some. He holds nothing back. This film has heart, emotion, and adrenaline. It has something, a majestic quality, that Tony Scott's mean, tough "Man on Fire" (2004) tried to capture, but not quite as successfully. An incredible Oscar-nominated performance also for Ethan Hawke, who unfortunately lost to Jim Broadbent in "Iris" (2001). Probably most people Antoine Fuqua's best film to date, edging out "Tears of the Sun" (2003) and "King Arthur" (2004). The storytelling never felt stiff in the joints and just moved freely pretty much the whole way through. By the way, was that Eva Mendez as Washington's wife in the film? JUST KIDDING! I knew that! The whole world would know that by now!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a tired genre and the method of storytelling here (character dominated) runs from an even drier well of inspiration.This is your only spoiler warning...On the surface, you could call this a fusion of 'French Connection', 'Se7en', and any third cop movie you'd like, but there's no need for that. True, Fuqua and Fincher stemmed from the music video world, but that's where the similarities end. Fuqua's method is more Michael Bay and John Singleton. Fincher has promise because he knows where to channel that energy. Oh, well, at least Spike Lee is showing change...Hawke does his 'Dead Poets' bit all over again playing a rookie--how ironic. What's really shocking here is the emphasis on Denzel. He and Tom Hanks have so much in common that I'm not surprised that they were in 'Philadelphia' together. Both rely on taking self-assured "mr. right" roles. Both have lately tried to be "mr. deep", making some noble failures. 'Glory' marked a time when Denzel really tried.Unfortunately, this takes too many cues from the last 20 years of cop shows and two Cameron movies ('Strange Days', 'Point Break') to be anything interesting. Rather than throwing us another "bad cop" cliche, Fuqua should have made false leads and layered backstories to make us think more often.Then again, what do we expect from the director of 'Replacement Killers' when he's working with the writer of 'Fast and Furious'?Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this film a let-down from the beginning. I find it strange that Denzel Washington should have won an oscar for what is basically a one-dimensional character anyone could have played in their sleep. I found him very annoying throughout the movie, (which is partly the idea, I am aware) but when a character becomes so tiresome that you're tempted to switch off, you know that the filmmakers are in trouble. As for Hawk, he is given woefully little material to work with but in fact ends up giving a more impressive performance than Washington - I think he presented his own spiral into the seedy underworld or corrupt cops and his subsequent disillusionment very well (even if the goatee was a mistake...) On the plus side, I would say that the film's final act is genuinely gripping despite frequent lapses into mindless "beat-em-up" mode. It is, however, hopelessly macho in almost all respects and inexplicable cameos by Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and Macy Gray reveal that this is a film about surface not substance. I can't see much in it to raise it above any other simple action "good cop, bad cop" fare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The difference between good and bad is just an illusion? Until when can you tolerate the bad society without to really became part of?13 years is too long time!Undercover cop Alonzo Harris(Denzel Washington)after the 13 years spent together with criminals,drug dealers and offenders became a criminal too. The corrupt cops like Harris appeared with the cop movies but earlyer in secondary roles.Afther the movies like Copland and L.A.Confidential we know that corrupt cops does exist.After 24 hours together with his superior Alonzo Harris,the rookie Jake Hoyt(Ethan Hawke) will be convinced about this thing.Jake has one day to prove that he is a 'good' cop but he will be pulled deeper and deeper in Alonzo's world,and his life will be changed forever.At the begining he don't knows that his life is in danger,but in the next hours he will run for his life.Housband and father,man of justice,he don't understands Alonzo's actions,he can't cheat,steal or perpetrate a crime.Thinking about his job and his family he respects the orders but when he finds himself responsable of a crime comited by Alonzo takes gun in his hand and starts hunting his superior.Hawke's acting is very good but is a 'shadow' behind Washington's character.Cruel and arrogant,he is Mr.Cool(like John Travolta in 'Swordfish').Denzel Washington is a great actor,this movie is one of his bests. He usually don't plays negative roles but he is the ideal actor for Alonzo. This suspenseful actiondrama is of the 2001's bests,the story reflects the truth,the play of the actors is great and the soundtrack can't be missed. It is recommended for every Denzel Washington fan!Rating:9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been so looking forward to watching Taining Day because of the accolades that it has recieved both about the film and the acting and having watched it they are fully justified. I would go as far to say that this is the best cop movie i have ever seen. The story is fairly simple it is about a rookie who is on his first day on the department and unluckily has Denzil Washington as his boss who is a corrupt cop. Thw acting is as good as acting can get. Denzil Washington is fantastic and quite rightly recieved an oscar nomination but Ethan Hawke deserves compliments too. this is by far his best acting roll and quite frankly things can't get any better. The film is shot in L.A which makes it look realistic and that is thanks to brilliant direction from an director i had never heard , Antione Fuqua. look out for him in the future because he has created a masterpiece here in Training day. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TRAINING DAY is a gritty, well directed, and (very) well acted look at the mean streets of Los Angeles.Denzel Washington (in his Oscar-winning performance) gives one of the finest performances of the year as corrupt narcotics detective, Alonzo Harris. Washington's performance is free, charismatic, scary, and loose. Also (unlike Russell Crowe in A BEAUTIFUL MIND), Washington never breaks character. His interpretation of a very evil man is flawless.He practically pops with theatrical sizzle.Ethan Hawke is just as good as naive rookie, Jake Hoyt. Throughout the film, we can actually see Hoyt come into his own and become a leader (as opposed to a beginner). In my opinion, Hawke should have also won the Oscar.This is an unflinching look at one of the worst, most dangerous places in America.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this edge-of-your-seat action thriller, Denzel Washington tosses off his good guy image and turns into a tough crooked street cop; rough, calculating and coercive. On the other side of the coin is the truly gentle "homeboy," Ethan Hawke, whose performance equals that of Washington. Hawke, as Jake Hoyt, becomes the only one of the rookie cops to take a stand against Detective Alonzo Harris (Washington), and a helluva stand he takes, too.This is a powerful movie, unequalled by any other new videos I have seen. Together, Washington and Hawke create a new genre in the film industry, and proffer dual performances that are above reproach. Bravo!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this film relatively cold and was really enticed to go and see Denzil Washington playing against type. What I was treated to was a very good film.It wouldn't surprise me if Washington was nominated for an Oscar in his role here as Olonzo, a Narcotics cop who is just a little bent. What? A bent cop? Surely not! Oh yes. There are loads of them in this film, and Olonzo is the most cunning, ruthless and fast talking one to be had!The film's events all take place on Jake's (Ethan Hawke) training day. He wants to be on the aforementioned Narcotics team. He is very naive though, Olonzo shows him what it's really like to be on the streets etc. and things get a little bit dodgy to say the least.Good plot structure and two very confident performance's - especially Washington, he is ELECTRIC on screen - make this a great thriller to watch. Hawke puts in a great performance (not a big fan of him, but this film might just make me see his other films!). The film also boasts some nice performances from Dr Dre, Macy Gray, and Scott Glenn too.So, go and watch this film, and be treated to something that although does follow the rule book as far as thriller's go, but also bends the rules to achieve a nice twist to the story.9/10Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite Denzel characters of all time....great movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved Denzel's character in this movie at first. It wasn't until near the end that he started to become tiresome. This movie just adds to the huge resume of Denzel that shows his versatility to play so many different characters. It is unbelievable that he is the same guy who played in The Hurricane and Remember the Titans. This guy can act, and this movie is no exception.Ethan Hawke did an excellent job as well, but Denzel is who made this movie so good. Together though, they were superb!My only gripe about this movie is that everything happens in one day. Jake (Hawke) meets with Alonzo (Washington) one morning on a "training day" to see if Jake is cut out to handle his new job as an undercover narcotics officer. Jake has a laid back, shy and almost sheltered personality while Alonzo is completely over the top and in your face. The things that happen in this one day are things that probably wouldn't happen in an entire career for most people. However it is Hollywood, so what do ya expect?Nonetheless, I really enjoyed the movie. There were many scenes which made you laugh, others which made you say wow, and then there were the ones which made you say "yea right". However, even my girlfriend (who was expecting it to totally bomb) said she enjoyed it.For a cop movie, it is very original and realistic in that it takes place right in L.A., no fabricated neighborhoods were used here. However, it does start to stray from the realistic aspect as the movie draws on, which is why I only gave it a 9 out of 10. But if you can get by that, then you'll really like this movie.</fullReview>

No, no, no! Get some more people to go to imdb.com and bring this number up. I thought the movie was great. Yes, Denzel was at his usual best but Ethan Hawke stole the show in my book. Considering his previous movies where he played characters who would have been better portrayed sleeping than speaking (Hamlet, Snow Falling on Cedars, movies I didn't want to see in the first place), Ethan Hawke did a wonderful job as the moral guy. I have a greater respect for him now. And let's not forget Denzel. I'm surprised he doesn't have half a dozen Oscars. But what does the Academy know anyway? If they know anything (which they don't) Training Day will be nominated for Best Picture, ActorS (plural, for both Denzel and Ethan, who should at least get a supporting actor nom), screenplay, and director. That's right. Antione Faqua really showed what he's made of with this film, as opposed to Bait which wasn't so good. I really liked it.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly A Fine Tuned Training!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>November 12, 2001 was the day I saw the intensity-filled `Training Day'. Here is how my `Training Day' went:3:30 p.m.- Since it was `Veterans Day' I knew I had some free time to see a matinee. Usually I see romantic-comedies during matinees, so I had not been trained in the action genre that is `Training Day' during this mid-time of the day.4: 13 p.m.- I decided on `Training Day' because of the buzz on Denzel Washington's virtuosos performance as a crooked L.A. cop. So I got up my gear (my movie watcher discount card, my popcorn money, and my glasses) and was ready to be trained. 4: 45 p.m.- My training began a little rough when I saw the long line outside the movie theatre waiting to get their tickets. I knew now I was not in this alone. 5: 13 p.m.- I now started my neck-stretching warm-up exercise regime as I notice that the only vacant seats left in the cinema room were the ones in the front row. 5:45 p.m.- My official training started in the `advertising department' when I saw the trailers of some upcoming yet-to-be-released films.6: 00 p.m.- 7:00 p.m.- During this time, my training moved into the `public relations department' when I was able to notice that the film was very intense and very well-crafted. It had substance that the viewing public, especially those that live in the inner city, could relate to.7:01 p.m.- 8: 15 p.m.- My training ended in the ` motion picture elite department'. Because after watching this immensely entertaining intelligent film, I knew that it belonged in the elite films of 2001. Academy voters should be put on probation if they do not nominate Denzel for a Best Actor Oscar. Ethan Hawke, who plays the rookie cop who gets manipulated by Denzel's character, was surprisingly good in this type of film for him. However, it was Antonio Fuqua's manipulative direction that was one of the most unpredictable aspects of the film. 8:30 p.m.- My `training day' had ended! So now all of you have been hired to start your "Training Day' as soon as possible!***** Excellent</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Day you'll never forget</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A friend of mine and I have been waiting a very long time to see Denzel Washington in a role where his talent really shines. The best movie I've seen him in to date is Fallen, although I haven't seen Malcolm X, so can't comment on that. For me, the difference between Fallen and most of Denzel's other roles is an edge, a sharpness, a *reality* that just doesn't appear in movies like The Hurricane or Remember the Titans. To put it as my friend does, we wanted to see Denzel play a character that would 'kick puppies and step on kittens' for a change. This movie takes what he brought to Fallen and puts it on steroids.Washington is Alonzo Harris, a corrupt cop. A man who believes he's part of the big time but, in reality, he's just a small-time criminal hiding behind his LAPD badge. As a member of a covert narcotics squad, he gets to cruise the streets of LA looking for his next big bust. He may have originally been a fresh-faced rookie with an idealistic streak and a notion that justice involved returning the streets to the community, but his thirteen-year tour of duty in the narc unit have left him jaded, disillusioned, and willing to do whatever it takes. Throw young Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) into the mix. Hoyt is that self-same fresh-faced rookie with an idealistic streak, a young wife, and a nine-month-old daughter. He's looking to make detective, and wants nothing more than to be able to provide for his family and take down the questionable elements of society that run rampant in downtown LA. Alonzo, however, has totally different ideas about Jake's future.Alonzo seems to have surrounded himself with a plethora of fools, and it's implied during the film that he's done it so that he can keep control. Because as long as Alonzo has control of the men in his unit, has control of the streets--which he rules with an iron fist--he has control of his life. As he gets to know Jake, however, he can see that there's something different about him...that he's not going to be just another follower. Jake has one single day to prove to Alonzo that he can cut it as a narc. Failure means he goes back to 'cutting traffic tickets' and maybe never gets his coveted job as detective. MINI-SPOILER However, an incident in Las Vegas with some nebulously defined and never-seen Russians suddenly has Alonzo in over his head. He has to provide a million dollars by midnight or his life is forfeit. His upper-echelon contacts (the semi-satirical 'Wise Men') are worried that he's not going to be able to find the money, and then they'll lose their man on the street, the guy who can be relied upon to get things done when the system can't. But Alonzo has a plan, and that plan centres around Jake. END MINI-SPOILERWashington turns in an incredibly driven and fiercely charismatic performance as Alonzo. Hawke, as his counterpoint, plays his role in a perfectly understated fashion, which only adds to Washington's impact in the film. Washington's character *needs* to be compared to a bland background, just so you can appreciate exactly what it is that's going on.But when the film comes to its resolution, we're still left with the question unanswered. Which view is the right one? Does Jake's initial idealism have a place in the warzone--the drug-fuelled hotbed of intolerance and violence that is 'the office' for these covert narcs? Or is Alonzo's brutal and almost fanatical version of justice the only way to catch--and kill--the wolves prowling around the edges of the flock?It's also refreshing to see a movie on this subject-matter that doesn't have a 'message'. Training Day simply explores the issues and puts them on the table, and whilst some people may believe it falls down on one side more than the other, I prefer to see it as giving the audience the option to make their own decision. The real stinger though, is that despite his unorthodox methods, his disregard for due process, and his uncompromising, severe attitude, Alonzo shares the same ideals as Jake. Both of them want to eliminate the scum of the streets. However, whereas Jake wants to create his perfect Aryan-esque world where it's safe for a fourteen-year-old to walk through the worst parts of town in the dead of night, Alonzo is much more interested in landing the biggest of fish--whatever the cost. Pros: Superb acting from Washington and a fine counterpoint by Hawke. A fast-paced character- and event-driven drama that assaults the senses and leaves you reeling from its mental impact. Cons: The last ten/fifteen minutes or so may leave some unsatisfied.Likely Oscar nominations: Well, I'm going to forego my usual comical comment here. Seriously, Denzel should get _something_ for his performance in this movie. It's just a pity this is the sort of movie the Academy usually overlooks. Verdict: A tour-de-force led by Washington that proves that violence and intelligence don't necessarily have to be mutually exclusive in a modern movie. Go see if if you liked Fallen, or want to see what Denzel can really do when he turns on the afterburner. Plus the ins and outs of this movie can easily lead to lengthy discussions over coffee afterwards.9 out of 10.</fullReview>

Just when you think this movie cant get any better, here comes another surprise. I was captivated throughout the whole movie, as was the audience around me, no one even left the theater during the movie. This is a definite MUST SEE.</fullReview>

Ethan Hawke really holds his own too. He masterfully displays the development of his rookie character. Disillusionment sucks!

		<shortDescription>Overlong and uneven, but very well-acted and often engaging</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At times, "Training Day" seems like a photographed play. Most of the scenes during the first and second acts take place within the confines of a patrol car, with Denzel and Hawke having their foul-mouthed interactions. To be honest, I felt some of those scenes could've been trimmed or cut and didn't seem necessary. The overuse of dialogue scenes dragged down the pace a little. So you can say, the film could've used more time in the editing room. The performances are stellar. Denzel is one of my favorite actors, and it was nice to watch him play a character much different from the upperclassmen he usually plays. This time around, he's an uninhibited, foul-mouthed, sadistic, no-nonsense narcotics cop. Like always, I was impressed by Denzel, but I was even more impressed by his co-star Ethan Hawke. Technically, the film focuses on him, but since Denzel is a much bigger star--he has to get first billing. Sorry, Ethan. Hawke, though a fine actor, usually gets the role of the pretty-boy love interest. This is a much, much different role for him. He plays a quiet, well-intentioned married man who gets called in for training (as a narc) by Denzel. The two guys couldn't be any more different, like all buddy cop movies. But unlike most buddy cop movies, this is much darker. There's humor here and there, but dark humor. None of that Riggs-Murtaugh chemistry we got used to in the "Lethal Weapon" movies. I have to admire Antoine Fuqua for not making the usual casting choices. Another example of his original casting is Scott Glenn's role as a burned-out dealer, who Denzel befriends. Of course, since Fuqua has a history directing music videos, we have supporting roles with such artists as Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and Macy Gray. Not the greatest actors, but they didn't have enough screen time to ruin the film. The climax is adverse to the film's harsh, realistic tone. We're basically given the Hollywood treatment. We have the usual dueling between the antagonist and protagonist, in which they beat each other to a bloody pulp. One of them gets away, the other returns--as a bloody mess--and they fight again. I don't want to give away the ending, though there's no big surprises, but if an alleged tough guy is in the middle of a ghetto, gangbangers and dealers surrounding and outnumbering him, and starts telling them off--it don't matter if you're a policeman or not; those guys would blow you away in the drop of a hat. That's when Denzel makes his "King Kong ain't got s**t on me!" speech, in which you're sitting in the theater trying to stop yourself from laughing. And you know damn well those gangbangers and dealers would've laughed at him too--before he's brutally killed. It's noticeable that the writer of this film tried to be realistic by injecting tons of street slang into the script, but some of the slang sounded more laughable (unintentionally) and preposterous than realistic. Believe me, I live in an environment where I hear more street slang than I need to hear. I know the difference between real and fake slang. "Training Day" is an overlong film that gets boring at times, but I found it mostly engaging. The performances alone are worth watching. By the way, that hot mamacita Eva Mendes plays Denzel's wife in the film. And she has a brief nude scene. Oh, man! Is she hottt!My score: 7 (out of 10)</fullReview>

Not a traditional American cop movie , as there was no clear distinction between bad guys and good guys and as there usually is a very clear one I thought Training Day was quite radical for the USA , as it portrayed a mix of bad/good guys doing bad and good , so who was the good guy ?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Denzel Washington has given us a different look at his acting capabilities.The majority of his films give us a decent man,who stands for right,and goes the distance in proving this.This time Denzel shows he can make us believe he is as rotten,cruel,and selfish as they come.And I believe in his character as Alonzo Harris,as crooked a policeman most anyone would ever care to know.He portrays this wicked officer to the hilt.A cop who cares very little about the well being of his kid and the mother of his child,or needless to say his sworn oath to preserve and protect as a civil servant of the police force.Before this movie,if anyone would have told me I would someday be watching one of his films where I would feel his death was justified,I would have thought they were crazy.This can only speak for the outstanding performance he has delivered in this motion picture.So much of what we see of him this time only proves he is indeed a great actor.A great actor,who has been slighted a time or two at the Oscars.Others might not agree with me,but I feel he was overlooked for his fine performance in "The Crimson Tide".Denzel should have at least been a nominee that year,in my opinion.If he doesn't receive best actor for this one this time,I feel like Julia Roberts,but I'll take it a bit further.The academy should discontinue giving out yearly awards,especially when excellent actors like Denzel are far too often loosing out to others who gave lesser performances.I believe if he looses this time,not just myself but a great deal of movie fans will be taken back to the 80's when Steven Spielberg's "The Color Purple" walked away empty handed,after capturing 11 nominations that year,and received not even one.Truly unjust.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie can be summarised by: bad cop, good cop, violence. There is nothing more, nothing deeper, nothing exciting, nothing new. It is not the first movie about bad cops doing bad things and getting punished. It's not the first movie about black &amp; white cops either. Let's hope it will be the last.There is nothing to say about the acting. Both Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke are playing very well, but the movie never really kicks off and the end is predictable. The movie compensates its poor scenario by a wave of violence and insults. If the US are really like that then it is difficult to understand why anybody would like to immigrate over there. What comes out of the movie is not so much the fact that the nice cop wins but more how poor and miserable the US are. Indeed, not only is the movie showing drugs, violence, alcohol, etc. but it also reveals that 99.9% of Americans are only interested in money. I guess the 'happy end' part shows that there is 0.1% that are above corruption and bribery.A dead boring violent movie that is best to avoid unless you are into this kind of low level scenario.</fullReview>

His devoted performance as the supertough "gangsta-cop" Alonzo Harris was absolutely terrific. If you ask me, Ethan Hawke should have won the Oscar for the best actor in a supporting role because he was quite awesome too - simply an excellent choice for the part of a young freshman. Film itself is, well, let's say an unique "buddy movie". I thought Antoine Fuqua's "The Replacement killers" starring Chow-Yun Fat (one of my favorite actors) was marvelous too but this one is much, much better. Fast-paced, stylish, violent and downright irresistible ride and an ultimate cop flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A mezmorizing performance from Denzel Washington as a corrupt street cop who likes to enforce street justice is alone enough to get this movie five stars. Ethan Hawke is also very good as a rookie cop who is sent out on a day on the streets with Washington, but Hawke being the good cop that he is doesn't like what he sees and gets himself even deeper than he can handel. The film suffers from a weak final act that transforms a gritty and almost brillent crime drama to a cliched action film that sets Washington up as the bad guy which he really isn't but due to the near perfect acting it isn't really a big deal. The violence is brutal in nature and graphic in content but only adds to the raw power that this movie delivers. Not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting exploration</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching all the special features on the DVD, I gained a better appreciation for this film. Both the director and the writer are "graduates" of project areas in the USA (Director: Pittsburgh, Writer: LA). The cast and crew spent a lot of time researching both the gang situation in east-central LA and the lives of undercover narcs. The film was pre-screened to gang members and the police to ensure its authenticity. This is a gritty, not pretty film. It has not been hollywoodized to appeal to the masses. It doesn't have a happy ending, the good guys don't always win...much like real life. The movie projects a definite shade of gray, so please don't look for black hats and white hats. For Ethan Hawke's character, it is his journey into the Heart of Darkness, with Denzel Washington, as his Kurtz.For those who complain that Denzel Washington won the Academy Award for best Actor; perhaps you should ask yourselves why he was not nominated for Malcolm X, and why he failed to win for The Hurricane. You may find a answer to that question, if you choose to view Training Day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Denzel deserved the Oscar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've heard many complaints about Denzel Wahsington not deserving the Oscar, and quite frankly I'm sick of it. Denzel Washington gives a solid performance in his role as Alonzo Harris. Most viewers aren't used to seeing him in bad guy roles where he's the one everyone's rooting against. He pulls off the performance amazingly, and when I watched the film I was just shocked.Not only was Denzel's performance great Ethan Hawke's character Officer Hoyt was also well written. Ethan and Denzel had a kind of chemistry during the shooting of the film that was just excellent. (especially the sheep and the wolves speech) Training day is just a great film, which tells the uncensored story of a officer trying to learn the ropes of his job. The movie falls into the three act structure perfectly. That's pretty cool sense the movie takes place in a single day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm amazed to see so many comments here, based purely on moral opinions and disliking of street language. Maybe those commentators should ask themselves why they see a movie? Just to hear words that no one in the real world is speaking? First look at the performances, which are great, not only by Denzel, but by Ethan Hawke too. Movies are not made to be judged morally, they should be judged on their artistic qualities. And the films' qualities are evident: good acting, unexpected plot turns and impressive camera-work, half the movie being filmed from inside the black Monte Carlo. It bears thriller and action components, which are both believable and do not stand in the way. It's enough to convince me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Police officer goes bad -</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are a cynic and desperately need to find a movie that will confirm your cynicism, then this is the movie for you. This movie offers a frank and graphic portrayal of a corrupt police officer. The police officer in question, played magnificently by Denzel Washington, is both a terrifying and pathetic character because he is a man who projects a facade of strength which is a caricature of the social misfits who abound in his universe. For the Denzel Washington character, rules of ethical conduct are utterly meaningless and are to be ridiculed and ignored. The problem with this movie is that it glorifies the corrupt cop who is portrayed as being tough and all-knowing when in fact his thinking and perceptions are completely distorted. Accordingly, his behavior becomes maladaptive and can lead only to disaster. As a result, he is ruined, both as a police officer and a man. Sad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moody cop drama more about streets than drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow. That was the feeling at the end of watching this film. I was greatly pleased after seeing it. It was a very easy movie to watch; the dialog went smooth and fast, the clips of gangsta rap and mood of the music was spot-on, and the acting was as bombastic as the characters were written. Also the directing by Antoine Fuqua (Replacement Killers, Tears of the sun...after Training Day) couldn't have been more brilliant and full of visual changes for the audience.Basically, Ethan Hawke plays a new NARC on the beat. He doesn't know what to expect out of Denzel Washington's character except that he is his trainer and an experienced detective. Denzel meticulously plans his real-life curriculum for Hawke to learn, and since Denzel's character is known in the surrounding neighborhoods as a detective who cuts deals with potential rapists, murderers, and drug dealers, he pushes buttons all throughout the neighborhood, brandishing Hawke as his protegé. When Hawke continues to see shady deal after shady deal, he begins to suspect that Washington is up to something but cannot place what it is. It comes down to the end when Hawke must choose what he was taught in the ethics training of the other policemen or what Denzel's character allows him to get away with on the street.There is not enough praise to give the actors and actresses, including Eva Mendes as Washington's girlfriend stuck in the ghetto with her son. I'm not particularly fond of Ethan Hawke in the action roles (to me, he looks kind of fake and unbelievable), but in this movie, there seems to be plenty going on to forget this small mirage. And Denzel was spectacular; he had this character down pact. He loves playing the same types of roles, but this one was almost written for him because of the delivery and positioning that he displays every time the camera is on him.The Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre appearances didn't need to be there, but there's no doubt about the power of being the director's friends. Snoop was better than Dre, I think, mainly because he was given more of a character to portray (while placed in a wheelchair of all things for the most notable cool-cat in rapping business). But other than their puzzling cameos, the movie does great to entertain and keep you guessing every bit of the way.I gave it a 7/10 because it doesn't have the look about a classic film and to constantly watch it, it would get tedious, but the feel and look of the whole thing keeps you entertained for a few watches. It's worth the buy, but rent it first to get a deeper story to see if it's your type of action/cop drama movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well written and well performed urban cop thriller - 79%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Patiently waiting for a chance to hit the sales, I head off to look for a decent pair of shoes for work. And with what do I come back with? A poster full of humorous quotes by George W Bush, a Nina Simone CD and "Training Day" on DVD. Well, it was only ?5 and you can't argue with that. Although I barely remember it being released, everyone remembers it as proving Denzel Washington's finest hour by awarding him with the Best Actor Oscar. And for not blubbing as much as Halle Berry."Training Day" sees young cop Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) assigned to Narcotics, partnering veteran cop Alonzo Harris (Washington) on his first day. As he tries to improve Hoyt's "street IQ", Alonzo appears to push the boundaries of what is acceptable policing to their absolute limits, forcing Hoyt to question both his own motives and those of his superior. The film is all about asking yourself one question: how far would you go in order to do the right thing? And without trying to sound righteous, this is a question I have been asking of myself lately. As a bartender, I'm constantly being asked by those I work with for a free drink or two. Do I do the right thing and refuse or capitulate and go with the flow? It is this theme of morality that lifts "Training Day" beyond the mire of most cop movies. The other huge bonus is the performance of the two leads - both Washington and Hawke are brilliant, utterly compelling and believable in their respective roles. However, I think that the Oscar went to Washington for two reasons. One: he is playing totally against type. Washington isn't known for playing characters with a prominent dark side, let's be honest. Two: Russell Crowe didn't deserve a second Oscar after "Gladiator". Hawke, I feel, was probably a little peeved at not getting as much recognition as this is easily the best film I've seen him in. But Washington is at his scene-stealing best, especially towards the end. Most other actors only appear for short periods of time (Dr Dre, Macy Gray, Snoop Dogg, etc) and don't really contribute that much.Unlike most other cop movies, "Training Day" feels a much more realistic picture than others in its stable. LA isn't the playground of the rich and famous that we expect in the movies - it's a scorching hot-bed of drugs, gang violence and simmering racial tension. And it looks great. This is a wonderfully shot film, drawing you into it's shady suburbs. For the first time in years, Los Angeles looks and feels like a real city and not just a main street full of skyscrapers. For all it's accuracy, I confess that some of the "hood" dialogue lost me (I'm a pasty white boy, can't help it!) and this marred the ending slightly, which did feel slightly contrived and hurried to fit the time frame. What it did do was leave me wanting more and I haven't seen a film in a while that left me like that."Training Day" is a dark and gritty portrayal of how cops really work in America today. It's engrossing and enjoyable, despite the sheer amount of screen time that Hawke and Washington share together. But on this form, who cares? Some may feel let down that it isn't the rocket-busting smash-mouth ride they were expecting but I feel it's better because of it. My advice is not to have too many preconceived ideas and just enjoy the film. Washington and Hawke both give career performances in a film that seems too small for the both of them. Still, if you're buying the DVD for only ?5 then you don't really have grounds to complain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great acting for a horrible plot and script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Some spoilers here)I thought that the plot of this movie was just horrible. The movie was somewhat complex, but we don't ever see Alonzo's motives or anything like that until Jake meets Smiley and his crew. Before, it's just like hey, let's go here and beat this rapist, then this druggie, etc. This movie is the type of film that I would typically abhor to see because the script in my opinion was too redundant at times.If anything saved this film, it was the casting. Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke gave the best possible performances in this otherwise crappy film. They fit their characters' roles perfectly and you can see it in their eyes. I am wondering why Ethan Hawke wasn't nominated for Best Actor along with Denzel Washington, instead of Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars as I think Hoyt is also a main character. Nevertheless, this acting duo is what has made a film with a horrible script viewable, because Training Day is the worst script with the best possible actors. This is definitely shown because Training Day had two Oscar nominations, for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor, and nothing else. Denzel Washington of course won the movie's only Oscar, but I don't know if this was his best performance ever. Nevertheless, Washington deserved the Oscar in 2001, and he is finally recognized as one of THE premier actors in Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Training Day Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'One of the best thrillers from Hollywood in many a year'. A comment from the Daily Express which is stated on the back of the Training Day DVD box. This comment is not far from the truth. This 2001 thriller directed by Antoine Fuqua and staring Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke, provides a fast paced, action packed, twist occurring experience. Jack Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) is a (white) rookie LA cop who is on his first day of training to become a narcotics officer. He is teemed up with veteran detective Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington) whose task is to put Jack through tests which will either make or break him. Jack begins to get suspicious about Alonzo's attitude towards crime and it soon becomes clear that Alonzo is in fact a rogue cop. Once jack is confident that this in fact, is the case, he goes about standing up to Alonzo and tries to counter his misdealing. Washington pulls off the dodgy underground cop brilliantly so much so that he was awarded an academy award for best actor in 2001. His acting in a way has the same effect on the audience as it does on Jack, you can't help trusting him when you really know you shouldn't. His performance really does suck the audience in. Hawke plays the na?ve rookie white boy cop in a way that compliments with Washington. You cant help but feel sorry for Jake who has been put in the middle of this street gang warfare. The totally different styles and attitudes of the two characters help to create a good versus evil tone to the film. On more than a few occasions, we are treated to fast moving scenes of gunfire and general violence which helps push the story along with great ease. There is never really a dull moment in the film and the gradual increase of suspense helps keep audience attention. In my opinion this would have to be one of the best films I have seen. The fact that Washington's character is so unpredictable, means that you are always trying to suss him out, which then has the effect of holding your attention and almost includes you in the storyline. The plot is not straight forward either. We are treated to a twist in the story which makes us re-evaluate the film. It makes you want to watch the film again so as to fully understand the story. I think that any film that makes the viewer want to see it again is a success in its own right. If you are wanting a straight forward, easy watching film, then Training Day is not for you. If however, you want a fast paced, twisting action movie, this is a must watch. Another Quote taken from the DVD box sums this film up: Training Day is a gritty, tough and realistic cop thriller, which will have you gripped from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is this really the way things are? Does it have to be like this? These were some of the questions that I asked myself as Alonzo (played by Denzel Washington) explained his brutally harsh behavior to his young drug-unit recruit, Hoyt (played by Ethan Hawke). What a wonderful performance by Mr. Washington. He has been truly intense in many other movies but I personally feel that he stepped it up a notch while playing this character. I thoroughly believed that Denzel was Alonzo. This feat, not to be confused with great storyline, developement of characters, and other movie characteristics, is not acheived by all actors. Robert Dinero, Al Pacino, and a few of the other great actors have at least displayed this skill once or twice in their careers. If you can understand the difference between overly-hyped Tom Cruise and the actors that I have listed, then we see eye to eye. The intensity with which Denzel delivered his lines in this movie makes it a must see for any inspiring actor that wants to one day be a leading man. As Ethan Hawke stated on David Letterman, Denzel Washington is one of the best leading men in Hollywood, and I personally concur. Highly recommended for serious crime-drama fans. Watch language for young children though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing performances, great action, good film, but it should have been better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a few actors in Hollywood that create a huge stir of interest and gossip anytime they come out with a new film. Tom Hanks is probably the biggest of these actors, but this group also includes tremendously talented actors like Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Cruise, Harrison Ford, and of course, Denzel Washington. All of this almost automatic hype is not, however, entirely accurate at all times, and Training Day is a prime example of this. Now before you click on my name above so you can send me some hate mail, I should just point out that I am not pretending that Training Day is a bad movie, I am just saying that there are a lot of things in it that should have been done differently or not at all. Denzel Washington plays the part of the scary Detective Alonzo Harris, and Ethan Hawke plays Officer Jake Hoyt, a new white officer on the force who is to learn the ways of being a tough cop from Harris. The most powerful part of the film is, of course, Denzel's performance as the hardened narcotics officer in Los Angeles, and the interaction that he has with the inexperienced Hoyt, who really only wants to get a nice promotion so he can provide a better life for his wife and kid. Harris has a way of doing his job that really makes it interesting, he's not just a guy running around arresting guys who sell drugs or are doing drugs, he plays his job almost like a chess game.One of the more surprising examples of this is the way that he forces Hoyt to smoke PCP laced marijuana as one of his first lessons, explaining to the incredulous Hoyt that if he were to turn down a similar gift out on the streets, he's be dead. No further explanation is given, and none is needed. Harris knows that he has to be intimidating on the streets or he'll get killed, and he knows that he has to be as familiar as humanly possible with the very thing that he's trying to stop. These people are his people, but he's on the other side of the law.There is an interesting way that the movie explores the possibility that many of that civil laws that police officers must follow only hinder the true delivery of justice and their efforts to stop crime, because Harris is an officer that pursues the bad guys in any way necessary, whether legally or not, and he looks much deeper into the situations than just getting the guys in cuffs in the back of his car. The scene where they see the two guys trying to rape a woman on the streets comes to mind. Hoyt is ready to throw these guys in the car, take them downtown, and throw them in jail, case closed. They witnessed the crime, it was that easy. Instead, Harris beats them both stupid and lets them go right in front of the astonished eyes of Hoyt, inspiring the famous line, `Let the animals weed themselves out.' God willing.The real problem that I have with this movie is that, for one thing, it is entirely too violent in places where it doesn't need to be. One of the things that I hate to hear the most in a review of an action movie is that it's too violent, just because it sounds so much like something my grandmother would say, but take, for example, the scene where Harris and Hoyt are fighting each other hand to hand. This scene is excruciatingly violent, but the only problem that I have with it is that it should have been maybe a third of the length that it was. MAYBE. I am a serious fan of good bloody, violent movies, I even enjoy Steven Seagal films and Van Damme films, but even in the most hardcore action films and for the most die hard action fan, there comes a point where you think, `Okay, I GET it.' Training Day either does not believe that this point exists, or doesn't know where it is. Besides that, I know that this is an aberrant role for Denzel Washington, who does not very often play villains, but even as the character that he played in Training Day, there are certain things that you simply can't do to an actor like him, and gunning him down Godfather-style by a whole row of machine guns is one of them. No matter how bad the guy is that he's portraying, you just can't do things like that to him, the man's LOVED! I am not usually one to complaing about issues of violence like this, but there is a place in the movies for excessive violence, and it is in Van Damme films and Seagal films, not in movies like this. Training Day had entirely too many real world connections to be dumbed down be excesses like that, and if these things had been reduced to a more realistic level at least slightly, the quality of the film would have increased enormously. Just a little change could have done a lot of good.</fullReview>

And such a dramatic finish: right out of the WWE school of drama, that is. I have enjoyed Denzel Washington every time I have seen him, but they gave him an award for this? His entire range of emotion was nothing more than arrogance, how hard can that be? Writing about it just reminds me of it, so I think I'll relieve myself of further tedium.

He's satisfied to let gang members kill each other off rather than fool with paper work. But, DW pushed EH too far, and EH decides he won't let DW get away with it. After he gets away from the tense bathtub scene, he decided to deal with DW who ditched him at a gang house.The final shoot out/fight between DW and EH is well done. DW does a great job as he tries to explain he's still top dog and still does not back down even when the other gang members won't bail him out.FINAL VERDICT: Very good bad cop/good cop flick with great acting and tense scenes.

		<fullReview>The story is a bit far-fetched (seems to me that an awful lot happens in just one day - police life really is exciting!) but this movie is worth watching even if it's only to see Denzel Washington put on an unforgettable performance. Washington is, in my opinion, one of the finest actors in Hollywood today. This may not be his best performance ("Glory" and "Philadelphia" come to mind) but it's unforgettable because it shows his versatility. Washington generally plays "good guy" roles; here he's the corrupt LAPD narcotics officer Alonzo Harris, who recruits Officer Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) to his squad only to set him up in a scheme he has to pay back Russian mobsters to whom he owes money.Washington's Harris comes across as believably ruthless ("the devil incarnate" my wife called him at one point.) Harris and Hawke made a great team. They seemed to have a chemistry and I hope they work together again. The movie is chock full of action and you definitely will not be bored. It contains a lot of language, but surprisingly little nudity or sexual content, focusing instead on the story itself.Watch this. You will definitely enjoy it. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a Denzel Washington fan. But I was disappointed by Training Day. Maybe I waited too long to see it, and had heard too much hype. But not once during the viewing did I forget that I was watching Denzel. He didn't disappear into his character. It was Denzel being gritty, Denzel cursing, Denzel being corrupt.Ethan Hawke on the other hand was amazing. He looked and acted like a young recruit. His acting registered every emotion the script called for.Good film, but the wrong star got the Oscar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Earnest And Misguided</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Denzel Washington plays against type effectively--he's evil--but in the end this is just another in Warner Brothers' long-standing tradition of earnest socially conscious dramas; the problem is that rather than addressing social ills, it just ends up patronizing its target audience, namely urban minority moviegoers, by delivering the notion, through a series of absurd coincidences, that street justice is more effective than law enforcement. Washington is relaxed and entertaining as a corrupt undercover cop who shows his new partner (Ethan Hawke, way out of his league) the ropes in south central L.A. but he plays into the conceits set up by screenwriter David Ayer (he wrote the slick `The Fast And The Furious') and in the end Washington's in cahoots with the film's stodgy finger-wagging, becoming little more than a stick figure. The director is the talented Antoine Fuqua (`The Replacement Killers') but this time he's reined in his talent for flashy color-driven visuals for the usual cloudy, bleached-out images we've come to expect when the subject is down-and-dirty L.A. Special note should be made of the cameo of singer/songwriter Macy Gray: she makes the most of her brief appearance, using unsteady hand movements and a fair amount of sass to create a vivid portrayal of a woman who knows she's being used by the police and who has no compunction about letting her feelings show--she has the best moment in the film and you end up wanting more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another by-the-numbers action thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>TRAINING DAY (2001) Rating: 5/10Here's a movie about cops, about the streets, about justice... Actually, to me it felt like it was really about one thing: scary black guys. Make that two things, there's scary Latinos too. Oh, and rich old white drug dealers, crooked cops and Russian gangsters. Mix it all up and you've got the crazy world of TRAINING DAY. You know, maybe I'm out of touch, but are things that bad? I can accept that South Central, LA is a mean old place, at least from watching movies like BOYZ N THE HOOD or MENACE II SOCIETY. But here, it's not just any hooligan messing around, it's the police!The movie has us following rookie cop Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) on, that's right, a training day with Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington), an undercover narcotics detective. Right off the bat, we can see that Alonzo is quite a character, a real live wire, volatile, aggressive and cocky as hell. But he's charismatic, too, and after all he's a decorated police officer, so Jake goes along with Alonzo's scary antics. Talking tough, beating people on the street, stealing drugs and money off thugs, drinking and driving... We're the police, we can do anything, right? Er, I'm not too sure, but I think we're supposed to accept Alonzo's behavior, for a while at least. It's the classic cop-who-plays-by-his-own-rules riff. If you need to cross the line to make a case stick, what's the harm?Personally, I was never able to buy the premise. Shouldn't Jake or any of the petty criminals who get manhandled by Alonzo object and report him? I don't doubt that some cops are dirty, that there is corruption in the justice system, but this is too much! And even if you don't question the plausibility, the movie just ain't that interesting. Stuff happens, than more stuff, with not much of a narrative throughout. Not even halfway into the movie I started growing impatient, wondering if all this nonsense would ever pay off. Short answer: nope. Just more scary Blacks and Latinos standing around looking scary.I guess one could suggest that what holds the film together is the character development. Could have been, except that Denzel Washington's Alonzo is pretty much the same throughout the movie, except that in the third act he loses what little complexity, is-he-good-or-bad? ambiguity he had to settle into B-movie villainy. As for Ethan Hawke, his Jake doesn't have much of a character arc either: "Dude, that dude's crazy! Wait, maybe not... Oh yeah, he's crazy!" pretty much sums it up. Likewise, the film never offers much insight: Alonzo's evil, but he thinks he's just getting the job done... But he's evil still, eh? Cue up the shoot-outs, crashed cars and mano a mano action!Basically, try as it might, TRAINING DAY never rises above being yet another by-the-numbers action thriller. Director Antoine Fuqua keeps things slick and sharp, and the cast is solid (though nominating Hawke and Washington for Oscars and Washington actually winning is pushing it), but unless you really wanna see Denzel doing his scary bad-guy thing, I can't quite recommend the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Washington and Hawke are great, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Can they save "Training Day"? Not quite."Training Day" definitely wants to be remembered as an in-your-face, gritty police drama. That it is, except it reaches the level of being so over-the-top that it becomes ludicrous. This particularly rings true for the ending, easily one of the worst of recent memory. I will not give it away, but it really had me scratching my head. The alternative ending on the DVD does not fare better.Denzel Washington is a show-stopper for the entire film, giving his most over-the-top performance to date (it may even beat out "John Q"). He is obviously having fun, which is what I liked. Hawke is excellent in a difficult role. He has the perfect tone for the most uncomfortable scenes, but can still show authority.Hothead Antoine Fuqua ("The Replacement Killers") directs with confidence here, and he had excellent production values to work with.In the end, Washington was worthy of the Oscar (although I still feel Tom Wilkenson from "In The Bedroom" should have taken home the statue), Hawke was questionable as Best Supporting Actor, and a string of unlikely and unbelievable events ran this movie into the ground at about the 90 minute mark.RATING: B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Denzel Washington's Oscar-Winning Turn Saves the Day Here.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Training Day" is an intense cop flick that tries to show the mean streets of Los Angeles through the eyes of a young cadet wanting to be a detective (Ethan Hawke in a well-deserved Oscar-nominated performance). Of all the cops to have a day with, Hawke gets to ride with the fiery and out-of-control Denzel Washington (in an electric Oscar-winning turn). Washington is a rogue cop who runs everything everywhere he goes. However, Washington has a hidden secret that could cost him his life by the end of the day. The film could best be described as "The Los Angeles Connection" (ala "The French Connection" 30 years ago) and Denzel Washington makes Popeye Doyle (Gene Hackman in "The French Connection") look like an eagle scout. Washington dominates the action and is the much-needed "fire" in "Training Day". On the opposite side of the coin is the equally riveting Ethan Hawke who acts as the "ice" to counter-act Washington's heat. Hawke is trapped in a situation where he sees all, but what can he really do about what is happening around him? Overall the film is a near-miss and really should have been a pure mess. Denzel Washington finally got a role where he could do what he wanted and more than anything "Training Day" is just an exhibition for Washington's out-of-this-world talents. With that said this is not Washington's greatest performance (I am partial to "The Hurricane" myself). Washington has made himself great by playing somewhat quiet and sympathetic characters and this role is the exact polar opposite of that. Ethan Hawke is super and this film truly put him into a higher class of actors. The research of this film is pretty impressive as the film-makers shot in real rough neighborhoods in Los Angeles and many real-life gang-bangers and thugs are prevalent throughout the film. Cameos by musical superstars Macy Gray, Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg are really some of the strongest scenes as all three do fine jobs in limited screen-time. Too many coincidences, a somewhat ridiculous confrontation between Washington and Hawke near the end and Washington's side-story are the main things I found a bit out-there. But in the end the film served its purpose: getting Washington the Best Actor Oscar. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great performances in an average, formula blaxploitation film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 20 years we will look back at this in the same way we look back at movies like Cleopatra Jones, Friday Foster, Foxy Brown, etc... and will take it for what it is: a cheap portrayal of minorities with the basic message that "those drug sellin', gun carryin' blacks and latinos are just gonna kill each other," except for the occasional hero who really wants to "change the way things are." Formula, formula, formula! (At least in most blaxploitation movies, the hero gets to be black!)Fantastic performances and a high budget help it to stand above other films in the genre. Now, I really enjoy Pam Grier movies, Dolemite, Cleopatra Jones, Shaft, and so on. I can watch those and have a great time. I also enjoyed Training Day, but let's be real about what kind of film this is. At its core, it is blaxploitation.*** POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD ***Stock characters fill the script: a lone hero who is pure of heart and wants to clean things up, a collection of bad guys with one really bad guy who leads them that's in it for the money, and ultimately "whitey" is in control (the nice, older white gentlemen Alonzo meets in the club.) Unimaginative dialog is characteristic of the genre and that detail wasn't overlooked here. (How many times can you say "dawg" and "ni**er" without it being repetitive?)Worth seeing for an entertaining time, but not high art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trite ending mars a film with an interesting theme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Films about police corruption are commonplace, but it's interesting to watch a film where the police become corrupted as a result of fighting an unwinnable war on the streets (a war that is unwinnable as seen in 'Traffic'), resorting to crooked methods/heavy handed tactics in their war against drugs. I enjoyed the interplay between Alonzo (Washington) and Hoyt (Hawke), their obvious clash of ideals/brutal cynicism and the early scenes are probably the strongest in the film. Hoyt's druggy trip almost reflects the murky, blurred world that he now finds himself inhabiting. The film has two main plotlines (police corruption, &amp; the Russian mafia seeking vengeance) which eventually come together but I feel this is where the film loses its hold on reality and descends into farce and implausibilty. If only the film perhaps had concentrated on the theme of police corruption, the possible consequences etc. The scenes &amp; dialogue where Alonzo &amp; Hoyt argue their feelings (wolves &amp; sheep) are excellent. On the one hand, we can sympathise somewhat with Alonzo - the ugly war against drugs is stacked in favour of the criminals - yet most of us would probably identify with Hoyt's opinion. It's a morally grey area which should have been examined more.Because the film sadly descends into a simplistic confrontation between good &amp; evil. It is very easy to criticise but I'd preferred a story that made Alonzo examine himself &amp; question what he has become. Instead he becomes a pantomine villain - boo, hiss, he's behind you!The performances were good esp in the beginning where the actors were given the opportunity 'to act' rather than wrestle with each other. Washington is charismatic - I loved his opening gambit where,impatient with Hoyt's talking as he reads his paper, he orders him to 'entertain' him. Some critics have accused Washington of 'hamming' in this role, but I thought he was good as the police officer corrupted by his sense of power. His role, away from his usual type cast, is reminiscent of Richard Gere's impressive turn as a corrupt policeman in 'Internal Affairs' - a film which is much more psychological and the better for it.An interesting premise, but the final twenty minutes disappoint and let's the whole film down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>[Contains what some might consider SPOILERS!]Training Day is a pretty standard cop movie. Corrupt cops isn't exactly a new theme in modern cinema. It is, however, quite interesting to see Hawke's character struggle with what he sees Washington's character do.The fact that we only get to follow Jake and Alonzo for a day is both the movie's strength and its weakness. The strenght is that the pace is quick and the movie is never boring. The weakness is that it seems a bit over the top for all those things to happen in less than 24 hours.Since Denzel Washington is in the film the acting is of course brilliant. Ethan Hawke also does a great job.Overall, Training Day is entertaining and never boring. A good film: nothing more, nothing less. (6/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, Training Day should have been rated NC-17. I was not prepared for the violence, language or subject matter of this movie. That said, this movie blew me away. If there was ever any question of Denzel's acting ability, the question is now definitely answered. Denzel was simply brilliant in this role.Training Day is about a young cop who wants to join an elite drug-fighting task force in the worst way. But before he joins he has to prove himself to the task force leader, Denzel. Unfortunately, Denzel has been is the drug war for too long, and has gotten himself into some trouble. Denzel then uses the young cop to help get him out of trouble.Honestly, the plot is not what impressed me with this film. In fact, I found the plot to be disturbing. But, Washington's performance was the best I've seen in a cop film in many, many years. So, while I can't recommend the film due to its hardcore content, I must admit that Denzel delivers in a big way. He is truly one of the elite actors in movies today.</fullReview>

He has a great eye for film when it comes to directing and even his music videos are entertaining.This film caught me off guard. As I'm sure many other people than I have felt going to see it, I thought it would be horrible. When the first 10 minutes or so went by, I could tell it would AT LEAST be entertaining. When the story began to unfold, I was actually into the movie.The character development in this movie is great. Denzel Washington played a great anti-hero and I would not be surprised if he won some awards for his performance. Ethan Hawke also played an immensely convincing role.The director, perhaps, was the best part of the movie. Fuqua has a magnificent eye for setting up scenes.

This film goes beyond painting the picture of a bad day as an undercover cop; it draws you into a world that is both frightening and intriguing. Denzel is perfectly cast. He does not just make this role better, he makes it possible. The fact that most of us can not conceive of disliking Denzel Washington is precisely what makes Alonzo Harris ( his character ) compelling. The evil of this crooked "wolf" is so plausibly wrapped in charm and humanity, that the decision to dislike him is painful. Denzel causes us to empathize with Hoyt's ( Ethan Hawke's ) gut wrenching dilemma - the audience is forced into the same, brutal indecision. Hawke skillfully plays his part, and is totally believable. I could identify with his character in every hesitation, and each surrender. All in all, a brilliant film. Not for the faint of heart, but not to be missed.</fullReview>

Denzel Washington gives an amazing performance as a rogue cop who tries to recruit another. For a second, think back to Washington's Oscar-winning performance in Glory, and compare it to this film. Washington plays a great bad good guy. In Glory, he plays a racist black soldier for the Union, who eventually comes around and loses his prejudice. In Training Day, he plays nearly the same role, a disillusioned cop who makes the system and his role as an undercover narcotics cop work in his favor. However, in Training Day, he does not come to his senses. The contrast and conflict between Hawke and Washington is stellar, and the action and suspense is unbelievable. This is a must see for anyone who likes cop/military action movies. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Training Day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I own training day on DVD and before buying it on DVD i heard mixed reviews so i eventually bought it and thought Denzel Washington's performance was definitely his best performance to date. From the first 5 minutes till the last minute, i was gripped and shocked at what Alonzo woz forcing Hoyt to do by crossing the fine line of law and justice. I also thought Snoop Dogg's performance woz funny but too short, i wasn't keen on Dre's performance. I thought Eva Mendes' look and presence was sexy and lingering. The music set the atmosphere and the dialogue and grubby look of LA set the pace. I watched the DVD twice in the same night and loved every single minute of it. Top Rating!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I only saw the film yesterday on video! I thought it absolutely very exciting from beginning to end, with great things in it to reflect on, concerning moral/standards. And just a scaring picture of one of the ways that the world works too. As others have mentioned, the scene where Harris is exposed as what he really is, is absolutely spectacular. No wonder D.W. got an Oscar for this performance.This is highly due to the brilliant performances from both main actors, but not least Denzel W. who made my blood run cold with his outstanding performance.I highly recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A seasoned narcotics officer takes a rookie out for one day of on the job training to determine if he's worthy of joining the elite undercover department. Is LA really this big of a mess? This movie makes Capone's Chicago look like Bedford Falls. But don't believe it. Thanks to your friendly neighborhood Liberal Thought Police media correspondent, a big city cop can't so much as clean his gun without being brought up on misconduct or excessive force charges. So the idea of Los Angeles being a modern day Dodge City with the cops shooting and beating up the street scum is about as far from reality as a Bill Clinton testimony. This is one of those films that is at times so over the top brilliant, and at others so patheticaly stupid, that you wonder if it wasnt a splicing of efforts by 2 different directors. But its all one guys work, and sadly the stupidity leaves a stronger aftertaste than the quality. Whats good is the entire first hour and Denzel's and Hawke's work throughout. Whats bad is the typical, utterly unoriginal and predictable ending. How can one movie go from so fresh to so moldy stale within the short span of two movie hours? Figure that one out and the world is your oyster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a well-made thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Antoine Fuqua comes this gripping, pulse-pounding police thriller about crime and corruption. Hawke is an idealistic rookie narcotics officer who's just been assigned to a new unit; Washington is his twisted, maniacal senior officer out to give him an up close and personal look at the gritty L.A. streets. The young officer's morale is put to the test as he's given an in-depth look at both sides of the law, and forced to make a choice as he's plunged into the cruel world of police brutality. Washington is intensely believable and charismatically over-the-top as a seasoned veteran who doesn't play by the rules, and Hawke stands tall as his inexperienced but steadfast subordinate. Mostly good writing and direction falter at the climax?and require a certain suspension of disbelief?but overall the movie packs a powerful punch. ***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Training Day Makes The Grade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Training Day is a very well-done film. I watched a screening copy of it at my apartment in Hollywood then had to walk down the sidewalk for some errands... that's when I realized the hard-hitting nature and true to life perfection of this picture in its portrayal of the LA streets.I laugh at the handful of negative comments questioning the quality of writing and/or directing. Just on the surface (for all those non-film school kids out there), there is a scene where Alonzo and Jake are sitting in a Stan's (?) house when Stan remembers Jake being a great safety in high school. Everyone who knows football knows that a safety is the lack resort to stopping a quarterback who gets loose. Later Alonzo makes a comment comparing himself to a quarterback. Nice writing. Then there is the scene where Alonzo meets with the heads of the police who are portrayed like Mafia Dons. It is lit very much like the Godfather with the single (low) light source and a yellow, almost Sepia, filter. Beautiful directing.Acting? Coach Boone to Alonzo. I think that about sums it up. He does an amazing job and puts you on edge, not only with the lines, but his intensity in his eyes. That's something that cannot be directed or written. Ethan Hawke, very subtle but very effective. Again, his delivery makes the lines jump off the page and turn them into anguish and fear that words just don't capture.As far as just the overall presentation, no, it does not drag. It's supposed to be scary/real, not over the top unbelievable like Warner Brothers has a bad habit of doing. It makes you think of what actually could happen, what could go on if it is allowed.Great effort people, keep these types of movies coming. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High energy filled with sharp dialogue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Training Day, we get a high energy movie with sharp dialogue, along with a superb performance by Denzel Washington as a rough and tough street cop. It is training day for a rookie cop played by Ethan Hawke, yet, instead of offices, coffee and paperwork, he is given a day with Washington and we the audience are along for the ride. From the moment both characters meet, we immediately understand who is running the show. Hawke portrays an innocent, honest, almost naive cop stern in the ways of ethics and laws. Washington, on the other hand, believes in the law of the streets. While both arguements for solving crime have been portrayed in a lot of other movies, along with the almost tired partnership of a Black and White cop and their differences, this movie actually works. Hawke is quite honest and at times naive, but not naive to the point of unbelieveability. Washington is fiery in his ways of cleaning up the city and his knowledge of 'real policing'. So we come to very much enjoy his presence on the screen because it's as if Washington himself relishes the part of being the bad and disliked character. A role that is refreshingly new for Washington, but you wouldn't know it watching him play it so well. There is a constant back-and-forth sharing of views on how crime should be dealt with by Washington and Hawke. It is amusing to watch Hawke rationalize his views only to be quickly outwitted by Washington's sometimes outrageous antics. Naturally Hawke must give in slightly because after all, he is the one being trained but also because Hawke sees this opportunity to move higher up in rankings and eventually become detective.Training day is a test for Hawke, but by the end of the movie, it truly is a test on everyone. A test of judgement, morals, ideals, values. In other words, an overall test of who we really are as individuals. And so by the end of training, we and Hawke both find out just that, who we really are. Grade: B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before watching the movie I had read some good and some bad credits about this movie. Some said it was overrated, that it wasn't realistic at all... Others said that it was the best movie they had ever seen. I saw the movie for the first time three years after it appeared in the theaters. Perhaps that is why I wasn't as influenced by the hype which was created around the movie as some other people may have been. Overall I liked the movie, though I wasn't very impressed with the first 20 to 30 minutes.What is the story about? The young police officer, Jake Hoyt, who has a perfect family, wants to get a better job within the LAPD. He doesn't want to write parking tickets for the rest of his life, but wants to become a detective in the Narcotica Brigade. To get this job, he will get some help and advice from a detective which is already chasing the bad guys for many years, but who isn't afraid to cross the line from time to time. Hoyt will have to make some big decisions, will he stay the good cop or will he cross the line as well?This movie may be a little predictable from time to time, but overall there are enough twists and unexpected plots to keep you focused and interested. The action is well portrayed, without exaggerating and Denzel Washington is really fabulous. I guess many people were a little bit disappointed because he played another part than what they expected from him. I liked him and I would advice everyone to watch the movie. To me this is worth at least 7/10, perhaps even a little bit more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this film on countless occasions and every time i enjoy it. The two main leads (Washington and Hawke) are excellent in there portrayal of there characters, Hawke a fresh faced rookie trying to work his way to detective and Washington as the narcissistic experienced narc.The film unfolds over the space of one day and although questionable that so much could happen in a day you have only to watch th t.v series 24 to see what Hollywood considers plausible. The acting aside the story is well presented and lets us know a little bit at a time, in between showing us the discussions between Washington and Hawke as they drive around L.A, these vignettes are extremely involving as Washingtons character changes from Mr nice guy to bad guy so quickly that u never no how he is going to act.It is questionable whether Washington deserved an Oscar for this as it is not his best film, but i say it is about time he got one for he has had to wait so long, and if it means that this film has been bought to more peoples attention because of it then i salute the panel for giving it to him, man on fire should have swept the whole lot, lol!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inner City Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Training Day" is really a Western transferred to an inner city setting. It's to Westerns like "High Noon" and "The Unforgiven" that "Escape from New York" was to the sci fi genre. With a touch of "Chinatown" and even "On the Waterfront" and "Maltese Falcon" thrown in for a complicated plot of double crosses and conflicting loyalties that I didn't completely follow but was made mostly credible by the recent LAPD Ramparts revelations.Denzel Washington is riveting, and more completely sunk into the character than he even was in "Hurricane" and "Malcolm X." But then actors always thrive playing a villain more than the hero, or even a hero with mixed motives.Ethan Hawke rises to the bait effectively, though the script mostly only lets him be reactive; for him, this is an action role.The Latino and hip hop music choices are quite good, and the rap stars of course enjoy continuing their fictional gangstah personas on screen to add to their CD-selling props.

		<fullReview>from the moment i heard that trailer the film had sold me with its suaveness, the Denzel factor, and the fact Ethan hawke got to play another supporting role with such sheer acting brilliance. The action is spectacular matched only by the intrigue and suspense as Hawke finally unravels Washingtons plan for him. Hawke could be seen as the ultimate in anti-stereo typical cops, white and legit. the political factors in this film cannot be missed however the film is well shot, well written and well acted apart from Scott Glenn's terrible turn as Roger. the film is a symbol of denzel Washington's rise to the top and the line "king Kong ain't got nuthin on me" serves as an ego boast for Alonzo and Washington. Training Day Lacks the real magic however to make it a long time stayer in peoples minds but never the less a good watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Denzel finally breaks image.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Training Day" (2002): The BEST "corrupt cop" movie since "Serpico", made decades back. Ethan Hawke plays a rookie police officer assigned to Denzel Washington, the savvy, intense, in-real-deep corrupt cop. The story covers just ONE day...a VERY LONG day. Both men do incredible jobs with their characters, and although the story got a little over-the-top on a couple of occasions, this is a sharp edged, superb drama with lots of insight, and action. Photography, pacing, scoring, dialog?it ALL adds up to a high quality, tense experience. I would think that Washington was very glad to take on a role such as this, after so many "honorable downtrodden black men" roles. He was on the verge of being irretrievably typecast, at least with me. I cannot imagine any REAL actor wanting to be locked into a single image.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't rate this one as high as my others because of the overall effect of the film. But this one was one of my favorites. The film is mostly based on the point of view of a veteran cop and a rookie but a lot of it deals with the prosecution of criminal gangster activities. I thought Ethan Hawke and Denzel Washington had great chemistry together and developed this into a great gangster flick.Jake Hoyte, police officer bored of his position decides he wants to go into the realm of undercover narcotics officer. However after meeting with his training officer Alonzo Harris he finds it's not all it seems.... and a whole lot more. He learns Alonzo goes by his own rules displaying aggressive and violent behavior towards his culprits and still letting them all go in the end. However after Hoyte seems more than this crooked cop can handle it turns into betrayal after a heinous crime Hoyte refused to commit. It goes uphill and downhill. his is 24 hours of his life Jakes might never forget.Suspension, drama and action topped off with flawless performances from the entire cast. This Oscar winning thriller is awesome for fans of grueling gangster films, me being one. And enjoyable for anyone, but people who aren't interested in the corrupt side of the hood might just see this as another dirty cop flick. You might not want your kid to see this one until their a little older. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost Perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the last 15 minutes, Training Day is a powerful, gutsy film that has award-winning performances by Denzel Washington (Alzono) and Ethan Hawke (Jake). Ethan Hawke plays a complex character that is only rivaled by his current stage performance of Hurlyburly.The movie follows Jake who is a rookie narcotics cop and wants to get in on the action and be part of Alzono's undercover team. Alzono is king of the narcotics group, a ruler of the streets who sets his own rules within the department and on the street. Alzono enforces his own definition of justice, punishment, and morality.Take away the guns and violence and this is about morality on the streets where there is no true understanding of how justice plays out, except by force.The supporting cast and cameos by Snoop and Dr. Dre are terrific, as is the cinematography and grainy feel. Denzel's performance is rivaled only by a similar role in Man on Fire.If only.If only this wasn't a studio film and didn't have to have the tied knot ending. The movie would be perfect if only the edit had stopped when Jake is walking away from Alzono after the bust, leaving the audience to wonder: Will Jake go bad? If only we didn't know.</fullReview>

Denzel Washington was at the TOP of his apogee and his role was worth. This kind of movie is the American good movies which aren't too Hollywoodian for the public the camera filmed different angles taken for suspense and intrigue. Though the last scene with the Russian Mafia was a death shooting scene with interesting angles and sound effects. The way the dialogs were filmed had enormous caracteristics of "well done". The Movie is highly recommended and suggested to an audience wanting realistic visions on drugs and corruption.</fullReview>

It was like Narc and Deep Blue, maybe? but w/ the obligatory non-actor rappers making extended cameos-Dr Dre, Snoop, etc. amidst the carnage and shaky cam.I enjoyed seeing Cliff Curtis, considering how good he is in Three Kings etc etc it's fun to see him playing yet another hispanic though he is a Maori in real life. I didn't quite buy Denzel's character being able to do this routine and get away w/ it for so long, I also thought that it made our police force out to be a pack of mercenarial rats, far from the folks I know who are in the force for real. That-ain't them.I agree that the little 'wallet pic/call' scene was bogus, you def. had to let the disbelief suspension kick in bigtime for it.Denzel is very good, focuses, believable. Ditto Ethan Hawke. You get nice turns by Scott Glenn and Eva Mendes as well. I am not so sure that this will hold up down the road, but for what it's worth, sure it's worthy of seeing. Ignore the whole Russki mob angle, clearly that was phoned in and not really thought out 100% in the developmental process.*** outta ****, first half is better than second.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Denzel makes this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a cracking cop thriller. The premise is simple, with Ethan Hawkes rookie cop taken on a training day with experienced and hardened officer Denzel Washington. He soon discovers that Denzel has let the position of power go to his head and that he is quite prepared to abuse his power. Hawke is excellent in his role as the rookie caught up in a terrible world of police corruption and he is deserving of his Oscar nomination, perhaps deserved of the win. Denzel is superb though. His character is meaty, with this guy almost being a personification of evil while also having other personalities to him, a character who is almost trying to delude himself into thinking that he is an upholder of the law. Washington is amazing, this is one of the greatest bad guy performances ever. Denzel is like a firecracker, one minute he is exploding and showing off an alarming attitude towards policing and the next he is talking Hawkes character round, convincing him that what they do is right. He is so good he almost talks the audience round at the same time. Of course the film may seem very exaggerated in regards to the police corruption in LA (ten cops from each precinct can be charged with abusing their privileges and the law apparently!). Overall this is a classy thriller directed with style by Antoine Fuqua. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intruiging, intense angle to the traditional cop movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Better than a typical out-of-line-cop action movie, Training Day delivers as a solid drama with enough action to keep things stirring.Ethan Hawke's naive character allows us as viewers to 'feel' the intensity &amp; chaos of L.A.'s back alleys and neighborhoods, while steadily unravelling Denzel Washington's character as an increasingly crooked narc officer who seems to know no boundaries.Perhaps the greatest success of this film is it lacks the predicatability of many other cop movies where the 'rogue cop' does have ultimate limits (i.e. The Negotiator, Bad Boys, etc), because he's really deep down a good guy. In this movie you really have to wonder if, for Washington, that good vs. evil line is ever drawn.I feel the best part of the movie, and most suspensful, is the poker game scene. It makes a viewer truly identify with the vulnerablitity of being completely isolated, and defensless, amidst a den of cold-hearted strangers.I would recommend seeing this movie, if for any reason to see a slightly different angle to the traditional Hollywood-cop-movie formula.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been truly great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS COULD BE CONTAINED HEREIN!The problem with Training Day is not that it's an ordinary film. Far from that, Training Day is a great action film that takes a brutal look at the drug scene and how cops can get lured into its seamier side. The problem is that it could have been a lot lot more than just that.The way I see it there are two threads operating in this film. One is the whole angle of the Training Day. Which is essentially Ethan Hawke's presence in the film and the dynamic of his interaction with Denzel Washington as a rookie cop on his first day. The second angle is that of Denzel Washington as the unconventional cop with the unconventional methods, who finally goes corrupt in a system that's too big and ugly for him.My issue is this - while it can be argued that the first (the training day angle) is nothing more than a plot device, I personally found that it became, at many times, an unnecessary extra storyline.I wish for this - I wish, in some manner, the film had stuck to the downfall of the cop, and not cluttered it with Ethan Hawke's character's presence (no issue with his performance, just his character). I wish it had reduced his presence to a narrator, a fly on the wall, in some way. I wish they'd moulded his character to be like a little man in the big world of drug crime, watching and trying to make sense of what's going on. I wish, in fact, that they'd stuck to the main story - that of an unconventional, yet corrupt cop caught in corrupt world and doing desperate things to cope with it.I feel if this had happened, the film could have been something else altogether. A niche tragedy about a particular profession. A story of the downfall of one powerful man. Perhaps (at a stretch) a bit like how Wall Street is a tragedy about the business world and how it can eat up its very own. Training Day could have been an awesome commentary on the meaning of survival and the sometimes difficult choices one has to make to survive. It could have had us empathising much more with Denzel's character, even while loathing it for his flaws.Unfortunately, the film doesn't entirely play upon this aspect, and in trying to be one too many things, seems to loose its way. No doubt, some elements of greatness are present, or I wouldn't even be writing this - but unfortunately by showing us how good it 'could' have been, the film ends up leaving you unsatisfied. It, of course, remains a terrific action movie worth a look. Unfortunately, it remains just that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Training Day kicks ass. Denzel Washington turns in one of the greatest performances of his career and this movie never lags for a second. Some cop films make the mistake of getting too deep in the plot and leaving things like acting and action by the wayside. Training Day achieves the perfect balance. Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke play well off each other and you end up liking each character. The supporting cast does well but it's Washington and Hawke that you are watching. Scott Glenn is good as a drug dealer that's a friend of Washington. The film takes place over the course of one day and what a day that is. From shooting it out with gang members to finding out just how dirty a cop Denzel is, Ethan Hawke finds that his first day on Denzel's beat is a very dangerous one.Bottom Line: I highly recommend this movie. If you haven't seen it yet you're missing out. A first class cop drama/thriller.</fullReview>

Personally I enjoyed 'Copland' more, which maybe speaks volumes for this movie and the Hollywood hype surrounding it.I think Training Day would like to be seen as a making a statement, but it fails on this front for me. I felt like I'd seen it all before in various other 'bent cop' movies, but harder and faster. Hawke is put through an unrealistic first day which seems to go on forever (they didn't even stop for doughnuts and coffee once) and Denzel is a more than a little annoying after a while.Maybe it's coz I'm a limey and don't really give 2 hoots about the Academy Awards, but there's no way Denzel's acting in this was better than Crowe in 'A Beautiful Mind'.Morgan Freeman should have had an Oscar ages ago as should Denzel, but don't just give 'em away for the sake of it!

I want to point out that you must have massive head trauma or be in born in another country to know that Denzel Washington not only played a realistic corrupt cop but it seemed like it was second nature for him. Looking back at this film I can see nothing flawed about maybe I mean not to be redundant but there are very few films that really make you feel gratitude at the end. I don't know if you haven't ever seen Training Day go out and watch this movie...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>to quote dr dre this is xplosiv west coast sh**. i dunno if ya can swear on here best make sure not though. I first saw this on vcd winter 2001 and was totally blown away i hadnt really seen much of ethan hawke before this picture and i thought he matched denzel's performance all the way through, both actors were really immersed in that lifestyle and their characters' personal backgrounds that they were totally believable as cops. For me the most important the most important thing in the movies is believability, if thats a word i doubt it. I thought the plot was as well worked out as alonzo's plan for hoyt and the way the girl's wallet got hoyt outta the bath and previously the 'blood test' no backing out barrier that alonzo enforces. Another reason why i love this movie is for its quotes and when still dre kicks in when denzel flicks the switches is legendary. Not coming from an environment as bad as that myself, i thought that training day like 187 and i a way the shield does, gives a view of that harsh culture not portrayed as clearly in boyz n the hood n menace. I thought the acting was great, the plot was tight and relavent and well planned and it was good to see other artists trying their hand at acting especially macy gray, who i didnt recognise at first! i dunno if this spoils the plot that bad but if u aint seen it ya have to and if ya have i hope ya enjoyed it as much as me. laters</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>TWO MOVIES - Only one of them is good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two movies in one movie. In the first there is Denzel teaching Ethan how to be a cop: effective, tough and, if need be, merciless; whatever gets the job done. You may question his methods, but his motive is pure, stop the bad guys. After the last conversation in the car, you expect the movie to be over. And it should of been. Ethan would've told the D.A. what should've been said and then end-of-story.Second movie - we get to see that Denzel is not only ruthless, but savage and murderous. He's even willing to give up his partner/trainee to murder. This movie, which at first was compelling and intense, now shifted gears so ferociously, so violently, so unexpectedly that it was impossible to want to watch anymore. This second part was like watching a train wreck, and no matter how much you scream, the trains crash into each other. I wish I hadn't watched the second part. It shouldn't have been there. It wasn't right. And I WON'T watch it again! While the acting is incredible, there are just some things best left unsaid, some scenes best left unfilmed and unwatched. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was entertaining for the most part. My overall reaction was "Cool. Good movie. Let's never think aboutit again." Because this is the sort of movie that gets worse if you think aboutit too much. It started to slowly get worse towards the end of themovie when I couldn't really help but think about the specifics ofwhat was going on. Denzel, yeah he acted well. He was believable. Hawk? He did a fine job, just barely good enough to cover up thefact that he was (let's face it) miscast. (And that is a complement tohim, I know I couldn't be miscast into this part and stil pull it off) But anyway, I get turned off by action flicks that try to be more thanaction flicks, and this movie kind of did that. Washington did NOT deserve an award for this. His character wasscripted in such a typical way that all he had to do was put on aconvincing face, hold his gun right and say his lines. Hawk had a MUCH more difficult character to play. There wasconfusion in him, weakness, guilt, value struggle...all that goodstuff. In short, this movie was good in some ways, not good in others. I don't regret having seen it...I would have regretted it if i paid to seeit in the theaters. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Denzel Washington is, in my own opinion, in the role of his life. Noted for the good guy roles, he now has THE chance to shine as the bad guy!The director's opening of Ethan Hawke in the family setting instills in the viewer that he's a cop who wants to make things right, ultimately, to keep his family safe. It's not a bad premise, really, since we all want that kind of security for our loved ones.His first day in the "narc" division is, shall we say, an eye opener. Washington's character stays focused throughout the whole film and that's what kept me on the edge of my seat. I kept finding myself hoping that he was a good guy after all. "Say it isn't so, Denzel!"The raid is where things screwed up. I really can't believe that all of the "bad cops" were willing to let Hawke walk out of there. Washington was the ring leader, but I don't think any man has that kind of control over everyone like that. True, I'm not from the streets, but this ain't the nineties, anymore. You can't control how I feel! Denzel being the boss, or not, if someone with Hawke's character were in the position to put me away for a very long time, I would make very sure that he was on my side. The director lost me, there.But I do see a lot of realistic values in the film. It was very well shot and I believe Washington finally had the chance to shine in this one! I'm just sad to see it took a role like this to get all the critic's attention. Keep up the good work, Denzel, I'm pullin' for ya'!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the most incredible films I've seen in a long time. Denzel Washington made this movie as great as it was. There is not another actor you could have cast in the role of Alonzo. He really stole the show with this film.The thing that is so great about this movie is that you've never seen Denzel Washington play a bad guy. And he does it so damn well!! Ethan Hawke is just as good as the rookie cop Jake Hoyt. But I've unfortunately seen too many bad Ethan Hawke movies (BEFORE SUNRISE, GATTICA)to turn me sour. Cliff Curtis is great in this as well as a gang leader with a heart. IF you want to see another great Cliff Curtis performance, check out BRINGING OUT THE DEAD. The supporting cast is great in this as well. Eva Mendez from 2 FAST 2 FURIOUS is Denzel's wife (hottie), Dr. Dre and the guy that played Redfoot in THE USUAL SUSPECTS are members of Alonzo's unit. Denzel Washington's performance is top-notch. And I don't even think this was his greatest performance. Denzel was superb in REMEMBER THE TITANS and in the Oscar-snubbed THE HURRICANE. I feel the Academy gave the Oscar to Denzel because they know they screwed him twice for REMEMBER THE TITANS (where he was robbed of the best actor award) and THE HURRICANE. Nonetheless, this is still a great crime drama and it's not to be missed.Rating: 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

Duh.. "Okay, boss!!"2ndly, in an apparent shot at the LAPD, featuring three high ranking members of the law enforcement community as crooked as Harris, not to mention his own morally challenged crew (Dr. Dre &amp; the rest), got a little tired. Is Jake Hoyt the ONLY honest cop in LA? This flick would have you believe just that. 3rdly, WAAAAY too "Deus-ex-Machina" for an ending.

It felt so real because the Bloods that were in this movie really are actual bloods in real life. not only that but the thought of a crooked cop running your neighborhood would make you antsy. Denzel Washington in the villain role shows why he deserved the award for best actor which I cannot contest at all - and Ethan Hawke as the rookie cop who begins to realize that all Alonzo Harris(Washington) is is a crook with a cop's badge. Even the supporting cast was great including Snoop, Macy Gray Scott Glenn and Eva Mendes. Very good urban cop movie with energy and heart.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DENZAL, Finally Plays a Bad A**</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Training Day is a great crime, drama, action, thriller, and cop/detective film. The screenplay is very rich and smooth, very free flowing. Great from start to finish. Training Day is one of my Top 5 favorite films to come out of 2001. The story is about a young police officer (Hawke) trying to make detective the fastest way, by being a narcotics officer for 18 months. He has one day to prove himself to his boss, Detective Alonzo Harris (Washington). This becomes his Training Day. Through out the film he finds out that being a narc is more then he bargained for. The film is about wrong and right and making the right decisions under extreme pressure. Denzal Washington gives a fantastic performance as Detective Harris. He is a man that has no morals and is using the badge to perform crimes against the criminals he is putting away, or trying to put away, either by death or prison. Denzal's powerful performance earned him an Oscar for best actor in 2002. Ethan Hawke gives a emotional performance as Officer Jake Hoyt, the new guy in training. He was also nominated for an Oscar for best supporting actor. Another great cop/detective film that came out recently is Narc (2002). I highly recommend both of these films. I give Training Day * * * * (out of 5 stars).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot has already been discussed a thousand times on here, so I will not waste time describing it, but for a in a brief way: Denzel Washington (The Hurricane,The Bone Collector, Courage Under Fire) plays thirteen year LAPD veteran Alonzo Harris. The film follows a turbulent day as rookie Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) is taken under Harris's wing in a "Training Day". Pass the tough test he is presented with, and he becomes a narcotics officer, fail, and he goes back to the Valley. What unfolds is a carefully thought out and even more impressively executed plot, that has many turns along the way, and many underlying themes that can be appreciated more on repeated viewings. David Ayers' screenplay beats the hell out of his other two famous ones - The Fast and the Furious and U-571, and Antoine Fuqua's direction is some of the best work I have ever seen. Every scene has it's own significance, even if you only realise it later, and they are cut perfectly to display this.I have heard accusations on here of Denzel being "bad in some scenes", and the supporting cast "having nothing to do". Let me clear that up with one word: Rubbish. Washington is on form for every second of screen time, showing us more and more of who he really is as the film goes along, but letting us judge for ourselves whether we like Harris or not, whether we agree with his principles or not. And as for the supporting roles, I would welcome anybody who can point out a scene in which actors are completely wasted. Scott Glenn (who also worked with Washington on Courage Under Fire) is solid as Harris's "boy" Roger, and Cliff Curtis of Three Kings fame is a joy to watch as a Mexican nicknamed "Smiley", even more so considering that he is a New Zealander and does his assigned accent perfectly. This film is brimming with talent, including the supporting cast. Although it recieved an Oscar for Washington's lead role, the whole film is virtually flawless. Hawke is fantastic as Jake Hoyt, and it's always good to see Tom Berenger pop up, even if its only for a few minutes. This film is well written, sharply directed, performed with distinction. The musical score from Mark Mancina deserves a mention too. And as for the so called "disappointing" ending, it really isn't. It caps off the whole feel of the film: Firstly, because it has ((Slight Spoiler)) Harris showing his true colours that have been coming out bit by bit all the way through. Secondly, because after the great (((((Spoiler)))) "King Kong" speech, the film is finished off in the same vein as the rest of it, with subtlety. It leaves room for interpretation, and, like throughout, it doesn't over do on emotion. An original, gritty, and refreshing look at a side of street life you don't often see portrayed so well.A well deserved 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Art of Seduction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seduction. It's such an interesting subject. Kierkegaard used to say that it is a necessary part of religious conversion. And Kuhn used to say that conversion is an essential part of every scientific revolution. Would the world go round without it? I love Training Day precisely because it's such a visceral foray into the art of seduction; for example, when Jake, the trainee, is faced with a serious moral dilemma, Alonzo tells him that the game they're playing is chess, not checkers, and adds, with avuncular affection, that when he's able to match what's going on in his head with the `real world,' he'll feel better. Only after he knows how to play the game, Alonzo adds, after he has become `wise' to real world, can he change things for the better. But he must become part of the system, however corrupt, before he can change it. He must have some dirt on him before others can trust him. From a pragmatist perspective, this is reasonable. From a `strategic' perspective of a chess match, it's morally superior. `They build jails because of me,' Alonzo boasts. And so, when the rookie makes his choice to challenge Alonzo's `official' construction of reality with that of his own, he's really challenging the entire system. In the eyes of his peers, he's an egoist, a `choir boy' who's better suited for a different line of work. He's a threat, not because he's ethically superior to his colleagues, but because he just doesn't understand the fundamental realities of the situation. `It's not what you know: it's what you can prove,' Alonzo says several times over to his protégé. Alonzo has the social and political capital to `prove' anything he likes. The more times I see the video, the more I buy into Alonzo's perspective. And the more I wonder if he wasn't right after all. The game is chess, not checkers. Watch it again and see if you don't notice a subtle change in your attitude. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>For some reason, the word I associate with this film is depression. Lots of the writing and the acting is solid, but are we really this bad? Do we really live among people who are like some of the characters in this film? Unfortunately, I think the answer is yes. No, I don't think there are cops like Denzel. (But I don't think there a hell of a lot of 'em like Elliot Ness, either, sad to say). To me, this film tells us something about where we are as a society, and it doesn't speak too prettily. Every man is a bad ass(yeah, right), latino gangstas from the hood have no respect for life, and in just a little way, the movie seems to want us to think these people are cool. I ain't buying it, but I suspect lots of people are. I guess I would compare this movie to Goodfellas and "No Fear" stickers. It is partially in love with the idea of its own toughness and ruthlessness. It kind of makes me want to say, "Oh, really? Wanna dance?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Definitely a bit different this one.For his performance, Denzel Washington received a best actor oscar as the narcotics officer who takes the naive Jake (Ethan Hawke) under his wing. Constantly referred to as a rookie, Jake goes on a training day to see if he can handle the street as presented to him by Alonzo (Denzel), and cope with the way narc officers deal with the law.It's a supremely well-told story, because nothing is given to the viewer on a plate. Every feeling you have towards the main characters is your own, and the movie never attempts to dictate your emotive response. This is a rarity in the sentimentally-driven industry Hollywood frequently is. The performances are utterly excellent, and Ethan Hawke does equally as well as Washington in my opinion - the only difference being that Washington's character has more scope and more of the opportunity to be dynamic.The movie is objective, never takes sides, and gives the viewers the chance to deduce their own feelings. That's how cinema should be.Fine movie.</fullReview>

It keeps you unsure of what either of the main characters' motives are, or even if they have any at all. Initially the Washington character can seem quite grating, showing the well written part, and soon your sympathies are lying with whom they should be. Although the ending is quite weak, and can leave you feeling short changed, it still makes a good, well written film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You Don't Win The Oscar For A Single Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you doesn't know and understand the fact above; you can't possibly understand why Mr. Washington won. Training Day is an extremely artless movie. Put most simply, Training Day is the harrowing tale of a black stereotype (Denzel Washington) placed in a commercially proven genre. And, of course, the white everyman dogooder (Ethan Hawke), who, almost singlehandedly, frees the ghetto from Washington's offensive and morally bankrupt stereotype. The "Ghetto People" could never, never in a million years, have emancipated themselves from the Blackzilla of Washington's character, not until they had the assistance of the all powerful Whitey to start the ball rolling. Ethan Hawke's character is so diametrically opposed to Washinton's, so bursting with morality, that the film does not allow Hawke's character to deliver Washington's stereotype the ultimate justice. This film fulfills all the needs of the average movigoing public. White audiences all over America are allowed to leave the theatre blissfully aware that their moral superiority is intact, and their inherent responsibility toward unfortunate minorities completely absolved.As for a comment atop this review I think any reasonable person can understand that when The Academy placed the little gold statue in Denzel's hands it was not for Training Day itself. It was for all the great films he made previously, and despite the extremely special performance by LL -- whoops I mean Denzel-- in these films, he was egregiously passed over. Obviously, a short list of these films would include: Carbon Copy, The Mighty Quinn, Heart Condition, and the incomprehensible Virtuosity. But the King of this unsung heap, is of course, Ricochet, a film so exceptional that it features an early glimpse of that great dramatic actor, Kevin Pollak. While it may appear, to the casual observer that Pollak is simply walking through the scenes, doing bits from his stand-up act, this simply is not so. Is it even conceivable that Kevin Pollak, the man who brought us the most realistic portrayal of a Rabbi since William Christopher's Father Mulcahy could be any less then outstanding in any role with which he chose to grace the celluloid.</fullReview>

I don't really care if this offers no redeeming comment on the direction, success or otherwise of law enforcement. I care even less about the snowballing ambiguity of Ethan Hawke's predicament as Washington's rookie partner, nor the plot variables, missed linkages, Hollywoodisation or in fact ANYTHING other than the performances of the two leads and the script supporting them. It did enough to more than justify the price of a ticket and in my book thats just fine and dandy. True it lacked the racial conflict of IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT, the grit of MIDNIGHT EXPRESS or the sheer dynamics of BULLITT.

His transition from "sheep to wolf" is both logical and fascinating. Denzel in contrast starts out at full volume and stays there. Even his death sequences - two of them! - are too long. I also don't get how he could get shot at close range, yet still stand and talk like he was hit with a punch instead of a bullet."The Russian" thing was also kind of dumb. Why bring a smoke screen of international intrigue into this? They should have kept it simple and called the bad guys from Vegas, oh, "bad guys from Vegas"; the same bad guys who offed Elizabeth Shue's pimp in "Leaving Las Vegas" maybe.Okay, so it's flawed. But despite that, it's still a good picture. I'd easily rent it again sometime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Training Day is the story of a rookie narcotics cop (Hawke) on the job for his first day with an unconventional veteran (Washington).... doesnt that sound like the plot of every 80's buddy cop film?Well, take that plot premise of the buddy cop movie and shove it somewhere unattractive, embellish this action with a plethora of expletives because Training Day is nothing like you expect it to be.Points here are mainly scored for its surprising story line, its morally perplexing outcome and the excellent performances by the two central characters.What goes against it for the most part is the simply unbelievable premise that there are narcotics cops in the force who can behave in the way Washington's character does and live to become a veteran cop.It's a jarring grinding ride of a movie, rather than a speeding roller-coaster, well worth the money to own it on DVD.A definate 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sinister look at the look of dirty world of undercover police - contains spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is about a na?ve cop Jake, played by Ethan Hawke, on his first day as a narcotic officer, being trained by the dirty corrupt guy who runs it, Alonzo, played by Denzel Washington. His character is so evil, sinister, and every other bad characteristic that you could think of, he has it, including openly flaunting his infidelity. It is to the point where if you want anything bad to happen to anyone on the film, it would be him instead of the guys committing the crimes. But at the same time, he actually thinks he is doing the right thing, believing that he is some sort of demagogue. Denzel is very good in portraying all that in this character, that is, everything except for any redeeming characteristics. Some other parts are a little more unbelievable, like Alonzo letting Jake in on his secret dirty dealing, not even knowing if Jake will be openly receptive to the assassination and looting of drug money that he and his gang regularly enrich themself with, then putting Jake on the quandary of coming on board or snitch and be blamed for the whole thing. I would assume if they want to introduce someone into their inner circle, they should either be receptive or do not object to such dealings. The other cops on Alonzo's team seem to be characters straight out of some illicit gang, with more criminal than law enforcement attitude and personality. Others issues includes the cardboard cutout characters of the dirty politician and DA. They are like a pack of crooks who has nothing in common except for their corrupt dealings. Looking at the deleted scenes on the DVD, it was good of them to delete the last scene where they collectively go to Jake's residence for the loot that he took from Alonzo. The ending is also over the top, with the faceoff between the two cops in the street, with Alonzo's street homies not coming to his aid, instead letting them two take it out mano-a-mano, including sliding a gun to him when he didn't have one. I guess at the end, Alonzo knew it its over for him, having messed around with some people even above this demagogue's head. So instead of running, he is accepting fate. Despite the movie's flaws, it is still a gritty hard look at the dirty side of undercover police world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I couldn't believe that this film was really from the director of "The Replacement Killers (1998)." Because I saw T.R.K. as Fuqua's first work, and that had more intense action than this one, like pervasive gunfights. "Training Day" is pretty good and somewhat realistic, too; but it could have been more better and intense as a decent Los Angeles setting. Other than that, Denzel Washington plays an impressive character whenever he partners with other people. I too, give this movie an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

It would smell bad to everyone. A loose cannon like the Washington character would not have made it for 13 years on the force. The ending was predictable but they should've at least given it a little more time playing up to it. The short story is that the plot gets more and more out there as the movie goes on.

		<fullReview>I will just say that Denzel is the top dog. I must give him high praise for this because this is his first time being the bad guy and he still gives a tremendously good performance. If i was an actor i would be so intimidated by this man. All I can say about the negative things people say about this movie is that they look for too much realism in a fictional story. True, their may be a lot of fact involved in this film which forces people to look for real life issues. To me that is just one of the things that makes this movie good. Denzel plays every character in the movies he's been in very well. It's too bad he had to play a negative role to win an Oscar but that's a separate issue. All in all, Denzel is one of, if not the best out there. I have yet too see a bad Denzel movie and this man has a long history. Few actors can say that. They have at least one stinker. With Denzel you have some better than others but never a bad one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had put off seeing "Training Day" until it came to the premium movie channels on cable. I only watched then because of the critical acclaim Denzel Washington's performance had received. I'm glad I finally saw it. Alonzo Harris (Washington) is a murderous, delusional, manipulative sociopath but we almost like him despite ourselves. Ethan Hawke gives the best performance of his career as the idealistic but thrill seeking, Jake Hoyt who, to his ultimate sorrow, is assigned as Harris's partner on the LAPD narcotics detail. Some have complained that the final scenes of the film are preposterous. While this may be so, these scenes are effective and tell an exciting and engaging story. Harris's irredeemable sleaziness is almost too much to bear, but the movie succeeds, nevertheless. Highly recommended, 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a must-see for anyone interested in the rim of society. The actual story is rather simple : a young police officer is transferred to the Narcotics department and recieves his "street training" from a hardened, experienced colleage.For an American movie it is quite uncensored. Many, many unwanted aspects of society are part of this movie, putting it in another way : they ARE the movie. It gives an extremely dark, pitch-black image of the edges of modern society and the people trying to control it.The tough, experienced officer forces his colleage through nice words and brute violence to break numerous laws, in order to "adapt to the streets". Towards the end the newbie starts to mentally degenerate, to harden like his mentor, and become a man of the streets himself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film finding its morals and giving a message (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was most certainly an exercise in placing contemporary urban morality. The tacit assumption about this film was that it was supposed to be some action filled, cops &amp; robbers, kitschy cool look at undercover cops. The real thing was an entirely different film. We are introduced to Alonzo and immediately we see the dangerous, brutal charm and power he wields. In many ways he appears to be what many men would strive to become; stoic, fearless, capable, clever, sexual, the list goes on. At the same time that we see this kind of cruel side to Alonzo as well. While we see Jack as a good man but very unexperienced and incapable. This is one of the most pivotal ways it breaks from being another trite cops &amp; robbers film. By the end of the film we see the cracks in Alonzo's philosophy and the narcissictic nature that made him attempt to be this uber-man.As the viewer we are placed in the moral conflicts that Jack is. He has to choose what is the appropriate answer to a bevy of morally broken scenarios. For the choices he makes are not simply right and wrong because Alonzo presents them in a much different light. While he is manipulating Jack's character to a certain extent he is also telling him the truth of the system. The problem with the choices that Jack has to make is that they are so easy to simply conform with what is wanted. I truly feel this is one of the core messages of the film. How difficult would it be for undercover agents to prey off of money from drug dealers and gangbangers? The answer in the film is not too hard. If money is seized who is to say that it is the correct amount. If you have some dirt on somebody how is it for you to put them in your pocket instead of in jail? This film is critical of police corruption but it also does not idealize the criminal aspect either. Another point that was brought up was simple impression and respect. The gangs that were dealt with in the film were not insane, gun-toting, violence driven people rather they were pragmatic, scrupulous, gun-toting people. They are not reduced to something less then human rather they are people doing very incorrect things. The violent elements in their world are gotten rid of instead of being the mainstay of their organization. When they deal with Jack it quickly becomes an issue of would they rather deal with Jack who is respectful of those around him or Alonzo who will sacrifice anyone for his personal gain. Overrall I think this film is quite excellent but has a tendency to be judged on the outset rather then having a good hard look at what it is really trying to say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Moral Responsabilities Of Being A Cop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>8/10Alonzo Harris is an experienced LAPD narcotics cop, who's been given the task to train the almost rookie Jake Hoyt. Harris will show him the streets, and will actually make him feel part of it. Harris' performance repulses Hoyt, but there's something that at the same time makes him admire him. Probably this will happened to the spectator as well. Partly because of the script, and mostly because Mr Washington knows how to be convincing to everyone listening. Hoyt will have to make a quick decision about if being a cop is really what he was expecting, therefore what he wants to be. Harris makes it sound like the only way possible to work in the narcotics division. But it's up to Hoyt to make a decision.The most remarkable, though there is nothing wrong with the directing, the script, etc, are the performances. Washington is really convincing and will make you doubt, you won't know when you have just crossed the thin (white) line between cop duty and illegality and corruption. And Ethan Hawk should have really won the Academy Award as Hoyt. these performances kill, in more than one way.This kind of great police dramas make me want to know and watch more about the genre.Btw, who the hell said it was a comedy?! it is funny watching as Hoyt smokes the dope that Alonzo gives him to 'be on the streets', but what else?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense but somewhat contrived</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A SPOILER OR TWO: If you get through some of the plot implausibilities and stereotypes, this is an entertaining and intense film. Denzel's performance is riveting, not because of the performance itself (it's pretty one-sided as far as I was concerned), but because Denzel has always played the nice guy. Here he plays the bad guy. It's simply interesting to watch this metamorphosis. But that's also the test of a great actor: being convincing in any role you play. And he certainly is convincing in this role and in everything he plays. So---bravo, Denzel.But for the movie: well, some of it just doesn't work, but you have to overlook some of the implausibilities and go with the action, which is constant and intense. And using famous rap stars in speaking roles is certainly a mistake. They come across as wooden. And some of the plot twists just become a bit too far-fetched: e.g. why does the young girl saved from a rape so willingly provide the information to her UNCLE!? She starts off her telephone conversation hiding everything, but then almost unconvincingly spills the beans. Why does the neighborhood in which much of the action take place change it's opinion of Denzel's character so quickly? Oh, yeah, he's a bad cop and he used them and they hate him and he's a pig, etc. But it just comes as such a pat finish. Was it dramatic license that forces the rookie into the "fold" so quickly on the very first day on the job? We are cheated out of getting to see the wool being pulled over the rookie's eyes, really. It all happens so quickly, forceably in the first hour or two on the job. Pretty neat trick, but are we then supposed to believe that the rookie was that gullible in the beginning? Yeah, he is pretty stupid, I guess, and green in the beginning. But wow, very little leg work had to be done to get him involved. But this of course is what adds to the intensity of the film. The artifice of compacting into a set dramatic time makes for drama, if not realism.</fullReview>

HOWEVER, he did NOT deserve the Oscar for this role. Just because he played the bad guy and not the character that everybody loves, does not mean that he deserves an award. In Monster's Ball, Billy Bob Thornton plays both of those types of characters in the same movie, yet no one even considered him for the award. What a shame...</fullReview>

There are a few scenes where you actually think to yourself that he is not the kind of guy you would want to cross or even come across walking in the street. He exudes danger and that's why he won the Oscar. He flipped everyone with this choice of roles. This movie could have easily been straight to video but how does a straight to video movie get a cast like this? I don't know but we can start by handing off kudos to David Ayer, screenwriter. Antoine Fuqua, director. You more than made up for that piece of splatch, Replacement Killers. Ethan Hawke, supporting role. You held your own and you definitely got the magic eye. I absolutely loved this movie and recommend it whole heartedly. And if you made a list of the top-ten most tense scenes of all time, you'd have to include Ethan Hawke in the gangmembers house.

		<fullReview>LAPD Officer Jake Hoyt (Hawke) wants to make a difference on the streets, so he attempts to join the tough, harsh world of the plain-clothes Narcotics Department. To succeed in this, he has to endure a training day on the job and convince the Narc's chief street officer, Detective Alonzo Harris (Washington), that he has what it takes. A difficult enough job for anyone, but Detective Harris has one or two skeletons in his closet, and today they've all decided they're claustrophobic! Firstly. The acting of the two leads is top-notch. Washington might have won the Oscar for the showier part but Hawke matches him all the way in what is actually a more demanding journey. 90% of the movie concentrates on these two almost completely in isolation and they deliver through-out; a couple of moving, confrontational scenes at the heart of the film being exceptionally executed.Secondly. The film does not have the courage of it's convictions. Initially it is almost plotless - and all the better for it. Harris takes his rookie on a roller-coaster of 'street justice' and, despite the latter's consternation, the pivotal moments are so well handled and the dialogue of argument in the mouth of Harris so persuasive that his apparent immorality is never as clear-cut as it should be. Had the entire film followed this path, we could well have been left with an intriguing debate on 21st Century urban justice and a refreshing reflection on the idea of 'right' and 'wrong'. The film, of course, does nothing of the sort. It's made in Hollywood after all! No, almost exactly half-way through, we are introduced to a no-brainer plot involving the Russian mafia (oh dear!) and Harris stops breaking the rules because he firmly believes this is the only way to maintain street law, and starts breaking them because he is suddenly a very bad man! Unbelievable plot twists follow hard by and we are taken into a different, disappointing, cliched nonsense of a film in which (among several lame developments) the residents of a lethal neighbourhood ghetto suddenly develop a collective, moral consciousness. The very ending is awful beyond words and if it's a nod to Penn's Bonnie and Clyde it's an offensively crude one!It is to the two leads' credit than that, as crassly predictable as the film becomes, it remains very watchable because of their inspired playing. And for that - it is worth a few hours of anybody's time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have very mixed emotions about "Training Day." I want to say it was one of the best movies of 2001. However...Denzel Washington is great, very much deserving of the Academy Award he won. And Ethan Hawke is quite good as well. Not to mention Scott Glenn, Tom Berenger, Cliff Curtis and so on and so on. For the first 70 minutes, I was loving it. However...About 70 minutes into the movie the movie takes a wrong turn from which it never quite recovers.But those first 70 minutes! Wow! What a movie! Jake Hoyt (Hawke) is a young LA policeman who has just transferred into the narcotics division. His first day on the job, a training day, he is introduced to and will serve with Alonzo Harris (Washington). Hoyt knows he must make a good impression on Harris or he will be washed out of the department.Hoyt quickly discovers, however, that Harris is a very unconventional policeman. Hoyt does things "by the book." Harris does not. Hoyt knows there are certain lines a policeman must not cross. Harris doesn't care what lines he has to cross as long as he gets the job done. So who is right and who is wrong? Is a little bit, maybe even a lot, of rule breaking okay for the police as long as they are succeeding at their job? In the narcotics division, do the ends justify the means?If the movie had stayed at this level, "Training Day" could have been one of the best cop movies ever made. However...70 minutes into the movie it takes that wrong turn. And for the last half hour it devolves into just another Hollywood Good Guy vs. Bad Guy movie. A very stylish and well done Good Guy vs. Bad Guy movie to be sure. However...See it for Washington's performance. See it because, whatever its faults, it is a very well made movie. However...it could have been so much more.</fullReview>

This movie was pretty good, a standard action flick with a few twists and turns, but nothing I haven't seen before. If the academy felt that Denzel Washington deserved an oscar, couldn't they have picked a better vehicle? I'm sure he's done better. Or perhaps a better actor for the oscar entirely -- what about Morgan Freeman, Samuel L.

		<shortDescription>Heart of Darkness on the streets of LA</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like the movie. I live in LA and saw up close neighborhoods I wouldn't venture into with a panzered Humbvie. But I learned that gangs have a code of honor. The story of a rookie cop Jake (Ethan Hawke) getting his street IQ bumped up a few notches by veteran Narc Alonzo (Denzyl Washington). But is Alonzo the truth the way and the light or a seductive demon? There's enough seduction and mystery to keep us interested. There is a boatload of really good acting between the two leads as they drive around the streets of LA fulfilling Alonzos agenda. Unfortunately the movie has two really week moments for which I suspect director Antoine Fuqua is still taking heat. Both moments are heroic unbelievable revivals of Jake. I suggest Antoine should have made an alternate ending without such a heroic revival and stuck that on the DVD for the viewers who were taken out of their theatre seats and put on the streets of LA. 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Cop Flick....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, so after Denzel Washington won the Oscar for Best Actor for this flick, I thought it would be worth my while to watch it and see if it was deserved. In my humble opinion, I believe that the Oscar was awarded to the WRONG man that night.The story revolved around Alonzo (Washington), head of the narc unit of LAPD, who take on a rookie, Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) who wants to be part of the unit. This day in the life of movie takes them to neighbourhoods of LA and Hoyt, who has great respect for the narcs and Alonzo finds himself in the middle of a corrupt system he doesn't want to believe.The performances are alright. Hawke is pretty good as the naive, new cop. Washington is believable as the expert, rough around the edges with a quick wit. But I don't think it's an Oscar winning performance. I do believe Russell Crowes performance in "A Beautiful Mind" was much stronger and deserving. No, I'm not biased because I'm an Aussie, but I think politics and personal feelings got in the way of the voting. I mean, "Training Day" was at the cinemas here for what, two weeks? Didn't even make the top ten here. When Washington won the Oscar, they brought it back to the cinemas. Luckily I work at a video store, so nothing but 2 hours of my time was wasted in watching this movie4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The script, direction, and acting go from superb to almost over the top at times to make the characters too good, too evil, and too dark. Denzel Washington's performance is much like that. At times, he is a believable bad guy, at others, he's just the type of guy who makes you think if even Hitler had kinder elements to him. It's difficult to tell if that makes the film better or worse. Personally, I don't think it made it better. It made it just a tad bit less believable. But in a way, that is necessary to show the badness of the streets and the ghetto/barrio neighborhoods that Ethan Hawke is left in to fend for himself. There is a deleted scene on the DVD that would have, in my opinion, made Denzel seem more human. I would have liked it in the film and cut some of that "King Kong" monologue near the end to make him a more tragic figure at the end. &gt; 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is Training Day a masterpiece? No. Is it worth watching? Absolutely.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Training Day is not an outstanding film. It is recommended only for those with strong stomachs and no reaction to the constant use of drugs, violence, and four-letter words. I, personally, am bothered by these factors. Why do I say Training Day is worth watching, then? Because Denzel Washington's performance is completely remarkable. I have watched Denzel through the years: through his first great Oscar-winning performance in the civil war classic Glory, his under-rated role in the Pelican Brief, and his acclaimed performance in the historically inaccurate -- yet excellent -- film, The Hurricane. But of all his roles, of all the movies he has performed in, Training Day steals the trophy (quite literally, actually!) Unless you've been living under a rock, you should know that Denzel won the Best Actor Academy Award for this film, making him the first African-American to accomplish this feat since Sydney Poitier (sadly, Morgan Freeman continues to be denied the Best Actor statuette). This great accomplishment is what inclined me to watch the film, and it was just as good (if not better) as I expected. During the first hour, one might wonder whether the sole purpose of the film is to disgust the audience, but towards the end of the movie you realize the point the director has been trying to get across, and it is as follows: no matter how many rewards corruption may bring you, it will eventually destroy you. The chemistry between the two lead actors (the other being Ethan Hawke, who won a Best Supporting Actor nomination for the film) is an accomplishment all by itself. The screenplay is a tad bit iffy, but the fabulous direction makes up for it; and the ending leaves you hanging just enough to keep you thinking (hopefully, the director will not attempt to make a sequel). I do not wish to give you a synopsis of the movie, because it is almost impossible to do so without giving away any of the twists or surprises, so I will just leave it at this: the movie is not great, but Washington's performance is.Overall rating: 8/10</fullReview>

The character type can not be confined to any race or color. One only has to recall the Rodney King episode to remember that had the incident not been caught on camera, it would have been just another case of random police violence covered up.

		<shortDescription>A riveting piece of filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never seen A Beautiful Mind. I'm sure Crowe did a fantastic job acting it. But Washington definitely deserves the Oscar he won for this role. Why? He took on a role that I had never see him try before and gave such a multilayered performance that I was riveted to the screen throughout the entire movie. You never knew exactly what was Alonzo Harris' true motivation in his actions towards Jake Hoyt(Ethan Hawke)until the final act, and it takes superb acting to pull that off with the sincerity and believability that Denzel did. Ethan Hawke does a good turn here also as the rookie cop Hoyt who struggles throughout the movie with the apparent "realities" of narcotics investigation offered up to him by Alonzo. Just how much "dirt" is Hoyt willing to take on without becoming untrue to his ideals?I never judge a movie by how "original" the story is. "Being John Malkovich" was hailed as an "original" story, yet I found it only mildly interesting. If Training Day has been "done" before, I can't recall seeing it. I judge movies by how well they tell the story that they are telling. This one is told quite well. The characters were interesting, the plot moves along quite smoothly, the visuals really portray the gritty, harsh reality of the LA ghetto.All in all, I found this to be a very worthwhile experience and would recommend it to anyone.I gave it an 8/10.P.S.:I wonder if the writers of FX's The Shield watched Training Day before writing the character of Det. Vic Mackey?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Day in the Life....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Denzel Washington won a long over due Oscar for his role of Detective Alonzo Harris in "Training Day". Washington, as is his custom fully buries himself into the role. He becomes Harris. The plot, in a nutshell, has Officer Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) reporting to Harris for a day od on the job training in his undercover narcotics unit. Harris shows Hoyt the seamier side of Los Angeles and attempts to show him the ways of the streets. Director Antoine Fuqua takes us into the ghetto neighborhoods and introduces us to a way of life few outside the "hoods" have experienced. Washington as mentioned is excellent, conveying ticking time bomb type of personality. Hawke, who was nominated for an Oscar for his role, is also outstanding as the "play by the rules" rookie. Rappers Snoop Doggy Dogg as a wheel chair bound drug dealer and Dr. Dre as a member of Harris' team give surprisingly effective performances in their roles. Scott Glenn does a nice turn as a drug dealing friend of Harris. And totally wasted as a member of "The Three Wise Men" is Tom Berenger, who has but one brief scene. "Training Day" has a fair amount of violence and street language, but you will just sit in awe of Washington and Hawke's performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Denzel Washington was SO good in this. Fierce, nasty, and you could question how much of a soul he actually possessed. I could even tolerate Ethan Hawke whom I have always thought of as pretty "light-weight", but in this movie he was able to put some meat into his character. This film is violent and nasty and there aren't a lot of people in the flick that I would consider "good and decent". Several scenes were knife-edged (or gun-barrel) violent, reminiscent of "Reservoir Dogs". At least one "coincidence", as I have seen mentioned in other reviews, was quite annoying. Knowing that Washington's character wasn't aware of this coincidence made me think even less of his character, basically he was watching out for himself, only himself and didn't give a thought to anyone else or their lives. Fascinating, violent and recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whoa!!! PIPE down there DENZEL!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's great about Training Day is that it never goes too far over the top. Judging by some of the comments already posted on this page, there are a lot of people who disagree with me on this one. But I thought the whole movie was nicely restrained, right up until the climax (is this review beginning to read like a write up for a high class porn flick?).Yes, yes, so Denzel Washington spends MOST of THE film TALKING like THIS (!!!!), his eyes continually twinkling with a mixture of mischievousness and raw insanity. But if there's one actor who you don't mind over acting, then it's Denzel. Imagine Al Pacino in the same role - although Al would definitely have looked even more ridiculous than Washington going round calling everyone his "DAWG" and Ethan Hawke his "nigga". Did Washington deserve the Oscar for this film... yeah, kind of... well, no... he just deserved the Oscar that he didn't win for Malcom X.Yet the whole time I was watching Training Day I just knew the final scenes would spoil it. I knew that Hollywood conventions would dictate that the film had to end with Washington and Hawke beating the living be-jaysus out of each other, sustaining several gun shot wounds and facial injuries in the process.Yet the final fight was really well staged, not asking the viewer to really believe that scrawny Ethan Hawke could really batter big buff Denzel. I mean, earlier in the film they asked us to believe that Ethan Hawke (a man whose eyelids look like they're on loan from Droopy Dog) had never schmoked the demon weed before... C'mon.Training Day is an interesting study in nihilism and is largely about, as another user has already commented, how important a set of rigid set of ethics should be to the public servants sent out to protect us. Yet the film never really resolves this issue - Ethan Hawke's character is shown to be deeply principled but largely unable to do his job because of his lack of street savvy and pragmatism, while Washington's Alonzo is shown to be resourceful and charismatic but ultimately careless and evil. So who does the screenwriter think should be patrolling the streets: Ethan? Denzel? Dr Dre (who's actually not as bad as you'd think)?Needless to say, I won't be signing up to join the LAPD just yet...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very realistic taste of L.A.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For someone who lives in L.A., it is easy to overlook the "holes" in the story, including the forced coincidences or the flawed final. There's too much emotion in this daring story to leave room for cool, logical judgment. This created a paradox: the story may be flawed, but still 100% realistic. Welcome to L.A., where the most dangerous killer gang is the police, and where half of the city's officials belong in jail. Both crowds share the same contempt for anything straight, and see the public as enemy.I can fully understand why the authors may have been too carried away by emotion (by their "beef" with the cops and corrupt officials) to analyze their own story in detail. Denzel is one of the nicest, straightest guys you can imagine in real life - and so are most of the others. Yes, even the rap singers. Previous critics said all that needed to be said about this movie, excepting its amazing realism outside the story. That's because most critics live outside Southern California. Planning a visit to L.A.? You don't need it - just rent this movie and save a few bucks for a trip somewhere else. The joke with the snail, in the movie, sums it up. Don't visit L.A. unless you "get it" - otherwise it may be quite a dangerous trip.</fullReview>

I've watched him turn in so many Oscar-caliber performances, then go unrewarded.So, now that the Academy finally decides to recognize his acting prowess they pick the wrong film. Don't get me wrong ... Denzel is great in 'Training Day' ... but he has been better in at least a dozen of his earlier films where he played more complex, meaningful characters.'Training Day' is a routine good cop, bad cop street epic. Exciting? Sure. Packed with action? Indeed. But it didn't deserve mention at the Oscars, let alone any awards. Movies and TV series like this are a dime a dozen.My guess: the Academy finally realized they should have recognized Denzel's work years ago and chose this film simply because it was current and eligible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Denzel and Ethan are indeed excellent in this mostly taut, well paced drama. Denzel's performance as a corrupt cop beautifully rubs against the possibility of excess, but bever crosses the line. Ethan playing an honest cop, looks increasingly bewildered by his unexpected wild ride, but he never loses his footing. Still, Training Day is one of those infuriating movies that could have been much better if the writer and director had trusted the audience more. The movie is seriously undermined by the "motivation" provided for Denzel's corrupt actions on this day, namely, his need to obtain money to pay off the Russian mafia. Denzel's character has already been set up well to have the mixed motivations of ridding the world of major drug figures and, at the same time, enrich himself for the risk he is taking. His complex character, and the tension with Ethan's character, drive the plot. The extra motivation undermines the drama, making it a more standard shoot 'em up. So for most of the film, the tension and drama is high. But the last few scenes undermine the drama.</fullReview>

Punch-ups ensue that never result in any of the protagonists getting seriously hurt and of course the villain leaves our hero alive, James Bond style. Why? Where is the logic? How could a film that carefully constructs a real, gritty world then leap so willingly into the realm of action cliché?

		<fullReview>Its the rookies first day with the specialist street crime squad. He is spending his training day (no complexity in the title) following the leader about on his "average" daily duties. Ethan Hawk plays the new guy who is all dreams and ideals, Denzel Washington plays the hardened street cop who is all realism and street vibes. If he were retiring in a week the cliché would be complete.We learn very early on that the only way to police the street is to become the street. Essentially by being less of a cop, and more like a teacher to the hoods and gangsters. While you may take them out for selling drugs to kids, stealing from the rich to feed you family is ok. Why break up a rape in progress when all you are going to get is a lot of paper work at the end of the day? Slowly Washington removes hawks' ideals, breaking him down to be one of the team. This starts with hawk being tricked into smoking a PCP laced joint, which inevitably leads him on a downwards spiral as things get more and more surreal throughout the day.The story is nothing particularly new. There is the buddy element, the cop turned crook element and the will he/won't he element of doing the right thing. The script has already dictated who should come out on top by navigating your sympathies in the direction of Hawk's plight. Hawk himself carries himself very well in what is essentially a stock role picked from the Hollywood book of stock roles. And if you turned to the next page you would see Denzel Washington's character. Washington was very good in the role, but it was certainly no Oscar performance. This is an average film with above average performances.Wait until the video comes out in Blockbusters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A character driven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Training Day sees Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke at full supremacy, both so brilliantly in command of there roles that they compensate for this action thriller's decorous screenplay and lack of ideas. If this film is about corruption, greed, narcotics and violence, by the end it becomes a one on one show between Washington and Hawke's character. What we care for, what entertains us through out the film is not its conventional themes expressed without conviction, but the squabbles between the two morally distinct characters as they visit the most corrupt places with the most corrupt people on the streets.Ethan Hawke plays Jack Hoyt (in a performance equally as brilliant as Denzel's), a man whose dream is to belong to the elite Narc squad. For him, it is an opportunity to fight true crime, the one that matters, to save the world of drugs. But before he can even dream of belonging to the Narc squad, he's got to pass a test and this film is precisely about that Training Day where Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington) will be his instructor, a day in which Hoyt will see that nothing in the city of Los Angeles is as it seems, and we realise the unsettling boundaries of corruption.Alonzo Harris, in an inspired and over the top performance by Denzel, is a charismatic individual convinced by his own methods. He believes that giving out street justice is what justice is all about, that the enemy is in the streets, outside the law and he has got to be hunted like a wolf hunting another wolf. Alonzo is clearly corrupt and does not go by the law, he is a liar and may be worse than the criminals themselves since he has power and they don't. The contrast between Hoyt, a man who goes by the law but has little experience in enforcing it and a man who doesn't go by the law but has a lot of experience in enforcing it is the movie's key appeal.The film does a good job of reflecting Hoyt's initial and later feeling about Alonzo's actions on us. Firstly we feel that this guy may actually just be a cop trying to fight crime in his own way but there comes a point when we grow to dislike him.The final moments of the film are the weakest point of the film. You see, what happens at Alozno seems collected out of a container since the only clue we are given for the possibility is shown a little past half way in the film. It feels like the director didn't know how to end the film and found a far fetched way during shooting. Having said that, I like the way the director handles the very last scene: it doesn't force any unnecessary action but ends as it should. This is a film worth watching only to see the character conflict.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really wanted to like film more than I eventually did.The film starts off in great fashion with Alfonso's (Washington) character being outlined immediately as an ultra cool narcotics cop with a street reputation and the mean streak required to survive in that type of work, you could not help but warm to his character's style and grace.Hawke plays an understated role as a rookie narc cop undergoing a trial day on the job to see if he can hack it on the mean streets.The plot lets the film down for me. About half way into the film the point seems to get lost somewhere and I was left feeling as if a massive opportunity to make a good film into a great one had passed.Washington is excellent none the less bringing humility, profanity and plenty of guts to his performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Training Day is one of the few movies these days that stand out. Denzel Washington acted very well, doing his job by making his character difficult by the viewer whether he is just a good cop bending the rules, or a crazy cop that should be locked up. Ethan Hawke also did a great job playing a character that is a kind-hearted person who knows right from wrong. This is a dark movie that will leave you guessing, and will leave you on the edge of your seat. This isn't a fantasy movie that seems too unrealistic, but a true to life movie that is as real as it can get. Plus, you get to see some fine acting by snoop dogg and others. This movie is a must-see, and Washington earned that academy award.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jake Hoyt wants desperately to become a narcotics agent toclean up the streets of Los Angeles. He will have to siphon out thegood from the bad as he embarks on his training day. He literallyhas twenty four hours to prove to Alonzo, a veteran narcotics agent,that he is worthy. As the day proceeds, he is faced with ethicaldilemmas on whether or not the methods of Alonzo's law enforcementare legitimate. Through all this madness and corruption, the verygreen and na?ve Jake must decide for himself who the real bad guysare.The manner in which the tension elevates through-out themovie is remarkable. Alonzo builds this tension with his crookedways. He is definitely not what he appears to be. Deceit is a powerfulconcept for some to grasp. Jake's willingness to do anything for theopportunity to make detective, leaves him in a very vulnerableposition. He is the unfortunate, in the midst of all Alonzo's streetjustice. Street justice used as an attempt to save his own hide.Long time good guy portrays the one minute brutal and the nextcharming role beautifully. Along with Denzel's acting ability, thedirector, Antoine Fuqua, does a terrific job in most aspects of themovie. For example, the way the story unfolds. T times the actionstops and the sun quickly moves through the sky. A subtle but uniqueway of showing the time frame in relation to the title. Also, Alonzo'screw meets with him on top of a building to plot out a shake down. Could it symbolize that they(the agents) think of themselves as ahigher power or untouchable?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Spoilers!* A lot has been said about how this film paints a bad picture of the LAPD, or how it depicts the worst aspects of humanity: betrayal, treachery, greed,etc. However, though it places its tale within a realistically urban environment, TRAINING DAY is actually a clever tale of how Washington's character sets up his scheme to get the money to pay off a p*ssed-off Russian gangster. THAT IS THE STORY. For the most part, the story works well, with good-guy trainee Hawke finding himself in ever-more compromising positions as Washington builds up to his money-acquiring caper.The only weak part of the plot occurs when Hawke is saved (during a lethal poker game) due to the most far-fetched example of good fortune/coincidence seen in a movie for a long time. Maybe reviewers try to get more out of this movie than is actually there because Washington got an Oscar for his role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Action Movie, an Above Average Action Movie, but Nothing More</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Denzel Washington as the crooked cop to lead all crooked cops and Ethan Hawke as the rookie assigned to him makes for a very good and intense action film. As the personalities clash we see that Denzel Washington is an evil dude without a redeeming quality. The movie is an interesting adventure through the bad parts of LA.The personality clash is incredible to say the least as we see the idealistic Ethan Hawke definitely at conflict with the crooked Denzel Washington. The movie has some very good moments and two very good performances from the leads and nice appearances from many character actors, like Macy Gray, Tom Berenger and a number of others you really don't expect. But the movie does not really say anything, there is no real socially conscious message it is just an action movie. Therefore in a decent role, but definitely not in an Oscar-worthy performance Denzel Washington did not deserve an Oscar for this part. He plays a crooked cop the best that he can in a movie that is really not meant to have any great roles.In fact Denzel Washington plays a stereotype of what many people in the media portray African-Americans today. With so many other straight action movies and far better performances this year (including a non-nominated performance by Billy Bob Thornton in Monster's Ball) I don't think Washington deserved his Oscar.The movie does get intense as we see a very driven and disgusting man get the best of Ethan Hawke and everyone else in the movie. Watching Washington's psychological game is quite incredible, and definitely one of the highlights of the movie. The finale is very good, but a little on the predictable and unbelievable side. Perhaps I have seen too many movies, but watching an injured Ethan Hawke jump from roofs, fall down, and get beat up the way he did definitely took away what little believability the finale had. This is a good solid fun movie and I definitely recommend it. Ethan Hawke really has nothing to add to the movie and definitely the first hour is the best of the film, it drags a little after that in places, with spots that turn out to be rally good. Watch it, but despite the fact that the stupid Oscars are really giving awards to the wrong people, don't really expect an Oscar-worthy movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This isn't a film about the moral amiguities of a modern plain clothes cop, or the blurring of the line between right and wrong. Denzel's character marches over the line with such incredible abandon that from early on in the film all sense of realism is lost. Ethan Hawke does a pretty good job of playing the rookie dazed by the events of his Training Day, but even he can't rescue this script. I'm surprised that Denzel got an oscar for this because his portrayal is so over the top, although I can't say he doesn't deserve it for his overall body of work. This film does ask some serious questions, but in such a loaded way that the answer is never really in any doubt. The ending is just laughable, but at least its the ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting and gripping cop movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people on this site really don't like this film, and I find it hard to see why. Is it because of the controversy around Washington's Oscar glory? This film is one of the best cop movies since 'Heat'. Gripping, exciting, and violent. Quite superb in parts.Hawke plays a 'rookie' cop, (and I use that term lightly) who is being trained by Washington to work the drug filled streets of LA. What Hawke is exposed to is the highly corrupt world that is LA's (and even America's) police force. The story concentrates on how Hawke deals with it - a coming-of-age, writes-of-passage drama in one sense, in which Hawke's innocence is lost. There is only a thin red line between the police and the bad guy - a simple police badge. Hawke's character remains a glimmer of hope for the system. All the performances are superb. Washington at times is chilling, Hawke is brilliant as a terrified cop who grows stronger throughout the film. See this film, it is not difficult to see why Washington got the oscar, but I think that Will Smith should have got it for 'Ali' instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Washington Makes It Worthwhile</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A brutal and disturbing film that attempts to connect you with the underbelly of the streets of downtown Los Angeles, while examining that fragile, thin line between those who enforce the law and those who break it, `Training Day,' directed by Antoine Fuqua, is a cautionary morality tale that decidedly points out that what you do and who you are is a matter of free will and personal choice. Beyond the action, it's a study of human nature that explores the necessity of having a moral code by which to live, especially when confronted with that age-old seductress Evil, who can lure even the best of the best across that line from which there is no return. The most disconcerting aspect of the film, however, is in it's portrayal of those in high places who with facility betray those they are sworn to serve and protect, with their flagrant abuse of their position and power, and moreover, seemingly always manage to hold the high ground of advantage over those against whom their misdeeds are perpetrated. Indeed, the burden of proof must always fall to the good guy, and more often than not it is those endowed with a more positive, benevolent nature-- the ones who want to do the right thing-- that find justice elusive and become victims themselves, if only because of their refusal to compromise their own principles. And that is really what is at the heart of Fuqua's film, which very probably will take many viewers to a place they would rather not be. But, as Steve McQueen said in `Bullitt,' when asked by his girlfriend how he can stand doing a job that keeps him so close to the gutter, `That's where half of it is--' And in today's world, unfortunately, it may well be that the percentage is even higher; which somewhat elevates the significance of this film. Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke), a nineteen month veteran of the L.A.P.D., is about to begin his first day on a new assignment, having landed a spot in the Narcotics Division, where he will be a member of a small squad under the direction of Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington)-- if he measures up to Alonzo's stringent expectations. It's a job he wants, because he sees it as an opportunity to really do some good in the community; it's a place from which he can help rid the streets of drug dealers and other felons. But he quickly discovers that-- as most worthwhile things are in life-- it's just not that easy. As Alonzo is quick to point out, `If you want to protect the sheep from the wolf, you have to become a wolf. It's the wolf that catches the wolf--' Jake also learns that on this day he's going to have to make a lot of decisions, and make them quickly, without the luxury of time to consider all of the possible ramifications. And one of them is put to him directly by Alonzo, who tells him he's going to have to decide what he wants to be, a sheep-- or a wolf. It's something he's going to have to know by the end of the day; and Jake doesn't know it going in, but this day, his `Training Day,' is going to be a day that will change his life forever. Fuqua's film is presented honestly and in such a way that it successfully puts the viewer on the streets of L.A., and Jake and Alonzo are credible characters; but the motivation behind Alonzo's ruthlessness is fairly anemic and under-developed. The weakness of the film, in fact, lies in the screenplay (by David Ayer), which though it captures a certain sense of `street-wise' reality, is otherwise rather formulaic and doesn't really have the depth it needs to make it emotionally involving. And one of the biggest flaws, especially in light of the fact that this story is presented in `realistic' terms, is that a key element of the plot hinges on a coincidence that Vegas odds-makers would love to put some big money on. Fuqua visits much of the same territory as Dennis Hopper's 1988 film, `Colors,' though the final message is quite different, inasmuch as the focus of this film is on the `bad cop' angle. As stated previously, there is some significance to this one, but it takes some work and imagination on the part of the viewer to discern. As Alonzo, Denzel Washington gives an excellent performance-- and, quite frankly, this film would be less than average without him-- but whether or not it is deserving of an Oscar is open to speculation. Washington is one of the finest actors in the business, without question, and he's taken on some challenging roles (in which he's been very successful) that make this part pale by comparison. Alonzo Harris is more along the lines of Mel Gibson's Riggs in `Lethal Weapon,' or Eastwood's Harry in `Dirty Harry,' the difference being that Alonzo is the bad guy. It's a credit to Washington's ability that he was able to make this such a strong character, however, and his Alonzo is certainly believable and real. And, in retrospect, perhaps it is an Oscar-worthy performance; it had to be to overcome the weakness of the script and what he was given to work with. And, again, without Denzel Washington, this film plays for two weeks in the theater and is quickly forgotten when it hits the video store shelf. Hawke gives a strong performance, as well, but that he received an Oscar nomination for it is the stuff of which debates are born. Like Washington, however, Hawke does do a good job of bringing his character to life, and it is one of the strengths of the film. The supporting cast includes Tom Berenger (Stan), Harris Yulin (Doug) and Scott Glenn (Roger). In the final analysis, `Training Day' is elevated by the performances of it's stars; without them, this one has no legs. 6/10.    </fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsThere isn't much of a cast to Training Day.It's mostly just Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke driving around in a car.But in crafting just these main two characters,it has constructed quite probably the best film to come out in the last 18 months,and which deserves to win oscars.It paints an unflinching,uncompromising account of life on the mean streets of LA,rampant with rapists,graffiti,gang members and mostly drug dealers.Hawke is certainly very impressive as the naive rookie cop,but the real star of the show is undoubtedly Washington,who delivers a breath-taking performance as the experienced,hardened police veteran who's just seen too much injustice in his career and has been pushed right over the edge.In between all this fantastic writing,directing and acting,there is also some brilliant action sequences (especially at the end)not to mention a thoroughly emersing hip-hop soundtrack.It really is hard to think of a single fault here,this is simply excellent.Cancel all other arrangements and see it.*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS"Training Day" opens strong. Here you had Jake, a guy who finds himself in this terrible situation. He wants to make detective and work narcotics, so he must spend a day in the field getting some ?real world' training with a hardened LAPD legend. You see this big brother/little brother dynamic develop between the two. Jake wants to impress this guy more than anything, but soon realizes he's in for more than he ever imagined.Who was it that said, the audience doesn't want to see the second worst day of a guy's life? Well, what a day this ends up being for Jake Hoyt. Ethan Hawke gives this great multi-leveled performance. There's two main things he needs to accomplish: be scared of Alonzo and hide that fear from Alonzo. ?It's just one day,' he must be thinking to himself, ?I can get through this.'The film does not build on this promise, but ends up being an unintentional sermon. I never like to feel like I'm being preached to while watching a film. "Training Day" claims to know the answers to the questions it poses. Films shouldn't do that. Make the audience think but let them make up their own minds.The cause of this problem is the character of Alonzo Harris. I was disappointed that this guy ended up really being bad. This is a case of a plot twist gone wrong. While it's admirable that Denzel didn't demand that the writers change the story so his character seems more heroic, the way many stars have, I almost wished they'd gone that route, if only just a little.We're never given a reason to feel sympathetic toward Alonzo. First we think he's a jerk. Then we find out he's really an evil person. The plot features this double fake-out that starts with him going psycho on a couple of would-be rapists. At this point you're thinking, they're messing with our heads. Soon we're going to see that Alonzo isn't such a bad guy. But the story just keeps pouring it on: Evil, evil, evil. This translated into boring, boring, boring.By the time the film got to the business with the three wise men and Alonzo's 'posse,' followed by the revelation that Jake's been set up the entire time, I was no longer involved. I was no longer relating to Jake's character but was just along for the ride, merely curious about what happened next.The card game scene is great and could have saved this film's behind. It's ruined by a coincidence that asks more from the audience's suspension of disbelief than it should. I mean, his cousin? Out of how many millions of people in Los Angeles? Is that supposed to be ironic? It's not even the coincidence that bugs me the most; it's that the scene it's meant to be the payoff of, the scene that had been the most interesting and intense in the film, ends with a big thud."Training Day" is another one of those films I wish had taken a different course. At the beginning you're thinking it's going to be about this wide-eyed rookie learning the hard lessons of the 'real' world. But not long into the story it becomes apparent that the film isn't based on any reality at all. It becomes this typical cop thriller with corrupt cops and evil Russian mafia guys. Isn't there enough moral tests in the real struggles of an undercover narcotics officer that they could have built a story around? It's as if no one involved in the film knew anything about narcotics investigation, so they had to resort to this theoretical crap that's straight out of "Tango and Cash."Grade: C</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Denzel's Definitely Different</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A departure from being the normal good guy made this Denzel Washington movie a bit different.....and unpopular with a lot of his fans. I found it a very intense story of two Los Angeles cops: one being a veteran corrupt one "Alonzo" (Washington) and the other a rookie, honest one "Jake" (Ethan Hawke). This is a bit sordid at times, with over 100 f-words, but was almost mesmerizing at times and hard to put down once the film started. At least that was the case on the first viewing. On the second, I didn't find the whole thing that appealing.I don't know if this is a realistic look at the crime areas of Los Angeles, but if it is, wow: pretty frightening. Washington's viewpoints, however twisted with this particular character, made some sense in parts, sad to say. Overall, not a pleasant film but certainly an interesting one.</fullReview>

Alonzo doesn't conform to the norm however to get results and Jake is pushed into doing things that he is very uncomfortable with. The more he does the harder it is to turn back and he becomes embroiled in Alonzo's schemes. A very good movie with fine performances from both the leads. Washington won an oscar for this and whilst it's arguable whether that was deserved he certainly puts in a fine turn. It's to Hawke's credit that he is not totally overshadowed. 8/10</fullReview>

You know a cop movie will be quite different when in the first 30 minutes a cop is smoking dope (laced with PCP), though it isn't quite simple how it got to that anyway. As is much of the movie, which never takes the easy way out of scenes (outside of a unreal ending) and stays in it's region quite well. Sometimes it seems like we've seen this before, but Washington is so convincing as a villain type, which he usually avoids, that the film is overall quite entertaining and worthwhile. Hawke is also noteworthy as the rookie whose life and perspective of what he once thought of (the LAPD) will change. Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and Macy Gray co-star. A-</fullReview>

This is not a knock on Denzel. I think he is a great actor and quite capable of winning a Best Actor Oscar in even better years. But this role was not the equal of many others which have won Best Actor Oscars. It may not even be his best one. All in all, rent this movie. It is pretty good, especially if you like cop movies.

Denzel plays a character so manipulative and so desperately evil, you'll forget that he is actually one of the "good guys". Sure, Denzel's character (Alonzo) has worked himself into a bind, and time is running out for him, so he has to act quickly and cunningly. It's easy to imagine Alonzo as a good guy before this, but as a good cop gone bad, he nails this performance. His best work ever, and Tony Scott's best ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Denzel Washington's Oscar winning performance made me want to see this movie, or otherwise I would have never ever watched this movie because normally I don't watch "ghetto, gangster, set in present day, with rappers in it, movies" like this. But the movie turned out to be way better than expected and it's arguably one of the best movie of 2001.The movie has an amazing pace that covers one of the days in the life of rookie narcotic officer Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) and rouge LAPD veteran Harris (Denzel Washington) on their first (and only?) day together on the job. The movie gets nowhere boring or slow and has tons of surprising plot twist that make the story very interesting and even tense multiple times throughout the movie.The power of the movie is in Denzel Washington's Oscar worthy performance and the chemistry between the two main characters. Denzel Washington is perfect as "bad guy" and delivers his lines in a most amazing way. His lines sometimes seem to come straight out of a Quentin Tarantino movie. Also notable is Scott Glenn in his role as a rotten old drugs lord.The atmosphere and style of the movie feels very realistic mainly thanks to the cinematography, nice fast editing, script and the performance's by the cast.Way better than you would expect it to be, give it a chance!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good Cop flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In all honesty, I have to admit that I went in to see Training Day at the Toronto Film Festival with somewhat less than stellar expectations. When I walked out I was impressed with what turned out to be a well written, well directed and incredibly well acted L.A. cop thriller. The story focuses on Ethan Hawke's character, a lowly cop being promoted to a narc who goes out on a day of training with an unconventional undercover veteran played by Denzel Washington. I won't say too much more about the plot but I must say that both actors play their roles very well; Hawke is very subdued while Washington is completely over the top. The movie moves at a satisfyingly quick pace and keeps you hooked right until the very end. The film does have its flaws but for a film of its genre they are so few and far between that you barely notice them. If you're looking for a fun way to spend two hours without having to think too hard then go out and see Training Day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, this is a fairly typical film, but the strength of Denzel Washington's performance lifts it far above the average story and shooting style. Basically an update of every cop show from the 70's, it offers no surprises in any area except Denzel Washington's performance, which is stellar. Ethan Hawke tries very hard with the unbearable "innocent young believer" role, but ultimately can't overcome the weakness of the script or stand up to the power of Denzel Washington, who should make a career of playing villains.Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hardcore entertainment and blatant stupidity...that's Hollywood.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "Training Day", a bloated Hollywood action/drama, Hawke rides along with street narc Washington on his first day of on the job training as an undercover narcotics officer. The film tries to represent the tug of war between right and wrong in law enforcement on the mean streets of L.A. In spite of solid production value, the flick fails miserably to deliver a compelling story as it wears on and finally wears out with numbing excesses. An obvious fabrication full of characters who are marching to the beat of a director's crop, "Training Day" has nothing to do with law enforcement and everything to do with Hollywood's exploitation of you and me. Nominal entertainment for those into crime flix.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Denzel Washington won his Best Actor Oscar for this film and I am one of (seemingly) many who feel he did not deserve it - for this particular movie. Washington is one of my favorite actors but it seems he deserved it more for other projects - the Academy was in it for the politics that year, as far as I'm concerned. Denzel actually gave a better performance in 2004's "Man on Fire," but of course that's just my opinion."Training Day" follows the path of "Bad Lieutenant" studying police corruption, but it is really using this as an analogy for the corruption of humanity itself - Jake (Ethan Hawke) is a good straight, honest cop who is slowly but surely twisted by his bad influence (Washington), the sadistic corrupt cop.This is not a great movie but it is a good one, with solid performances. That all said, I don't think it was Oscar-worthy and I do believe Washington has given far better performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>gritty stuff but oscar caliber?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actors seem to enjoy playing "bad" people and Denzel is so bad here, he becomes a caricature: a slick mix of all those power hungry LA cops you hear about too much in the news. His performance is riveting, he's a scumbag yes, but who would want to watch this more than once? Ethan Hawke's role was the tougher of the 2 leads, I felt, because he had to play a person who is all too rare in Hollywood these days: someone with a strong moral center. We feel all his pain and disgust and finally his anger, and we root for him, even with the cliched script. Hawke deserved his supporting nomination since he truly went thru an emotional gamut from beginning to end. Denzel pretty much stayed the same: remaining a scurvy villain in every scene, even if, one is apt to say, his job created his behavior as much as his own greed did. Feeling powerless to change society, he in turn becomes just as warped and destroyed as the people he's trying to put away. Too bad the screenplay takes the issue of powerlessness and turns it into an action picture. This could have been real compelling with a more careful writer. Instead we get Denzel as evil cartoon and an Oscar to show much Hollywood loves evil cartoons. Harvey Kietel excelled with more complexity in the Bad Lieutenant some years before in the 90's, with complicated religious overtones thrown into the mix to make a riveting but overlooked film experience that was hardly given a chance at the box office. See that for a more realistic look at corruption and authority and view Training Day one time to debate why Denzel has the gold statue and Kietel does not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hang on to what you've got and check to see if it is there later. This pressure cooker is about to blow. Almost as different as night and day. Denzel Washington is a renegade undercover cop that blurs the line separating good from bad when he teaches a young officer(Ethan Hawke)how to survive the streets on his first day of training as a narcotics cop. Excessive violence seems to be order of the day. Compelling and solid story. Also in the cast are: Dr. Dre, Scott Glenn, Snoop Dogg and Eva Mendes. Two hours well spent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pretty standard cop thriller is livened up by a good (if not Oscar-worthy) performance from Washington</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After making his application to join a special unit within the LAPD, Officer Jake Hoyt is assigned to his new boss, Alonzo Harris for a training day on the job. Harris immediately shows Hoyt a way of work that is foreign to him ? making him smoke drugs and drink at the very start of his shift. From this point onwards, Hoyt is taken on an eye opening training day that forces him to depart from his professional ethics and try to understand how things are done on the street. But is Harris really working for justice his own way or is he working for himself ? and how far will Hoyt sink before he cannot justify it anymore?When this film came out I wanted to see it as a thriller; after the Oscar for Washington I wanted to see it for another reason and eventually got round to seeing it on video. The plot starts on familiar territory and pretty much continues along the same road for the whole film ? it is never really more than an average cop thriller but it still manages to be quite enjoyable. The film sticks to the 'ends justify the means' plot device for the first half but then pull back to reveal a wider plot that is more of a standard thriller. In the first half this is all stuff we have seen before and it sort of works but not as well as things like The Shield etc ? Alonzo is too out there to manage to make me be for him and against him; unlike the Shield where you are constantly being challenged by Mackey. The second half is more dramatic and, although a bit forced, is necessary to bring the film round to a dramatic conclusion.The Oscar for Denzel was not deserved in my opinion. Having now seen his performance I will acknowledge that he is a big part of this film working but he is not Oscar worthy here. Actually his performance is just par for the course for this type of film ? yes he is a bit of a powerhouse and his tough delivery really makes the film move but it is hardly worthy of being called the best performance of the year even if it is really effective within the context of the film. Hawke is pretty good but obviously plays second fiddle to Washington's scene stealing performance; he is wide eyed as required and he serves well as our entry into Alonzo's world. The support cast features quite a few well known faces but mostly they are underused and play slightly worn ethnic clichés full of tattoos and 'mo-fo' dialogue ? Macy Gray, Dre and Snoop represent the rap community while Mendes shows ass and Glenn, Yulin, Barry and Greene add recognisable faces if nothing else.Overall this is an enjoyable but standard cop thriller that has gotten better reviews than it perhaps deserves. Although he doesn't not deserve his Oscar for this, Washington's performance still drives the film and is fun nonetheless and certainly livens up what is, for all it's stars and it's publicity, is still a standard cop thriller with bells on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So What Was His Second Day on the Job Like?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Denzel Washington earned his Best Actor Oscar in 'Training Day' portraying a veteran LAPD narcotics officer who has become every bit as hard, amoral and corrupt as the mean city streets he patrols. We've seen plenty of 'bad apple' cops in movies before, but rarely one as chillingly complex as Alonzo Harris, a man who long ago abandoned any of the crime-fighting idealism that led him to the job in the first place. Harris has learned that to deal with bad people one has to become bad oneself, and he has no compunction against going outside the law if that is the only way to get what he wants. For while he may piously declare that he is only beating the lowlifes at their own game - employing their tools, using their methods - the truth is that Harris has simply sold his soul to the same self-centered greed that motivates the criminals he is supposedly after.Writer David Ayer provides Harris with the perfect foil for him to go up against in the form of Jake Hoyt, a rookie cop who has been assigned to be the veteran's partner. Feeling that he is finally going to be able to fulfill his lifelong dream of helping to make the world a better place, Jake is in for a very rude awakening once he comes up against the hardboiled cynicism of this more-than-he-bargained-for partner. Filled with the understandable jitters and self-doubt that come with the first day on the job, Jake quickly comes to see that there is something not quite right with Harris, who spends much of the day breaking laws, flauting procedures and even threatening Jake's life if he doesn't go along with the many nefarious plans and schemes he has up his sleeves. Of course, Harris attempts to seduce Jake over to his way of thinking by arguing that such 'unconventional' actions are required to circumvent a legal system that hamstrings officers with its bureaucratic rules and obsession with civil rights violations. Or is this just a convenient excuse for Harris to justify his lawbreaking? The film is, in many ways, more interesting as a study of Jake's character than of Harris', as we wonder if Jake will come to accept Harris' seasoned viewpoint or somehow see through it and remain true to his ideals.'Training Day' is filled with scenes of great dramatic intensity, often times based on some legitimate moral dilemma that Jake finds himself confronting. The mercurial nature of Harris' behavior keeps us as bewildered and off guard as it does Jake, for like him, we really don't know what exactly Harris wants or where he is coming from. Such moral ambiguity is a sign of powerful storytelling and Ayer deserves a great deal of credit for bringing some depth to an overworked genre. However, at times the film feels a bit forced and strains credibility just when we most need to believe in its truthfulness. This is particularly the case in a scene in which Jake is about to be blown away in a bathtub and receives a last minute reprieve in the form of a coincidence too preposterous to be even slightly believable. Moreover, some of Harris' actions - though valid for the point that the film is trying to make perhaps - seem highly unlikely in the real world. The overall effect of them is to throw the audience out of the movie just when we are most eager to go where we feel it is taking us. However, these are minor quibbles about a film that works so well for so much of the time.As this is the film that won Washington his Academy Award, we must not fail to mention the superb performances delivered by both him and Ethan Hawke as Jake. Washington, generally relegated to 'good guy' roles, proves himself a deft villain in this case, displaying the many intricate coils of his seething, cobra-like character. In many ways, though, Hawke does the more impressive job, partly because he has been given the less flamboyant role of passive observer. Washington gets to hit all the dramatic heights, yet, it is through Jake's eyes that the audience gets to observe this lethal individual and Hawke provides the understated richness that brings this everyman character to life. As Jake gets more and more intricately ensnared and embroiled in Harris' immoral actions, we can't help but identify with the ethical plight being thrust on this man who just wants to do what he knows ? or thinks he knows ? is right. These two fine actors provide the explosive, symbiotic partnership that brings the screenplay to vivid life.Director Antoine Fuqua makes each moment count dramatically, whether it be a tense confrontation between Harris and Jake over an issue of great moral consequence or a subtle moment of quiet reflection as Jake contemplates his next move. Despite the fact that the film seems to strain a bit at the edges (one wonders what Jake's SECOND day on the job will be like), 'Training Day' provides more food for thought than your average cop buddy movie ? and much, much finer acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Training Day is Denzel Washington's Oscar winning performance. Ethan Hawke co-stars as a naive rookie cop who on his first day on the job undercover, ie: his Training Day, is assigned to a street wise and hardened veteran played by Washington.There is nothing remarkable here outside of Washington's performance. The range of this actor and his ability to change his character portrayals is no doubt why he is so much in demand. You would be hard pressed to find two more diverse performances than those he has recently given as the decent, hard working family man John Q and his portrayal of a rogue cop in Training Day.There are a few good, solid cameo performances here, ostensibly by Scott Glenn. Harris Yulin plays yet another bad guy role but I must admit that I have always found him totally compelling on screen. Tom Berenger on the other hand is wasted in his bit part. He is an actor who truly has become type cast.Training Day is a gritty, violent &amp; foul-mouthed movie which makes anyone who does not live in an inner city forever thankful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Training Day is a tense and powerful drama but that would have been a complete turd without amazing performances from Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke. Well the academy award and nominations for those are often noted what is often over looked is the great performers by musicians in the film like Dr. Dre and Macy Grey who play small but memorable cameo's.The action and the suspense. Are well put together and timed. The action is Brutal but not nearly as tough as the language and ideas that are throw around by Denzil's crooked cop. Ethan Hawke looks outplace where he needs to and frightened out of his wits at times. If you put yourself in his shoes you will too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Training Day suprised me in the fact I didn't think it would be up to much. But it does deliver on certain levels. Denzel Washington is excellent as he hams it up in his role that could have been spat out from a generate an Oscar computer program. He does enough to make you dislike him but also understand his view on the world. Ethan Hawke also cuts it as the green new recruit. The supporting cast are a mixed bag while you have Dr Dre who should defintely stick to music producing. Cliff Curtis is excellent in arguably the most gripping scene in the movie. I did enjoy it , but I couldn't help feeling that the films finale was not how the writer had intended and in what seems like the final confrontation with the main chracters isn't and then another scene has been tacked on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Training Day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the main reason I wanted to see this film was because of a great star winning the Oscar, and then I heard that the villain he plays is a cop. Basically Jake Hoyt (Oscar nominated Ethan Hawke) wants to become a professional LAPD narcotics cop, i.e. stop drug trafficking, and he is teamed up with veteran, swaggering and streetwise narcotics cop Alonzo Harris (Oscar winning, and Golden Globe nominated Denzel Washington) for 24 hours to learn and prove his mettle. But as they are searching and investigating the big drug case, along the way they clear the streets of other (possibly drug related) crimes, and Jake is finding it very difficult to cope with Alonzo's questionable and very rough techniques, particularly when the guilty should go to prison. As the film continues, you see what a genuine scum Alonzo really is, and why he does not deserve to be a cop, and he and Jake do eventually turn on each other in the concluding scenes. Alonzo does meet an unexpected death, being killed by thugs (most likely the ones he insulted). It is a dark, pretty engaging and very stylised look at American law enforcement. Also starring Scott Glenn as Roger, Tom Berenger as Stan Gursky, Harris Yulin as Doug Rosselli, Raymond J. Barry as Lou Jacobs, Cliff Curtis as Smiley, and hip hop stars Dr. Dre as Paul, Snoop Dogg as Blue and Macy Gray as Sandman's Wife. Denzel Washington was number 28 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 40 on The World's Greatest Actor, and Alonzo Harris was number 50 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes &amp; Villains. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jake Hoyt teams up with Alonzo Harris . Hoyt is a newbie plains clothes undercover cop while Harris has been in the job for years and both men are chalk and cheese where personality is concerned . We`ve seen this sort of scenario umpteen times in other buddy movies , only thing is this usually only happens in comedy dramas and if you`re tuning into TRAINING DAY for some light hearted laughs you`re going to be very disappointed!!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!!! TRAINING DAY is a grim gritty hard hitting drama , the sort of movie Hollywood rarely makes these days with the first half being a very compelling intelligent movie that really holds your attention . Unfortunately about half way through there`s a slightly ridiculous plot twist that threatens to sink the whole movie and had me begging the question " Why on earth would Harris and his corrupt buddies invite Hoyt along to do a job with them " ? I mean Harris has only known his partner for a few hours at the most while the other cops don`t know him at all so why would they trust Hoyt to keep his mouth shut ? I guess that`s to show how evil Harris is and how morally upstanding Hoyt is at the climax , another bit I found faintly ridiculous . I mean if you`re a home boy would you side with a corrupt black cop who`d let you walk away from a crime if the price was right or would you side with an untouchable white cop who will see justice done at any price ? Yeah that`s what I thought too . I don`t want anyone picking me up wrong thinking I hate this film because I don`t , it`s very well acted by all the cast and even after the plot twist halfway through it still held my attention , especially when Hoyt is in the latinos` house . It`s just that it seemed the studio decided to treat the audience as fools at the last moment which is a common fault with Hollywood movies for the last few years . I was going to give TRAINING DAY 9 out of ten up untill the halfway point , so overall the movie gets 7 out of 10Seeing as everyone else has brought up the subject of who deserved the oscar I will say some days I think Washington deserved it while some days I think Crowe deserved it , but 2001 wasn`t a vintage year for performances and if the Oscar voters had put Jim Broadbent in the best actor category he would have deserved to have won it for IRIS</fullReview>
