		<shortDescription>Very tough viewing, but worth it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is an exceptional, very challenging and thought-provoking piece of work. Viewing it, as I did, at a morning showing on opening day, however, is not to be recommended. Having said that, I am not sure when the optimum time for seeing this film would actually be.There is a lot of very uncomfortable viewing here. The subject matter - such as it is - is very bleak, but, paradoxically, more life-affirming than depressing. That is to say, I looked at the majority of the characters on screen and thought: please don't let me end up like that.The plot is thin - that is not meant pejoratively, it's not a plot-driven film - but the performances of the cast simply roar off the screen. Peter Mullan and Eddie Marsan are fantastic, but then again, they always are (as an aside, does Marsan not tire of playing scumbags?), but the real revelation in this film is the performance of Olivia Colman.She is perfect in this, absolutely note-perfect; incredible acting. Awesome in her delivery. So good, in fact, that you forget this is just a movie. Her performance here is definitely going to propel her into the upper echelons of British acting - if she is not already there.Tyrannosaur is not faultless, there are some scenes that linger too long and others that linger not long enough, but for an early effort from Considine this promises much for the future. This is Considine's 'Taxi Driver' and I will queue around the block for Considine's 'Goodfellas'.Superb writing and gritty direction; performances better yet and Colman delivers on every level. Bravo Ms Colman, and bravo to everyone else associated with the best British film of the decade.See it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will keep this simple.It has been quite a while since a movie has shook me to my very core, rattled my sense of security, and left me deeply scarred when I got out of the theater.Tyrannosaur for me personally is one of the best movies of the year. The year's not over, and it may as well hold a top 3 spot on my list until the end.First and foremost, the acting in this movie was outstanding. Mullan, Colman was incredible as the two forces that move the movie. Marsan was genuinely terrifying. These three people should be considered for Oscars when the time comes.There were a few moments where I almost...almost turned my head away, and not many movies can claim the privilege of making me squirm and feel uneasy (Not even the fairly recent "A Serbian Film").I guess the strongest strength of this movie was the uncanny sense of realism. I've spent enough time learning and observing just what emotions and bursts of rage can do to people. And every bit of rage and anger in this movie seemed all too real. I'm sure some will counter me on this, but for me, I didn't consider any actions, reactions in this movie to be over-the-top. They flowed seamlessly, taking us to bleak, dark places, sprinkling a bit of hope and light along the way, only for us to be shocked again. By god, it was VERY suspenseful in some parts.In the end, a few hours after getting out of the screening, I'm still reeling trying to find my composure. No, it's not an easy movie to watch, and yes, some will probably dismiss it as an unnecessary glorification of domestic violence and brutality. But for me it's more than that, it has soul, one that's not easy to capture with a subject as difficult as this, but Considine certainly managed to do just that.Watch it if you get a chance.9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film knocked me for six. Stunning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2011 hasn't been a great year for movies. In fact I'm struggling to think of a film that has blown me away but just as you start lose faith a film comes along that knocks you bandy. Tyrannosaur is that film.This is a grim film. Grim in every way but where there is despair there is always a chink of light and Tyrannosaur is all about that little chink of light.Joseph is an angry man . A very angry man. A man who's life is not good. When he's life is at it's worst he accidentally comes across a good Samaritan in Hannah who see's the good in people yet in reality is having a far worse time than Joseph.I have to say that the performance of Olivia Colman has to be the best i have seen by any actor this year. A quite stunning portrayal of a battered woman who has nothing good in her life yet always has a smile for someone. Peter Mullan is fantastic also and it goes without saying that Eddie Marsden is brilliant.Writer and director Paddy Constantine should be proud of what he has done here and i cant recommend this film highly enough and if this does not pick up awards in the new year then there is no justice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is the real England....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing "Tyrannosaur" is an experiment of life: the reality described is not so different from the everyday life of many of us.Mr. Considine is able to realise, thanks to a perfect script and superb actors, a small masterpiece and a perfect debut.The story set in a Leeds of charity shops and pubs, tells the anger, frustration, domestic violence, so common in this early-century England.Over time we learn that the request for aid between the main characters becomes mutual, up to a finale as unexpected as disturbing.Well done to everyone, but honour to Peter Mullan about holding the entire film with a surprising force and fragility.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Violent, bleak, transformational brilliance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paddy Considine's directorial debut has been a widely anticipated event. With his excellent performances throughout his British cinematic career, most notably his work with Shane Meadows, a dark, churning piece of cinema was what we have been expecting. We have not been let down. Tyrannosaur is as gritty as it is gripping. The setting in a Northern industrial, working class community ? the estates of Leeds, creates the imprisoned physical environment for Joseph (Peter Mullen) an alcoholic, self-loathing widower who meets a Christian charity worker (Olivia Coleman) and we are drawn into their troublesome worlds. The films workings of violence and desperation draws another influence to my mind, which is Gary Oldman's directorial debut 'Nil by Mouth'. Both are lavished in gritty, deglamorised violence. Both have a tendency to stare the darkness in the eye, unlike some audience members (including myself) that will have an undeniable urge to look away. It's a representation of life on the underside, where it often is difficult, dark, testing and sometimes evil in its twists of fate.The film has a strong link to animalistic representations, an element to which instantly brought Andrea Arnolds award winning short film 'Dog' to mind. The idea of trapped animals and the capabilities of those pushed too far is a powerful and dominating theme.Needless to say the challenging viewing nature of this film forms the base of its appeal. Its unflinching and unapologetic brutality could be deemed too prosaic for the majority of mainstream cinema goers. You will need to be ready for the challenge to fully take in and be moved by the film, it's not one to watch on a Sunday morning, put it that way.The direction and acting are the notables in this production. Most notably Olivia Coleman, whose supporting role threatens to overshadow that of Mullen's, if it wasn't for his own exceptional performance. Mullen portrays Joseph in such a way that despite his loathsome qualities he remains human and even relatable, at times when other characters don't.But it is Coleman's character and performance that really underpins and illuminates the rest of the feature. Her character is an almost polarised opposite in comparison with Joseph however as the plot turns we are exposed to an array of character transformations. It is these that actually help support the minimalistic plot which allows us to focus and be consumed by these iridescent performances.Considine has excelled himself in his writing and direction, with very few criticisms that could be levelled at each, other than those looking to nit-pick. Whilst somewhat preoccupied with the grim and depressive side of the characters, the film triumphs as it chase's the ray of light at the end of the tunnel. For all its depressing and challenging nature it mirrors the lives it portrays and the personal struggles of the characters, as they keep pushing and fighting. An excellent first feature from Considine and I personally cannot wait for his next offering.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard to digest, but brilliantly acted...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently Hollywood and the various film industries across the globe have seen an upsurge in the amount of on-screen performers who are taking a break from acting in front of the camera to instead take control from behind it. Paddy Considine, the star of 'This is England' and 'Dead Man's Shoes,' is now a member of this increasingly growing club with his first feature-film debut 'Tyrannosaur'. Written and Directed by Considine, this is an uncompromising debut film from the former photographer, which examines the destructive effects of violence and aggressive behaviour on the lives of two different individuals who are drawn together through their developing friendship.Joseph (Peter Mullan) is a lonely, cynical, and belligerent working class man. He spends his days drinking alone in the Pub and gambling in the local bookmakers where his only friends reside. Violent and abusive outbursts govern his existence thereby creating a solitary creature who acts on instinct rather than reasoning. However, Joseph's life changes when he meets and befriends Hannah (Olivia Colman), a local Christian woman who is constantly being verbally and physically abused by her sadistic husband James (Eddie Marsan). Both tortured souls, they find solace in each other's lives and develop a friendship which transcends their misgivings.'Tyrannosaur' is an uncompromising, and at times, difficult film to watch as the characters' lives are laid bare for the whole audience to observe. Joseph responds to problematic situations through the use of his fists, while Hannah simply acts out of fear and denial. Both Peter Mullan and Olivia Colman give fantastic performances; Mullan is initially a brutish, vagrant looking male who can't naturally become entwined in society, but as the film develops, empathy begins to grow for a man who accepts his short-comings and the fact that he may never be able to overcome them. With humanity arising slowly from his dishevelled face through his relationship with the young, neighbourhood boy Sam (Samuel Bottomley).While Colman's striking performance, which is far-cry away from her role on the hit British comedy series 'Peep Show,' shows a woman who is conflicted in all manner of her beliefs. Her religious beliefs give her the naivety to believe that her husband can change, while her heart knows that he will only stop hurting her when her beatings become fatal. This is most notable in the scene where James breaks down in tears at her feet after striking out at Hannah, as she cradles his head he constantly professes his love for her repeating the phrase "it won't happen again, you know it won't happen again." Hannah constantly reaffirms his worries saying that she does love him, but as she lowers his head, the camera observes her changing emotions as the audience is shown that Hannah is clearly not a woman in love with James, but instead she is simply afraid of him.Considine's first directorial effort is certainly a competent effort, he never attempts to direct the audience's attention too far from the script or the two central performances at hand, but this itself is the film's primary flaw. While it is captivating and emotionally unsettling, it is also a narrative which is not uncommon in modern British cinema (or known to some as 'miserable British cinema'), and it portrays the same judgements and ideals as many of its predecessors did before without providing anything new to the sub-genre at hand, especially in the culmination of the sub-plot involving the young boy Sam and his neglectful mother and boyfriend.Despite its unoriginality in the narrative's conclusive mediation, the film still manages to evoke a strong emotional response from the viewer through its combination of horrifying visuals and fragile performances from the two lead British actors, as Paddy Considine begins his feature film journey with a solid and respectable character portrait of two broken individuals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The actor Paddy Considine produces a powerful writing-directing debut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Tyrannosaur, the relatively young but well-established actor Paddy Considine (he's 37) directs a group of superb British thespians in a searing drama about a rageoholic widower in the town of Leeds. Basing his protagonists on unspecified but intimate experiences, and aspects of his own mother in the dead wife, Considine has written a film that's intense, brutal, and compelling. It takes us to the deep end of violence and cruelty but leads us through to a sense of redemption. A gray, grizzled, lonely, angry pub denizen widower, Joseph (Scot Peter Mullan, a scary life-force with both violent and sensitive sides) displays nothing but drinking-fueled violence in the early scenes of the film, in which he beats his own dog to death, smashes the window of a bank, and assaults three rowdy youths in a pub when we're barely past the credits. He runs into a charity shop to hide from the youths, and it's here he meets Hannah (Olivia Colman, complex and heartrending), with whom he will be involved throughout the film. Considine strains the audience's ability to stomach violence and ugliness, but hardly strains our credulity. He has made what is very close to a great film.When Joseph hides behind a rack of clothes in the shop, Hannah calms him and prays for him. He begins things on an honest basis with her, declaring, "My best friend's dying of cancer. I killed my dog. I'm f--ked." Visits to his friend and a funeral punctuate the action and add perspective. The next day in a desperate emotional state Joseph returns to the shop again, but is abusive and nasty about Hannah's religiosity and what she later ironically calls her "cozy" life in the Manors housing estates. Now the film's point of view shifts to Hannah. We learn she too drinks whenever the bus takes her home to her suburban house. First it may seem this is to deal with the violent emotions she has absorbed from Joseph, but it soon emerges that she lives in a horribly abusive relationship with her jealous, cruel and desperately unhappy husband James (Eddie Marsan), whose return home is anything but a pleasure. There's a surprising role-reversal that gradually develops between Joseph and Hannah.James' behavior makes Joseph's violence seem simpler. He urinates on Hannah for falling asleep on the sofa before he gets home, and other cruelties she reveals later that prevented her from childbearing are disgusting (and some of her experiences may strain credulity). Joseph's mood swings are scary while Joseph seems his own worst enemy but not entirely a bad man. For one thing he has one warm relationship with a kid across the street (Samuel Bottomley) who must live with his irresponsible mother (Sian Breckin) and her aggressive punk boyfriend (Paul Popplewell ) but maintains good humor and friendliness toward Joseph. There's some humor if of an insensitive kind too in Joseph's explanation to Hannah of how "Tyrannosaur" came to be his nickname for his overweight diabetic wife, but the word suggests that part of him is a prehistoric raging animal. The film's final scene offers hope for both Hannah and Joseph.Considine seems just to be establishing character and situation halfway through the film, but when Hannah and Joseph seem equally at risk of violence, inflicted on self or by others, events become tense and suspenseful, and desperate though the characters are, we care about them and wonder what will happen between Hannah and Joseph when she leaves James for the drunken widower as the safer bet. Semi-comical rants from Joseph's drinking scraggly-haired drinking partner Tommy (Ned Dennehy) add flourishes, and the death of Joseph's friend and his funeral, which family and Hannah, now very battered and taking refuge with Joseph, provides a temporary pause before final revelations. Considine is as strong in the plotting as in the character areas, and his choice and directing of actors can't be faulted.There is intensity and bitter truth in Considine, who steers clear of the edge of wild fantasy one finds in the Irishman Martin McDonagh. His harshness verges on the crude. But considering how well all the elements are managed here, Considine has produced a very impressive debut. He knows how to grab you and hold you all the way through. If you're looking at your watch, it just because you're terrified. Brutal and ugly this world may be, but Considine seems to know it and love it enough to show its truth and humanity. The accomplishment here is to give us lives that seem broken and hopeless and then hold our sympathy and offer a chance of a new beginning that's far from soft and easy. Erik Alexander Wilson's images, which for a welcome change are not distractingly jerky and hand-held, have a kind of limpid clarity, and there are some songs at the funeral that are almost too rich and pretty. Peter Mullan is also a director. He and Eddie Marsan figure in the dark, intense Red Riding trilogy, as does Paddy Considine. Considine is known for his beginning with Shane Meadows, and has significant Hollywood acting credits. His 2007 Bafta-winning short, Dog Altogether, presented Mullan and Colman in the same roles, differently developed.UK, 91 min. Tyrannosaur had its US debut at Sundance where it won acting awards for Colman and Mullan and a directing award for Considine. A Strand Films US theatrical release is scheduled for October 11, 2011. Seen and reviewed as part of the New Directors/New Films series presented from March 23 to April 4, 2011 by the Film Society of Lincoln Center and MoMA, NYC.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tyrannosaur was a tough and sometimes brutal film to watch. It's unsettling to watch both of these characters unravel. The best thing about it was the performances. Peter Mullan was great, but it was Olivia Colman who really stood out. Her character transformation was completely believable, and she was a powerhouse. To me, she was the driving force behind this film. The film takes some really unexpected turns in her character's arc, and by the time its over, it felt more like her film than Mullan's. As of now, she stands as one of the best performances of the year, and I hope many people take notice. Overall, definitely recommended, especially for Colman</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an odd couple living on borrowed time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tyrannosaur, on first viewing, immediately brings to mind another directorial debut by an acclaimed actor, namely Gary Oldman's Nil By Mouth. The crisis of masculinity, the victimisation of women in domestic settings, incremental brutalisation of children, and penchant for violence among certain kinds of weak-willed men are all overlapping themes. The graphic representation of these themes in visual terms is also common to both films. And finally, both contain outstanding performances from their cast.But writer/director Paddy Considine brings his own stamp to this project in his bold portrayal of an odd couple fleetingly driven together in extreme circumstances. Joseph is a self-loathing, hard-drinking loner, haunted by past failures, particularly in regard to his wife, whom he hit. He tries to make up for his character failings with displays of loyalty to a dying friend. It smacks of too little too late.Hannah is a devout Christian who works in a Charity Shop during the day, and enjoys a large glass of rioja at night. Her faith is built on less stable foundations than Joseph assumes when they first meet. His attack on her character may well prove to be the last abusive act of his life, such is the scale of regret it will bring in the long-term.Peter Mullan as Joseph is convincingly lost, playing a character removed by only a few degrees from the father he portrays in Neds. Olivia Colman is simply immense as Hannah, a brittle front easily broached by Joseph's bile, unleashing a fear and unhinged reaction that even the volatile Joseph struggles to comprehend. In between there is a touching vulnerability and unnerving humanity. Eddie Marsan, as the depraved James, once again proves why he is fast becoming Britain's preeminent character actor.This is character-driven social realist film-making to a certain extent, though there is a prominent three-act structure, exhibited more than in most films of the type, including a quite shocking but satisfying 'surprise' at the end. Tyrannosaur forces you to think about how we treat each other, and about the lives unraveling around us that we choose to turn a blind eye to. A mature debut from Considine, who sets a very high bar for himself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This superb film represents a coming of age for director Paddy Considine. It's a work of genius and a genuine work of art. Stunning performances are delivered by all of the cast members, right down to the minor roles. The wee lad is brilliant! However the stage is stolen by the 2 lead actors, Mullan and Colman. Their chemistry brings tears to the eyes on a number of occasions. Marsan is brilliant too. His character is at times more frightening and sinister than Mullan's, which is obviously what was intended! The film is at times very hard to watch because there are literally no punches pulled at any point. The ride is worthwhile though - it is utterly compelling, deeply thought provoking stuff. Just brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Realistic drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Mullan is Joseph, a man battling his inner demons, and Olivia Colman is Hannah, a woman he meets by chance in this character driven drama from Britain. Mullan and Colman are magnificent, especially when on screen together.Joseph is a rage filled alcoholic who is mad at the world and living alone after the death of his wife years earlier. He meets Hannah, a woman running a consignment shop; she prays for him even though he doesn't believe in God. Her husband is an abusive controlling monster. This is not a happily after story and it feels very realistic, portraying everyday working class people struggling with loneliness, regret and doubt. Mullan and Colman radiate genuine human emotion, never looking like Hollywood,s usual pretty faces. This is worthwhile just for the two leads who are riveting.Just be aware that this film will not leave you feeling good about life in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tyrannosaur: it's time these class clichés died out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For much of the past century, class consciousness has been at the centre of Britain's film output. Developing the style dubbed by commentators and critics as 'British Realism', our filmmakers seem continually preoccupied with class division and its inherent anxieties. But more than ever, realism seems to have very little to do with it, as what began with such kitchen-sink masterpieces as Saturday Night and Sunday Morning has now been reduced to one-dimensional and clichéd depictions of life on 'the other side of the tracks'.In the world of all things edgy and British, Paddy Considine is almost too good to be true. He is a long-time friend and collaborator of Shane Meadows, has starred in an Arctic Monkeys video and, of course, has a regional accent. After a decade of acting in such high-profile films as Dead Man's Shoes and Submarine, Considine made the transition into writing and directing with his short film Dog Altogether. His new film, Tyrannosaur, expands upon the BAFTA award-winning short and, much like Considine himself, is a veritable checklist of Brit-flick cliché.The film tells the story of Joseph (Peter Mullan) and Hannah (Olivia Colman). Joseph is a gruff alcoholic, whose violent rage obscures a heart of gold; Hannah is a middle-class charity-shop volunteer, whose cheery exterior hides a torturous home life. The two meet and, would you believe it, they realise that - despite their different backgrounds - they are kindred spirits.Not only is the plot a little on-the-nose, but Tyrannosaur is so painfully conventional that at times it borders on parody. Even the setting is all too familiar: a gloomy estate shrouded in perpetual dusk, where sirens are forever sounding in the background and children kick ragged footballs against graffiti-adorned walls.Furthermore, the way in which Considine attempts to unpick the binary between the middle- and working-class experiences is blatant to the point of being distasteful. In order to show us that Joseph and Hannah share the same pain, Considine juxtaposes images of Joseph spending his evenings in an old armchair, wearing a vest and holding a baseball bat to his head, with scenes of Hannah in the comfort of her new-build home, sobbing into a glass of Blossom Hill. Whilst Considine deals with some pretty dark subject matter - namely abuse, rage and alcoholism - such relentless stereotyping robs the film of any actual pathos.As the two tortured souls begin to find solace in one another, the rest of the film unfolds in an equally embarrassing fashion. At one point, Hannah joins Joseph at his local pub for his friend's wake. What follows is a horrendous scene in which she drinks lager, smiles incessantly and dances around with Joseph and his rag-tag group of friends. The fact that this exact sequence was perhaps done with about the same level of sophistication in James Cameron's Titanic, where Rose joins Jack in steerage to dance a jig and drink Guinness, is rather telling of the level of insight into class division Tyrannosaur provides.In spite of the dire material they are given, the cast do rather well and are of notably high esteem. Peter Mullan, for instance, has starred in some of gritty British cinema's most beloved films, including Ken Loach's Riff Raff and Danny Boyle's Trainspotting. Yet this impressive pedigree only adds to the overriding sense of self-parody, as Tyrannosaur is little more than a caricature of the sort of film that someone like Mullan would find himself in.Tyrannosaur has already won numerous awards at both the Sundance and Munich film festivals, and it's easy to see why. Like the old Hollywood joke that all you need to do to win an Oscar is make a film about the Holocaust, it seems that all you need to do as a British filmmaker to find critical success is to cobble something together involving a grotty pub, a rough estate and a pit-bull chained to some railings. Tyrannosaur is all this with bells on: a paint-by-numbers British drama that is as offensive as it is redundant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tyrannosaur Feat. Q &amp; A with Paddy Considine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since his debut appearance in Shane Meadow's cult classic A Room for Romeo Brass back in 1999, Paddy Considine has provided us with a diverse range of characters in low budget wonders as well as appearing in a number of Hollywood productions. His acting ability seems to know no limits and it was with great anticipation that I awaited the opening credits of his feature length directorial debut Tyrannosaur, blissfully unaware of the gritty realism and brutality that was about to unfold before my eyes.It was interesting to see that Brian Cox was also in the audience, it is clear that this actor turned director is respected not just by his audience but also by his peers. When the lights went down in the packed cinema a stark silence fell on the audience, the anticipation was enormous, and I was hoping that Tyrannosaur would live up to its name.After the success of his BAFTA award winning short film Dog Altogether, Paddy decided to revisit the characters he first introduced to us back in 2007 to take an in depth look at their lives. For those unfortunate enough to have missed this short, it follows the path of an unhinged man, Joseph, and his encounter with a religious charity shop worker, Hannah, who will seemingly stop at nothing to help him. This scenario is revisited in Tyrannosaur and it is great to see that Considine stuck with the same actors, with both Peter Mullen and Olivia Colman putting in exceptional performances which are only enhanced by the inclusion of Eddie Marsan as Hannah's violent husband.Comparisons to Shane Meadows work are inevitable but Tyrannosaur is an altogether different beast, with lashes of dark humour and depraved acts that would not be out of place in a Peckinpah film. It is incredible how Paddy manages to create a feeling of empathy towards Joseph, he is a violent brute with little or no concern for those around him but somehow also strangely likable. His relationship with Hannah is the key to this as we see rare glimpses of affection which indicate a human side to him, even though we are well aware that deep inside there is a monster lurking.Joseph is not the only one prone to violent outbursts, with Hannah's husband even more twisted and abhorrent. From the offset it is clear that there will be an inevitable confrontation between these two characters and the build up to this climax is outstanding. The supporting cast do a fantastic job of grounding the story, with a gripping subplot involving a young child and his suffering at the hands of his mother's cruel boyfriend. I fear that I have already given away too much but I have barely scraped the surface of this captivating drama that will be playing on my mind for a long time to come.For a debut film this leaves one hell of an impression whilst asserting Considine's position as a Director to watch out for. In my eyes it is the third great British debut of the year, following on from Richard Ayoade's Submarine and Joe Cornish's Attack The Block, and it gives me faith that our nation can compete with Hollywood when it comes to one of the most important aspect of a film-making, the art of storytelling.Paddy was gracious enough to appear at the preview screening I attended for a Q &amp; A session following his film and the rapturous applause spoke for itself. I have encountered him twice before at gigs where he played with his brilliant band Riding the Low and he always comes across as a charismatic, down to earth guy with a genuine passion for his art whether it be acting, singing or directing.It wasn't long before he mentioned his pal Shane Meadows, and not long after this Paddy's phone went off; "It's Shane telling me I better watch what I say about him" he retorted, reading his text message. It's off the cuff comments like this that make it so easy to warm to the man, and it was not long before we were all putty in his hands, listening to his fascinating anecdotes and eager to press him for as much information as we could in the time allotted.My highlight of the session was Paddy's retort about filming on location; "You can't film Inception down the f****** high street", and he went on to mention how the way a man came past walking his dog provided the idea for one of the key scenes in the film. In another scene shot in a pub, I was astounded to learn that the guitarist was given the part in order to stop him from pestering the crew. The song he created fitted perfectly with the mood of the film indicating that Paddy is unafraid to take risks with his film-making in order to provide us with the aspect of realism that echoes throughout Tyrannosaur.One of the highlights of British cinema this year, Tyrannosaur is an outstanding debut with powerful performances that should not be missed. Fans of Considine will certainly be impressed by his decision to move behind the camera and those new to his work will be dumbstruck by the sheer brilliance of what could well be the next great British director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Actor Paddy Considine's directorial debut has an actor's aura about it: the characters are the story, and in this case the central character, anti-hero Joseph (Peter Mullan) is an uncontrollably angry working-class Brit from Leeds who beats two dogs to death in between humans he bloodies up.As his foil, Hannah (Olivia Colman) is the essence of kindness, bonding with Joseph in her thrift shop but suffering physical abuse from her middle-class husband, James (Eddie Marsan), who urinates on her, beats her, and rapes her.In Considine's world, anger and violence have only a brief respite, for instance when Hannah and Joseph attend a pub party in honor of Joseph's best friend's death. Otherwise, cruelty rules with a bit of redemption in Hannah. Even that notion is ironic given the denouement of the story.Considine takes Mike-Leigh-like kitchen sink realism to a new level, almost as if he were parodying the venerable Brit staple. But, no, this is the real deal of aggression, and Mullan is close to perfect as the angry old man who could be redeemed if he had the moral strength.While misanthropy dominates this bleak landscape, it's the acting that makes it all enjoyable. It's tough out there, dinosaurs of all kinds troll for heads and hearts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a moment in Paddy Constantine's Tyrannosaur where the two main characters confront each other about a major problem they are facing. For the first time the male protagonist sees what he was, what he has failed to do, and what he must do to make things right. It is such a cathartic moment of clarity for him and his female friend, both clarity and horror, and a complete shock for the audience.Peter Mullan stars in one of the year's best films. He plays a man, Joseph, who suffers from alcohol, loneliness, and worst of all rage. His temper hurts those around him and gets him into more trouble than he can chew. His only friend is dying, the daughter of which hates both him and her dying father. He drinks all day, staggers home at night, and fights anyone who does him wrong, or at least what he calls wrong.One day he winds up hiding inside a woman's garment shop. She finds him irritable, vulnerable, and extremely volatile. The woman, Hannah (Olivia Colman), does what most of us wouldn't do. She let's him be, offers tea, and prays for him. This confuses Joseph. It's quite evident, but underneath all the testosterone and aggression you can almost see him trying to figure out why she helps.We soon find out that she is the victim of someone similar to Joseph, only more cruel and abusive than just angry. Her husband James (Eddie Marsan) drinks as well but his temper and need for sex and authority drive him to do awful things to Hannah. Joseph and Hannah strike an unlikely friendship, attempting to find solace in the utter chaos that is life.Mullan and Colman play off of each other so well. They both need help and want help but don't know how to ask others let alone help themselves. Mullan's character lost his wife to diabetes, though his aggression doesn't stem from that single incident. We don't know everything about him or Hannah but we know their characters have seen a lot and have had to deal with more than your average Joe. Their faces and their voices speak volumes of their back story.Director Constantine makes his feature debut (he also wrote the script). He shows a gritty and morbid, Irish Landscape, where the beer flows, the skies are rarely bright and sunny, and the nights are filled with barking dogs, violent husbands, and tortured souls crying out. He has developed some really deep, disturbed characters that have significant baggage. The writing is authentic (I'd be curious to find out how much was improvised by Mullan and others, especially during tirades). There is a great deal of heart poured into this film.There is a good amount of disturbing material here that some people might find offensive. As tough as these scenes and images are to take in I find that they are necessary to tell this type of story. Violence is not pretty, but when done with a certain grace and dedication it can really turn into something special, such is the case with Tyrannosaur.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark, depressing.....and simply stunning.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't feel the need to drone on at length as some other users have effectively summarised the film's core plot and themes. However, I felt that this film was such a work of art I could not help myself but come on here and add my voice to the chorus of compliments this film has been receiving.I like nothing better in a movie than something that is thought provoking and gripping. I get so bored with some of the formulaic nonsense churned out by filmmakers these days, particularly from Hollywood. If I sit down to watch a film and I find myself utterly absorbed then that's usually a sign that the piece is something special. This was one such film and it was over before it had even started, such did it hold my attention that I had no concept of the passage of time.The script, written by director Paddy Considine, isn't anything out of this world. It's fairly basic and, in plenty of instances, predictable. It is actually the direction and masterclass acting performances that serve to make this movie what it is. It is abundantly clear what the script sets out to do. Had the cast been average, or simply not the correct casting choices, this movie would've been instantly forgettable. However, all three of the principle cast are absolutely amazing. Peter Mullan's good hearted tortured soul of a man is played to perfection as he lives a daily battle with the rage and anger that has become his demon and undoing in life. Eddie Marsan's ability to communicate the sheer evilness of the abusive husband is gripping, especially considering the contrast he represents to other characters in the picture in that his character was more evil and nasty than fighting inner demons or pressure.However, the major shout out of this film is Olivia Coleman's performance. It is truly astounding. I have been following her work ever since she appeared in a guest role in The Office. She just gets better and better. She expertly channels pressure of trying to keep one's self together despite having to live an intolerable and hidden existence. Despite her inevitable descent into the more during the course of the picture Coleman manages to continue having the audience feel nothing but sympathy and compassion for her character. An unfortunate victim of a world in which cruelty and evil is all too real and all to effecting should we come face to face with it in our lives.I am not sure whether or not this picture has been released too late, but I was astounded to see Coleman not getting a best actress/best supporting actress nomination at the Academy Awards. I'm amazed how a performance like this gets overlooked, yet an actress from Bridsmaids gets the nod. It beggar's belief.For those wanted a thought provoking film this is not to be missed. It is arguably the best British film of the year. For aspiring actors and actresses I would say this is a must watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>unsuspecting and deeply affecting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had absolutely no knowledge or expectations for this film before watching it and I think this probably augmented the shock that came with its viewing. To sum it up in one word, I'd say this film is unsuspecting. The characters, plot and action are all totally plausible and the realist style lulls you into a sense of suspended disbelief which makes the impending violence all the more shocking. When I say violence, I don't just mean a Hollywood-style orgy of blood and guts everywhere. This isn't sensationalist torture porn like the Saw films. Tyrannosaur's violence is real and conceivable, like it could actually happen. But it happens when you least expect it and by those whom you least expect it from. The resultant effect is a shock that stays with you well after the film is finished. The cast are incredible. Peter Mullan gives authenticity to a character so filled with rage it would seem impossible for people like him to really exist. Eddie Marsan is one of the most provocative villains I've ever seen on screen and Olivia Colman's performance immediately tricks you into forgetting what Peep Show is, much less remembering that she was in it. I left this film thinking Paddy Considine HAS to make more films. The direction if faultless ? it has the same oppressive grey landscapes as you would expect from any social realist film and focuses more on faces, expressions and economic storytelling than superficial flare. His writing is top notch too. He has a way of clearly highlighting the issues and themes (domestic abuse, anger, lust and love) and presenting them in a fresh, engaging, inspiring and shocking form. Tyrannosaur is a damn good film but it's not enjoyable in the conventional sense of the word. It's affecting more than anything. You're moved, frightened and shaken by the things you see. You physically and emotionally react and this, I think, is what makes a good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hard and ruthless drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No concessions, gifts or excesses in the first feature film from British director Paddy Considine, also responsible for this script, one of the most accurate that have been written so far in European cinema. The background and present of protagonists of this film are perfectly entwined in a web of invisible acts. Scripts are thus elevating the film to the top flight of the arts.The film is pure reality, raw and hard at each of his characters, putting the viewer in an uncomfortable situation: feeling empathy with characters whose actions are despicable.There are no heroes or heroines, life is complex, and the characters of the film, each immersed in his circle of violence where they can not get out, so they are. The subtlety with which Paddy Considine gets us suffer in the bowels with hardly violent images is impressive, we suffer with the characters, read their thoughts, we feel their impressions. It grips us a tremendous sense of threat in the film. And yet, we can not help but sympathize with some of the terrible actions that the characters make. The film tells not only what is in it, but everything suggests around.The division works with enormous force. Not only is Peter Mullan and Olivia Colman is safe and quiet in their profiles, they are also transmitted the highest degree of truth and manage to forget what happens out there, reducing the world to the theater.'Tyranossaur' is a brutal and intractable drama that hides little or no expiration date letter. His sincerity is its proximity. It is a work that, more than a movie, is a ruthless monster, a monument against suffering and a giant passes over such insignificant people like us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first have to say that the performances are all quite stunning; particularly Olivia Colman. She takes a very measured approach to the role and it comes off perfectly. Peter Mullan was also excellent as Joseph; a great piece of casting as I felt he was ideal for the role. Eddie Marsan plays the abusive and somewhat creepy husband just right and I have to also give a mention to the young actor Samuel Bottomley, who plays a local boy who Joseph looks out for. I'm sure this young man will have a great future. This is a film that is all about the performances; there are no special effects or fancy camera trickery; it lives or dies on the performances and I have to say (for me at least) it worked to a tee! One of the criteria I use when deciding whether I like a film or not, is the emotional response it generates. And I can honestly say with this one it was all positive. Don't get me wrong, you are taken all around the houses on the way there, but to end it they way they did I though was just perfect!SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED My score: 9.6/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolutely harrowing film about redemption set in a gritty contemporary housing estate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Mullan is certainly a man to be reckoned with. As is Paddy Considine, who has been in lead roles in films such as "Cinderella Man" and "Dead Man's Shoes" over the years. He directs Peter Mullan in "Tyrannosaur", which follows the story of depressed and violent alcoholic named Joseph as he drinks away his days and lashes out at everyone around him. Joseph has a troubled past, and now alone and in his fifties, he appears committed to his fate for better or for worse. He spends his days drinking in the local pubs and betting in the bookies. His best friend is dying of cancer, and believes he is going to hell for all of the bad things that he has done. This causes Joseph to reflect on his life. His other human contact is with a young boy who lives across the road from him with his young mother and her thuggish boyfriend and his vicious bull dog. Joseph wanders into a charity shop one day, and it is here that he meets Hannah, and she offers him a chance of redemption through her friendship.Well, the first five minutes of "Tyrannosaur" certainly gripped me and dragged me right down into the life of the protagonist. It was exceptionally harrowing, and what Joseph does at the start of the film to his dog sets him up to be a hated character, but the way he reacted to what he had done nevertheless made me generate some profound sympathy for this character. Mullan is absolutely amazing in this film. He is also a brilliant director, with a fetish for disturbing conventional social films like this one. His 2010 film "Neds", for example and also his portrayal of the Magdalene laundries with "The Magdalene Sisters". Considine directs this very well, capturing the essence of what life is like for many people in Britain and in Ireland these days. I could detect an influence of Gary Oldman's "Nil by Mouth" by how it was made."Tyrannosaur" is at it's heart a very interesting character story and the title itself is highly ambiguous yet very fitting. I initially believed it to be metaphorical, that it was named after the fierce Dinosaur because Joseph's temper reflects that of the Tyrannosaur and the fact that it would be buried under the ground (As the cover indicates) could well have represented so-called skeletons from his past being concealed. Olivia Colman provides a brilliant supporting performance, but the show invariably belongs to Mullan. Without a doubt one of the most underrated actors around at the moment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paddy Considine has made a monster!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't remember ever having sat through a film with my hand over my mouth for the entire duration but that is exactly what has just happened, from opening scene to close.Knowing that this was a film by Paddy Considine, a man known all too well for his roles as tormented souls, abusive sociopaths and vicious psychos, I had the feeling that this wasn't to be taken as lightly as the picture on the front cover suggested.Tyrannosaur is in fact a seething monster in the calm before the inevitable rampage and I believe that Considine has just gone and proved himself the most intensely expressive actor turned director since Gary Oldman brought us Nil By Mouth.The story (without spoilers) goes that Joe is a violently angry and disturbed man whose rage and aggression has already seemingly cost him dearly, yet we see first hand the extent of the damage he brings on himself.His revulsion towards his own actions bring him to cross paths with Hannah, a Christian charity shop worker who delivers him somewhat from the consequences of an outburst of rage. But when he judges her for someone that doesn't understand him or know the life he's lived, little does he realise the damage and rage boiling beneath her own calm exterior.Tyrannosaur has the ability to be so many different kinds of story all at once and thanks to the clear direction of Considine, the superb script and the outstanding performances of Peter Mullan, Olivia Colman and the surprisingly solid Eddie Marsan, you know all too well that the characters are capable of taking it in any one direction with all the purpose that their rage amounts to.But Tyrannosaur's true grit and determination keeps it on one set path. And never have I seen a film that so often portrays the very real fear, sadness, anger and confusion of any one character, yet does not get lost. This film is bleak, dirty, perverted, angering, tragic - downright gutting in fact - and yet it becomes uplifting and redemptive.I would never want to tell Shane Meadows that he's out of a job but by the looks of Paddy Considine's first venture behind the camera, he surely has competition.If this film doesn't rock the film industry, they're all dead inside!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The inescapable cycle of violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Kitchen Sink and Social Realistic genres are ever present in the UK as British filmmakers explore that the darker elements of life and society. Tyrannosaur is a film that shows that the genre is still alive.In a nameless working class town Joseph (Peter Mullen) is an unemployed man with a violence temper and flies into fits of rage with ease. After killing his dog and threatening a teenager in a pub Joseph hides in a charity shop. They he meets a Christian woman, Hannah (Olivia Colman) offers the hand of friendship to Joseph. But Hannah is also a victim of violence, suffering at the hand of her abusive husband (Eddie Marsden).Tyrannosaur is the directing debut for actor Paddy Considine. He has a very hard-hitting, unflinching style as he is not afraid the most the darkest aspects of life. Considine explores the themes of violence in society, how it affects people from the perpetrators to the victims and that it affects people from all walks from life. Violence at both the forefront and in the background as it effects characters in the background. The destructive effects of alcohol plays on people, playing with their emotions and acting as a coping mechanism. The pacing is just right, the score was soft and subtle and the cinematography had a dark simplicity to it, highlighting the bleakness of the town and the situation of violence.The acting was fantastic throughout. Both Mullen and Colman had difficult roles and they did everything they needed to. It would have been easy to make out Joseph to be a vile human being that we want to see come to serious harm but Mullen does bring out a lot of character and complexity to his role: I admit that his accent and grumble makes him a little hard to understand at times it was still a very compelling performance and it would be easy to far a man like him despite being in his late forties/early fifties. Playing a victim of domestic abuse is always a tough role to get right and Colman (known mostly for comic roles) gives a natural performance and deserved many of the Best British Awards she earned.Tyrannosaur is a very tough watch with some very graphic scenes that shock for its brutal depiction as a man searches for redemption. Tyrannosaur is a film you should see once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a superb piece of gritty realistic cinema from a director with his finger on the pulse. If you are looking for an easy film to watch then this isn't for you. The film opens with the main character killing his dog- how can you feel any empathy for this character?. Well watch this film and tell me you didn't feel something for him. Life is not black and white and this film affirms this brilliantly. The relationship between the thuggish Joseph and the gentle and kind Hannah is at times uncomfortable but is dealt with in a realistic and brutally honest way. The acting performances of the three main leads, Peter Mullan, Olivia Colman and Eddie Marsan are nothing short of phenomenal. The film is bleak but has it's moments of tenderness and every scene seems to work. My only negative about this film is that it's too short- I could have gladly watched another 1/2 hour. The only reason this film hasn't got a 10 from me is that I never give any film a 10 on first viewing. This came pretty close to breaking that rule. If you are looking for a non sensationalist piece of gritty drama then you will never do better than watching this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really good film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I warmed to the idea of watching this film purely after seeing Mr Considines' performance in Dead Mans Shoes. I found his acting to be absolutely brilliant so was curious as to whether his film making would match his asking skills. And boy did they match up. In regards to the opening animal death scene. I NEVER watch animal documentaries purely for the reason that I hate seeing animals being killed even if it is for food. Any advert appealing for help from animal charities is upsetting for me so I agree the opening scene was tremendously upsetting. The second time I watched Tyrannosaur I skipped the opening scene to avoid it. BUT on the flip-side people DO things like that to animals everyday and it is nitty and gritty and heart wrenching so the use of such a harrowing and upsetting scene fitted the film.I loved Peter Mullan in this. Yes he starts off as a right b*stard but you can't help liking him and warming to him. All I kept thinking was 'I hope he gets the girl' because I sensed such chemistry between him and Olivia's character. They worked so well together. The two contrasts of characters: the drunken down and out versus the charity shop working religious caring person but both living very similar lives both alcohol ridden and laced with trauma. Perfect!I'd read, before watching this, that it was a depressing film and long winded and hard to watch. Nonsense. It's very good indeed. Well done Paddy. Thank you for this film and hope there is going to be loads more to come from you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Searing tyranny and "innocence" soars in Tyrannosaur</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you can make it through the first few (difficult) minutes of Tyrannosaur, I think you can make it through the entire film ... here is to hoping you can as it is a very good one.First time feature director Paddy Considine (an actor in Red Riding, In America, Cinderella Man ) makes an impressive and solid directorial debut about tortured and abused souls starring relative-unknowns (although for NOT much longer) Peter Mullan (Braveheart, War Horse, Red Riding) and Olivia Colman (Hot Fuzz, The Iron Lady, Hyde Park on Hudson) as (him -- Joseph) an abusive, mean drunk and (her -- Hannah) a saintly consignment store owner. At a relatively short 92-minutes, Tyrannosaur packs both a literal and figurative punch. Although it is short in length it is NOT slight in subject matter -- as it is grim, austere, dark and disturbing at times but ultimately uplifting (and therefore a rewarding watch).The film begins after a particularly rough night for Joseph (he is brutally beaten over some verbal sparrings and provoking antics) when he stumbles upon Hannah as she is opening her store one morning. The pious and kind Hannah opens her doors, arms and heart to the broken man although he isn't sure if he wants to take any of her kindness or charity and he makes this fully known (he has his reasons).The film takes some twists and a few unexpected turns; but these two stay true to their conflicted characters as it becomes a tale of morality, faith and devotion (and not how one might expect). Soon after the pair meet, the tables are turned and Hannah seeks out Joseph for some much-needed help/support on her side. These characters are highly flawed (but well written -- don't misread that -- as this is what makes Tyrannosaur stand out for good reason) in search of someone else who might value them as "something". There is a searching, a longing, a desire, a grasp, a yearning (or) a hunger present in THESE characters that is not commonly found in film today. These two simply have an URGE to be valued (flaws-and-all) by a fellow human being! I will (safely ?) bet that the majority of us are not as flawed as either Joseph or Hannah but their NEED should resonate with us all! These two destructive personalities find solace in one another; but they initially do not know what to make of the other and the film plays out their developing relationship. This is a particularly good watch although it is a tough one -- and I am glad to recommend it as I also see it as an important one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paddy Considine's Dark View</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is something about watching this very dark, brutal, intense, deeply sad, and yet profoundly compelling movie that seeps into the psyche, making future night walks rather fearsome. Paddy Considine who can bring us such warmly lovable characters on the screen as an actor here write and directs a story that pleads for us to look at just how low people can go - and still survive. It is shocking to watch but once the film begins the power of the story and the brilliance of the actors who bring it to life it is impossible to pause for breath.Joseph (Peter Mullan) is a grizzled, isolated, drunk widower whose anger at the world is so close to the surface that he lashes out at the slightest provocation - even to the point of brutally killing his own beloved dog at the opening of the film - a fact that makes the audience loathe him form the start. He lives alone, occasionally visits his only friend who is dying from cancer, and ha a connection with a kid across form his flat, a young boy Sam (Sammuel Bottomley) who is forced to sit out on the sidewalk while his mother (Sian Breckin) cavorts with her current boyfriend (Paul Popplewell) who keeps his pitbull dog close by. In a matter of a few days Joseph has not only beaten his dog to death, but he has also crushed the windows of the Paskistani bank where he abuses the owners, and in a pub pool hall he severely beats three mouthy boys who taunt him.Having no place to hide Joseph walks into a charity second hand store run by Hannah (Olivia Colman),a seemingly evangelical church woman who takes pity on Joseph and prays for him despite the fact that Joseph is atheistic. As the story unfolds we discover that Hannah is also a profoundly sad woman, her smarmy husband James (Edie Marsan) is abusive: Hannah is afraid of him and turns to drinking to escape her loathing of James. James spies Hannah with Joseph, threatens her, and rapes her, urinates on her, and destroys her organs with broken glass so that she is sterile. Hannah attempts to leave James, gets drunk, is beaten more, and finally ends up with Joseph as her only friend and Gilead. When Hannah and Joseph seem equally at risk of violence, inflicted on self or by others, events become tense and suspenseful, and desperate though the characters are, we care about them and wonder what will happen between Hannah and Joseph when she leaves James for the drunken widower as the safer bet. Once the playing field is even between Joseph and Hannah things change and we realize how desperately at the bottom of the pit they are. What happens form that point most be seen afresh to appreciate the ending.There is some comic relief provided Joseph's drinking scraggly-haired drinking partner Tommy (Ned Dennehy) and some songs and dancing at the funeral when Joseph's friend dies, but the overall film is bleak and in the hands of lesser actors than Peter Mullen and Olivia Colman it may not have worked. But Considine's writing and direction along with the brilliant performances of these tow actors produces a film that is one of the finest of the year. This is cinema at its darkest and we should see films like this to realign our own perspectives about how life can be severely difficult. Grady Harp, April 12</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's difficult to say anything about this movie because it is one of the strongest, hardest and brutal movies I've seen in the last couple years, a punch in the head from its very first minute. Be prepared if you want to see it because it can really catch you by surprise as it did to me.Tyrannosaur is interesting in a lot of aspects. First of all, it's not an easy movie and even being an intense drama, it has few thrilling moments and turns. Also, the characters development is pretty interesting because the movie starts from an apex point for every character.Sometimes disgusting because the movie shows the worst of us all, but also the best. As another one said, the movie "delivers such a harrowing portrait of two characters that it is hard to watch without being equally repelled and touched at the same time".Joseph and Hannah are two characters that represent the two different sides that come together and complement each others fears and braves. They think and react differently from each other but above all they are humans and are faded to change their most solid opinions. Also they have some things in common like their lack of some believes. While Hanna tries to fool herself all the time, creating a world completely different from the one she lives, Joseph never hides the truths or all his negative point of views.At first the movie reminded me of Falling Down (1993). Everyone has a little of William Foster inside, but although Michael Douglas character represents what goes thru our minds in a bad day, if you want to see what ordinary people would do in their rage days, Joseph and Hanna are the closest example.Despite all their rage, angry and hate, their reasons become clear in the exact right moments thankfully to the plot development. There's a moment when Joseph compares ourselves to dogs, meaning that we need to realize how much a dog can be mistreated to be afraid and attack the others, and at the same time how much the same dog needs to be proved that some other people aren't there to mistreat it. And that's who we are.But Tyrannosaur wouldn't be what it is if wasn't for the acting. Frankly the best performances of the year. Forget 2012's Oscar favorites, Petter Mullan and Olivia Colman are outstanding, offering visceral performances of two mentally disturbed people by traumas acquired during their lives that are now in a point where they can not longer see any perspectives. Olivia's performance is so subtle and at the same time powerful, expressing her character difficulties and mixed feelings perfectly. Undoubtly, their performances save the movie from any imperfection and improves what is already perfect.If you are not in the mood for a chaotic and tough drama, just put this movie aside, but don't forget it because it is worth watching. But if you are looking for a top notch acting and a masterpiece drama that has the power to transform its anguish into important lessons to be learn, this is it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>first of all one of the best British films I saw. highly recommended! yes there are difficult scenes to watch (beating dog to death for one), but its all make a collage of a man Joseph(Petter Mullan) is. a ruin of a man who his bitterness drowns in alcohol, a man who lost his faith in life, joy and everything that should make our lives fulfilled. A story so common in todays world...aggressiveness surrounds him, even feeding him to produce more and more of it...aware that he is falling apart, he looks for a escape. and he finds it in Christian orientated woman Hannah(Olivia Colman). she too carries a heavy burden on hers chest in term of her psycho husband. also unhappy with her life finds relief in faith and Jesus Christ. But its not enough, and when Joseph stumbled in shop, she felt she needs to pray for him, help him, save him but instead saving herself...yes its heavy drama film but it makes you think about life. what is good, wrong, happy or sad. who is truly happy? but someone copes with it better then the others.. yes we can all be Joseph sometimes, pressure of everyday life that needs to get out, somehow. path to auto destruction is easy to accept, but struggle is what life is.Joseph in understanding what Olivia did, forgave her and found his redemption and calm for his tormented soul in the end hopefully...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was wary of watching this, not being keen on blatant violence in films, but it was very well played; the physical violence mostly being left to the imagination. I consider it to be one of the most thought provoking films I've watched in a long time.Peter Mullan and Olivia Colman deserve awards for their individual performances. This film is about anger and how we deal with it. We all have anger somewhere, but how close to the surface is yours and how well do you manage it?Joseph's anger is just beneath the surface and boils over at the slightest provocation. You think you might hate him, but you don't know anything about him or his life. Hannah's anger is deeper, but no less dangerous and I thought about what I had watched for several days after; it had a quite an impact on me......and the Tyrannosaur part? Obviously it was meant to be the monster in Joseph ...hahaha How wrong I was!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is without a doubt one of the hardest movies I have ever sat through, I can cope with a lot, but this one purposely makes you feel uncomfortable. It is very grim, violent and often disturbing, some of the scenes made me feel genuinely uncomfortable. I love Paddy Considine as an actor, he proved by writing and directing this that his talents are vast and many. Peter Mullan is superb as Joseph, Eddie Marsan is incredible as Hannah's violent husband, he made me feel guilty for watching the film. It is the performance of Olivia Colman that makes this movie something special, she is a totally likable actress, but in Tyrannosaur she proved that she can be a superb actress, her performance was on another level.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was so surprised by how much I enjoyed this film. It seemed as though it would be slow and dark and grim and not a lot else. But I gave it a go. It's taught me to be more open minded about such things (and to believe Mark Kermode when he says something is worth a look).This is the story of a faint and unexpected hope amidst a sea of despair. It takes the form of a surprising friendship between the two main characters. Both are lost, suffering in their own way, quietly, or angrily. The performances are so gut wrenchingly superb that I was immediately invested in the pain each feel.From the moment the main characters meet, and the flotsam of faint, burgeoning hope begins to form, I began to will it to become something more substantial, that may save them both. The performances from the two leads are heart breaking and at times, visceral. Both are equally superb. Though some scenes are undeniably difficult, I was transfixed throughout.For me the beauty of this film is in the success it makes of showing how our relationships are what give our lives meaning and hope - That no matter how awful circumstances can become, sharing a meaningful bond with another person can make life worth living.As grim as the surroundings and the situations, that overriding streak of beauty running through the film allows it to transcend it's depressing setting. I found it a truly moving experience and would recommend it to anybody, but with a warning that if you're faint hearted, be prepared. Having said that, everything that happens serves the story and character development, so I had no problem with it what so ever.In my top five favorite films of all time, easily.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A punishing and honest look at cruelty and what we do when pushed to our limits</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>TYRANNOSAUR is no easy film to take in. It is a window into a very harsh, unforgiving environment populated with people that have a lot of personal pain. It is also brutally honest in its assessment of the world as a violent place that pushes us to our limits. Still, it isn't all depressing because of chance encounters in which we meet people who seem to be very different from us on the surface, masking pain that is very similar to our own. This is the type of story that TYRANNOSAUR tells, and all from first-time feature director Paddy Considine. He gets strikingly real performances out of his actors and shows a firm directorial hand. There is hardly anything to gripe about here, save a couple of moments of animal cruelty which could turn off a lot of people. I must admit that I was somewhat revolted in those scenes, but they still felt organic to the story. One major theme explored is what people do when pushed to their limits, and there are many instances throughout the film in which this is shown. I don't really want to spoil anything specific, so if a dark psychological drama is something you're into then this will probably be one of the best you'll see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film... if you're in the mood for it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some films thrill you, some scare you, some make you laugh. You choose which one depending on how you want to feel. Tyrannosaur is a fantastic movie, but you have to be in the mood for it. It's not a feel good type of film. It's gritty, nasty, dark, but ultimately uplifting (in a sad sort of way).The main character, Joseph, is introduced to us as he kicks his beloved pet dog to death, smashes a Post Office window and gets into a fight with some youths in a pub. And he's our 'hero' - he's the guy we're expected to root for. If you don't like the sound of him already, you're probably not going to enjoy his tale. He's not the most sympathetic of characters. Olivia Coleman (best known for her comedic roles, such as 'Sophie' in Peep Show) is outstanding, showing just what a versatile actress she is.Some people have criticised it as 'yet more British miserablism.' That's a fair comment. It is pretty miserable. That's why if you're looking for something cheery, it's not for you. However, if you're willing to see just how depressing some people's lives are, you'll be glad you did - I'm guessing not many people are as trapped in such a downward, self-destructive spiral as the two central characters. If nothing else, you'll be glad you're not them.Oh, and don't get your hopes up about seeing giant dinosaurs - it's a metaphor - Jurassic Park, this isn't.</fullReview>

When I was young, the British Angry Young Men had emerged on stage and screen, and I thought I got the message, which was that in the face of a pitiless society, an Angry Young Man must revolt. I think the message of "Tyrannosaur" is that some men are born angry, others experience something terrible to make them that way, and society's pity is wasted."

		<fullReview>Hannah: I feel safe with you. Joseph: Nobody's safe with me.This was a damn good movie. One that holds you tight and won't let go. One that shakes you up and once again points out that your everyday life isn't so bad. A fairly heavy movie with partner violence as an emotional topic, intertwined with a religious layer. It's not exactly a movie you should watch if you are in an emotional dip, because it's actually a terrible dark depressing film.The acting performance of Mullan and Colman was overwhelming and impressive. 2 Tormented souls who find each other and ultimately find support in each other. Joseph a terribly aggressive loner who apparently already battered his wife and now lives in a daily haze of alcohol. It's in such a drunk moment that the aggression and rage appears once and while in such a terrible way that he even kicks his faithful dog to death. Or he starts threatening a teenager in a pub. Eventually, he runs into a secondhand clothing store, where he meets Hannah. A deeply religious woman who is a victim of sexual violence and abuse by her husband. Despite that they are actually opposites, they try to cling to each other and support each other.The strength of the movie is its realism. The image of rage and violence. I don't think any of the images or segments used in this movie is exaggerated. It's not an easy film to watch and it leaves a bitter aftertaste. But the film touched me deeply and was full of intense feelings.The best part was the funeral of Joseph's friend, where everyone in the pub is drinking a beer and someone sings a sensitive song on his guitar. A time when you briefly see the two main characters flourishing, and that they can enjoy the simple things in life. More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well acted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start with i thought this film was brilliantly acted,the main leads played by Peter Mullen and Olivia Colman were so realistic and their different type of living conditions says a lot about modern England today.She lives in a nice home in a nice part of town but has an abusive husband,her dilemma is it worth putting up with him?as she has nowhere else to go.He on the other hand lives in poverty because he has in a way just given up,he knows its to late to better himself and to change his life style.So when the two opposite characters meet each other they form a sort of bond and give each other a sense of hope. However the negatives i had with this film was with the Peter Mullen character,in the films opening scene he gets angry and takes his spite out on his dog who he brutally kicks,he then leaves his dog to die alone in a cold shed over night.I was disgusted with this scene and thought he should have been arrested and charged.Also later on in the film he kills the neighbours staff who i don't think was entirely to blame for what happened to the little boy. Why does the film have to use a Staffordshire Bullterrier as the bad dog?this breed is already misunderstood ,on an average week the statistics of Staffordshire Bullterriers who get put to sleep in pounds across the UK is as high as 80,most are very loving dogs that mix well with others and generally love people.Unfortunately they have been overbred and a lot end up as strays and dumped before they reach aduldhood.This film has not done their breed any favours so for this reason i am giving the film 5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I admire greatly the work of Peter Mullan, I went out of my way to find this film in its limited run in the states. Peter Mullan, as he does with all his work, again layers this performance with so many wonderful, complex and interesting moments, it becomes impossible to look away. I also found myself extremely appreciative of Paddy Considine's mesmerizing dark script and perfectly nuanced direction. But perhaps I am most grateful for introducing me to the work of Olivia Colman. Ms. Colman gave in Tyrannosaur, undoubtedly one of the most brilliant female performances of the year in one of the most overlooked films of 2011. Even while the dark nature of this film makes it less a candidate for multiple viewings, I found myself upon a second watch, surprised to find so much more to appreciate within Tyrannosaur. Erik Wilson cinematography is wonderful and just so very right for this story. Dan Baker and Chris Baldwin's original music was a delight and made you want more. Simon Rogers's production design and Andrew Ranner's art direction immersed you in this too somber world. I can find no editor's credit, but assume it likely Paddy's as well. Yes, that was spot on also. But to sum up, while the dark and brooding nature of this film may give some viewers pause or lessen its appreciable merit, this is no less than a truly masterful little film done to perfect precision by writer/director Paddy Considine. Which excites us about his upcoming project, The Leaning. When Paddy, when? Soon please, sir!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paddy Considine is one of my favorite British actors. Several great movies, like "In America" and "Dead Mans Shoes", have shown his great talent. Get ready for his full-length directing debut. Tyrannosaur tells a dark and depressing story about a man plagued by violence and hate. Every little thing can make him explode and he won't hold back. This is a heavy movie. If you're in a bad mood or you've just been dumped or anything like that, don't watch it, cause you'll get even more depressed. Also, if you love dogs, you might just skip this one. If you like dark, heavy dramas, you'll find a true gem with this one. I really loved the grim atmosphere in this movie, the very convincing acting and the way everything is filmed. Paddy Considine should definitely keep both acting (he's not in this movie though) and directing cause this man is a true genius. When the ending credits rolled I just sat there staring at the screen with a sad look on my face for a couple of minutes. Which in this case is a good thing cause that's probably exactly what Considine wants. This is a movie I will not easily forget about</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bleak, predictable, but brilliantly acted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paddy Considine is a superb actor, and has made his reputation in large part through appearing in the brilliant films of Shane Meadows; so perhaps its unsurprising that he elicits fine, subtle performances from his cast (Ken Loach veteran Peter Mullan, and Olivia Colman ) in his debut film behind the camera, 'Tyrannosaur'. The film itself lies in classic Meadows/Loach territory, and like his mentor, Considine creates a bleakly poetic vision of life in an unfavoured corner of Britain. In places, the film is almost apocalytpically bleak - there are bad people in this world, but some of the characters here appear completely irredeemable. The central characters, however, are beautifully, tragically human. This isn't ultimately a surprising film; but it's still a convincing and moving portrait of people whose lives have not run according to plan.</fullReview>

The film is brutal and honest in the acting, the storyline, the settings, everything is just superb. The lead actress gives a wonderful performance, I was familiar with her from the TV series Peep Show as a comedy actress but in this serious role she is just tremendous. The misanthropic main character is played with gritty realism by the Scottish lead actor and is totally believable, I've met characters like this and to see it brought to the screen is a fantastic achievement from the director. As a Brit I am happy to see us make great films like Tyrannosaur, up with the best in the world. Not quite ten out of ten, but very close!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Packs a punch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although "Tyrannosaur" covers much the same ground as Ken Loach does in his films - namely, people (usually men), who suddenly wake up one day and begin to wonder how they have ended up like they have, this film still packs one hell of a punch. It's worth noting that Peter Mullan who plays the protagonist in the film under review, also played the protagonist in Ken Loach's "My Name is Joe". Joseph is angry - very angry. Anything can set him off: rowdy pool players in a pub ? frustration at accessing his money at the Post Office (he's a widower, so it might be a pension of some kind). Plagued by violence and a rage that is driving him to self-destruct, he undergoes a life change after accidentally killing his dog. More often than not he wakes with a massive hangover. This of course, doesn't stop him whiling away the hours in the local pub. For Joseph one day is much like the day before and in the days stretching ahead of him. He spends a lot of his time wandering the streets, picking fights with neighbours or drinking. He is desperate to change his ways, but doesn't know how. For Joseph the light at the end of the tunnel grows dimmer with every passing hour. One day, with nothing better to do, he wanders into the local charity shop and gets into conversation with Hannah, a plain, Christian woman who believes in the rejuvenating power of prayer ? to her, nobody is beyond redemption, even Joseph. Joseph doesn't see it that way: he is automatically suspicious of anyone who offers the hand of friendship. Gradually however, Joseph and Hannah strike up a friendship of sorts. When Joseph discovers Hannah is married and lives in one of the more affluent suburbs, Joseph automatically suspects Hannah is just befriending him to relieve the boredom of standing behind a counter all day long. However, life for Hannah is far worse than it is for Joseph. When she turns up at work with a black eye, Joseph suspects, rightly it turns out, that her husband is to blame despite her repeated denials that she'd accidentally walked into a door. Inexorably, Joseph is dragged deeper and deeper into Hannah's world, a world that threatens to plunge him back into his former life. Peter Mullan puts in a stunning performance as Joseph. But the best acting honours has to go to Olivia Colman, as Hannah. "Tyrannosaur" holds up a mirror to a certain strata of English society, and it's not a pleasant picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really good drama from Paddy Considine, who has, with this, his first feature length film, proved himself to be both a versatile cinematic actor and a talent behind the camera as well. The three central performances (Peter Mullan, Olivia Colman and Eddie Marsan) are exceptional. Absolutely stunning, especially Colman, and Considine directs with real confidence. I hope he continues to make films like this. Darker, more stylish than his good friend Shane Meadows, who no doubt gave him some hints while they worked together. It's very grim, the setting is ugly, miserable, the locals either sullen or disgustingly aggressive (not a good advert for the 'North') and some may find it uncomfortable to sit through, but this only adds to the gritty realism and emotional trauma which make this such a riveting watch. Probably the best film of 2011. It's top of my list now anyway.</fullReview>

The same goes for the boy, and I'd say also for the the boy's mum's awful boyfriend and his mates. Found the husband character is secondary, and therefore less well developed.

		<fullReview>We like our drama full of relentless rage, do us Brits. Screenwriters across the country are coming up with new ways to have the working classes screaming at each other. Add generous quantities of GBH and a liberal garnishing of senseless killing.Everyone in this film is angry. The secret of the British 'it's grim up noourth' melodrama is not to ask why anyone is angry. They just are, okay? They're poor, so do we need any other explanation? Nope. Just shut up and take your medicine. Well acted medicine, I have to admit.This film shows how much great performances can hide an average director and an average screenplay. You generally expect an actor-turned-director to get the most out of his actors, and Considine certainly does that.The script is pretty weak, though. I would call it crude. Unsophisticated thuggery inflicted on an apparently willing audience. Considine must be tapping into some kind of Sundance-inspired masochism.How do we hide the writer's lack of ability? Have everyone shout meaningful, heartfelt monologues at each other. The problem is, particularly at the start of the film, these monologue's are not motivated by the action in the story. Peter Mullan's Joseph is a fighting, furious drunk who hits the ground running - or should I say, punching and kicking. He meets the unlikely born again charity shop owner, Olivia Coleman's Hannah, and before they have been together a few minutes, he is verbally slashing her with cutting insights. This outpouring would have felt awkward if the characters had known each other all their lives.This style continues throughout the film. Plot twists are delivered without skill of insight. Why is Hannah - who seems fairly sensible - married to some kind of raging psycho, whose introduces himself into the story by urinating over her while she's asleep?This ugly and cruel Punch and Judy show of a film continues in this, and can only build to a dramatic climax by increase the violence to an absurd degree. By the end, people are acting like pure caricatures. If it wasn't so gruesome and so visceral, you might laugh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first became aware of Tyrannosaur as it started making waves across various film festivals, (particularly Sundance), however it wasn't until I saw Shane Meadows' masterpiece 'Dead Man's Shoes' that I knew I HAD to see this. Paddy Considine just blew me away as Richard and I was excited by the prospect of his directorial debut. It hit me, hard. It was a long time since a film impacted upon me so strongly. It doesn't feel like a debut; so confident, assured, mature, etc. Peter Mullan just commanded the screen as the world-weary and grizzled Joseph. Every time he was on screen, he grasped my attention so firmly that I literally couldn't pull my eyes away from this magnificent performance. In most films, the other actors would pale in comparison to such a performance, but not in 'Tyrannosaur', as Mullan is equaled by Olivia Colman's marvelous, at times subtle performance as Hannah, Joseph's source of solace. Erik Wilson's cinematography was a pleasure throughout, presenting many striking images which stay with the viewer.The story is simple, but it nonetheless provokes a strong reaction, particularly throughout the second half. Paddy Considine can't be commended enough for this visceral, grim and undeniably impacting gut-punch of a debut. Highly recommended. You need to see this, and once you do, it will stay with you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An impressive directorial debut from Paddy Considine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having done some of his best work with director Shane Meadows, it's no surprise that first-time director Paddy Considine turned to the darkest areas of the human soul to find a story that is both violent and romantic, without ever confusing the two. The Meadows/Considine collaborations A Room for Romeo Brass (1999) and Dead Man's Shoes (2004) were an unsettling mixture of mental anguish and kitchen-sink drama, but Considine's debut, Tyrannosaur, keeps the tone firmly within the boundaries of the Ken Loach School of Gritty Film-Making, which help make this often gentle tale of two broken souls finding common ground often difficult to sit through.An expansion of Considine's BAFTA award-winning short Dog Altogether, Tyrannosaur follows Joseph (Peter Mullan), a heavy- drinking and unemployed widower with extreme anger issues. We first meet him being thrown out of a pub following an unseen altercation, after which he kicks his dog to death in the street in a blind rage. Further anti-social behaviour sees him end up in a charity shop owned by God-fearing Hannah (Olivia Colman). Joseph is abusive and possibly dangerous, but she decides to help him anyway. Hannah's apparently comfortable middle-class life is at odds with the tougher upbringing experienced by Joseph, and he initially scolds her for it. Yet as the charity shop evolves into something of a safe haven for Joseph, he comes to learn that Hannah's marriage to James (Eddie Marsan) is an abusive one, and that she has her own demons to face.The film certainly doesn't pull its punches. From the opening scene of witnessing the protagonist of the story brutally kill his own animal to a graphic rape later in the movie, Tyrannosaur is uncomfortable viewing but is never out to simply shock. The character of Joseph was based on Considine's father, but rather than being a carousel of unpleasant experiences torn from the directors memories, the film instead ponders whether a life wasted can be redeemed. Joseph and Hannah may seem to be complete opposites, but their shared disappointment in the life they have led and the suffering they have endured makes for a romantic bond that is both believable and profound. The relationship is given extra weight by the performances of the two leads. Mullan is uniformly excellent in a type of role he has done before, but Colman, who was up to this point of her career mainly known for her comedy work, is a revelation. An impressive debut work from an actor I have admired since I first saw him back in '99.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a fun movie but a very well made one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Man, saying Tyrannosaur is not a happy movie is quite an understatement. The main character is a rude and unlikeable man who beat and mistreated his overweight wife (the titular Tyrannosaur, she's dead), has an extremely hostile attitude towards his environment and to top it off is a raging alcoholic. He comes across a religious upper-class woman who turns out to have some problems of her own. The film has a very bleak color palette matching the bleak outlook on life of most people in this story. Though I would not really recommend this movie as a must see, I do have to say that it is well made and acted for what it is. But what it is, is a dark depressing film about people living on the edge of society who have a different state of mind than average Joe. Still a better watch than most American Comedies these days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE best film ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film to me, is the best film ever made bar none. There have been many great films and some are rated higher by critics and IMDb followers alike but I beg to differ. Paddy Considine's direction is flawless and the main three characters acting is a master class of how it should be done. Hard to imagine this coming out of Hollywood as it has no polish, just pure realism. Eddie Marsan is a loathsome character, played superbly but the other two main roles played by Peter Mullen and Olivia Colman are the best I have ever seen. Colmans performance always moves me to tears and why she did not get the Oscar is beyond me. The story is simple, raw and 100% realistic. The culture of violence on the estate, the rage and pity then ultimately hope will bring goose bumps up all over you. Watch this carefully, the attention to detail is breath-taking and I promise, it will leave a lasting impression that you cannot forget.Literally a masterpiece and master class of acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Violent Drama set in a Fictional Northern British City</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>TYRANNOSAUR offers a bleak picture of life in contemporary Britain. Joseph (Peter Mullan) is unemployed, with a tendency towards violence, who has contributed in no small part to his wife's early death (the Tyrannosaur of the title refers to his widow). He encounters Hannah (Olivia Colman), a middle-class woman working in a local charity shop, who offers to redeem him through prayer; initially he rejects the offer, but as the film unfolds he gradually becomes more and more involved with her. Hannah has as bleak a life as Joseph, having to cope with a violent husband (Eddie Marsan), who eventually rapes her. She stays at Joseph's house, and the two of them form a relationship, even though neither of them can disclose their feelings. Deliberately shot in washed-out colors, TYRANNOSAUR suggests that people are imprisoned by their existences, whether they are working- or middle-class. The only hope of 'redemption' - which is perhaps too optimistic a word - is to trust in one another, and even then, the redemption might be only temporary or partial. This is what Joseph and Hannah discover at the end, even if their meetings are only sporadic. Paddy Considine's film is not for the fainthearted; the language is extreme, and there are violent scenes throughout. It is well written, even though there are one or two implausibilities; at one point Joseph kills a neighbor's dog, who has previously mauled the child Sam (Samuel Bottomley). Normally any dog would have been put down by the authorities after such an incident has occurred. Nonetheless this low-budget film has a powerful effect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great emotional drama 7/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review: I really didn't know what to expect from this film because I only had seen it in a advert, but I am glad that I watched this well written movie with great performances from the actors and an emotional storyline that gives you a deep insight into the world of a man with a bad temper. You really do feel for the characters throughout the movie and when the story unfolds, you realise that Hannah is just as bad as Joseph. There are other parts to the story which makes it interesting and I liked that it showed that there was a human side to Joseph although he does go of the rails quite often. Hannah was a great addition to the storyline who also has her own problems which was why the two main characters really had great chemistry which was shown in the film. A Great Watch!Round-Up: I know that the movie is pretty old and that there isn't any massive actors in the film, but you should definitely give it a go. It's a very deep emotional drama which is quite explicit but very well made. Peter Mullan is very believable in his role and was pretty scary in some scenes, which the role needed. He has starred in movies like Harry Potter and War Horse &amp; Trainspotting so he has worked in some major blockbusters but he still hasn't isn't in the limelight. Olivia Coleman has been in many TV dramas and she had a role in the Iron Lady so she is obviously not a major player in Hollywood, but her part in this movie wouldn't have worked without her. Budget: N/A Worldwide Gross: $22,500 (Deserved much more!)I recommend this movie to people who are into there emotional dramas about 2 characters who are going through a bad time in there life. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll admit that during the first few scenes in the film I had my doubts. After watching Peter Mullan swear profusely before proceeding to kick a dog to death, I was somewhat curious as to which direction the film would take. However, being a Considine fan, I decided to stick with it.So about 10 minutes later I had come to the conclusion that I was in love with it. The interplay between Mullan and Colman just enthralled me in their first scene. The character development that took place deepened both character at a virtually identical time, and the relationships between all characters were progressed at the exact right pace.You have to give it to Considine here, his script is stunning. He answers any partial intrigue raised in the first half of the film extremely cleverly, without using obvious, direct means and instead giving the viewer enough information to resolve minor issues (such as the tension between Joseph and Marie) in their own heads.After about the initial 45 minutes of the film, Considine builds a strange kind of equilibrium. My timing is very imprecise here, but the point at which I'm referring to is where Hannah has temporarily moved in with Joseph. At this point, I felt safe. I felt like Hannah had escaped her issues. I felt like if the film had ended there I would have gone away with a warm fuzzy feeling. But it didn't.I don't want to spoil the ending, but suffice to say, it was astounding. The end sequence made my stomach turn and eyes haze over. What can I say, it was fabulous. A masterpiece. I truly hope that anyone who has watched this film will go away with Paddy Considine cemented in their heads as one of the best storytellers of the modern era.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Our protagonist Joseph (Peter Mullan), a deeply troubled man exhibiting typical alcohol-induced characteropathy (obsessive-compulsive character disorder), is introduced in the opening scene, when forcefully refused service in a local English bar drunken he soon takes out his frustration on his beloved canine companion. Joseph, unwittingly kicking his dog to death, falls in a bout of despair and self-loathing, losing the sole comfort he had in life. Uncomfortably spiralling in self-destructive tendencies he finds refuge in a used clothes store led by the pious Hannah (Olivia Colman), who attempts to bring solace to the visibly disturbed individual. Despite the crass demeanour and ruthless lack of sensitivity, Joseph falls off the hellish track, now finding weirdly idyllic comfort in Hannah's peculiarity. Nonetheless Hannah's religious path to perfection is brutally scarred by a inconsiderate and aggressive husband James (Eddie Marsan), who goes as far in disdain to urinate on the body of his sleeping wife.Bleek and overbearing by dysfunctional inertia "Tyrannosaur" turns out to be a surprisingly stunning character study in true British straightforwardness. No meandering about the issue of socially rampant brutally brings a brief glimpse into a different set of rules, one governed by beer with mates. Tyrannosaur is the not so sympathetic nickname for the departed wife of Joseph, but functions more as a symbolic extrapolation of his inconsiderate nature of a monster, who rampages through his surroundings unable to fully appreciate what he has. After her death Joseph is left distraught with realisation of how empty his life has become and now appreciates the inner beauty of his wife. The relation with Hannah brings a certain degree of hope, but also initiates a self-defensive mechanism as Joseph is certain that closer interaction will dissolve the initial angelic vision he has of her, leading him to initiate the same disrespect he directed towards his wife. The illusion naturally fails to withstand the onslaught of human faults, soon making Hannah from the protector to the one seeking asylum (a key role-reversal in the movie).Featuring tremendously disruptive performances by Coleman, Mullan and derisive Marsan, "Tyrannosaur" comes as a spectacular feature debut by Paddy Consisine. Mullan especially manage to portray a seemingly impulsive and loathsome individual with a misguided warmth buzzing underneath the couthness. Nonetheless the truly harrowing portrait by Coleman of a woman scorned becomes the true highlight of the forceful and touching debut. Her anguish is so palpable with a supremely memorable scene of rejection by Joseph a true candidate for scene of the year. A true moment of mundane cinematographic clarity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dinosaurs. Extinct creatures that once roamed the earth, big teeth, small arms, foul-tempered when they heard it was last orders at their local pub, apparently they thought that the meteor thing was just a pretext. What is it about violence? Poverty breeds violence; not just poverty in a material sense but poverty of the soul. Cruelty, oppression, hatred. What Paddy Considine's film attempts to encompass is the whole world through one man's story and his relationship with an unlikely soul-mate. A whole world of pain, regret and pure unrestrained evil. Where do love, hope, feelings fit into this world? There's simply no room for them and that's how violence is born into the lives of Peter Mullan and Olivia Coleman's characters. Perhaps structurally Mullan's character is actually drawn to Coleman's because he deeply regrets mistreating his own wife, that he is reliving the terror that he once caused in a woman who loved him from her perspective through this strange, tender yet conflictual new relationship. Why does Tyranosaur succeed with material that could potentially descend into melodrama? Perhaps the reason is that there is no condescending moral to the story, because the unsettling central character is both near and far, accessible and inscrutable. Maybe because the eye of the filmmaker is so clear and unblinking, so sensitive to the beating of the human heart.'The happiness of the human race in this world does not consist in our being devoid of passions, but in learning to command them.'

		<shortDescription>tough to watch but worth it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A grim and harrowing drama in the style of Ken Loach or Mike Leigh. The story begins with Joseph, played by Peter Mullan, who I loved in My Name is Joe, but I also know him from small parts in Trainspotting and Shallow Grave. Joseph is an angry man, and doesn't do a lot to endear the viewer to him in his first few scenes.Set in Leeds suburbs, Joseph meets Hannah, a middle-class woman of faith who works in a charity shop. Olivia Coleman plays Hannah. I didn't think it was possible for me to love her any more, but the woman can do anything, from making me laugh in Peep Show and Green Wing to making me cry in this movie and in Exile. She also played Carol Thatcher in The Iron Lady, although it took me a bit longer to recognise her, Meryl Streep said that she is "divinely gifted". She was half the reason why I was so looking forward to seeing this film. I can't wait to see what she does next, she is one of my favourite actors working at the moment.The other half of the reason why I was so looking forward to watching this film is Paddy Considine, the writer and director. I know him from his collaborations with Shane Meadows, who I can say with almost complete certainty is the best film maker to have come out of North Staffordhsire, England. Meadows and Considine are from towns about ten miles away from mine, and I think it might be required by local law that I like and support them. In the case of much better known, but considerably less talented Robbie Williams, this is a tough one, but not so with these guys, if you haven't seen This is England, go out and get it and watch it. Now. Go on.OK, now I'll assume you're back and have watched This is England, blown away, aren't you? If you're American you almost certainly will be. We had film night get-togethers in my old neighbourhood in Manhattan last year and I showed a group of Americans that film. They didn't know we had that sort of poverty, anger and racism in England. This has a similar feel ? it seems to me to be made very much for the British market.This story isn't autobiographical, but it is inspired by things Considine saw as he was growing up in the working class Midlands. There's lots of violence and unhappiness in this film. Joseph, and the viewer, have a first impression of Hannah that turns out to be wildly different from reality. She turns out to be not quite what she originally seems. The film is not fun to watch and there's a couple of very sickening, violent scenes. It's beautifully shot, though, and very well-told. Without giving too much away; bad things have happened to Hannah, and Joseph, on the face of things, is a bad man. But they find something good in each other and give each other support. There's a big shock (well I didn't see it coming) towards the end, and it doesn't really have a happy ending.Considine skilfully shows us Joseph's complex character and Hannah's grief and torture. Everyone involved with this film is incredible. I look forward to Considine's next film.more reviews http://claiready.wordpress.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So what?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The British film industry. While never being the juggernaut that is the American film industry, it can still give the world great films, many of which are highly regarded. Sure, many recent British films have been utter atrocities, but there are definitely many diamonds among the rough, the best of recent years being The Impostor. One reason that many British films have been poor is that they're too real. Sure, many films are aided by the fact they're realistic, but still have some element of escapism. However, these recent British films have attempted to reveal how modern Britain is 'Broken Britain', and how it isn't just something the tabloids write in order to sell more papers (because Britain was always perfect now, wasn't it?), and because of it while many are gritty and bleak, they are often boringly one-note and forget to entertain at all. This film unfortunately falls into that trap, as while it is gritty, dark and has collection of depressed, moody characters, you won't care due to how little it has to offer outside of that and by the end you go 'so what?'The story is that Joseph, a Scottish middle aged man, is having a rough life, getting into fights with teenagers, his neighbours and is resentful of everyone he meets. After one of his fights, he runs and hides in a charity shop owned by Hannah, who he resents due to her beliefs and her seemingly perfect life. However, as he comes to discover, she is more pain than he first thinks and takes her in, forming a strong friendship. Now while the story may sound interesting at first, it suffers from a major problem that affects the rest of the movie: it is so interested in piling on the darkness of their lives (i.e. Spoilers Joseph killing his dog, Joseph's best friend dying of cancer, Hannah being urinated on by her abusive one- dimensional husband, Hannah describing why she is infertile) that eventually you lose interest, due to how boringly one-note they become and the amount of plot holes that there are.(i.e. why doesn't Hannah divorce her husband, considering how vile he is to her? why doesn't anyone call the police when something bad happens?)This problem also affects the rest of the movie as well. The characters are either depressed, horrible, violent or a mixture of the three and while that make them seem more realistic, it doesn't make them in any more intriguing or interesting, as none of them ever extend beyond that. Sure, this isn't as bad as American Beauty where ALL of the characters were annoyingly whiny, despite their luxuries (which none of the characters have in this film), but they're still very uninteresting. It doesn't help that the acting, while good, isn't outstanding. Sure, there has been much written about how good Olivia Colman is, and how she should have been nominated for more awards than she was, but she isn't that good. Sure she's a great actress, but she's about as good as everyone else in this movie, which is good, but doesn't go beyond what her character is restricted to. Unlike another underrated female performance of Pam Grier in Jackie Brown, where everyone is great, but she was a standout who truly owns her role, Olivia Colman doesn't stand out, as she doesn't go beyond the restrictions of her character or show any personality in the role, much like everyone else.It doesn't help that none of these characters get any sort of redemption throughout the film. If Paddy Considine was to make all of this misery truly mean something, than he would've had these characters rise above it, and truly make something of their lives despite their problems. However, this never happens, and the characters don't really change that much. Sure this may be like "real life", but this sense of realism is hampered by the extremes these characters go to by the end of the film. (SPOLIER) For example, when Joseph's younger friend is attacked by a dog, he kills it, rather than letting it slide or calling the police. At least while there are hints that his character will change by the end, as he sends a letter to Hannah telling her that he is getting his life back on track, Hannah isn't so lucky. Instead of divorcing her husband or (again) calling the police to get him arrested for his abuse, she (SPOLIER) kills him, in a very violent manner I should add. I understand that she was still in love with him to get any help as there are relationships like that in the real world (even if I hope there aren't many couples similar to Hannah and her husband), but if she was that in love with them, would she have really gone to that extreme? It doesn't seem very plausible, as it is completely out of character for her. It's more worrying considering that (SPOLIER) despite being in prison, seems happier that he is gone. What kind of message is that sending out? That murder solves all problems? I understand that I'm probably reading too much into this, but that is what it comes across as.Overall, while the acting is good and there are some nice scenes here and there, there isn't enough in Tyrannosaur to make it worth watching, and by the end of this miserable bore, you'll feel like you've wasted an hour and a half of your life that you could have used more productively rather than making it become extinct by watching this film. Stick to acting, Paddy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a film as bleak and hopeless as this, where everyone is an abuser or being abused, and the only comforts seem to be booze and sex from your pitiful surroundings, the sudden emergence of a happy montage at a party is like a chink of light on a long, cold, dark night. Seasoned film goers though, will know something is up. Movies that are wall-to-wall depression as this is do not change direction halfway through, so those 'in the know' will take it for what it is: The Calm Before The Storm. And it does arrive. Get ready to be blown off your feet.The acting here is terrific. Peter Mullan plays a man who is difficult to like due to his racist and violent tendencies, but the more we hear from his back story, we understand he is the way he is. Olivia Colman is just flat-out phenomenal. Her portrayal of a wife subjected to the most humiliating tortures in her private life, and the fake smile she is forced to wear at her charity shop every day, is just heartbreaking, and alas is most likely more common amongst the population then you'd expect.There's a world out there, in council estates and slums, that we turn a blind eye to. It's full of druggies, alcoholics and various other dead-end losers, who's only ambition is to get their next 'fix', whatever that may be... and they don't care who they step on to receive it. Tyrannosaur depicts this brutal state of affairs in shocking detail, but it also reminds us, even in nice little middle class homes with picket fences and apple pies cooling by the window, that things might not always be so rosy. In fact, they can be even worse... 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A miserable little movie full of grubby, unappealing characters going about their violent, depressing little lives. This marks the directing debut of actor Paddy Considine (DEAD MAN'S SHOES) and he must be a right barrel of laughs if you get to know him.Admittedly, the film is well made, decently shot throughout and boasting a couple of fine central performances. Peter Mullan (RED RIDING HOOD trilogy) is exceptional as the booze-hardened widower whose life seems to be falling apart around his ears, while Olivia Colman brings the film's emotional heart as the put-upon spouse. The exceptionally sinister Eddie Marsan shows up as a really nasty piece of work.The one thing I don't like about these modern, grimly realistic sorts of film is the way they deliberately tinker with the audience's expectations. TYRANNOSAUR spends the whole running time setting up a confrontation that never arises, which is okay as a twist in itself, but it doesn't replace that confrontation with much of interest otherwise so you feel a bit let down by the ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The simplicity of the plot reminds us of the fact that modern filmmakers are not entirely bound by the notion of Hollywood narrative and the necessity to produce money. The film was incredibly refreshing and a joy to watch as it was probably the first among the films I've watched this year that gave me this impression. Peter Mullan was magnificent playing an emotionally unstable hot headed drunk. Mullan's acting is reminiscent of Jeff Bridges Oscar winning role on 'Crazy Heart'. Paddy Considine's debut masterwork was one of the greatest I've seen which is probably at par with other modern filmmakers such as the Coens and Aronofsky. Incredible music score as well as very interesting cinematography. I'd file this film among the top for this year and would highly anticipate Considine's subsequent works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A work of unnerving intensity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although the contours of first-time director Paddy Considine's Tyrannosaur are bleak and unforgiving, underneath the film's excess of anger lies what the poet Anne Sexton called so aptly "the awful rowing toward God." This "rowing" is visible in the struggle of Joseph (Peter Mullen), an unemployed widower, to discover a spark of the humanity that lies beneath his outward expressions of rage. Like the 2004 film Dead Man's Shoes in which Considine gave what is arguably his best performance as an actor, Tyrannosaur is a work of unnerving intensity and brutal realism, yet, in spite of its intermittent violent acts, is a surprisingly quiet film that has moments of warmth and humor, especially in Joseph's interaction with a little boy that lives next door.The poet Rumi says, "a rose's rarest essence lives in the thorn," but at first all we can see is the thorn. In the film's opening scene, we meet Joseph in a state of drunken rage kicking his dog to death (shown off camera) as Cinematographer Erik Wilson surrounds us with the grimness of Leeds in West Yorkshire, England. We do not learn specifically the source of Joseph's anger, but it is suggested that he feels guilty about how he treated his late wife. "I'm not a nice human being," he says matter-of-factly. Following a series of violent outbursts in which he shatters the window of an Indian clerk who had made a few critical remarks directed towards him, and an encounter with three young men at a pub that he berated for making too much noise, he wanders into a thrift shop run by Hannah (Olivia Colman), a kindly-looking clerk who, seeing his anguish, offers to pray for him.Her reward, however, is a tirade against her religion, how she has escaped from facing the poor, and how meaningless it is for her to try and comfort him. Deeply hurt by this, she returns home only to be confronted by her abusive husband James (Eddie Marsan), a sick individual who preys on weaker, vulnerable people. Accusing her of infidelity he physically attacks her, causing visible bruises to her face. Hannah pretends to Joseph that her bruises are the result of a fall, but he knows from experience that there is more to her story. Accepting Joseph's apology for his previous rant, she turns to him for protection and agrees to go to the hospital with him and say a prayer for a friend (Robin Butler), who is near death.This is not the start of a Hollywood-style romance in which everything neatly comes together at the end, but is only the beginning of the painful realization of two troubled souls that they need each other. Marked by exceptional performances by Peter Mullen (My Name is Joe) and by Olivia Colman, who was heretofore known only as a comic actress, Tyrannosaur is difficult to watch and emotionally draining, yet is about real people who slowly begin to discover a sense of their inner strength. While the film does not offer easy solutions, it allows us to discover, in the darkness of our own being, the power to face our demons, knowing that redemption does not lay in revenge, but only in acknowledging and taking responsibility for our actions that may have caused harm to others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is it about great British actors and brutally morbid directing debuts? Gary Oldman with Nil by Mouth, Tim Roth with The War Zone and now Paddy Considine with this. The story is here is of two broken people who come together briefly and find some small semblance of peace in each others' company. Joseph is filled with as much self-loathing as he is anger, prone to lashing out at others and then punishing himself later. Hannah is a woman of faith who volunteers at a charity shop where the two meet ? outwardly she is happy but some cruel remarks from Joseph hit deeply easily, revealing a much great hurt and pain within her.That's a very brief look at the plot and you can already see that we're not talking Friday night with some beers and a take-away with this film. The plot shouldn't be the thing to give you pause actually, because in terms of narrative the film is not perfect and indeed features one or two twists that I didn't particularly care for; this is not to say it is bad (because it most certainly is not) but just that the story is not the big selling point here. What is the main reason to come to Tyrannosaur is that it delivers such a harrowing portrait of two characters that it is hard to watch without being equally repelled and touched at the same time. In fact saying that makes me realise that this is a credit to the film in that you can really hate who Joseph is (and you will) but at the same time your feel for him in a way that would never even flicker across your mind if you met him in a pub. The film is at its strongest when these two characters are just allowed to be who they are ? and there is clearly a lot of writing and development behind them that doesn't come over in dialogue.Considine deserves credit as writer because I believe his understanding of his characters really informs the film. As director he positions the camera well and sets up his scenes effectively but it is in his direction of his cast that he does his best work. As a powerful actor himself, Considine really allows his lead pair to come out and deliver on their characters. OK, for Mullan Joseph is not a massive stretch ? indeed if you described the character to anyone familiar with UK cinema they would say the character should be played by him since he has done variations on this theme so many times. This is not to say that it is easy or that he doesn't deserve praise though, because he does, he doesn't feel like he is acting ? it feels like he is this person. Alongside him is a real powerhouse of a performance though; Coleman is excellent ? I can only assume that this film was not eligible for the 2012 BAFTA's for some reason because it is genuinely the only reason I can think of why she is not nominated for best actress. Her character is good in terms of structure and Coleman (Peep Show and other UK comedies) just seems to totally understand her and be able to convince in her skin. One scene in particular (you'll know it when it comes) is so intense and so emotionally raw that I found it almost unbearable to watch and even now tears well up a little when I think of it. Her performance here is tremendous whether it is in the smaller moments or the moments of anguish that flood out of her.Tyrannosaur is not a film to recommend but it is an excellent film. The focus is on these two broken people and, while the story is solid, the heart of the film is in just how real they are to the viewer. Considine seems to create an atmosphere of trust within the film because he draws great performances from the two leads and it is this that makes the film so hard to watch but yet equally rewarding in its own way. Brutally difficult viewing but in terms of quality acting and impact it is certainly worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is this tendency of phony naturalism in the so-called "social realism" sub-genre of British drama, namely based on combining gritty and even disturbing atmospheres and plot devices with feel-good conclusions and happy endings; and in some cases, redemption for characters whose actions would be considered unredeemable in real life. It is as if the screenwriters decided, after 90 minutes of depressing reality, that the subject matter was just too much for them to hold and they decided to open the door to optimism and faith in mankind. Which is obviously respectable in and of itself, but definitely does not belong here -- neither aesthetically, nor thematically.This incongruous combination of depressing development and uplifting conclusion is not at all a separate incident. I can see this in Jobson's redemption at the end of "Red Riding", in Juliet Aubrey marrying Robert Carlyle at the end of "Go now" (probably the most ridiculously implausible happy ending I have ever seen in a serious film), and even true crime cases painstakingly faithful to documented facts, such as "Appropriate adult", feel the need to give their conclusion some sort of an upbeat tinge.The man portrayed in this film kick-starts the plot, quite literally, by killing his own dog, admits he battered his wife and he would probably keep on doing it if she still were alive, and takes long -- too long -- to sum up the courage to stand up to the two male characters who do deserve his rage, with quite pathetic results by the way. The film even makes the effort to be realistic in its psychological portrayal of the character as a first-class scumbag: his cowardly methods of physical confrontation at the bar, or the fact that he only approaches the female lead after sniffing her low self-esteem and her vulnerability like a scent dog would. All of this against the backdrop of an ugly, unpleasant, boring and ultimately destructive lumpen suburban setting. So far, so good as far as realism goes.Then all of a sudden, there seems to be a hint of redemption and hope somewhere in the horizon, and it turns out the guy isn't a bad chap after all (and is even capable of acts of mature dignity), and life isn't all that miserable for these characters. Pardon me, but with all this set of premises, there is something that simply doesn't work in the film. Either the premises built up for over an hour don't work, or the film's character development and resolution do not work.Maybe it is just me, but if you want to film idyllic scenes of bucolic happiness with a tinge of melancholy, perhaps you'd better stick to Ealing Studios, or perhaps even better, to remaking Bambi.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joseph (Peter Mullan), divorced, destructive alcoholic meets Hannah (Olivia Colman), a believer and a somewhat naive woman that is humiliated and beaten by her psychopathic man James (Eddie Marsan). Hannah and Peter develop a friendship trying desperately to solve their problems but with fatal consequences. Still they manage to go further trying to build a future together.The debut of the 37-year-old talented and successful Paddy Considine as film director is brilliant. His film script mirrors the hardest things in human life. He portrays his characters with the realism and deep insight in social and emotional problems.Peter Mullan convinces strongly in the role of the unhappy man Joseph, dangerous in his abuse, but also empathetic seeking dignity and respect. I was horrified by the cruelty in some of the film scenes. It's always difficult for me to see animals and children suffer from abusing and confused adults. But unfortunately that's what happen in life. Tyrannosaur has got fantastic acting, a great script and a skillful direction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In grim 'Tyrannosaur', 'Save the Cat' becomes 'Kill the Dog'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The late screen writing guru, Blake Snyder, came out with a book a few years ago, entitled 'Save the Cat'. He argued that a successful screenplay should contain a 'Save the Cat' moment at the beginning of a script, where the hero ingratiates his audience through a humanitarian gesture (it could involve helping a person or even an animal; hence the term, 'save the cat'). Newcomer writer/director Paddy Considine turns Snyder's advice on its head by offering up the opposite: a 'Kill the Dog' moment. Rather than feeling sympathy for the protagonist, Considine seeks to alienate the audience from his protagonist and is quite successful?I can't recall a film in recent memory where not only one, but two dogs are actually killed by the film's protagonist.My pet peeve with 'independent' films these days, is that many protagonists don't like themselves. I call them 'sad sacks'. They're the type of characters that don't make for good drama, since their egos are weak, are always down on themselves, and have little or no charm. Considine's 'Tyrannosaur' goes a step further by offering up Joseph, the unemployed North England widower, who has a perpetual anger management problem. When he meets domestic violence victim, Hannah, who runs a charity shop, his harsh words toward her, are a very hard draught to take.Nonetheless, there is an even more despicable character than Joseph and that's Hannah's husband, James, the ultimate abusive husband. James' character is designed to shock as he's seen returning home one night, intoxicated, and ends up urinating over Hannah while she sleeps. He later rapes her and she reveals that he's placed shards of glass in her vagina in the past, causing her to become infertile. While the domestic violence scenes are admittedly powerful, they are also wholly manipulative, since James is merely a one-dimensional monster. It would have been much more difficult for Considine to humanize his villain. This also holds true for his secondary characters, the skinheads who live across from Joseph, who are also perpetually angry, and are not above goading a dog to attack a child.Considine attempts to humanize Joseph a bit as he ultimately softens up in his relation to Hannah. But in a cruel twist of fate-SPOILERS AHEAD-Hannah is jailed for murdering her abusive husband. While Joseph pays his respects at a funeral for a friend and visits Hannah in prison at film's end, this seems to indicate that he's 'cleaned up his act' somewhat; but is it enough to forgive him for past transgressions? Some would say, given his background, 'yes'. But to my mind, the horrible killing of the two dogs, is enough to reject Joseph out of hand. There are many people who had horrendous childhoods or difficult lives, who don't end up killing defenseless animals and subjecting others to continuous, psychotic outbursts. Considine seems to argue that characters like Joseph, should be given a 'free pass'; or perhaps people should be 'understanding', given the environment these characters come from.There are occasional strong moments in 'Tyrannosaur', especially the aforementioned domestic violence scenes. But there were some characters who were too one-dimensional (such as James) and others like Joseph, who I was inclined to have little sympathy for. Only Olivia Colman's performance as the brutalized Hannah, proved to be compelling and saved the film from a total unpleasant aftertaste. With so many films on the market, investing oneself in Joseph's journey, is not one I would care to take again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Mullan is one to take a very similar character in a number of his films, yet each is different in their own way and relate to the viewer a good new story.He leads the film along with Olivia Colman in a down to earth and very gritty movie based in Yorkshire (England), directed by Paddy Considine. We find Mullan's drunken violent character wishing to turn the page and relent, so finds solace in Olivia Colman's character's Christian &amp; charitable nature. However, not all is as it seems and the victim becomes the helper and the helper is one who really needs the help, trapped in a violent and frightening marriage with a dark secret.This isn't a film about directing as such, although is a debut for Considine who does a great job. The film is about the themes, acting and story, and that is a gem.It's harrowing to watch but still gripping. Certain aspects you've seen before, but it's a change from the celebrity obsessed film fare we're used to.It plays like a good theatre play, and there's lots to admire here. Olivia Colman as the main victim in this film (admittedly amongst a set of them) is fabulous in this role, and you'll ride the difficult emotional journey with her.I'd say give it a go if you're interested in some gritty drama. A good directorial debut, and Mullan is again great to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tyrannosaur ? CATCH IT (B+) Critically acclaimed British movie by first time director is more riveting, shocking and at times bizarre than you expect it to be. The concept is simple an old sort of bipolar man and a Christian woman with domestic abusive husband meet in unconventional manner and start to develop a friendship. The movie pushes the envelope every moment, when you think it's going to be dull story about two old people it pushes the limit by introducing the violent and disturbing scenes. I think it showed the real face of humanity and what we have turned into over the years. Peter Mullan &amp; Olivia Colman's performance is remarkable. They lived their characters and not for a second you will remember it's a movie. It felt like a documentary to me about their lives. In my opinion its one of the most realistic movie I have seen in recent year. If you have the stomach for hardcore reality, it's for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>English Actor Paddy Considine starred in one of my favorite movies of 2002 called "In America" about an Irish family's move to New York City. Now ten years later Considine has gotten behind the camera to directed his first feature called "Tyrannosaur" It's a brutally emotional punch to the gut, that will have you thinking about it for days.Peter Mullen plays Joseph an angry, rage filled older man who in the first scene, after being tossed out of a bar, kicks his dog a little to hard and kills it. Joseph is extremely lonesome after the death of his wife (and now his dog) he spews his anger and hate to everyone he comes in contact with. Every little annoyance seems to send him into a rage. He is however friendly with the neighbor boy who lives with his mother and thug-ish boyfriend. Joseph is unemployed and after mouthing off to the welfare office and smashing their front window he has a sort of panic attack. He seeks refuge in a Christian charity shop. This is were we meet Hannah played by Olivia Colman.Hannah is warm, caring, and offers to pray with him. Joseph just gives her the usual mouthful of insults. Hannah lives in a very nice part of town in a big house with a her husband James. We find out that all is not right in her seemingly perfect and easy life. James is fiercely controlling and an angry drunk. While Joseph uses his words to hurt people, James uses his fists.Joseph starts to hang around Hannah's shop and little by little they start to form this weirdly intense relationship. It's not a sexual one, but they really connect in a real deep down primal way. They are both extremely damaged people, who are reaching out for someone to bond with. When James stops by the shop and sees his wife help Joseph try on a suit, he becomes enraged. Unlike Joseph though he never shows this side to anybody but Hannah and it's no different here. He promises that he will get her when she gets home. The things James does to his own wife are quite disturbing and Hannah does something that is equally unforgivable in the eyes of the law.Joseph is a very complex man and although his introduction is quite jarring and violent we begin to see that he really is an honorable man deep down, but he puts up such a hard front that its hard for anybody to see it. The ending of the film really makes you question what is right and what is wrong. It's not really a happy ending or is it? "Tyrannosaur" is available on Netflix watch instantly so see it tonight!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb - harrowing yet deeply moving debut from Paddy Considine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A tale very in keeping with the wonderfully talented Paddy Considine's work. Brilliant performance from Peter Mullan and Olivia Coleman is a revelation, heartbreakingly vulnerable as the battered wife. I'm not sure of the name of the actor who plays her unpleasant and possibly schizophrenic husband but he is very creepy and thus plays his unsympathetic role very well. I seem to recall some time ago a film critic speak of how unfathomable he or she found it that Coleman was not even nominated for a BAFTA, though I cannot confirm this. She should have been if she wasn't. I've always liked her but here she was able to really show her range. I am typing this as I write and have no idea how things will turn out with thirty minutes or so to go which is no bad thing at all. I suspect there will be a twist or two before the credits role. Hats of to Paddy Considine for an excellent debut as director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Am Slightly Uncertain About 'Tyrannosaur' Because Even Though It Is Intensely Portrayed and Unflinchingly Dramatized, I Wish It Had Cut Deeper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since I'm evidently having troubles in beginning my review, I shall try to make my job easier by putting in another movie to clear my own understanding on 'Tyrannosaur'. The second movie was also a British film that came out in 2009 and starred Colin Firth as a gay professor suffering from melancholic depression, plus it was made by a first time director who is also a fashion designer. Yes, I'm talking about 'A Single Man' which made a quiet reception on the box office but was commended by critics for Colin's heartbreaking performance. In spite of loving the film and Firth's performance, I did realize that the film circumscribed itself to three or four major characters and intended largely on creating an atmosphere. 'Tyrannosaur' does the same thing by limiting its scope to Joseph and Hannah's characters or rather their perspectives and leaving out all extraneous details. We don't know much about Hannah's husband except that he is rich, jealous and dastardly; we also do not get much details of Joseph's life since the script limits us to witness his perpetual aggression. It could all have been dangerously one note had Olivia Coleman and Peter Mullan not made their characters so engaging and uncompromising. Like Colin Firth and Julianne Moore in 'A Single Man', they don't make their actions and dialogs seem 'movie-like' (think a 'Tarantino' film) but sustain the tense suburban atmosphere requisite for 'Tyrannosaur'.The movie is about Joseph, a middle aged man with a dangerous mind ? he is violent, foul-tempered, vituperative, and alcoholic. Before the opening credits begin, we already hear F and C expletives from him as he leaves the bar in a drunken state. He kicks his own dog so hard in the ribs it dies despite his attempts to save him. He is always in the 'attack then repent' mode until he meets Hannah at her store where he hides after assaulting some teenagers. Hannah behaves at first like a woman who will do good for others always and Joseph condemns in quite a colorful language this clichéd nature of hers. Joseph's impact on Hannah proves life-changing for her and she realizes that having total faith in God and believing he will do good isn't any use and that she had to take up matters in her own hands (her pathetic childless marriage). This unleashes the rage inside her which she had repressed for so long; on the other hand, for Joseph things begin turning around as he takes the initiative to stop pitying himself.The title of the movie that has been debated by many for being hastily chosen, foolishly chosen, deliberately chosen to give an 'Indie' appeal and for some, completely wrong as the movie had no dinosaurs in it. I do agree that the director Paddy Considine has picked out a remote idea for the film's title and its more because the film does not venture much in giving us enough background details. The motif of Joseph's late wife and the similarity between her and Hannah should've been more pronounced. Paddy does give us clues about Joseph's relationship with his wife, especially in that small moment where his sister quips "Doesn't this remind you of something?" or something like that when a battered Hannah comes to her place and he asks his sister what should he do with her. And then there is the conversation between Hannah and Joseph later, but it's all too fine for a motif that is the title of the film. Then comes the relationship between Hannah and Joseph: How shall this be critiqued? What is shown to us seems disturbing and spooky enough to make us wonder whether Hannah should've ever met Joseph. I also want to point out the motif of prayer that was constantly spoken of in the beginning could've had more development as the plot progressed. The plot duration itself is a bit sketchy as if we take that Hannah had spent a couple of days with Joseph, how is it that the truth came out so late; surely suspicions are bound to arise when 'the house seems quieter than usual and people don't show up at work' (I'm trying my best to avoid any spoilers). And let's completely forget about the Muslim shop owner angle and overlook the fact that cops rarely seem to appear.Coleman is so darn good here ? take that scene where Hannah's husband arrives at the garments' store just as she puts a tie around Joseph's neck. Her husband threatens to deal with her once she returns home (he doesn't say this aloud as Joseph is present) while Joseph watches her reaction from the changing room. Coleman conveys Hannah's fear and tremulousness so convincingly not just through her face but also through her body movements we totally feel for her character. It's a shame I didn't notice her the first time I watched the disappointing Iron Lady (I like most other viewers was gushing at how good Streep was). Even there, she convincingly reacts to her mother's demential condition. And Mullan does a fine job of making Joseph seem as a man haunted, enraged, trapped and dictated by his past actions. The cinematography is another noteworthy thing ? the flat, gray, bleached look to highlight the grittiness of the film. In a scene where Hannah drinks nonstop out of frustration and fear, as the lights keep flashing on her, for a moment it seemed the color of her eyes changed to bright yellow (maybe I'm just imagining) similar to an effect in the movie 'Black Swan'.Tyrannosaur is intense and difficult to digest, and the performances go hard. Maybe it would've cut deeper had a few more minutes been added (especially towards the ending) to do its themes more justice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It took me 3 starts to get past the clothes rack. The tenor of the movie is gloomy and, from the start, portends of bad things and pain to come. As the story unfolds we find out that Hannah is truly the one in need and as the role reversal between Hannah and Joseph unfolds, one can not help but go back to Hannah's prayer for Joseph cowering behind that clothes rack. She asks The Lord to touch his heart and believes that He has brought "Robert" to her to help him find his way. How ironic that proves to be.The acting was superb, but Olivia Colman's portrayal of a battered wife was incredible and a difficult delight to experience. Being American, I found the accents difficult to parse at times, yet even without that understanding the emotion and pain was unmistakable.Truly an exquisite example of film making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very occasionally, a film leaves one indelibly and profoundly affected. I simply went straight to bed after watching 'Tyrannosaur' and "thought" myself to sleep.In one of the most remarkable pieces of film-making I've ever seen, Peter Mullan sort of reprises his character in 'My Name is Joe'. Except, behind this alcoholic, instead of the softer cement behind the brick wall persona of Mullan in My Name is..., in this, behind this brick wall is hardened granite.I had seen a snippet from the beginning, where Mullan comes out of the pub and takes his anger out on his dog, on some preview or chat show but I hadn't linked that with this movie. But, I could place it immediately and it helped me set the tone and style of what was to come.Paddy Considine's debut directorial is amazingly assured and the extraordinary frankness and depth of acting his actors that he extracts is astonishing. The brutal vulnerability that TV comedy actor and feature film 'novice' Olivia Colman portrays is heart-rending and emotionally shattering.One is always sitting on a knife edge, when watching and though the pace kind of settles us, we are really are as anxious as the characters. One is kind of glad when it has finished but somehow want more. I sat in front of a blank screen in the dark after for five minutes.In many ways, I strongly agreed with much of Joseph's (Mullan) rantings, about God, religion and do-gooders. I initially saw what he did in Hannah's (Colman) rather pathetic and cosy life and I, like him, became to be ashamed of myself for thinking that. That we are so beset by what's on the cover of one's persona and not what's underneath.You could at least say that there was reasoning behind all of Mullan's actions, however twisted and distorted by Life itself. But, of course, it is Hannah's home life that takes the movie by the scruff of the neck and the always creepy Eddie Marsden as her husband plays what he plays best; an evil and plain nasty man.The black picture that Consadine paints is one that fires every emotion and then some more not yet discovered by medical science. If you're not rocked to your bones by this film, well, I think you know where I'm going with that one.Yes, it is an often brutal, savage, even depressing at times film that has four letter swear words, including the "c" one falling about like confetti. Most people don't use language like that, but people do and just because our lives aren't like theirs, that doesn't mean that some people's aren't. Of course they are - and like that outward book cover that I touched upon, these people are just everyday human beings, trying to make something of their lives and really, that's all we're all doing, right?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Review:Here comes another British movie, i think 2011 have been one of the very best year for the British cinema as we have seen such outstanding movies coming out. And you can also say that 2011 has been the best year for the debut directors as well. Tyrannosaur is not a movie about Dinosaurs but somewhat the exact behavior and situations in our own lives. This movie marks the directorial debut of an actor, Paddy Considine who is a very fine actor and a breakthrough filmmaker as well. This movie is based on the short film he made a few years ago that won many awards all over starring the same actors playing the same characters. Its been said that this movie depicts somewhat same conditions that Considine himself grew up with while its not entirely an autobiography. I think i wasn't prepared to watch a movie like this when i did, it left me feeling shocked as hell. The low rating i gave to this movie is because of that, its not a bad movie or a masterpiece but a very good one but too uncomfortable. This year offered many movies that challenged viewers, i have had many experiences watching movies that were quite unsettling and challenging. Here is the case where every bit of the movie left my every bit of mind and heart feeling not so good. I don't think if a movie is too uncomfortable that is a bad thing or that i wont watch it, i love the experience. This is a movie which is violent in every way, not just the fact where you'll see people beaten to death but also the characters beaten down by their life, their luck and fate and the situations. Almost everyone is one hundred percent drunk and you'll hear like ten swear words in a minute or so.Joseph is a lonely man, who is unemployed and a widower. He is an active drunk too and all the hate, anger, rage and violence is driving him to a self destructive path. The anger and violence is filled in Joseph, to a point where you will see him beating his own dog to death and after that burying him. You will detect a slight difference of attitude in him once this incident happens, a moment where he is almost closed to kill some people at a local pub, he controls and stop himself. He forces himself to run here and there scared of his own self wanting to change his life and a way to get out of his unpleasant past and everything around him. Joseph played wonderfully by Peter Mullan crashes into a charity clothes house, he hides himself in between two racks of clothes. That shop is owned by a very kind and Christian woman Hannah played superbly by Olivia Coleman who takes pity on him, she prays for him and Joseph for a split seconds feels like a big load has been lifted from his shoulders. They later seem to develop a friendship bond, Joseph not knowing anything about Hannah, her past and present that seem to coincides with his own. Little does he know that the feel of redemption that he feels in her presence, she herself has a deep dark secret that may take him back to the path which he has been running away from. Hannah is married to James played by Eddie Marsan who once again plays a near psychotic douche bag kind of a character, he doesn't even believe on himself or is too confident about his own manliness when he suspects something going on between Hannah and Joseph, he beats Hannah violently and rapes her. Joseph not just take a deep interest in Hannah but on his neighbor too, a very young child who is threatened to death by his crazy step dad not different from James.This movie has some outstanding performances, first of all, Olivia Coleman. She is a scene stellar, the kind of performer that grabs and holds your attention for the entire movie. I loved her performance and think all the acclaim she got is so deserving. From her sympathetic Christian woman and quite innocent but still somewhat darker image at the beginning to the woman who regularly survives domestic violence and tries to move on with it hiding her bruises from the world. Her character goes many changes and she seems to go with it. A brilliant job worthy of awards. Petter Mullan who i hardly remembered until i saw Children Of Men once again did a fantastic job, like Coleman his performance is something i would consider the best of his career. He plays it so effortlessly that you fall into this illusion that he might be exactly like this in his real life. Outstanding performance by both of them. Eddie Marsan who i think is another wonderful actor gives one of the best supporting performance of his career since Happy Go Lucky. He is the kind of a man you just hate the core but he does it perfectly. One thing is for sure that in the beginning when Joseph seems like a unlikable, violent and angry man that slowly fades away towards the end when you find even more ugliness in people around him.Rating: 3.5/5 B-**FULL REVIEW on my Blog: Hollywoodandme.Blogspot.com**</fullReview>

The scenes are realistic without being graphic, you don't ACTUALLY see the crimes being committed, only a camera shot of some kicking, someone moving, never the 2 connected, get the picture? Put this film into context, when America are destroying the world in the name of "freedom, democracy and Israel", we get lots of feel good forget everything dry American comedies and utterly obvious war propaganda films. Either way, I can even hear Americans screaming "no more yanki teen flicks , no more Shia Leboef and Nicholas Cage".In short, a breath of fresh air to be entertained and have some soul searching done in one go. Great piece of Brit cinema, putting the yanks to shame with their crud "lucky number slevin" and remakes of everything that didn't need to be remade. Miss this film at your own loss.

		<fullReview>Paddy Considine's self-penned directorial debut is a strong film. It's not another Nil By Mouth; this isn't a telescopic view of notable characters of the underclass. With its modern estate, and mixed-class protagonists convening at a charity shop the shackles of social document are removed. The film becomes a character study. Peter Mullan's Joesph is a violent man, but is he a bad man? Can Olivia Colman's ardently Christian housewife support the piety that she talks? Are the dogs deserving of their masters, of their fates?As in Mike Leigh's tradition of a script pursuing its characters, rather than the other way around, the film unfolds. People are revealed - not with secrets but with truths that confront the assumptions that one might usually make. For all the violence that it does have in it, its not a violent film; there's only one real surprise, or 'twist'.The acting is uniformly of the highest standard, even from the little lad Samuel Bottomley. The principals in tandem are rather fine. Olivia Colman manages a disconcerting oscillation between girl and woman, between the fragility of neediness and the world's weight. Peter Mullan is in his own league in his desperate but nonetheless sure grip on dignity, on reality. Dan Baker and Chris Baldwin's eclectic score is interesting too. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paddy Considine is just someone you've got to hate down to sheer old fashioned jealousy . Some men you must hate because they've got a chick who they obviously don't deserve . The hatred for Considine is different because he can write a screenplay , and can act most British actors of his generation off the stage , television screen or the silver screen . In short the guy is too talented and reminds you that life is not fair. Like a few other British actors who are too talented for their own good like Tim Roth and Gary Oldman to name but two Considine has turned his talent to directing and one can't help thinking these over talented thespians are part of a conspiracy By this I mean they're conspiring to make the world's most depressing film . Oldman tried to have a go with NIL BY MOUTH and Tim Roth beat him with THE WAR ZONE . Now it's Considine's turn to pull his sleeves up and brutalise the Indie cinema going public with TYRANNOSUAR , a rabid dinosaur of a film with bloody sharp teeth that wants to rip its audience apart The story for want of a better word revolves around Joseph played by the patron saint of kitchen sink dramas Peter Mullen who lives on a hellish council estate populated by low life inbred chavs . The dialogue is mainly composed of threats where the F word and the C word feature prominently. Laugh ? I thought I'd never start . And I didn't because I was too busy phoning The Samaritans</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've always considered films to be a form of escapism, not necessarily all Doris Day and happy endings but at least a positive experience. Silly me. Apparently it is the film maker's duty to drag us through the mire of the most repugnant examples of human behaviour. The main character in this film, Joseph, is a violent and thoroughly unlikeable piece of work, especially if you're a dog lover. His 'saviour', Hannah, is an appealing but tragically depressing figure and her husband nothing short of bestial. I don't know about you but I don't need to have my nose rubbed in the misery of the human condition. In short, this film should come with a health warning - watching it may have you reaching for the nearest sharp instrument. And I thought Oliver Stone was depressing .......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the directorial debut from actor Paddy Considine, and his second time as writer, he had success writing Dead Man's Shoes, and I heard very good things about this film because of the performances, particularly about the actress, and I was happy to see it was rated five out of five by the critics, so I had to see it. Basically Joseph (War Horse's Peter Mullan) is a lonely, unemployed, bitter and foul-mouthed alcoholic who is destroying himself with his drinking habit, his anger feuds and bouts of violence, one instance of his rage even sees him kick his own dog to death, but this may all change soon. One day he is being beaten up by a gang, and afterwards he hides in a charity shop in amongst the clothes, and the sole volunteer worker there, Hannah (Peep Show's Olivia Colman) offers him some help, which he initially shuns, and she prays to god for him. Joseph admires her belief in the lord above and sees her as some sort of redemption and escape from his misery, so he returns to the shop, but ends up insulting and upsetting her, so for a while she does not care much for his company, but slowly they start to understand each other. It is after Hannah does him a kindness by praying for his friend who is dying of lung cancer that they she really takes pity on him, and they eventually become unlikely close friends, but the Christian woman has secret demons of her own, she is a victim of domestic violence as her husband James (Eddie Marsan) verbally and physically abuses her. It is after one particular severely violent night, where she is raped and ends up with a hideous black eye that she has left her home and seeks help from Joseph and he allows her to move in with him for a while, and this gives them the opportunity to spend more time together, including at the funeral and wake of his friend who passed away. One conversation sees them talk about his wife who suffered from diabetes, and he mentions an inappropriate joke that she reminded him of a tyrannosaur, like the one in Jurassic Park; her weight he joked made ripples in glasses of water, like in the film, he states that he both and hated at the same time. There was a time when Joseph and Hannah went to her house so she could collect her stuff, but she ran away knowing her husband may be there, so Joseph borrows her key to go into the house and sort the situation himself, and in the quiet house he eventually gets a big shock, he finds James has been stabbed in the neck and bled to death. Hannah defended her reason for killing her husband mentioning the rape and understand that she will face the consequences, and we see Joseph finally bring down his damaged shed and kill the violent dog from across the road who attacked the young boy who looked after him, and the years pass to see that he has made himself a better man getting work and her in prison but they still see each other when he visits. Also starring Ned Dennehy as Tommy, Sally Carman as Marie, Samuel Bottomley as Samuel, Paul Popplewell as Bod, Sian Breckin as Kelly, Robin Butler as Jack and Paul Conway as Terry. Mullan gives a brilliant performance as the often unsympathetic drunk, and Colman is fantastic as well as the sweet middle-class faith believing housewife who suffers horrible abuse from her nasty husband, most people thought she would be nominated a BAFTA or Oscar, they make a compelling duo despite their obvious differences in opinion and personal troubles. The film is pretty much built on the relationship between the two lead characters and their personal demons bringing them together, I can see the comparison with Nil by Mouth because of the similar bleak subjects, including the inclusion of violence and abuse, but this film is not the same at all, it is gripping and a must see, not for the fainthearted but a sensational drama. It won the BAFTA for Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director or Producer for Considine and Diarmid Scrimshaw. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as it should have been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Tyrannosaur last week, and was prompted to sign up to IMDb just to write a review of it as I feel people are overrating this film somewhat. To kick off, I'm a big fan of the film Dead Man's Shoes,which the director, Paddy Considine, co-wrote with the one and only Shane Meadows, so I was expecting something fairly special, but I couldn't help but feeling slightly let down by Tyrannosaur. There are a few things wrong with this film imo. The direction is pretty much non existent, there were hardly any distinctive visual shots or sequences, which considering that Considine has a degree in photography was a bit disappointing. Also I think that the film as a whole seemed to be a bit flabby and could've done with tighter editing to make it more concise, more seamless. Perhaps the film's strongest suit is in the writing. The characters were interesting and 3 dimensional and there were some funny scenes, especially the one's featuring Joeseph's Irish mate, and I have to say that the last twenty minutes of the film were pretty engrossing. All in all it struck me as an actor's film as oppose to a filmmaker's, the emphasis was on the characters first and foremost everything else was secondary. I've no doubt that Paddy Considine will go on to make a great film one day, as Tyrannosaur did show some promise, especially in the script, but it struck me as a film made by a director still trying to find his film-making voice, he would've perhaps been better off following the path of his good friend Shane Meadows in making a few more short films first to develop this before attempting to make a full feature film. Still, definitely worth seeing, and better than a lot of other films currently being shown at the cinema. An above average but not great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not buying the hype.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A big disappointment, I thought it was pretty miserable and not in the way it was supposed to be. There were interesting themes it kept tapping on, but Paddy Considine never fully delved into them. As someone who has first-hand experience with the idea of a morally reasonable person who suffers from rage issues, I thought the opening of the film was fascinating and at the start it looked like it was going to really dig into that kind of a mind. I was looking forward to seeing this play out, but as it went on Considine strayed further away from that and turned it more into this ridiculous vigilante piece. I was just grabbing my stomach in laughter by one of the more violent scenes towards the end.Considine presents it as this natural character study but it's absolutely absurd and I don't think it gets nearly as deep into the characters as it acts like it does. The performances are fine, but the writing prevents them from getting anywhere truly great. Each of them has an impressive scene here and there but the characters are so improperly written that they have nowhere to really go. Add in the fact that the choices of music are some of the most wildly inappropriate possible for the tone he was attempting to establish and the whole thing is this awkward mess with little glimmers of hope popping up occasionally. As far as I'm concerned, Considine should really stick to acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like misery just because of misery, then you might like this movie. But I hated it and stopped watching after 40 minutes. What's the point of this swearing all the time? In each sentence the word f*ck is used numerous times. I don't care if this is realistic, it's just plain silly and boring. The scenery and the photography is also not impressing at all. Everything is ugly in this world. I don't mind ugly things, in fact I can enjoy them but please balance them with beauty. But that's something the English don't understand, they like to loose themselves in their own depressing environment. The more you suffer, the better. And this stupid woman who lets herself verbally abuse in her poor shop...oh come on, kick that bastard out!An old fashioned Christian view on life, I can't believe this is produced in 2011?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wouldn'd watch it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review may appear useless to most people, since I have only watched one minute of the movie. It begins with a man beating up his dog to death. Just because he was angry at someone. Killed the dog. I walked away. Whatever could possibly be the rest of it. That scene made me feel horrible. If that was the purpose, you've done well from minute 1. It's not that I am such an animal lover, neither do I have a problem of a person beating up another one in the movie (all for the sheer purpose of entertaining us, viewers). But this just made me feel I've been spit into my face. So, I am writing this just so you'd be ready for what is waiting for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a Christian or redemption film----swearing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film starts out with a man coming out of a bar. He is swearing a lot and not just any words. He Keeps say Fu__K and swearing at everyone. It appears he got kicked out of the bar.This all starts in a few seconds of the film. I do not believe any one that wants to promoted redemption in a movie would have this kind of language and it the maker got awards for it, the people that gave it to them are nuts.I have seen a number of films one called The Encounter. There is nothing like the filthy, language film.Forget about it don't watch it, it is offensive.</fullReview>
