		<shortDescription>A lovely film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd never heard of this until a few weeks back. I saw it last week on video. What a lovely film. It treats its subject matter with real sensitivity. The performances are believable, especially by the two Polish brothers (who made the film as well)as Siamese twins who have shacked up in a hotel for reasons initially unknown, while Michele Hicks is really sweet as the only person who will befriend them. The mood and pace is slow and beautifully graceful. A nice change from shallow, dumb blockbusters, Twin Falls Idaho is a very touching, tender film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not until recently, on route to Yellowstone, did I realize there is Twin Falls, Idaho</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A story about a grown-up pair of Siamese twin brothers - one does wonder. "Twin Falls Idaho" is a quiet yet possibly disturbing film (only if one is uncomfortable with the idea of looking at a pair of conjoined twins' physical features, which was actually only subtly featured). It is thought provoking and calmly sentimental. Well-written, acted, and just the right dosage, I felt. It's a tender story about brotherly love, man and woman young love, sons and motherly love - full of humanity. The natural delivery of everyone in the movie, including Penny's friend, the doctor who gave a routine check up on the twins - there's a casualness and ease to his brief performance. Michele Hicks somehow fits perfectly into the role of Penny - there's just the enough measure of beauty and heart demonstrated by her acting. There's also her low voice, the way she talks; her lean figure, the way she walks. Along with the ever fascinating to watch Leslie Ann Warren, 'tis blessed casting. The Polish brothers are themselves remarkable. How they delivered such poignant sensitivity about a pair of attached Siamese twins, when they themselves were not, is amazing. Michael Polish directed this script that he wrote with brother Mark. It's not Hollywood, not action movie. It is independent film flavor. It has no glamour - it does have some artistic camera angles and a dreamlike flashback sequence. But it is an intriguing film to experience, at its own pace, without rushing anything. The tone and mood, and the dim photography might suggest otherwise, but there is suspense and a secret to unfold. It all comes together naturally, with its slow dance. Its ending? Go see for yourself - it's an experience that would worth your while.Applause to the Polish Brothers and everyone involved in the production of this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say this because I almost made the fatal mistake of classifying this movie with the sentimental, depressing, and whiny ones, based on the little I'd heard about it. Call me prejudiced, which I am (and thank goodness, this wonderful film cured me of some of those symptoms), but at first, the idea of watching a movie about a girl and a pair of Siamese twins was not that appealing. It took some recommendation from friends whose opinions I value highly to overcome those inhibitions and to decide to brave whatever disappointment might come out of this venture. I now thank those friends for the good and true word.The beautiful Penny (Michele Hicks) tells her friend that somehow the Falls twins were not ugly, and I couldn't agree more with her: the Falls brothers, with their neat dress and meek manners, are simply adorable. The strong bond uniting them is another attraction (anyone on especially close terms with their sibling(s) would understand this). I found it shocking that Penny's lawyer should think it rude that the twins should whisper constantly to each other; for me, it showed an intimacy that couldn't be imitated by anyone else, and beyond the reach of any convention.The Polish brothers have done an inimitable job; some of the details would never have occurred to one who has grown up on her/his own. And it was nice to see quite distinct personalities developed for each of the Falls twins that went beyond their talents/interests.Focusing on this kind of specific peculiarity might be what gives this story such an expressive power, to make us think about the various kinds of being "different" or relationship in general. On this other hand, it is a shame that the subtler overtones of the story can easily get buried because of this very focus, and scare some "fun"-loving people away.I later read an interview about the movie and the creators' account of some of the imagery and the design of the movie, but such explicit detailing has taken away some of the charm I had felt for what I had believed were natural/innocent things, rather than improve my opinion of the movie. So take this advice (although it might already be too late if you're reading this) and go see it for yourself, before exposing yourself to anything that could disenchant you! I promise that you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Five Stars out of Five--A Wonderful, Beautiful Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Twin Falls Idaho" is a dream-haunter of a film! Lovingly and meticulously directed by Michael Polish and written with quiet brilliance by Mark Polish (with help from twin brother Michael), this gentle, soft-spoken film is one of the three best films of 1999. The imagery in the film is often gritty and stark, pointing out subtext to the audience without utilizing masks or shadows. It's a wonderful story about the nature of relationships; about love and marriage and "divorce"; and about the lives of those unfortunates society labels as "different", and the realization that they are not so different as society may have initially supposed. The acting is superb; the Polish brothers are completely believable as the conjoined twins Blake and Francis Falls, performing feats like deftly buttoning up each other's shirts or playing the guitar together (Blake strums while Francis manages the fret for chord changes) as if they had, indeed, done it all their lives. As the film rolled on, I found myself loving these two guys as unique and colorful individuals, and empathizing with their plight. And the often-used "Hooker with a Heart" character Penny is given new light and life by Mark Polish's careful crafting of the character and by Michelle Hicks edgy yet warm performance. If you're like me, "Twin Falls Idaho" will leave you awake nights, thinking long and long. I look forward to seeing what the Polish brothers will do next, either collaboratively or on their own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I kept holding my breath while watching this movie. Not like being underwater or anything like that but more like kissing the love of your life or holding your own child in your arms for the first time. Like that. I had to remind myself to breathe. Twin Falls is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. Finely crafted to the extreme, delicately directed, with performances that absolutely broke my heart. The Polish brothers have created something truly remarkable here, and Michele Hicks, in her first film performance, is amazingly stunning and talented. Twin Falls is definitely a work of art!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the 5 best movies I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I caught the beginning of Twin Falls, Idaho one evening while flipping past the Independent Film Channel. I was immediately hooked by the story. The acting was absolutely riveting, and while the plot may have been slow to develop, and even a bit predictable, there was an intangible quality about it that kept my eyes glued to the screen.Michele Hicks is brilliant in a difficult role. My heart nearly broke when she was shunned by the Falls brothers. Lesley Ann Warren was excellent as the cliche mother. But the real kudos belong to the Polish brothers, who were responsible for the writing, acting, and directing. I was convinced that the story they told was real when I first saw them. The bond they display on screen is definitely not contrived. I was completely blown away by the tenderness and understanding they shared.All in all, one of the 5 best movies I have ever seen. It is rare for me to be so completely gripped by a movie as I was when I saw this one. And yet, I just couldn't tear myself away. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Twin Falls Idaho" is amazing not just for how much really good material it packs into its first hour, but for how it parlays all that good material into even better material for the film's second half. Although Francis Falls tips the movie's hand when he gives us his thoughts about sad endings that become happy endings, the unexpectedly original way in which these thoughts are illuminated is a genuine treat.And what can be said about the acting? Neither Michael nor Mark Polish strikes a false note in what could have been embarrassingly showy turns. The quiet intensity of their attachment to one another and their relationship to the world around them. Michelle Hicks also finds a way to turn a character who could have been an instant cliche into a person whose feelings we care about.This film is a rare gem you will want to see more than once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is still haunting me, even long after watching it for the first time. It depicts a rare insight into the exclusivity of sibling relationships and utilises a neutral tone that ironically intensifies every second of the story. Although the movie skims slightly upon cliches, that only helps to familiarise the audience with the plot so that they don't feel too alienated by the mystery of the twins. This most certainly is a treasured oddity in the video store.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I drove sixty five miles one way to see this film and itwould have bargain at twice the distance. This film issuperbly written and acted and I see no flaws. The premise which is cojoined twins played by the Polish brothers, identical twins, is original and delivered with a poignancy that is rare. I spoke to a couple of people after the film who said they thought they would be uncomfortable with the subject and were for a couple ofminutes but then became totally involved and forgot. Iwill not go into the storyline as this is a film you should enjoy as it unfolds, but I caution you to pay attention as there is alot to be appreciated in watchingthe intimacy between these brothers as well as the dialogue, sometimes almost inaudible between the brothers. The film also offers analogies, puns, metaphors, and an interesting array of supporting characters. There is also alot of "hidden" humor so watch carefully. Although there is alot of sadness in the film, the overall feeling after was uplifting. This film was on my mind for days and I think it was the first thing I brought up in conversations. This is a MUST SEE for anyone that enjoys film that are not standard fare. I amlooking forward to adding it to my video collection. FOURSTARS!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Twin Falls, Idaho" is a very well made film with unusual depth and complex emotional content. It is absolutely a must see for anyone wanting more than your usual Hollywood fodder and fluff. A different sort of Love Story and a gritty look at a uniquely off-center topic. The Characters are often somewhat surreal, but not to the point of being ridiculous or unbelievable, this said same surrealism serves to make the imagery and story all the more powerful. The Hopeful and "Best of Humanity" themes and messages underlying the main story are clear to anyone that watches this fine piece of work. Casting and Cinematography are exceptional. And the stand out performance without a doubt goes to the lovely Michele Hicks as Penny as well as fine performances by Mark and Michael Polish as the Twins. One of the Best Films I have seen in quite a long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems like the writers of Twin Falls had a few ideas that they thought would be "cool" to put into a film and nothing else. The premise of the film is typical cookie cutter Hollywood formula, the hapless love story, the hooker with a heart of gold, the dysfunctional hero, etc. Unfortunately that was not the problem with Twin Falls. The problem was the unbelievably poor and heavy handed symbolism. I knew I was in trouble when the movie started with the hooker receiving a 2 dollar bill as change for her cab ride. She stares at it like it is the strangest thing she has ever seen yet somehow she knows it should mean something. Not five minutes later, she walks past a TV with A Tale of Two Cities on. It only got worse from here. The story was an uninspired, trite mess. All of the subplots involving the hooker were underdeveloped, especially why the hooker cared about these guys at all. There was mention of a child she may have given up for adoption at some time, but it was touched upon once and never mentioned again. The interesting elements, like the preacher who lived next to the twins, were completely wasted in this film. Twin Falls Idaho is an art house film that insults the intelligence of its viewers while boring them all at the same time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was surprised to find out everyone who's seen this movie thought it was amazing. Because the dialog was BEYOND bad, not to mention the acting sub par.First, NO conjoined twins have ever looked that good in real life. Second, the dialog was blatantly bad, including one of my favorite lines at a Halloween party, "This is the only day of the year they're normal." Everything that could stereotypical in your mind go for a couple of conjoined twins, goes wrong in the span of this movie. People taking pictures while they sit in the park, them being approached and the attempt made to make them into freak show superstars.And at the end, when he was living with the other freaks in the like run down abandoned circus? Come on. There's a STRAY ELEPHANT. I couldn't even tell my friend that ending without laughing.Not to mention the editing was awful and jumpy from shot to shot. A lot of time scenes lacked cohesiveness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Brothers Polish do not try to obviously overturn accepted notions of 'weirdness' that might attend any representation of their subject matter (Siamese twins). The film opens with images of duality linked with strangeness - two girls in a cab part; a man with an iron claw gives them change, two ripped pieces of dollar sellotaped together. So already the notion of being two is linked to rupture, disrepair, disfigurement. One of the women, Penny, a prostitute dressed and eye-lined like a teenage Goth, walks through a strange hotel that seems to exist in a suffocatingly smoky time-warp. She enters a lift guarded by a weird old codger who comes out with some incongruous comments and a barmy sense of direction. The corridor smells of stale urine. Later we discover that neighbours include a 'jive'-talking marriage counsellor-cum-evangelist called Jesus (registration no: HEY ZEUS). The corridor is wallpapered an off-green, complementing the sickly olive beaming in the boy's bedroom. The score, on the whole the kind of thing you'd hear in any 'quality' Hollywood picture, is sustained just a little too long, and becomes a little Badalamenti-like, confirming the overall David Lynch feel which is strengthened by a later sequence in a freakshow, and a general similarity of plot and melancholy to 'The Elephant Man'; although the feeling here is more the similarly titled 'Twin Peaks'. How can the heroes seem other than weird?A lot of people have been claiming this as one of the year's best movies. I just mustn't have got it. Of course, I sympathised with the brothers, the sexual frustration, the identity crises, the fundamental feelings of abandonment, yet also the privileged, whispered, shared private life, the idea of coming to a dive hotel to die. The development of the relationship between Penny and Blake is very sympathetic, although the character of Penny is so richly and engagingly realised, she risks making the twins seem one-dimensional (no pun intended). The cod-Freudianisms of having her psychologically compensate for an abandoned, retarded child by mothering/loving two disabled 'boys' is a little pat, as is the disjunction between her moral growth as a person, and their physical decline.There is much that is beautiful here - the world flooded with the boys' necessarily off-centre worldview; the whole Halloween sequence; the dream sequence with the bicycles (linking Siamese twins with silent cinema for the second time this year (the other is 'Of Freaks and Men') - what's going on here?). It's just that everything happens as you'd expect, as predictable as you'd guess a Hollywood movie about Siamese twins would be - right down to the moment when the errant mum returns to squeeze her dying son's hand, or the circus past. And maybe that's the rub, not just that Hollywood would never make a film about Siamese Twins, but that a Hollywood-like film about Siamese twins, like the score, is a little off-kilter; that Siamese twins, as much as brawny action heroes, muddled bimbos and precocious teenagers deserve the Hollywood treatment as much as anyone? I guess?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Siamese twin brother falls in love with hooker with a heart of gold? Okay, I was willing to go with it. Every part of my being was trying to warn me, but, I really wanted to like this film. And, to the credit of the Polish brothers (writer/director/stars of this opus), they pull it off...for about 20 minutes.The greatest problem with the indie film movement is, that everybody thinks they're making great art. I wonder if the Polish brothers were sitting in the editing room, thinking to themselves (like I was), "there's no earthly reason for these two people to fall in love! We haven't given either character the opportunity to get to know each other, much less fall in love! But, hey, we're making indie films here! We don't need rhyme or reason!"Mark and Michael Polish DO deliver halfway decent performances - though I'd rather have seen Michael in the lead. The other performances are marred by chintzy dialogue that was cliche 50 years ago.All in all, a complete waste of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film features some of the most mind-numbingly obvious symbollism I have ever seen a film. I just 'loved' how the director made sure to linger forever on a piece of symbollic imagery just to make sure we 'got it'. Then just in case, they would show us the same imagery a few minutes later.The actress who played the hooker was simply awful and seemed unable to display any range of emotion. The Polish brothers who played the twins seem to think that the more they sleepwalk through their role the more 'artistic' the film will seem.Overall, I felt that this film was a poseur attempt at making a piece of deep and meaningful art cinema. At the end of it, I was extremely sorry I had spent the whole time watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How could anyone have possibly been fooled into liking this film? There are so many terrible aspects to this film that one would need to write an essay to list them. But since most everyone has covered the bad acting and the contrived script, I sum up the atrociousness of this film in one of the last scenes: when the separated twin returns to his pseudo-western roots with an immaculately-groomed typical bullshit roughing it beard, his out on the trailer home range straight from the prop closet cowboy hat, and his excruciatingly unconvincing reflection on his experience. It was obvious to me, and should be obvious to everyone, that the directors/writers/main actors have lived their life picking up the most generic, overused, and forced melodramatic elements from films and combining them into a half-assed visionless failure of a motion picture.</fullReview>

I watched the movie on TV and there was only one commercial so I was riveted to my couch as I did not want to miss one moment. I did not have a sense of where the story was going at the beginning but the writers took us on a believable journey. Perfect pick for the mother. I am lucky to be channel surfing this night or I would have missed a story that I could so strongly relate to. I will have to do some research to see if the Polish brothers have written or directed any movies since. I wish them both huge success with any projects they tackle in the future.

		<fullReview>I'm not sure why people were so venomous about the acting and the storyline of this movie. I thought, given the situation of "Blake and Francis," that if this were a real set of Siamese twins, there would not be a lot to feel giddy about. I liked it. I thought it was original and really makes one stop and evaluate his/her own life. We are darn lucky to be whole and healthy. We'd have no idea what it'd be like to be joined together having to try and live a normal life. My congratulations to the Polish brothers. Outstanding work, boys. If either actor had shown a variety of emotions, it would have been totally unrealistic. I know I'd not be happy if I had to drag someone around knowing she'd die before I. The critics of this film need to stop and think before they make cruel comments. I lost my sister, and she was not a my Siamese twin, but she was my best friend, and since her death, I've been gloomy. But like Francis said, "Every story has a happy ending...it's just been untold." That's my life right now. Good movie, Michael and Mark.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps only twins like the Polish brothers could have made the quintessential work of art about conjoined twins--one that shows the uniqueness and depth of this bond, while universally hinting at how deeply love is rooted in our very flesh. Often the attempts to delve into these relationships (of conjoined or even identical twins) has been produced by non-twins and has assumed some kind of pathology--something either incestuous, or morbidly dependent. One thinks immediately of Cronenberg's Dead Ringers. What the Polish brothers have given us is nothing short of miraculous, utterly human and as poignant as anything I have ever experienced.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Landmark movie with insufficient investment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An almost watchable movie with only one or two lines of decent dialogue (which are milked by repeating them at the end). It concerns Siamese twins, joined at the torso but with separate heads, identities, one hand each and three legs. The serious subject matter is barely explored, although the twin brothers who play the twins act very convincingly (they also direct and write the movie). On of the brothers falls in love with a tart-with-a-heart and this creates some friction and jealousy between the two brothers - who came into the world together and have planned to leave together. One brother is strong, whereas the other is of failing health. Poetically, we are reminded that there are no sad stories, it is just that the author stopped writing - the story goes on - it's just untold. The story of Twin Falls Idaho goes on a bit too long in places without a storyteller, but at least it airs a very difficult subject and brings it into public view.</fullReview>

Or when folks wanted to use them to get rich.Seeing the love between the two brothers was so touching I had to get out a box of tissues when it came time for the surgeons to separate them.Michele Hicks, her performance was awesome. She portrayed a true friend to both Blake and Frances, and a beautiful lover to Blake.Lesley Ann Warren - what can I say - you were magnificent. Your performance as the mother who was haunted by giving up her children was heartbreaking. Making amends is not always easy and in the case of your character, a very difficult scene to act.To the rest of the cast - I don't have enough room to write - you were all great!I give this movie a 10.

		<fullReview>Twin Falls Idaho is a haunting, deeply personal story about a relationship that probably turned off a lot of people solely because of its two main characters. It was reminescent of the Broadway musical, 'Side Show', which also dealt with the subject of conjoined twins. The Polish Brothers gently present their characters to the audience baring the essence of all relationships with a directness rarely seen. There is an intense emotional connection between the audience and the characters. And in the end, you cry for the characters, not because they are different, but because we are all so much alike.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very excited upon hearing about this film. It sounded like a very original idea, but unfortunately lacked. The ending of the film was shockingly bad, so "hollywood" in style that it seemed like someone entirely different had written it. Michele Hicks as Penny was downright awful, my suggestion to her-stick to modeling. Her character wasn't the least bit believable and I had absolutely no sympathy. However, the film does have its good points, the cinematography at the beginning, the scene where the brothers play the country song. Certainly worth watching, perhaps your opinion will differ.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>pretentious, derivative, empty, slow; David Lynch w/o talent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>These twins (the writers / directors / stars )want to be shocking, creative and profound, and often seem to wish they were David Lynch. But they don't have his brains or talent. So it's slow without being meaningful, and preachy with no wisdom. Even in a stylized film with bizarre elements, things have to be real on some level, and very little here rings true. As far as the style, it's juvenile and derivative. The model who plays the erstwhile girlfriend is nice to look at, but that only goes so far, especially considering the absence of any nudity to break the monotony. An empty, pretentious, stupid film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Penny (Michele Hicks) is a prostitute hired for Francis Falls (Michael Polish). When she gets there, she finds Francis and Blake Falls (Mark Polish) are actually conjoined twins living in a rundown hotel. She runs away at first but she has to go back to retrieve her purse. Blake is the stronger one while Francis' health declines. On Halloween, the brothers go out to see their mother (Lesley Ann Warren). Penny runs into them at a diner and she takes them out to a party.The Polish brothers have created an unique looking film. First there are the Siamese brothers. They are absolutely original and very compelling. The brother filmmakers use the haunted model looks of Michele Hicks to the fullest. She started late with her acting career after modeling but she shows some skills. There is a lot of whisper acting, and slow pacing. This has a memorable look and a strange tone. And it is their humanity that shows through.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first thing that came to mind was David Lynch, wedded to a heartwarming feel. Understated, yes, but oh so heartwarming. A little dash of the 1930's "Freaks" for good measure, in a good way.The academy awards are such bunk(crap). A movie off the radar like this is essentially incommunicado per the awards, yet sitcom-like drivel like "Terms of Endearment", "Kramer vs. Kramer", and such win best picture. Forget awards. This movie rises above the standard issue formula that rings true for the academy, like so many "Indy Movies" do. I like to think of the lot of understated Indy movies as above and beyond what radar we typically place our "understanding" of movies in. Twin Falls goes far beyond those expectations. Redefines them.Rent the DVD when you want(need) to go beyond the standard issue Hollywood "drivel".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Haunting, taut and dark is this story of conjoined twins played by real life identical twins Michael and Mark Polish. Michael directs and shares writing credit with Mark. These shy conjoined twins temporarily are living in a run down hotel as they summon the courage to reunite with their estranged mother(Lesley Ann Warren). A homeless hooker named Penny(Michele Hick)finds herself befriending the Falls brothers. They wander outside the apartment to attend a Halloween party with Penny pretending to be wearing a "Siamese Twin" costume. Blake(Mark Polish)tends to his sick brother Francis(Michael Polish)and tries to interpret his mixed feelings toward the thought of losing his sibling. Then to complicate matters more is the relationship developing between himself and Penny. Albeit a strange story, it is well acted. Others in the cast: Patrick Bauchau, Garrett Morris, William Katt and Teresa Hill.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, ideas are what sell a movie for me (at least for the most part). Given the state of Hollywood today where everything is a remake or rehashed from something else, it's refreshing to see something totally original like "Twin Falls Idaho." But not only does "Twin Falls Idaho" contain some good ideas, it's a well-crafted and utterly fascinating film.What would happen if you had to go everywhere and do everything with someone else? What would it be like? How would you do it? These are some of the questions that "Twin Falls Idaho" addresses. Blake and Francis Falls (Mark and Michael Polish in their writing and Michael's directing debut) are Siamese twins who have lived their whole lives attached to each other. But Francis is sick, and the brothers are determined to go out of this world together. Enter Penny, a prostitute who grows very close to them, and ends up falling for Blake.The beauty about this film is how it's constructed. The twins may be the film's focus, but Penny is our eyes. We know as much as she does, and her reactions are instantly relatable. She asks the questions that we want to ask, and the movie never gets ahead of the audience or vice versa. But the Polish brothers know that there is a story here, and they wisely focus on that. But they integrate being a Siamese twin flawlessly, and that's what raises this movie to another level.The acting by the three leads is outstanding. The Polish brothers are brilliant. They are so good at functioning as Siamese twins that it's almost impossible to believe that they are not really like that. The are used to all the questions, and the looks, and they are used to answering them, but the stares and pointing still hurt, and their desire for privacy is something they hold dear. Newcomer Michele Hicks equals them. A lesser talented actor would overact her emotions, but she understands the use of subtlety, and that's why the audience can relate to her. Everything about her character is real and genuine.Less impressive are two of the most important supporting characters, Sissy and Tre. Their desire to expose the twins (for shock value/gossip as in Sissy's case, or money and publicity in Tre's case), come off as writer's constructs, and while the actions are genuine, the situations feel contrived (but the performances are good and very effective, especially Ant as Tre). But these missteps are saved by the performances of the other actors. Lesley Ann Warren fares better as Francine, the twins' mother who gave them up for adoption after they were born, but she's still not as good as the three principal characters. The other actors are great, such as Miles, the doctor friend of Penny's who helps her look after the twins. There are an assortment of oddball characters, but the actors keep them real and believable (unlike Wes Anderson or Terry Zwigoff).Michael Polish has the mark of a terrific director. The film is clearly a low budget indie film, but Polish makes the most of his budget so it doesn't seem like it. The tone is dark, yet strangely warm. This is a quiet movie, almost too quiet, but it helps establish the tone. Polish has respect for his material, and his film is about curiosity, and NEVER exploitative."Twin Falls Idaho" isn't perfect, but the good aspects vastly outweigh its flaws. It's impossible to understand why this movie didn't get access to a wider audience, particularly since co-joined twins were, and still are, a slightly hot topic of the day. I can definitely say that this is a must-see film for everyone, especially since its messages of tolerance and respect have many parallels with today's world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strangely fascinating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had seen this movie announced on my cable a couple of times before. The title itself meant nothing to me. Earlier today while browsing through the movie channels I caught the beginning of it. I still had my doubts about seeing it, specially since in a different channel there was a movie about a Gambler in Vegas. I love Vegas, I've been there at least 60 times in my lifetime, so anything related to it, I love. I did go back and forth between the 2 channels a couple of times, but at the end something fascinated me about these siamese twins and their beautiful girlfriend, Penny so I stayed with this one. I could not have made a better decision. I live in Mexico, and was watching the movie with Spanish subtitles. The movie title was translated to Spanish as "Strange fascination". As the story develops, you can go through many different emotions. Love, compassion, sadness, happiness and any other you can think of. You are carried in a strange fascination throughout the development of the plot. The Prostitute, Penny, is simply adorable. They couldn't have chosen a better person to portray this role. I have seen 3 fascinating movies in my life, THE LEGEND OF 1900, SOMEWHERE IN TIME, and this one. This along with the other 2 is the type of movie that you can see several times without ever loosing interest in it. I highly recommend it to all people with sensitivity.</fullReview>

I know it is like 6 years old I have just finished watching and plan to add it to my collection to watch again. If there is anything that I would like is maybe more history, not only on their characters but maybe their mother as well.No matter what any one has to say about this movie I believe it should be a classic for all times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw the film last night on cable and decided to wait until today, October 30th, to post a review, because it happens to be Mark and Michael's birthday. Hope they've been having a decent one, as they deserve.I've been into the Polish twins since I saw Jackpot and Northfork a couple of years ago, and I'd been waiting to see this film since it was released. I was not disappointed. The subject matter is more than tricky, and it's handled with a truly impressive balance of seriousness and humor; the humor does not come at the expense of the story but rather is intrinsic to Francis' and Blake's lives, as they are seen dealing with their reality of being conjoined from birth. The catalyst of the story, the hooker played by Michele Hicks (who was also with them in Northfork) proves to be the perfect foil for the twins. One of the best scenes is the one where she takes them to a Halloween costume party - the one night of the year, she says, where they can "be normal." By the end of the movie, the seriousness of the situation comes to the fore, and it's handled beautifully, eloquently and with exactly the proper amount of emotion and just the right touch of Scorpionic restraint, so it never becomes maudlin. Not quite a perfect film - it could have been a little shorter, but a brilliant, original, daring and deeply felt project nonetheless.IMDb rating - 8 (equivalent to a low ***1/2)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Twin falls is a decent movie altogether. Mike and Mark polish are excellent in the role of the siamese twins, they portray their anguish, their fear of the world, and their love and dependence on each other perfectly. Your really feel sort of intrigued and mystified when you look and listen to these two characters.Penny is the character that simultaneously keeps them on their feet and breaks them apart. Had to be a woman... Also great acting from the beautiful Michelle Hicks.The movie poses some interesting questions about relationships, and about depending from one another to the very core.But it's far from perfect, because, there's really nor much of a story. The story's just a skeleton where the writer and director hang all the dialogue and all their philosophical rethoric. Basically, more things could and should have happened - they would've helped flesh out the characters better than a lot of dialogues... And it wouldn't have made such a slow paced movie... Liked it, but not really my idea of a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning!! The best independant film had to offer in the late 90's!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a twin and I know a mild feeling of exploitation with questions people always have and their large interest of a somewhat minority culture. When people ask if I would rather not be one and what it's like, I've known no different, therefore wouldn't have it any other way. Mark and Michael Polish have made a debut film dealing with a far more extreme subject...siamese twins. With characters Blake and Francis Falls, they create a richly cinematic, yet detailed and realistic environment for a pair of twins conjoined at the hip. Their film protests exploitation of anyone deemed "abnormal" in society. They do NOT manipulate their touchy subject for laughs or cheap thrills, nor do they skim on realism to convey their message. The Polish Brothers caught my eye with their stunningly original filmmaking style as well. Michael's writing is outstanding. Mark has no trouble with pacing the film and providing an absorbing atmosphere and together they bravley combat a "circus-going" society amused with the "abnormal". They are my favorite in the new wave of filmmakers of our generation. I strongly believe they will become really big in the near future as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The premise is too good not to be told in a movie - a couple of siamese twins, who are society outcasts, bump into a girl which falls in love with one of the twins. Just read like this, it could be a comedy, but here the drama takes over. Heavy-written, and heavy in tone, this is no walk on the park. The Polish brothers achieve the illusion of making us believe that they are real siamese twins, and the real triumph of this movie is making us feel the crisis they experience. But it is a strange movie, probably they made it on purpose, and one of its assets is not having a known face (making the story so much believable). Don't expect to come out with a smile after this one, even though it is an interesting experience.</fullReview>

I must say it is a decent film, with good photography and soundtrack, but there seems to be something lacking, perhaps the Polish brother's aren't the required actors, or maybe the story isn't just that compelling. I kept thinking of David Lynch's "The Elephant Man" (can't imagine why...!?) Although the film is set in a low pace, and some scenes are a bit "boring" and predictable, still it kept me hooked on the screen, it strikes as a paradox, but i just say that sometimes you feel compelled to like the normality in things...and this film is all about that: what is normal, what is abnormal and why should we care about things like that.In my opinion it's a good debut (i think), and they might do great things, still to earn my vote they will have to work harder...PL-Oporto (PORTUGAL)</fullReview>

I heard great things about this.Oy, what a lousy film. Where to begin? The Polish brothers seem to have decided that their stunt performance as the twins would be enough to make this into a beautiful and meaningful film and the script would just sort of write itself. How about a hooker with a heart of gold who falls in love with one of them? Oh, and a doctor (William Katt) who sees them only in terms of cold, clinical science, and cannot see them as people! And a priest (Garrett Morris) who only sees them as a metaphor for the interdependence of humanity, blah blah blah.Each secondary character appears only to serve a transparent and obvious purpose. Everything is spelled out either through tried and true cliches or through painfully didactic soapbox dialogue.The heavy handed metaphors are cringe worthy, the whole look of the film derivative beyond belief, and the ending corny and obvious.To be fair, there are a few nice scenes and thoughtful touches (Halloween, for one) but overall the movie is as contrived as its name (they must have named the film first and then named the characters and the street to match-- completely bass ackwards). Maybe someday an intelligent filmmaker will adapt Darin Strauss' wonderful novel "Chang and Eng" into a worthwhile film and we can all forget about this feeble attempt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating Exploration Of A Sensitive Subject</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An unusual and fascinating tale about the lives of conjoined twins Frances and Blake Falls. Both know that Frances is sick and near death, and they have resolved to die together. But an unexpected romance intervenes, as Blake falls in love with Penny, a prostitute who, after her initial revulsion, befriends them both and helps them experience a bit of what life has to offer. This movie is a classic example of people desperately in need of love who enter each other's lives.I found myself totally wrapped up in this story. It is completely unique - like nothing I have ever seen before. It features strong performances from Michael and Mark Polish as the Falls brothers (Michael also directed, and the brothers together wrote the screenplay) and a marvellous performance by Michele Hicks, in her first major role, as Penny. Hicks exudes compassion and anyone who watches this movie will be completely taken with her. The complexity of the relationship between conjoined twins is sensitively explored, particularly as Frances becomes jealous as he watches Blake's romance with Penny grow.(SPOILERS AHEAD)I was somewhat put off by what I thought was a weak ending to what had been a superb movie. Setting aside the question of whether it is physically possible to separate conjoined twins in adulthood (I'm not a doctor) I did nevertheless find myself wondering about the psychological impact, and the movie doesn't really address that issue in any detail. It simply happens, and a few minutes later the movie ends. Oh, there's some sensitive sharing between Blake and Penny, but it left me flat. In fact, the entire last 15 minutes or so seemed strangely disconnected from the rest of the movie and I found myself asking, "How did we get here from there?"Still, this is a very good movie that rates an 8/10.</fullReview>

A tale about siamese twins in love with the same woman and challenged by the pressure of available medical separation could have come off like a bad Farrelly Brothers riff but is instead a beautiful film about accepting and loving our unique, individual selves. Its an incredibly moving film and contains the extraordinary directorial and acting skills of the Polish brothers whose sensitivity is intensely affecting. Its filmed with a passionate eye full of wonder and the close of the film is beautifully realised. The cinematography is excellent especially in the twins' apartment and the entire cast is uniformly in sync. Some great moments await you in this gently quirky treat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A heartbreaking movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Twin Falls Idaho", on paper, sounds like a freaky David Lynch-style psychodrama. Thankfully, on screen it's a heartwarming and gentle movie held together by excellent performances from the central trio. Michael and Mark Polish play Blake and Francis Falls, two conjoined twins who meet hooker Penny (Michele Hicks) when Francis requests her services for their birthday. At first shocked by their appearance, Penny soon begins to help the brothers and the three become friends. However, Blake has strong feelings for Penny, and how will Francis react?Thankfully side-stepping any physical comedy based on the twins' condition, "Twin Falls" is a subtle and touching movie that isn't without some barbed wit. The direction is assured and the Polish brothers prove their worth behind the camera as well as in front of it. One scene, where the brothers rest in a park whilst passers-by watch them through zoo-like bars in a fence, is truly upsetting.The only fault is that the final third of the movie loses its footing slightly and tries to deal with maybe one issue too many. Regardless, "Twin Falls" is definitely something special, and proves the Polish brothers are the latest cinematic siblings who will be worth keeping an eye on. 8</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unique. I think the David Lynch comparisons with which this film has been saddled do it no favours at all. To me this film isn't "weird" at all, despite its subject matter. I found it immensely moving, sweet and touching without being saccharine. The Polish Brothers' performances as the conjoined twins was pretty convincing (not that I have much to compare it with), as was that of the woman who played the hooker, Michele Hicks. The music was pretty fine too, and the scene where the twins sing a song with the guitar was just delightful.I'd compare this film to Kissed, in that both take a completely "out there" subject (in the case of Kissed, it's necrophilia) and make a very human, unsensational story out of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just rented "Twin Falls, Idaho," and it was the best film I've seen all year. A delicate exploration of the world of Siamese twins Blake and Francis, it was beautiful and symbolic without being at all heavy-handed. The film draws you into the twins' terrible/beautiful mixture of deep intimacy, and the longing to know what it would be like to be "free" of each other. Beware: I cried my eyes out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>lowkeyed, subtle drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Twin Falls Idaho' proves, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that love stories do indeed come in every shape, size and form. This low budget, independent film actually tells two love stories: one between two brothers conjoined together from birth and the other between them and a golden-hearted prostitute who befriends them.This movie is an obvious labor of love on the part of the filmmakers. Writer/director Michael Polish and his real life identical twin brother, Mark, who co-wrote the screenplay, also star as Francis and Blake Falls, a pair of Siamese twins who, on their birthday, order up a hooker played by newcomer Michelle Hicks. Though initially frightened away by the `freakishness' of the situation, the young lady, Penny, finds herself growing attached to these two painfully quiet and withdrawn young men who seem to have a strange symbiotic relationship she is unable to comprehend but which, in some strange way, speaks to a yearning for companionship lodged deep within her own troubled soul. The film becomes a moving study of three social outcasts groping towards each other for support and affirmation. In many ways, the most striking aspect of the film is the quiet, hushed tone it uses to unfold a drama that could, by its very nature, easily succumb to cheap sensationalism and exploitation. Blake and Francis, so long conditioned by a lifetime of societal rejection to draw into themselves and stay conveniently out of sight, have created a private universe where they barely ever speak above a whisper. Penny, herself lost in a cold, uncaring world, seems instinctively drawn to the innate goodness and politeness of the two men and she quickly learns to look beyond the physical difference that has served as a barrier between them and so many others. The film also does not go for the obvious choices one might expect in a work about misunderstood social outcasts; it, wisely, refrains from ladling on emotionally manipulative scenes in which people stare rudely at the pair or in which opportunistic exploiters work their wiles on the boys. Although the film does touch on both those issues in a minor way, the primary focus always remains the relationship that is developing among the three main characters. There is a haunting sequence in which Blake, the healthier and more physically robust of the two, in a fit of pent-up frustration, actually attempts to pull away from Francis ? emotionally if not quite physically. But Blake realizes that he and his brother are fated to go through eternity together one way or the other and that he really would not want it any other way. Indeed, this is as much a love story about two brothers as it is about two men and a woman.As the Siamese twins, the Polish brothers achieve a remarkable triumph on the level of sheer physicality, somehow convincing us, by their movements and mannerisms, that they really are two people sharing the same body. More impressively, they bring a beautifully understated pathos to their interactions both with each other and the people with whom they come in contact. Ditto for Michelle Hicks who effectively conveys the compassionate understanding that brings a rare ray of light to the otherwise dark world in which the boys live out their secret life.One could argue that `Twin Falls Idaho' hedges its bets by portraying a pair of Siamese twins with which no audience would have any trouble falling in love. And, perhaps, there is something to be said for that criticism. A more courageous film might have shown us a slightly more combative, angered or embittered pair, one which struck out at an unreasoningly prejudiced and cruel world in ways that might make them less palatable to us and therefore much harder to like. Perhaps. Yet, as the first film that I can ever remember even having the nerve to tackle such a risky subject, `Twin Falls Idaho,' in its call for tolerance and understanding, deserves all the kudos it has rightfully received.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing this film, I remarked to a co-worker that one of things I most appreciated about "Twin Falls Idaho" was the feeling that this film could have been made *only* by these two people, Mark and Michael Polish. So many screenplays and films seem shallow and generic, as though the writer(s) put nothing of themselves into the work. TFI feels just the opposite: that the Polish brothers put many of their own feelings and thoughts into the work, which made it much more effective, in my mind.Other IMDB users have complimented the supporting cast, and I'm no exception; the performances in TFI are across-the-board terrific, especially Lesley Anne Warren and Patrick Bauchau. Michele Hicks and Mark and Michael Polish deserve special mention, of course.People have commented that the pacing of TFI is too slow; I can see their point, but I enjoyed the deliberateness of the pace, as the story is mostly about the internal struggle between "joined-ness" and separation, and not about action per se. Be warned: this is not a fast-paced movie; settle in and let it flow over you.Also, I was surprised by the humorous touches, which were quite welcome. My personal favorite: Hicks's "closet" is really the entrance to a staircase, and on the door, "fire escape" has been crossed out in favor of "fashion escape."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fascinating and haunting film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's understandable that this movie would not be for all tastes. It has gotten generally good but decidedly mixed reviews. Mark and Michael Polish, the real life twins who portray the conjoined brothers, wrote the story and the screenplay. Michael directed the film. This is their debut film and I was quite impressed with the results. People attending a showing of Twin Falls Idaho expecting to find something similar to the work of Cronenberg or Lynch will be disappointed. Unlike the works of the two Davids, this film is sensitive and quite touching (although Lynch's The Elephant Man probably comes closest in its portrayal of a mistake of nature). Mark and Michael could not have been better in their portrayal. Their expressions and gestures, their manner of speech where they virtually spoke as one, their whispers to each other as if to make sure they were in agreement, all of these things added up to beautifully realized and richly shaded performances. Some have criticized the performance of Michelle Hicks as Penny, the call girl who befriends and helps them. I do not agree. I thought she was fine in the role (her first film acting job) although she did have a bit of difficulty here and there with a few of the most demanding scenes. Lesley Ann Warren had a small and not fully fleshed out role and was nearly unrecognizable, but I have always found her presence in a film most welcome. Yes, Twin Peaks Idaho has flaws, but I saw this film yesterday and it has stayed with me ever since. I can't say the same for most movies that I see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a remarkable film in its understated and sensitive treatment of its subject matter, that could too easily have become sensationalistic in the wrong hands. The Polish brothers were reluctant to let anyone else direct their film, and it seems highly unlikely that anybody else would have produced anything similar (even if it were as good).The screenplay, performances, cinematography, and music are all very effective and work together to create a vivid character for this story that is refreshingly distinct and unusual, without straying into the bizarre or outlandish. (Not that I mind bizarre and outlandish, mind you, but it wouldn't have suited this film.)According to their web site the Polish brothers have two other screenplays titled after American cities; I'm looking forward to seeing those as well. Maybe they can even be convinced to write one called "Moosejaw Saskatchewan" some day.</fullReview>

I saw "Three Seasons" at a festival earlier this year and as I was watching it, I was forgetting it. I can't tell you how many "Sundance darlings" I have experienced that with. ("Next Stop, Wonderland", anyone?)It kills me that this film is not being given a larger push in the market. Maybe Artisan should have picked it up and created a legend of the conjoined twins who disappeared one weekend in a seedy motel. God knows some of the undeserved Blair Witch Box office should be going elsewhere. Why not this film?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie manages to be both intriguing and touching. The story of a pair of Siamese twins and a woman who enters their lives sounded like a David Cronnenberg or David Lynch odyssey when I first read the plot description, but the movie is original in the fact that it doesn't exploit the twins. I felt myself really caring for and empathizing with these brothers. The sequences involving their ashamed (ashamed of herself, not of her sons) mother had the audience in tears. Lesley Ann Warren is wonderful in this brief performance. The movie's minor flaw is the fact that it drags on a bit near the end. It should've ended with the "bicycle sequence." There were commercial considerations, I guess (even though this is an independent film), and the epilogue was needed to wrap things up. But up until the final scenes, this is a highly emotional and excellent film. Final grade: B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Twin Falls Idaho is a fascinating, poignant movie, very well-done for the subject matter.I consider myself to be: (1) the average movie-goer who likes movies just because they're movies, (2) a person who likes many different genres of movies (action, love, sci-fi, foreign, drama, comedy, etc.), and (3) a person who doesn't judge a movie by it's budget or lack thereof. This being said, as a person who thinks of conjoined (Siamese) twins as something rare and somewhat unfortunate as a human occurrence, and whose first two thoughts of Siamese twins are those joined at the head whom Dr. Benjamin Carson separated, and also as unfortunate co-individuals seen in circus sideshows, this movie was very moving to me. The logic behind the actions of the twins, and the events that happened to them and how they coped with them seemed to be truthfully rendered with sensitivity, yet honesty. The teenaged mother who bore them, and whom they sought out; the prostitute they longed for; their trepidations at interacting publicly in society -- these things were all brought home with numbing sincerity for the audience to observe for themselves.For these reasons, I thought it was a very, very good movie. Different, thought-provoking, but very, very, good. I also have absolute NO qualms with the acting jobs done on everyone's part.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mostly boring movie has a distinctive imagination and is proficiently handled, but deploys these qualities to fairly shallow ends - the closing thought, about a sad ending being merely a matter of the author having quit before reaching a happy one, seems meaningless other than as pure mush. Compared to something like Cronenberg's Dead Ringers, the theme of the nature of identity within a structure of helpless interdependence is hopelessly simplistic - as summarized by the movie's metaphor of a two dollar bill (as clunkily explained to us: worth twice as much if whole but worth nothing if split in half); the movie has a literalism to it that quickly gets ponderous. So many of the ideas and scenes seem weary or predictable: the notion that the one night they can comfortably go outside without attracting attention is Halloween (because they're assumed to be trick-or-treating); the scene where people callously point at and whisper about them in the park; the deathbed return of the mother who gave them up as infants for adoption. The movie has numerous small virtues though - including a weird symbolic depiction of their ultimate separation, and a good performance by Hicks; but ultimately it doesn't forge enough of a grasp on the poised, eerie style it's chosen for itself, and can't avoid a feeling of pervasive inconsequentiality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film sucks, and sucks bad. If you were one of the people that said they cried during this film, I wonder what kind of people you are. This film was in no way a tear jerker, but then again, I don't cry at movies anyway. However, if you'd like to see a movie which is moving, watch "Sometimes in April" or "Hotel Rwanda". If genocide of more than 800,000 people doesn't make you cry, what will? If you liked this film, more power to you-to each their own. BUT, if you're one of the fools who commented on the acting being "great", then it's obvious you were extremely high on opiates when you saw this, or you don't have any idea of what great acting really is.The acting in this film was absolutely horrible. In fact, the only good acting in this horrible film, was the black guy from Martin that thought he was Jesus.The film's writers were the same as the so-called "stars" of the film. One of which must be dating the worst actress ever (Michelle Hicks) because they write her name in the credits as "Introducing Michelle Hicks" like she's ever going to be in anything other than a DP Porn. That broad was the worst actress I've seen since that other dunce in "My Life Without Me". Either way, be on the lookout at your local Wendy's, because old Michelle Hicks is going to be needing a job after she blows the $15 Grand she made from this pathetic attempt at becoming somebody in the film industry.I am not sure if anyone else caught this, but those two fairies (the Polish's) also wrote-or attempted to write a couple of the songs in this film. The music in this film sucked and it was obvious that the music was directed to be "different" or "underground-ish", which it wasn't.The writers were trying so very hard to make serious scenes which made you either laugh, think, or cry-none of which I felt whatsoever at any point during this waste of film. The Polish bros. are elementary.This film and the acting is like someone with a fake, bad accent. The writers tried to be 'different' and 'unique', but fell short. The fact that Michelle Hicks has a face that would make a freight train take a dirt road, only makes me think on of the Pollock brothers are doing something with her or to her to make her think that she can act. I am sorry, but when she was talking to the doctor about the twins and said, "Maybe it's not meant to be figured out. They're not a puzzle" I had to run to the toilet and puke. The way she said it and the look on her face attempting to be serious in that scene would make a Smurf throw up.The writing SUCKED. The acting SUCKED. The plot SUCKED. The idea SUCKED. The music SUCKED. The whole idea SUCKED. The people that play this movie on cable REALLY SUCK.If I were you, I would watch this movie. That way, you can tell good acting from bad acting. That way you can tell good writing from bad writing. That way you can tell a good plot from a bad plot. And don't let me ruin the surprise, but Twin Falls Idaho would be the "bad" part in everything I just wrote when compared to good acting, or good writing.This movie was bad. For some reason, this movie and the morons in it really irritate the holy hell out of me. This movie just goes to show that if those so-called actors and actresses can make it, so can anyone. If you think I am alone, read all of the posts. I wasn't surprised to see that people agree that this film was bad, but my God-it seems like half of the posts on here didn't like it.The Pollocks got in the back door of a movie set, tied up the actors and crew-who are probably still missing and anyone that the Pollocks could beat up would have to be bigger wussies than they are, and took over with whatever it is they tried to do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that the movie was wonderful. It didn't make the 2 main characters seem like freaks, but like 2 brothers who care very much for each other. I found it while flipping through channels last night and have thought about it all night. That is how I know a movie is really good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is definitely a little metaphor-heavy, but sometimes the tasteless nature of the images seemed kind of satirical. So many people said in their reviews they were expecting "A David Lynch sideshow story." Wouldn't those overdone metaphors run rampant in a typical sideshow-offish version of the story? Or hey, maybe the Polish brothers are crazy. If the two-dollar bill metaphor remained unexplained, I would have liked the film a lot more. This movie is saved by a majority of the actors...but not Lesley Ann Warren.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has some excellent scenes of sincerity and clarity. But the majority are horribly, eye-roll-inducing pretentious or just plain pointless. The subject is virtually uncharted territory (and very good territory at that) so there's hope for a much better movie to be made about siamese twins yet. I loved the scene where the conjoned brothers (Blake and the dying Frances) watch, at a Halloween party, as a couple dressed up as siamese twins detach themselves after an argument. And the scene where the brothers fight and literally try pulling themselves apart was heartbreaking. And Michelle Hicks is a knock-out (not to mention a good actress) as the prostitute, named Penny, who falls in love with Blake. Other then those three qualities the movie was mostly stuffy blah. Did the writers bother to give the twins different personalities; or did they act exactly the same because they've been together so long? And the dorky symbolism is as pointless as Penny's doctor friend who visits them and later gives a dull speech in the hospital about the twins, comparing them to dollar bills or something (I can't be sure as my mind drifted rather quickly). A great film could be made using this one's basic core. The whole movie I was nit-picking and thinking how I would have done it better (aren't I full of myself?).Overall I give it **1/2 out of **** for it's originality and a few stellar scenes in an otherwise muddled mess of indie twaddle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a sad ending, just an ending untold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Twin Falls Idaho" starts out with a down-and-out hooker trying to make her rent by servicing a mysterious customer in an all-too-obvious seedy hotel. What she finds is an adult conjoined twin (two heads with one shared body), one of whom she ?falls' for, in this ambitious love story by twins Mark and Michael Polish who also play the lead roles. Freaks are no easy subject to portray well on film without being sensational but this movie, like the Cher, Eric Stolz film "Mask", does a good job of sticking to the subject - contrasting normal with abnormal and finding a humanity common to both. The conjoined twins, Blake and Francis Falls (remarkably put together on film) have been abandoned by their mother since birth and they survive on their own in carnival side-shows. But their visit to the big city is to find their mother as well as other reasons which the film hints at. Penney, the darkly mascara prostitute with a heart of gold (played with strong character by Michelle Hicks), can't stand to see Blake and Francis victimized and abandoned by a society that only sees them for their commercial value. There is also an undercurrent of despair in her eyes because she, too, abandoned her baby at birth because it was mentally retarded. The precise way Blake and Francis act together illustrates a key point of this film - can two brothers who must depend upon each other's physical movements and emotional psyche survive if they are separated? "Twin Falls Idaho" answers that question but it does so in a somewhat trite and manipulative way. Trite in terms of overstating the obvious - at a Halloween party, the twins are asked who came first and they respond repeatedly, ?Cesarean'; later a gay photographer envies their predicament but wonders what would happen if one twin is gay and the other is not, and finally the sappy line Francis gives at the end about no such thing as a sad ending. Manipulative in terms of finding the right scene at the right moment - the mother (in a very good cameo performance by Lesley Ann Warren) who denies her twins but shows up at the hospital precisely before Francis succumbs, the overly wise Doctor Miles (Patrick Bauchau in his best Lionel Barrymore impression), who turns up at key moments when Penney needs direction (the use of the two-dollar bill to symbolize how the conjoined can never be separated is one example), and the dramatic defiance of Blake as the twins are rushed to surgery(even though there are such things as patient rights). There is no denying that this well conceptualized and smartly acted film is worth seeing but I just wish the Polish brothers had played their story strictly from the vest without need of extra spice to liven an already very delectable dish.</fullReview>
