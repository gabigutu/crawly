		<shortDescription>Inventive, Compelling, Emmerich's Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Earl of Oxford (Rhys Ifans) is a talented playwright whose position forces him to publicly abandon his endeavors. He seeks to sign over his plays and sonnets to Ben Johnson (Sebastian Armesto), but that's easier said than done. When William Shakespeare takes credit (Rafe Spall), that's the least of concerns as the words of Edward affect the political climate.Rhys Ifans is an unrecognizable powerhouse, and though the rest of the cast fairs well, he shines. As does director Roland Emmerich, who uses every trick at his disposal to make a highly sophisticated drama littered with elaborate costumes and set decoration to be admired. The theatre experience is very well represented in Anonymous, with the narrator barely making the curtain. Believe it or not but this does actually happen and there are actors who specialize in. The workings of the theatre coincide with the events described and eventually merge. In the time of Edward, the Globe is shown with spectacular accuracy and the familiar faces of the troupe appear across plays.The future of England is put at stake as the insight into Edward's inspiration is penned on a relationship with Queen Elizabeth (Vanessa Redgrave and in younger form Joely Richardson). These secrets showcase the power of words to win over love and country. Is it cheating to inject stolen verse into a screenplay? To some extent yes. We're talking about a movie that lifts words, then says they came from a thief. A bit of a paradox if anything. Similarly, it would be silly for J.J. Abrams to direct a movie that's filled with scenes from every Steven Spielberg film, yet that happened with Super 8.If Anonymous has a fault, it would be in jerking around the audience. The movie starts with an inventive use of a framing device, and quite appropriately in a theatre. We go back and Ben Johnson is jailed, only for us to go back 5 years to see him getting jailed. Then we go back another 40 and when we next see Johnson he's being set free. So? in which time is he released? Thankfully Anonymous is long enough to allow an audience to gain bearings.Anonymous is Emmerich's masterpiece, a radical far from his usual environmental apocalypse works. There could be a stigma surrounding the subject, which will be viewed as blasphemy by many. I'd like to reassure you that most popular cinema is an act of fiction. Shakespeare isn't available to rebut, and most moviegoers are not concerned with historical accuracy so long as the story is compelling and filled with drama, which Anonymous delivers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the Greatest Literary Deception of All Time Gets Suberp Cinematic Treatment--Superior to "Shakespear In Love"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About 300 years after the publication of the first collected works of Shakespeare, the so-called First Folio (1623), a schoolmaster named J. Thomas Looney (pronounced "loanee") facilitated his students in readings of the Shakespeare plays, particularly "the Merchant of Venice". Over the years while watching the plays, hearing their rhetoric, and absorbing this remarkable voice whose Elizabethan presence is still revered and studied today, Looney became convinced the man from Stratford who is attributed to having written the plays (the Orthodox View), was not the true author. He came to believe the name "William Shakespeare" which appeared on two published poems, the later quartos and the First Folio was in reality a pseudonym for someone else, possibly a nobleman. Previously, those who questioned the Orthodox View, sometimes called Anti-Stratfordians, had proposed others of the Elizebethan Age, such as Sir Francis Bacon and Christopher Marlowe, but Looney was convinced the true author was someone never before put forth since Shakespearian scholarship began in the 18th century. Shakespeare has and still does remain shrouded in mystery. Because Shakespeare biographical detail has been sketchy at best, Looney developed a profile similar to those used by detectives to paint a picture of his candidate, based on elements in the plays. He determined the writer was a nobleman, a Falconer, possibly sympathetic to the Lancastrian side of the Wars of the Roses, and someone who loved Italy and Italian culture. And, most important of all, that he was a poet who possibly had written poems and/or plays under his own name before going under the name of William Shakespeare. After finding a number of primary sources at the British Library, he came up with his findings. Looney proposed a somewhat forgotten nobleman named Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford, as being the true identity of the poet/playwright William Shakespeare in a book called simply "Shakespeare Identified"."Anonymous" is a film based on Looney's original notion that Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford, penned the plays which would become the greatest literary canon of the English language. The events surrounding the plays, their performances, Oxford's conscious willingness to stay behind the scenes, and the attribution of the plays to the man from Stratford, a businessman who had little or no experience in theatre, are all dramatized in a period film which takes you back to the world of the Elizabethan Stage. One of the best aspects of "Anonymous" is how it relates the plays to political rhetoric of the period. In recent years, Shakespearian scholars have proposed that many figures of the Elizabethan Court were satirized in the plays, such as William Cecil and his son Robert Cecil. The links between the plays and contemporary politics are brought to the fore much more directly than in "Shakespeare in Love".Character actor Rhys Ifans offers an Oscar-caliber performance as the man who some believe was the real Shakespeare. Ifans finds that delicate balance between the remarkable artist and the troubled nobleman who could not reconcile the two worlds of his life. If Shakespeare was in fact a nobleman who went under a pseudonym, many of the events portrayed in "Anonymous" are plausible. Unlike today, playwrights and poets lived on the periphery of society, and a nobleman of the rank of Oxford writing plays containing charged political rhetoric would have been scandalous, hence the Shakespeare-Oxford theory.The hero of the movie is actually his colleague Ben Johnson, the Elizabethan playwright who has always dwelt under the shadow of Shakespeare, especially in modern times. Johnson would have been the greatest playwright of his age if Shakespeare had not been writing. In this story, he becomes the guardian of the Shakespeare plays, and supposedly the man who saves the canon for posterity. Johnson in fact wrote the preface to the First Folio of 1623. If there had been a cover-up of Shakespeare's true identity, Johnson would have known.While the film bases many of its embellishments on facts known about Edward de Vere, the film does take a few rather implausible historical licenses, not unlike Amadeus which appeared about 25 years ago. Edward de Vere may have flirted with Queen Elizabeth when he was younger, but whether they bore a child does seem quite fantastic. Later in the film, an extraordinary truth about Oxford's own heritage is revealed. However, films have to tell a story, and some licenses are made in order the story remain interesting and compelling. Shakespeare in many of his plays bent history to fulfill his dramatic goals and theatrical visions.Many Shakespeare enthusiasts not only dismiss the Oxfordian argument but do not approve of the subject altogether. Some Stratfordians' view is that there is no "authorship question" and that any attempt to discredit the man from Stratford does a disservice to Shakespare. I think "Anonymous" is not so much about changing minds but about bringing the question out into the open. Regardless on which side of the fence you may be, there are a lot of questions concerning the life of Shakespeare. Answers to mundane questions, such as primary sources concerning his composing, are strangely absent. No one seems to have mentioned Stratford being any kind of a poet, playwright or actor in Stratford. However, as shown in the film, primary source evidence survives which speaks of Edward de Vere as an adolescent putting on a short play for the young Queen Elizabeth.So the film brings us back to the fundamental question: did Oxford write the Shakespeare Canon or was it the man from Stratford? Primary source evidence is sparse, and documents which could have shed light on this problem may have perished in the Great Fire of London in 1666. In short, we may never know. But Oxford's star is on the rise, and in years to come, this may be the first film to acknowledge there is indeed a question. Whether it has been answered is up to each viewer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anonymous = Entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First thing to point out. When going to watch this movie I had no intention whatsoever to judge it on its historical accuracy. I simply did not and do not care. If you want a documentary on Elizabethan times then clearly you shouldn't be watching this particular film.If, on the other hand, you want a perfectly entertaining and interesting way to spend a couple of hours then you should go and see it. I thought the story was engaging and original (if, like myself, you're not a pretentious academic). The acting was, on the whole, very accomplished. In particular, I thought Rhys Ifans gave a brilliant performance as De Vere and was perfect for the role. I did find Rafe Spall pretty annoying as Shakespeare, but perhaps I should give him the benefit of the doubt as this was probably the aim of the character.With regards to the historical rewrite then surely if people are interested in what 'Anonymous' suggests they'll try to find out more about the subject in order to make their own mind up. Nothing wrong with that. And those taking Hollywood's version of history at face value are pretty much beyond help anyway.Certainly one of the most memorable movies i've seen (for the right reasons) this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I, once gone, to all the world must die." ? William Shakespeare, Sonnet #81 Actor George Dillon has said, "The purpose of drama is to challenge people and to make people see things slightly differently." The challenge is laid down in stunning fashion by German director Roland Emmerich in his latest work, Anonymous, one of the best films of the year. Focusing on two of the most important events of the Elizabethan age: the Essex Rebellion of 1601 and the succession to the throne of Queen Elizabeth I, the film supports the premise that Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford, a prominent aristocrat and court insider, was the real author of the works attributed to William Shakespeare, plays and poems of romance, tragic political intrigue, and comedy that contain such a compelling beauty and searing intensity that, after 400 years, still reach directly into our hearts and remain there forever.Described as a "political thriller", Anonymous creates an atmosphere of foreboding and intrigue that, like many films of the genre, begins with a jumble of names, images, and flashbacks that challenge us to sort it all out. We are not certain of anything, but Emmerich invites us, in the words of Diane Ackerman "to groom our curiosity like a high-spirited thoroughbred, climb aboard, and gallop over the thick, sunstruck hills." Steering us through the maze of Tudor history, the film makes credible the startling events of the time, providing an authentic recreation of London in the 16th century with its crowded theaters and raucous audience, cluttered streets, and court royalty decked out in fine jewels.Though some may point out historical inaccuracies in the film, Emmerich, citing Shakespeare in Love as an example, says that the film contains an "emotional truth" rather than a literal one because "the drama is the primary concern." He need not have had concern on that aspect. Through Emmerich's direction, the writing of John Orloff, the cinematography of Anna Foerster, and the superlative performance of an all British cast including Oscar-worthy performances by Vanessa Redgrave as Queen Elizabeth I and Rhys Ifans as Oxford, Anonymous succeeds both as an authentic drama and a plausible explanation for many of the problems surrounding the authorship question. While the film may lack a certain depth of characterization, it more than makes up for it with style, spectacle, and an involving story.To some, the film may be skating on narrative thin ice, Emmerich, however, told an interviewer that "if we provoke, let's provoke all the way," and provoke he does. According to Anonymous, de Vere, in addition to being Shakespeare, was also the illegitimate son of the Queen and, in 1573, the father of a son with Elizabeth, Henry Wriothesley, the 3rd Earl of Southampton (Xavier Samuel). Emmerich handles the subject of incest with great taste, with neither the "Virgin Queen" nor Oxford knowing the truth until close to the end of their lives. After a brief prologue by actor Sir Derek Jacobi, the film begins with the arrest of playwright Ben Jonson (Sebastian Armento) by faceless men in knight's armor in the middle of a theatrical performance.The author of the play is a well-known writer who, though he is soon released, is taken to the Tower and accused of sedition and slandering the State by the mere act of authoring a play, the mark of a totalitarian society reflecting a growing disdain for the arts. The film then flashes back five years, then forty years, as we become acquainted with the young Earl of Oxford (Jamie Campbell Bower), taught by highly educated tutors with access to a vast library in the home of William Cecil (David Thewlis), where he was brought up as a ward of the court after his father's death. We also witness his marriage to a teenage Anne Cecil (Amy Kwolek), daughter of William, a marriage that never produced any lasting satisfaction for either party.As we return to present time, Oxford is forced to hide his identity because of the biting satire of his plays that lampoon some of the more prominent members of the court, and also as a result of a political arrangement that becomes clearer later in the film. His initial choice to front for him is the same Ben Jonson but Jonson refuses, passing the mantle to Will Shakespeare (Rafe Spall), an actor for the Lord Chamberlain's Men who seizes the opportunity. In a superbly comic performance, Spall portrays Will as an illiterate money-grubber who can barely speak coherently but is willing to sell his name to Oxford at a premium cost. The heart of the plot, however, focuses on the attempt to seize power from Cecil's son Robert, an episode that is known to history as The Essex Rebellion of 1601.This insurrection, led by Robert Devereaux, the Second Earl of Essex (Sam Reid) results in his beheading and the imprisonment of Southampton who is sent to the Tower awaiting certain death. Oxford's attempt to persuade Elizabeth to save their son results in a political deal that makes us privy to why Oxford was never able to reveal his authorship of the Shakespeare canon. While some critics may proclaim the movie a moment of singularity that indicates the end of the world as we know it (even before 2012), Anonymous may have the opposite effect, opening the subject to a wider audience who may be able to view Shakespeare and his times from a totally new perspective.In Robert Heinlein's "Stranger in a Strange Land," Jubal said we're prisoners of our early indoctrinations, "for it is hard, very nearly impossible, to shake off one's earliest training." If my intuition is correct, the prison gates will soon be swinging wide open, and the shaking will begin in earnest. As Victor Hugo said, "Nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anonymous -- Hacking history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>These days, the term "Anonymous" conjures up visions of unknown activists trying to influence history from the wings. They write things, and that writing changes society. In his film of the same name, director Roland Emmerich seems to be suggesting that this idea is not exactly new, and that the plays and poems attributed to William Shakespeare were essentially motivated by the same desire. He takes the age-old mystery of "Who really wrote Shakespeare's plays?" and turns it into a political thriller.If it's difficult for you to imagine a historical costume drama done by the director of "Universal Soldier," "Stargate," "Independence Day," "Godzilla," "The Day After Tomorrow" and "2012," you are not alone. :-) I suspected that the screenplay (by John Orloff) came first, and that Emmerich discovered it and became enamored of it, and a quick trip to the IMDb verifies that this intuition was correct. It also informs me that Emmerich, taking advantage of the money he made on the previous films, paid for this whole movie out of his own pocket, so that he could have full control of the film, without interference from any studio. It shows.It's not a bad movie at all. And this is something I never thought I'd find myself saying about a Roland Emmerich movie. The cast is simply to die for: Vanessa Redgrave as Queen Elizabeth the elder; her daughter Joely Richardson as Elizabeth the younger; Rafe Spall as Shakespeare (a talentless clod of an actor); Sebastian Arnesto as Ben Johnson (a talented playwright, but not even in the same galaxy of greatness as the author of Shakespeare's plays); David Thewlis as William Cecil; Edward Hogg as Robert Cecil; Derek Jacobi doing the prologue; Jaime Campbell Bower (from "Camelot") as the younger Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford; and Rhys Ifans as the older Edward de Vere, and the real author of Shakespeare's work.As presented, the plot is not at all a scholarly argument for the Earl of Oxford's authorship of these plays. It is instead a clever reimagining of historical events (some treated as loosely as Shakespeare himself treated actual history) to turn the answer to the mystery that scholars argue about into a taut political thriller. In Orloff's/Emmerich's vision, Edward de Vere wrote the plays and published them under someone else's name for no less a reason that to foment revolution, change the course of history, and determine the next king of England.And damnit, that reimagining kinda worked for me. The sets and costumes are pitch perfect, the performances are good, and the potential is there for a good time to be had by all. Like anything related to Shakespeare, the more you know about him and his work, the better this film will be for you. There are so many asides and in-jokes that I cannot begin to go into them. Orloff really did his research. Except for the part about Edward de Vere having died before at least 10 of Shakespeare's plays were written, that is. But that's just a nitpick, and should not stand in the way of writing a good drama. Those kinds of historical nitpicks did not deter Shakespeare, and they don't deter Orloff and Emmerich. All of them understand that "The play's the thing," and that history doesn't mean diddleysquat compared to that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow! You've got to see this. Whether true or not, it's a fascinating film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone in our theater was so mesmerized by this many-layered plot that no one even got up to go the bathroom. My head was spinning a bit, trying to keep up with who was related to whom, but I loved every minute of it.And I know the cast is highly pedigreed because I recognized some of the actors in the plays from a live performance of Shakespeare the Old Globe Theater troupe gave at UCLA a few years ago while the Old Globe was being renovated. Annette Bening was in the audience that night, so it was a pretty cool evening all around.After the movie I was at a restaurant next to the theater and I heard a woman say, "I just saw that Shakespeare movie and I'm in a daze."Go see it and you will be, too.

		<shortDescription>A Play By Any Other Name ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. While it is clear that writer John Orloff and director Roland Emmerich believe that Edward De Vere, The Earl of Oxford, and not Will Shakespeare, wrote the infamous and iconic plays we have celebrated for 400 years, my advice is to watch this as a Hollywood movie and not a docu-drama. Hollywood is at its best when exaggerating, twisting and dramatizing historic events and figures.You may be an expert on Shakespeare and even Elizabethan history, but whether you are or whether you are not, my guess is that you will find this to be interesting and thought-provoking. You may agree with the idea that Shakespeare was not the prolific and talented author, but this movie provides one possible alternative ... with no scientific proof or actual documentation. We see Rhys Ifans and Jamie Campbell Bower portray Edward De Vere as the older and younger version respectively. Both capture his passion for writing and frustration at being unable to live the life for which he was born.Vanessa Redgrave and her real life daughter Joely Richardson portray Queen Elizabeth at the older and younger stages, and we certainly get a distinctive impression of how "the Virgin Queen" may have been mis-labeled as much as any figure in history. Many lovers and illegitimate children are mentioned and the web of secrecy would have been exhausting, given the other responsibilities of her position.Rafe Spall portrays Will Shakespeare as what one might call The Village Idiot. The buffoonery we see from this man is an extreme that weakens the case for De Vere, rather than strengthen it. Though talented writer Ben Jonson (Sebastian Armesto) was De Vere's first choice, the lack of morals by the illiterate actor Shakespeare allows him to seize a capitalistic opportunity and soak up the audience love.The best part of the film is the realistic look and feel of the streets, the Globe Theater and costumes. Rhys Ifans is exceptional in the role of De Vere, and the story itself plays out much like one of Shakespeare's plays. The downside is, I believe most will find the multitude of characters and time-lines and sub-plots to be quite confusing at times. Don't take a bathroom break or you'll miss new babies being born and upheavals being planned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an ambitious tale of drama and intrigue (mild spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roland Emmerich's Anonymous addresses the question of Shakespeare's identity in this tale of Edward de Vere and his actions in the court of Queen Elizabeth. The film starts a prologue by the eminent Shakespearean actor Derek Jacobi, and then leads us into a scene with Ben Johnson running about London, fleeing from the knights of Robert Cecil while carrying the Complete Works. From there we flash back five years to the first time Johnson was arrested for authoring a "seditious" play, while de Vere, Christopher Marlowe and other luminaries of the London dramatic scene watched. From there, a second flashback of another 40 years sends us to watch de Vere's youth and his first encounters with the Cecils and with Queen Elizabeth. Throughout the film we follow three periods of time: de Vere's youth and his growing love for the Queen; the peak of the Shakespearean arc in London, when de Vere was feeding plays to Shakespeare and involving himself in intrigues of London surrounding the question of Elizabeth's heir; and to a much lesser extent, the actions of Johnson and Cecil in the aftermath of the deaths of Elizabeth and de Vere, and the coronation of King James I. Some have complained that the various swings from one time line to another are confusing, but I found it easy to differentiate between young Edward and young Elizabeth and their much older counterparts. The main body of the film centers around the contest between de Vere's actions to place the Earl of Essex in the line of succession, and the competing interests of the Cecils (first William, then Robert) to steer the throne to King James of Scotland. Thankfully for the viewer, it is easy to differentiate between the two camps, as Essex and his entourage are all fair-haired, while James and the Cecils are dark-haired. There will be controversy about this film due to the great liberties it takes with historical facts. John Orloff's screenplay ranges from facts well established in the historical record to some points that are debated by experts with varying points of view and interpretations, to some fictions that are introduced and can only be viewed as flatly false. Who wrote the plays and poems we attribute to Shakespeare? This is at least a topic for debate. Who killed Christopher Marlowe? This film provides an extremely unlikely answer to this question. Was Elizabeth truly a "Virgin Queen"? A modern viewer might think this to be unlikely (especially considering who her father was) but the number and variety of her children suggested by the film seems extremely unlikely. And then there are facts not in dispute at all that are contradicted by the film (such as the fact that Edward de Vere survived his first wife Anne Cecil de Vere and indeed remarried). It is important, then, to understand that this film is a work of fiction and is not presenting what it believes to be the literal truth regarding the authorship of Shakespeare's plays. With that in mind, it comes out well in comparison to the feather-light Shakespeare in Love. The production values of the film are tremendous. The producers have gone to great efforts to replicate Elizabethan London, with its architecture and much and the wooden planks used in place of modern sidewalks. The acting is tremendous, especially Rhys Ifans as de Vere and Vanessa Redgrave as Elizabeth. I recommend this film highly, not as a serious treatment of the authorship question, but as an entertaining piece of historical fiction. It might have been interesting to see a film that was a more serious treatment of the Oxfordian point-of-view, but such a film might well have been fairly boring in comparison.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was Shakespeare a front?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Was William Shakespeare a front for an aristocrat who did not want his name revealed as the author? This movie is about political intrigue and how theater gets caught up in a larger struggle for power. The movie offers an interesting and controversial portrayal of Queen Elizabeth I and a glimpse of life in England at the beginning of the seventeenth century. The printing press was becoming a political weapon and those who published could influence the public, maybe to the point of rebellion. Hence, the need of the government to control what was being performed on stage. The stage served the same function of television does today. It was the medium of mass entertainment, which made the playwright a critical player in the politics of the time. Now, if Shakespeare was a front, then the question is: who wrote all these plays? Maybe it doesn't matter who actually wrote the plays but then again, maybe it does matter because by knowing the author, this may lead to new interpretations of the plays. Maybe these plays were political polemics produced under the guise of historical drama. Whatever the case, one thing is for certain: these plays made an impact on society that continues to reverberate to this day.One other point. This movie is a work of fiction and so if it is loose with certain historical facts, so what? This movie is not a documentary. Rather, it is a fictional historical drama that revolves around a controversial and even shocking plot. Whether Shakespeare is the actual author of the works attributed to him is not the point. That is a matter for debate. What is the point is whether the movie works as a movie. The story is complex, yet the movie manages to engage the audience through strong acting and by presenting a story crammed with political intrigue. Who can say for certain what was going on in England 500 years ago? It is all a matter for speculation, based upon the available historical material, all of which is subject to interpretation. The idea of English writers bickering and fighting over the authorship of plays may seem trite and far fetched, but the conflict makes for good drama, even if it is pure fiction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anonymous is interesting, but not totally satisfactory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an aficionado to the literature about conspiracies, "hidden knowledge" and more historical curiosities of a doubtful veracity, I have read a little bit about the theories which propose the falsehood of William Shakespeare (1564-1616) as an author of the plays, poems and sonnets which made him such famous...and I honestly don't find them very convincing theories. Even without being a historian, and without being able to confirm the contradictions about dates and places, it's clear to me that the focal point of these "conspiracies" is simply claiming that Shakespeare couldn't have written the most acclaimed English literature for not having the necessary social connections, education and culture in order to achieve that. In other words, those investigators suggest the fact that the greatness from a person is determined by his/her money or social position, and that it's impossible for any "commoner" to possess the necessary talent in order to stand out in his/her occupation. Under that logic, every millionaire person should be an artistic and scientific genius.The film Anonymous tried to examine that hypothesis about Shakespere, and even though I liked it, I think its screenplay should have been better polished, because its frequent chronological jumps, court intrigues and numerous characters make it occasionally a bit confusing and tiring. Nevertheless, I have to admit that Anonymous generally kept me interested.Anonymous recreates London in 16th century with an absolute realism and attention to every detail; from the mud on the floor to the extraordinary replica of the Globe theatre, all the visual elements are brilliant, even though they occasionally draw more attention than the necessary. The narrative aspect also suffers from some excesses, and I think that the film could have been a bit shorter by deleting some of the most tangled plans from the villains (or even from the heroes).The whole cast from Anonymous brings solid performances, highlighting Rhys Ifans, Vanessa Redgrave and Rafe Spall. So, in conclusion, I think Anonymous deserves a moderate recommendation despite some tiring moments, because it generally kept me interested.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The trailer to this movie interested me but it really beat my expectation. I thought it would be sort of interesting but overall dumb and super far-fetched movie. Now I can see how some people might dislike this movie, especially for those that are fans of Shakespeare. Also the movie doesn't really make you think but instead goes in a black and white direction. Where Shakespeare is a charlatan and a fraud, while being a obnoxious drunkard and a despicable person at that. Also this movie might irritate some viewers who judges movies by how true it is historically. Although history is written by ink and usually by the victors. But what this movie is, is a intriguing movie that grabbed my attention most of the way through although it had some slow moments. And can get a bit convoluted the way it goes from before and after parts, but you catch on after a while. Since there are movies about Shakespeare, it would have been more interesting if it had more of the back story of Earl of Oxford and his life. And also some parts seemed a bit far-fetched. The cast was pretty good and the acting for the most part is believable. Especially Rhys Ifans who played Earl of Oxford, the way he presented himself was charismatic and you could tell the character is intelligent by the way he expressed himself. Vanessa Redgrave was also great as Queen Elizabeth I. What was intriguing was how plays are in a way sort of like movies and this movie was about how plays moved people in immense ways. Overall this movie was a good blend of drama, romance and conspiracy.7.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The most performed playwright of all time, the author of 37 plays, 154 sonnets &amp; several narrative poems...and yet not a single manuscript of any kind has ever been found written in Shakespeare's own hand." A movie that explores the theory that Shakespeare didn't write any of the things that he is said to. The theory is that The Earl of Oxford (Ifans) wrote them all as a stab at the new Queen (Redgrave) of England. I have said this before but I am not a Shakespeare fan at all, I just don't get him. There are a few movies of his I like but for the most part I am not a fan. Needless to say before watching this I was not that excited at all. Almost instantly the movie grabbed me and I was hooked. For those like me this is not really about Shakespeare at all, but more of a political thriller about trying to start and control a rebellion against Queen Elizabeth I in the 1600's. Weather this is true or not to me doesn't matter but the idea of writing plays as a way to begin a rebellion is a very interesting theory and makes for a very interesting movie. Overall, (from a non-Shakespeare fan) I really enjoyed this movie and recommend this. I give it a B+.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>- like the traditional dumb blonde cliché. However, now we must all come to terms with the fact that that tenacious bunch of maniacal deviants, the Oxfordians (never to be confused with the Oxonians for whom there is still hope) have their very own movie. Not only is it based on alarmingly dubious conjectures; the film actually manages to outbid the traditional improbabilities necessary for the Oxfordian theory to (appear to) work, and confounds the entire Elizabethan era with its towering disrespect of facts altogether. And this, I believe, along with the truly beautiful production values, is the saving grace of this film. Contrary to my expectations after seeing a trailer of sorts in which the director actually seemed desirous of being taken seriously, "Anonymous" tops all fears and anxieties by leaving any pretense of historical correctness far behind. According to "Anonymous," not only did Shakespeare not write his own works, he was also a moron. Allow me to relate the moment when, realizing that the film could in no way be taken seriously, I abandoned my apprehensions and started to enjoy the spectacle: in 1601, our protagonist, Edward de Vere, the Earl of Oxford, finds Shakespeare em-bare-assed with a prostitute and orders a performance of "Richard III" (which should rightly have been "Richard II," but never mind that.) On the way out, after having remunerated the whore whom Shakespeare is too cheap to pay, he informs the Bard that he (Shakespeare) has published a new poem. Shakespeare seems surprised (as he should, since "Venus and Adonis" was published in 1593, eight years before), but here, Will's surprise is due to his unfamiliarity with the word 'published,' and he adds, after a beat and a half of inane staring: "Oh, you mean: like in a book?". And the Earl sends him a look of dismayed and painful disbelief that is absolutely priceless. This was when it dawned on me that the film is actually a straight-faced joke from beginning to end.The erratic leaps of time (let alone the leaps of faith) in "Anonymous" attempt to flimflam us like a confidence trickster's shell game, in order to sell us the mystery of the authorship, but when the film is over, only one true mystery remains, and that, admittedly, is a mystery which must indeed baffle all and sundry: what ever induced Derek Jacobi and Vanessa Redgrave to appear in this movie?!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Production Values, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Questioning Shakespeare's credits could be a divisive topic, and mixing the idea with a terrific set of authors and an inventive script would have resulted in an explosive film to say the least. The final result is a film that is highly watchable because of its recreations of a long gone period, but it is desperately lacking an effective script. We are left with the movie that could have been.We're taken through a highly irregular narrative that presents an alternate storyline to show what could have been Shakespeare's real role in the production of his masterpieces. Because of political and religious reasons, the man's true identity is hidden and through some quirks in the actual production of one of his early plays, soon we see the origin of the "public figure" that we associate the playwright with. Behind the scenes, we are told we have political intrigue, a modernistic retelling of the queen's secret life, and the tragic end to the people who might have been more responsible for the spirit and truth of the various works.The film is at its best beautiful to look at, and it is entertaining in a few of the scenes. Still, one is left yearning for more clarification, for a better understanding of what could have the writers been thinking they could get away with. It is in the end, a mystery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Acting, Costumes, Cinematography &amp; Screen writing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The good parts: The cinematography, acting, costumes, sets and screen writing were magnificent. The film is stunningly beautiful to watch in every way. Vanessa Redgrave as Elizabeth I, Rafe Spall as Shakespeare and Edward Hogg as Robert Cecil steal the show, but the Edward de Vere, Christopher Marlowe and Ben Johnson characters are also quite good. The basic premise of an authorship mystery involving Ben Johnson, Edward de Vere and William Shakespeare was handled brilliantly by screen writer John Orloff, who gets an A+ in my book on making the premise believable.Some nit-picks: The whole subplot involving the succession to the crown was a bit tough to believe. I wanted less of that and more background to the Shakespeare vs. de Vere storyline, especially more about what would have inspired de Vere to write the poems and plays in the first place. I believe it is likely quite difficult to tell a story this complex in a 2 hour movie and have sufficient character development, and it actually would have worked much better as an HBO mini-series. Some minor editing changes would have made the movie a lot more accessible to the general public. I have detailed knowledge of the era, and even some of the more arcane points the movie covers, but even I found it a bit confusing at times.The first surprise: I saw this movie a second time (as I was a bit confused the first time around) and it made perfect sense on the second viewing. Any and all confusion was gone, and I was able to enjoy and appreciate the film in a much deeper way.The part professors will hate: In true Hollywood style (just like Shakespeare in Love) the story has fantasy elements, certain historical figures in the wrong place at the wrong time, some factual revisions and a lot of compression of time (events which occurred over 13 years compressed into about 1). English professors will HATE this and probably pan the movie for it.More surprises: 1) There is a LOT of scenes from Shakespeare plays shown in the movie, and Roland Emmerich (plus Mark Rylance perhaps ?) does a great job directing these scenes...who knew ? 2) You don't have to be a believer in the basic premise regarding the authorship to enjoy this movie as its lush camera-work and truly great (perhaps even "Oscar worthy") acting combined with a solid screenplay make this a delightful film despite some historical oddities.My conclusion: This could well become a cult classic. If you come with an open mind, enjoy Shakespeare, and appreciate great acting &amp; stupendous cinematography, you MUST see this movie. On the other hand, if you are an English professor, or the type of pedant who hates Hollywood treatments of historical topics, you will probably want to stay home.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe I'm biased. I happen to think that Shakespeare wrote his own plays, just as Rembrandt painted his own paintings and Leonardo da Vinci invented all those fascinating machines. But it's a free world and everyone is entitled to self expression.The acting was more or less OK and the scenery - well, CGI is often used to rescue a poor story, and it is here, too. But the real criticism is that this is a complete fabrication and as far from the truth as a film can get. It's a league worse than previous Hollywood efforts such as "The Patriot" and "U571", which at least had some elements of truth in them. "Anonymous" is basically a hatchet job, and I'm surprised that such respected actors should have anything to do with it.There's plenty of period scenery, a load of parchment and more candles than you can count. But the film is so full of factual errors - where the true facts are well documented - that it makes a mockery of the storyline. The chronology is way out (for example, Marlowe was stabbed to death in 1593, but the film has him going strong five years later.) The Earl of Oxford, portrayed as a sensitive and passionate man, was actually a murderer and a rapist, among other things. And no, the Thames was not frozen over at the time of Elizabeth I's funeral. I was quite surprised not to see alien spacecraft surveying the whole scene.Those who dismiss the factual errors as "just a piece of fiction" should ask themselves why Sony has released a "study guide" for this film, specifically for use in US schools. "Anonymous" should no more be the subject of study than a film claiming the Apollo moon landings were faked.Don't bother with this film - spend a couple of hours with the written word instead. Shakespeare's written word!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In order to enjoy this pseudo-historical thriller, one has to suspend natural desire for logic and order. For a start this is not history. The mystery of Shakespeare, the greatest writer in English language, will probably stay mystery. So, this simplistic movie,doesn't give any answers, nor pose any valid questions, it just tries to dazzle with bright colors. And it makes it's questionable claim with the heaviest of feet. The character of Shakespeare is made to be a step up from village idiot, dumb and illiterate. Little more subtlety wouldn't hurt. But this is Hollywood, a land where moneymakers rule over talent. So, simpler the better, says the one that holds the purse strings. It is hard to do art without money, but when money rules,art becomes obsolete.</fullReview>

But because he is in politics it is forbidden, so he lets someone else take the credit, and that someone is William Shakespeare. And the unfortunate chain of events that will follow.Rhys Ifans is Oscar worthy, his performance is beyond perfection as a tortured man. Vanessa Redgrave is good as Queen Elizabeth, so was her daughter Joely Richardson as young Queen Elizabeth in flash back scenes. The setting was also good, all the other supporting cast where good also. Roland Emmerichs direction is perfect, I hope he won't be missed by the Oscars.</fullReview>

The story is also another of its many problems; it made no sense at all and didn't engage. Any time it tried to be serious and tried to convince us of a somewhat credible theory the pace of the film just slowed right down. This is completely unsuitable material for a second-rate director like Emmerich who's more suited to dumb, high-concept action flicks and crowd-pleasers. I think Emmerich had bitten off more than he can chew with this one. In the hands of a more capable director this could've been more convincing and may actually make some sense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Was Shocked That I Was So Bored</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a firm believer that William Shakespeare of Stratford wrote the plays attributed to him, I thought that "Anonymous" would make my blood boil with its myriad historical inaccuracies and its nonsensical conspiracy theories. Instead, it nearly put me to sleep. None of the characters aroused any interest or sympathy. None of the characters had any life, so how could they interest me? None of the characters had a character arc, meaning that no one significantly changes or grew during the film. (Well, that's not completely true. The young de Vere played by Jamie Campbell Bower seemed to be an immature horn dog, while the older de Vere played by Rhys Ifans seems to have no interest in sex at all, but that wasn't character growth - that was an unlikeable character mysteriously becoming a very different unlikeable character with no explanation for the change.) As Edward de Vere, Rhys Ifans attempted to show his poetic soul by looking constipated. He didn't show a shred of humor, which is decidedly odd for a man who supposedly (if he was the real author, as the Oxfordians would have it) wrote more comedies than tragedies. His character claims that art must be political or else it is merely decorative, but he never expressed any political beliefs in the film. He had a personal grudge against the Cecil family, but there is a difference between the personal and the political. (By the way, I find the statement that art must be political or else it is merely decorative to be the most offensive thing in the entire film.)According to the film, Edward's consummate goal was to install Essex on the throne rather than James. But why did he care? Was it some sort of prejudice against the Scottish? Was it out of some sort of affection for Elizabeth? He lusted for her as a youth, but we never see him show any affection for her as a woman, rather than as sex object (when they were young). (And if he had felt any deep affection for Elizabeth, one would have to question why he would care for such an empty-headed libertine.) Did de Vere actually think Essex's political policies were superior to James's political policies? If so, why didn't the film ever differentiate between their policies? Does this mean that Oxford would have thought the screenplay of "Anonymous" was merely decorative? As played by Ifans, de Vere didn't seem to have a passion for anything, or any joy in living. He didn't even enjoy writing ? he wrote to keep his "voices" from troubling him. (At the very end of the film, he shows some love for his son, but by that point it was too late for me to care about this cold fish.)Perhaps I shouldn't have been surprised that I was bored. I have long thought that it would be difficult to make a film with Oxford as the hero of an "Oxfordian" movie, because you would either have to portray him as a prig who was ashamed of writing "Hamlet," or as someone who would like to have taken credit, but was too big a wimp to say anything. This film manages to portray Oxford (at least when he is Ifans) as both a wimp and a prig. The film did not bother me primarily for the way it treated William Shakespeare. It bothered me primarily because it was so damned boring.Even if you accept the premises of the film, it doesn't make sense on its own terms. Queen Elizabeth is not presented as a Puritan (quite the opposite) and she clearly enjoys plays. Why, at the very end of the film, does she suddenly insist that de Vere's name never be on the plays? That comes completely out of left field. And Robert Cecil is supposed to be an ultimate political games-player and spy master. Why doesn't he know that the man he installs as King likes plays? Why did de Vere first learn about the power of plays to move people when he was a mature man (played by Ifans) who attended a public performance of a play by Ben Jonson? According to the film, de Vere had already written "Romeo &amp; Juliet" and the "Henry IV" plays and had them performed at court - wouldn't he have already known about the power of plays to move people??? The second most offensive thing in the film (i.e., after the statement that art must be political or it is merely decorative) was changing the line "that can sing both high and low" to "that can kiss both high and low" - turning it into a cheap oral sex joke.</fullReview>

Anonymous is so false in so many ways it would waste too much time to name them all. Sure, you can take certain liberties for the sake of a story arc, but the script is so over-the-top wrong it drives right into a ditch. And what's especially worrisome is that unsuspecting viewers might buy all this malarkey as truth. Shakespeare as illiterate? Are you kidding me? Queen Elizabeth, a long reigning and strong monarch, as a dupe to slimy obsequious advisers whose motives are totally obvious? Ridiculous. Well-known historic and literary figures like Jonson, Marlowe, and Shakespeare himself, played as petty sniveling punks? Really? Other historic figures distorted completely out of their true contexts? This movie bombed for good reasons.</fullReview>

There are a lot of aspects of the truth found in the movie, but unless you are familiar with both sides of the argument you may not spot them. Also, there are many historical errors in the film that distract from the argument against Shakespeare. I did not enjoy watching this film, and couldn't wait for it to be over.

		<shortDescription>The 'darker and edgier' Shakespeare?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film presents itself as Roland Emmerich's move into cinematic maturity, a move away from the special effects laden films of his youth and into a concentration on plot, atmosphere and mature characterisation. Or so he apparently intended, but by the end of the film I was hoping in vain for an alien invasion to destroy London or Godzilla to burn down the globe...anything to raise the mood of gloom and doom that Emmerich apparently thinks is 'proper' film-making. Derek Jacobi (one of the few performers who actually gives any sparkle to his performances) promises at the beginning to tell a 'darker story' and dark the story certainly is; full of tightly framed underlit shots of lots of men in ruffs and beards shouting at each other and generally being underhand. Not one sympathetic character shows themselves; Edward Hogg's Robert Cecil is a grumpy hunchback who, like his father, hates the arts and wants to put King James of Scotland on the throne (which the film, rather ineffectually tries to suggest is a Bad Thing). Rafe Spall's William Shakespeare is a drunken fornicator who kills Christopher Marlowe when he discovers the truth about his non-authorship of the plays. Ben Jonson is a treacherous swine who is given one of the film's unintentionally hilarious lines ('You know he's illiterate. Oh he can read well enough'). Queen Elizabeth is a senile old bat who has spent most of her reign dropping bastards left, right and centre, which his counsellors alternate between covering up and trying to stick them on the throne. And as for Edward De Vere, the 'soul of the age?' Well it's hard to sympathise with a man who, according to the film, killed an unnamed servant and wasted most of his family fortune while ignoring his own family. The part is given to Rhys Ifans who fails entirely to endow it with any sign of life whatsoever. And as for the big question the film poses, 'Who wrote Shakespeare?' The film does such harm to the Oxfordian cause by piling on absurdity on absurdity that one might suspect this to be a stealth satire.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been great but was rather bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film had all the substance of a great work but the flaws in the treatment were frankly bad in several critical regards. Firstly, the film seemed forced in its pace and had busy, over-bearing and unnecessary music. Secondly for quite some time it was very hard to care for any of the characters--they were over-acted caricatures. I'm not enough of a film critic to say whose fault that is. I feel it could have been greatly improved by letting the atmosphere of the times and the drama speak for themselves--the shots were too close in, the music unnecessary and obnoxious, the characters of the young Edward and the grown up Earl of Southampton were cast with men who looked so much alike it was confusing. Yes, it was made clear much later that there is a reason why they should look alike, they just didn't have to look THAT alike and I had to struggle with who I was seeing given the non-linear way the film was constructed.Looking at the box office figures from this site it seems to have bombed very badly. I was aware for a long time of the theory behind this eventual movie and it was way over-dramatized when indeed there was so much that could have spoken for itself if the director/producers didn't seem to think they had to trowel on the sales job. Sorry to see this go down in such flames and am a but surprised given the talent involved. Eventually the film did engage but for about three quarters I thought this really quite stunk. Sorry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie last night and was hugely disappointed. Being a Shakespeare fan, I was always going to be a bit sceptical about any movie that supported the theory that the great man did not write his own plays. But if there was any fear that this movie would lend weight to the countless conspiracy theories that have littered history for centuries, then those fears were soon dispelled. True, Shakespeare is made to look a complete idiot. But that says more about the director and writer than it does about the Immortal Bard. If Shakespeare is treated badly, then Ben Jonson is positively lampooned. Watching the movie, I occasionally got the feeling that its producers did not know who Ben Jonson really was. Historical accuracy was not high on the list of priorities for the makers of this movie. They engage in dynastic and historical gymnastics in order to support the pathetically weak plot, mainly, that Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, wrote the 37 plays attributed to Shakespeare. By the time the movie finished, I think the Earl of Oxord had turned out to be his own father and Queen Elizabeth i was his mother. This will only count as a spoiler if you have attempted to follow the entwined family trees of the Cecils, Tudors and de Veres through irritating jumps back and forward in time which totally confuse the audience. Having said all this, the movie does boast an outstanding cast and Elizabethan London is excellently recreated with both costumes and sets. Just a pity that they also decided to manufacture the historical events.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shakespeare, soul or betrayer of the age?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shakespeare is considered as the soul of the age. But after having seen this movie, you would really begin to doubt. The movie is a political thriller in which they assume that Shakespeare didn't wrote his plays, but Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxford did. He wrote those plays in order to begin a rebellion against Queen Elizabeth I. I, personally, really liked the movie. It was definitely interesting to watch and it left me thinking whether or not Shakespeare actually wrote those 35 plays, 154 sonnets and several narrative poems standing on his name. Before watching this movie I had already heard of this theory that he didn't wrote all those pieces himself. But I refused to believe that. The idea seemed so beautiful that there ever lived such a talented man who wrote so many wonderful and brilliant pieces. But now that I've seen this movie I'm beginning to doubt increasingly. Because, first of all, why would a man so talented and passionated by writing leave his two daughters illiterate? Someone else would nevertheless have wanted that they learned how to read and write so that maybe at least one of them would be willing to follow their dad as a writer. Or that they could at least read the great pieces their father wrote. Secondly, if somebody is so loved and adored by the public of his time, he would surely have wanted to be remembered, because then he would surely have left some written evidence that he actually existed. But on the contrary, not a single manuscript of any kind has ever been found written in Shakespeare's own hand, in 400 years, not one document. Also his will famously left his second- best bed to his widow, but it made no mention of a single book or manuscript. Why is that? Isn't it strange that there is not even a single letter found written by the greatest writer of the 16th century? Didn't he even wrote a single time to his wife or children when he was so far away from home? Thirdly, how can a man that wasn't a member of the upper classes be so familiar with the aristocracy, kings, queens and life at the court? Why didn't he wrote plays about the normal working men like other writers as Ben Jonson of his time did? If writing comes from the heart, why didn't he write anything reflecting to his life in Stratford? How comes that this great artist didn't take any inspiration of his own life, like all other artists do? Fourthly, the only handwriting we have of William Shakespeare are 6 shaky signatures. How can a man that wrote such a brilliant plays have difficulties signing his own name? Fifthly, there is no proof that he did attempt the Stratford grammar school as they use to say, but his work shows us such a big acknowledge on different subjects. He even got a very rich vocabulary. How can it even be possible that he wrote such a brilliant things without at least have some form of learning? Sixthly, William Shakespeare didn't spent the remainder of his days in the playhouses of London but in the small town of his birth, Stratford-upon-Avon as a businessman and grain merchant. Why would you all of the sudden give up your great passion? Finally, no record shows that William Shakespeare has ever crossed the borders of his homeland, England. But how can he, in several of his plays, describe places like France and Italy in such great detail if he has never been there? This discussion is probably far from over. But the question that we should perhaps better ask ourselves instead of 'to be or not to be' is 'Is Shakespeare really the soul of the age, or is he more like the betrayer and fraud of the age'?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Writing plays and poetry is the passion of the Edward, 17th Earl of Oxford but he can't share it with the world and is forced to let someone else take the credit. And there is Elizabeth I, strong as ever but in this movie with a very very interesting interpretation. I always like it when a movie offers an interesting view. Historic events are always seen from "a" point of view and written by winners/powerful. Who says that some of these elements weren't true? Note for this movie: don't leave your brain at home because there are lots of up and down flash backs. Don't get often confused but at a point I notices that I was trying to match scenes. Due to the plot, I didn't mind that much in the end. "It is not in the stars to hold our destiny but in ourselves" ... who needs stars if there a queen to give destiny a hand.I like to hear Shakespeare. Fair enough, makes "easier" script writing but better to steal well than create badly. Loved being in a Elizabethan theater, but wasn't so amazed due to previously seeing 'Shakespeare in love'. Still the interacting between public and players, so very different from a film experience in NL. In house scenes were beautifully dressed. The CGI for outdoor palace/tower were well done. Costumes were elegant but not elaborate; liked Vanessa's black dress that she wears at the end.Rhys Ifans (Earl of Oxford) is brilliant, liked him in Notting Hill and can hardly believe it's the same man. Vanessa Redgrave was a good fragile older queen but not a good harsh one. Joely Richardson as the younger Bess was lovely and flirty enough. Jonson, David Thewlis and Edward Hogg (William &amp; Robert Cecil) were solid, liked the "Henry V" player but not all actors. Not outstanding ... but Xavier Samuel (Southampton) looked delightful. It's a 8,5 movie due to the time line multi-cut-up but still a 9 because of the interesting twist. Maybe a bit too ambitious but still strong enough movie that I will enjoy watching again.</fullReview>

Now, I don't know whether this was really true or not, but, it's fun to watch.Once you establish which beard is which and which beard is actually a younger incarnation of a beard in the future (as there are a lot of flashbacks showing what the beards were doing when they were younger), you can actually follow the conspiracy and see which beard comes out on top. As it's filled with plenty of beheading, back-stabbing and political treachery, it's actually more entertaining than you might think.A happy filmic surprise.</fullReview>

In it he conducts a masterful analysis of the theory and exhaustively researches all of the points made for and against the theory that Edward de Vere wrote the works written under the name of William Shakespeare. It is one of those books that you will either read all the way through because you become so convinced that de Vere is the author and want to read more, or you will put it down half way through because you have been hit over the head so hard that you just give in. He leaves no stone unturned and confronts every argument against the theory in a way that leaves you with your lower jaw hanging somewhere down around your knees in amazement.The "evidence" that de Vere wrote "Shakespeare" is mainly circumstantial but overwhelming. The evidence that William Shakespeare wrote "Shakespeare" is direct but wafer thin. That is the heart of the issue.Having read the book and spent 20 years waiting for the theory to take root and bear fruit it was hugely enjoyable to see even the trailer. As someone who previously had no interest in Shakespeare because I found it uninteresting and difficult to understand but who embraced it once I discovered the character behind the works, it mattered not a lot that there were inaccuracies in the film. What emerges as you read Ogburn's book is the personality of one of the greatest writers who ever walked this earth and who was buried for all time by a political machine operated by the family of his first wife and the "state". The film is a triumph of truth over politics with truth sometimes taking a back seat to the victory itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only lamentable aspect of this splendid film is that often critics seem to base their negatives on the premise that it was fact being presented, rather than hypothesis. It's a strong argument for many &amp; for the majority, fantasy. It really doesn't matter, the entire production is exceptional artistry! The opening sequence is brilliant &amp; definitely hones the audience's alertness. Once you're introduced to the premise, the initial opening seems to be far past. As much detail that went into its making goes beyond historical values &amp; awe inspiring beauty of authenticity, it's a living world that we've allowed into, a secret shared.The acting all around is superb, one definite Oscar nomination omitted for Rhys Ifans. The subtle soul erosion of a talent never realized, to the final illusion of identity reinterpreted again &amp; again. It left you deeply hoping that this was fiction for the sake that such a tragedy should never have been. Few film makers can create this lingering sense from simply seeing a film, but then this is not simply just a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a great story!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's sad that this film is not getting all the credit it deserves because of the controversy of its message. I watched Anonymous with a completely open mind and a desire to be entertained, and I was not let down in the least. The acting was superb--Rhys Ifans was absolutely stunning as Edward De Vere, capturing so well his passion and pain as the real author (according to the story) of Shakespeare's works. I thought Sebastian Armesto did a fabulous job as well as the tortured Ben Jonson who must keep quiet about De Vere's identity. Movies should not be rated by whether or not a person agrees with the message the filmmakers were trying to communicate--they should be rated on the acting, the script, the cinematography, and the overall quality of the film. Anonymous excels in all areas. It is a fascinating and intricate story, beautifully told. If you like to watch movies of really great stories, then you will love this film. It's definitely one that will be added to my movie collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is NOT the usual "the historical Shakespeare did not write the plays and poetry" claptrap. It is an imaginative, playful, experimental re-imagining of history such as Shakespeare himself might have done. The concept and writing alone are equal to Tom Stoppard's excellent "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead." Given the terrific cast and performances, the sets and costumes, the feel of this film makes it likely that all but the most hard-nosed film AND Shakespeare buffs will gleefully allow the suspension of their disbelief. I know I did, and I'm as hard-nosed as they come. See it more than once if the temporal displacements (genuinely well-used) confuse you. The writer (Orloff) has hit all the marks deliciously (Elizabeth as a slut!), and the production values are all top-notch.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The play's the thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stagecraft is the subject here. The movie opens and closes with a modern-day stage as a framing device. At one point when watching Bottom parade around with his Donkey's head, we're watching _four_ stage frames: modern times (the outer framing of the movie), Elizabethan times (the main part of the movie), Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream", and Pyramus and Thisbe. It feels like being caught in a set of nested Russian Matryoshka dolls.And the costumes and sets are incredible, even much deeper and wider than the typical "period piece". The quest for reality extends to even horse-craft, mud, fencing, examination by torture, executions, military campaigns, assassinations, and arms. One really is enveloped in the feeling of living in Elizabethan times. This alone might be the main reason for watching this movie.Greek Tragedy gets a big nod. Hidden familial relationships play a part in the story; some of the events are truly "tragic". And just in case we don't "get it", an explicit comment is made.Events from reality sometimes show up in the plays. There's a death involving hiding behind a curtain that years later became the Polonius/Arras scene in Hamlet. (This one is so "obvious" no explicit comment is ever made.) Carrying the idea of reality showing up in the plays to an extreme, while also thrumming the Greek Tragedy theme again, an insult is cast late in the movie. The situation is that a mother is prepared to kill someone who's in fact her son over a royal succession. The insult is "put that in one of your plays".And the borderline between "reality" and "stage" is breached many times. Characters in plays are assigned recognizable physical attributes of real people at court. Some plays so involve the audience it takes sides and jumps up on the stage to join the fight. One play intended to inflame the audience to exit the theater as a mob really does so (and right on schedule).The idea that "words" take precedence over everything else is examined. Because of writing plays, the protagonist loses most of his remaining fortune, has an unhappy family life, has a strained relationship with court powers, and watches his ancient family name peter out rather than join the royal succession. (Of course not all of his misfortunes can be blamed on his art: his losing an important romantic relationship and being largely banned from court happen for what seem like unrelated reasons.) The psychological conflict runs deep: at one point the protagonist is asked to to choose between the possibility of acknowledging authorship and familial love.Whether or not the events or theory are "true" isn't really central and doesn't much matter. (Admittedly the movie may try to have it both ways, with a strong disclaimer and some fairly outrageous events on one side; but a whole lot of recognizable architecture, situations, and even character names on the other.) It might have been easier to focus on the themes of the movie if its portrayal of events hadn't been quite so easy to believe for us non-academics. More likely, this movie is a victim of misleading marketing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overcooked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm well familiar with the many arguments that someone other than the Stratford Actor, William Shakespeare, wrote the plays attributed to him and am somewhat agnostic about the whole matter. There are good reasons to believe someone else did them, although I think there are also good reasons to believe that Shakespeare was, for the most part, Shakespeare (allowing for collaboration with others in his company).But this film isn't a good representation of the argument that Edward de Vere was the author of the plays we attribute to Shakespeare. I lost count of the historical inaccuracies after the first 20 minutes or so (Hamlet before Richard III? Richard III, not II, at Essex's revolt? And the way Marlowe died? Just to mention some obvious nonsense).But I really was less bothered by that than I was by the general unbelievability of this film's characters. Just about everyone in this film over-emotes, and their motives are just implausible. I'll buy historical fiction (which this film really is), but only if the characters and events are believable and compelling. This film fails that test.I doubt this film will be long for the theaters. It's terribly overcooked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anonymous: The author of the 37 plays and the 154 sonnets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>#EAPP11_REV2016 Written by John Orloff, Ronald Emmerich's Anonymous was a potboiler, mouth gnashing, teeth grinding drama thriller about the conspiracy theory about the authorship of Edward de Vere for some well-known, most watched, most read and most anticipated plays, sonnets, and literary works that has been known for decades as William's Shakespeare masterpieces. Anonymous is also a historical drama about the time when England was in a succession crisis and in the time when there are doubts of who will be the true successor rightful to the throne.Anonymous was indeed a good movie as they meticulously brought us back to the good old times of the Elizabethan London. They richly evoked the London of its time, when the splendor of the court lived in a metropolis of appalling scarcity and the streets were ankle- deep in mud. It creates a resounding and genuine atmosphere, which established how intimate it was. The groundings could almost reach out and touch the players, and in the box seats, such as Oxford himself could witness the power of ,based on the story, was his work.Anonymous was also marvelous in its cinematography and depiction of the characters. The dialogues, acting and etc. was splendid making the movie more effective and making its audience as tense and thrilled as intended for a drama thriller. And another thing that makes the movie interesting is the way how the story line goes hooking the audience to watch in order to find out the mysteries and to answer questions on their mind created by the story itself. But on the other hand, there's a quite mix-ups and muddles in its flashing back of time in the earlier lives of the characters that make it somehow hard to follow and hard to apprehend. The movie is very splendid even though others, especially the fans of William Shakespeare might found it trampling their favorite William Shakespeare. I think they shouldn't be offended of the concepts of Anonymous. First things first, How can we say that what we read on books, internet about William Shakespeare are true? Are there really evidences or just like the concept of these movie they are just mere conjectures? Are the sources really reliable or are they just some secondary sources passed person by person without knowing if it's the mere truth or if something was changed or omitted or misunderstood? For me the movie, although having that introduction of Derek Jacobi, is not really intended to trample the reputation of the Great William Shakespeare. Because if we will analyzed the title of the story, it is not quite applicable because as we can see there's really no anonymous in the movie, all are revealed. Edward de Vere though used the pen name anonymous but it is not significant enough to be a title as a whole. For me Anonymous was whoever the author of the plays, sonnets, and etc. Because as of now, though many believed its Shakespeare, there are still debates of who really has the right to claim the authorship, and Edward de Vere is one of them. And for the movie, the author believed its de Vere. This movie doesn't really tried to destroy Shakespeare but just trying to support the Oxfordian theory that it was De Vere who wrote those. If there are films that support Shakespeare, this are just another version of the conspiracy theory that it was de Vere. There are many questions in our minds right now. If it really was Shakespeare or de Vere, or any other author who make those fantastic work? But it really doesn't matter now, whoever the author of these fantastic masterpieces, whoever this genius man who make fame on writing that his works are still marking on the heart of its reader. What important is that there's these works present up to this century that keeps on inspiring and motivating each and every one of the readers. Anonymous is a great movie, the story line, the cinematography, the depiction of the characters and the setting, the plot twists, the hype was generally great for me regardless of how inaccurate it was,</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Complicated questionable but compelling history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Anonymous' is a modern play on Broadway where a different version of Shakespeare's real life is presented. After a prologue, it flashbacks to Robert Cecil, the Earl of Salisbury with his men chasing after Ben Jonson (Sebastian Armesto) with a collection of manuscripts. He hides them under the Rose and his pursuers burn down the theater. Then it flashes 5 years earlier, Shakespeare (Rafe Spall) is a drunken actor. It flashes 40 year earlier still, Edward De Vere, the Earl of Oxford (Jamie Campbell Bower/Rhys Ifans) is the real author of Shakespeare's works. It is a film about political intrigue in the English court during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I (Joely Richardson/Vanessa Redgrave).There are a lot of questionable and complicated history. I almost feel a real need to be more familiar with the British history both royal and literary. There is something wrong with this version of history but I'm not a good enough scholar to pinpoint it. The start of the movie jumps around in time and it's easy to get lost. This is definitely an unique interpretation of history from writer John Orloff. Roland Emmerich's direction really needs to simplify the movie although the complicated story adds to the atmosphere. In some way, all the name dropping is addictive and fascinating. The acting is top notch. Emmerich films it with so much murky realism. It's a very tough call. There is enough great performances and the story is so audacious that I must recommend this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Roland Emmerich gets it all wrong but makes a masterpiece of it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything is wrong but extremely well made. This is certainly Roland Emmerich's masterpiece, and although almost nothing is according to that part of reality which in spite of all is known to us of those days, it's a great story very well written. A few things are convincing, though.Above all, Rhys Ifans makes a very convincing Edward De Vere as the absolute nobleman he was, making a complete tragedy of his life. Edward Hogg as Robert Cecil is perhaps the most convincing character of all oiling the way of his intrigues in serpentine slyness. Vanessa Redgrave and Joely Richardson as the Queen, Sebastian Armesto as Ben Jonson, Southampton and Essex, Burleigh, well, all the actors make a perfect job, and Will Shakespeare is finally exposed as the fake he most probably was. The rest is fiction.The film makes Elizabeth the mother of various bastards including all the major earls in a plot of all round incests, while more disturbing is the blatant historical incorrectness of making Shakespeare murder Marlowe ten years after his official death and the performance of Richard III at the moment of rebellion ? it was actually Richard II. Of course, everything is exaggerated, there were no overwhelming massacres at Essex' demonstration, but never mind ? it's a great film widely transcending and surpassing the obvious construction of the absurdly tall story of "Shakespeare in Love" and made more convincing, above all by the superb acting by all the actors (includiong Derek Jacobi, who actually only states the facts, and Mark Rylance as Condell ? you immediately recognize his voice.) Only Bacon is missing. This is self-evidently a full score film and for all times.To sum it up: Most viewers seem to agree that this is Roland Emmerich's masterpiece - a feast for the eyes and intensive action all the way, great dramaturgy, the theatre scenes are all flamboyant parties and the highlights of the film, a fantastic although hardly plausible story, and at last a debunking of the phoney Shakespeare cult. The exaggerations, although overdone as always in Emmerich's films, are dramaturgically no detriment to the film but only add to a perfect theatrical drama of both splendour, knavery, humanity and tragedy.</fullReview>

She thought there wasn't enough "spicy" moments in there (see shows like "Rome" to understand what she means).Still the movie is intriguing, but might also be a bit difficult at times for those people who're not used to the English being spoken in the movie. So if English isn't your first language there are scenes (that play in the theater) that might be difficult to follow). Other than that, the movie has quite a few tension filled moments and does have a drive. It still seems to be lacking something to push it over the edge and make it really great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Interesting Theory!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anonymous makes for an interesting drama, especially for those fascinated by a theory that the works of William Shakespeare's were actually not his work. The film may seem a little dry at certain points, but it makes for an interesting movie. Historical accuracy has never been a problem of mine, and it continues to do so as the filmmakers took liberty to make some changes. But the costumes and production design were excellent, as they recreated accurately Elizabeth-era London to near perfection.It's interesting to note how the film was directed by Roland Emmerich, who normally does much bigger films. He directs a film that centers on the theory that Shakespeare's works were actually written by Edward De Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford. Shakespeare himself is made out to be an idiot by the name of Ben Jonson. All of this happens during the backdrop of the Essex Revolution.The film is well-acted. Rhys Ifans does a really good job as De Vere, as the story his told from his time as a child prodigy to his deathbed. Vanessa Redgrave does a solid job as Elizabeth I, and Joely Richardson does the same as the younger version. David Thewlis is excellent as one of the queen's main advisers.Overall, Anonymous is pretty interesting movie, especially for those interested in this kind of history. Now who knows if there is truth to this theory, but it does raise some questions for historians. As a lover of history, I was not too concerned about the historical accuracy. After all, movies are made to entertain, not to teach. It was a little boring and slow in some parts, but the film works thanks to excellent acting and a lavish production set to transport viewers back to the past. I rate this film 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great plays are staged under an illiterate actor's name amid political turmoil.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The "Anonymous" Shakespeare: Revenge of the Ghost Was William Shakespeare the author a role played by William Shakespeare the actor? The question is posed by "Anonymous," an earnest and occasionally entertaining historical drama directed by Roland Emmerich.The film's answer, that the plays, poems and sonnets of Shakespeare were in fact the creation of Edward DeVere, Earl of Oxford, is a popular but utterly improbable theory embraced by those who cannot believe that a man of only modest education, and little social standing, could have created one of the pillars of the English language. "Anonymous" will persuade many conspiracy theorists but few who understand that genius does not require membership in the upper class.The William Shakespeare depicted in the film is an actor who can read but cannot actually write ? not just in the literary sense but literally: he cannot form letters on paper. But he is money-hungry and keeps an eye out for the main chance, and he sees it when DeVere begins to stage his plays through Ben Jonson, another playwright. Jonson is reluctant to lend his name, so the plays are produced without a designated author. When the enthusiastic audience cries, "Author! Author!," Shakespeare steps forth, much to Jonson's chagrin.Thus begins a spectacular run of successful plays which Jonson and Shakespeare obtain from DeVere, who has spent his life writing plays but feels it would be too undignified to produce them. If that was all there was to it, the obvious questions would be overwhelming, such as, how could such a fraud be kept secret in the hothouse atmosphere of Elizabethan London? If DeVere was so reluctant to let his literary abilities be known, why did he in fact publish (or allow to be circulated) some poems that bear his name? And if he was a great writer, why are his poems so lacking in grace, style, and wit? Why would be publish the junk under his own name and let Shakespeare have the good stuff?The filmmakers (and "Oxfordian" theorists) need something to distract attention from these simple but deadly questions. They need a distraction, so they invent one in the majestic personage of Queen Elizabeth the First.The mature Elizabeth is played quite wonderfully by Vanessa Redgrave, and in a film full of flashbacks, the younger Elizabeth is played by Redgrave's real-life daughter, Joely Richardson. They portray Elizabeth not as the reserved, parsimonious Virgin Queen of history but a frisky, fun-loving theater fan who retains her romantic spark into old age. Elizabeth's need to protect the secrecy of her love life is the impetus for the long-term cover-up of the authorship of the plays.The film comes to life when Shakespeare, played by Rafe Spall, stages the plays that he did not write. It grinds almost to a halt when Jonson (Sebastian Armesto) and DeVere (Rhys Ifans) play court politics, which actually is actually the bulk of the film. The politics of the day include the aristocracy's sensitivity to the political jabs in the plays, but the overwhelming factor is the looming question of succession to the unmarried and aging queen. British audiences might eat this up, but most Americans will be left wondering what the hell is going on. Anyone who thought they would see something like "Shakespeare in Love" will be quite disappointed.Ultimately, the Oxfordians just cannot accept that a man without much of an education or any social status could have been the real William Shakespeare. They cannot wrap their minds around the thought that a streak of genius surfaced in an otherwise modest man who lived at just the right time in history, when the modern English language was struggling to be born, and that he made the most of his opportunities without benefit of high birth or learned schooling.In the opening to the film, set in the present day, the actor Derek Jacobi describes William Shakespeare as "a cipher, a ghost" because he neglected to be modern enough to leave more visible tracks. It is the revenge of the ghost that many people will go to see a movie about William Shakespeare, but few people will bother to see a film about Edward DeVere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Emmerich had ever done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You might think that it's not that hard after over three decades of manufacturing such schlock as "Godzilla", "10 000 BC" and "2012" among a couple of debatably okay ones like "The Patriot", "Stargate" and "Universal Soldier" (the latter one due to my personal nostalgia more than anything else). Yet "Anonymous" is as close to a magnum opus Roland Emmerich will most probably ever get. In fact it's such a radical departure from his usual pop-corn flick routine it alone is quite fascinating in and of itself.The story centers on the firm belief that William Shakespeare wasn't the one writing all the plays we all love so much. It is not the only motive however. What makes the story this good is the fact that all the intrigue between Edward De Vere and the world around him is a setting for the other themes to develop. Whilst still good all by itself, the various topics are at least as important and fleshed out as the main one. There's an author that struggles to find his identity in spite of a great opportunity presented before him. A scoundrel of an actor, a perfect opposite. De Vere himself, not as a writer, but as a man torn apart between what he loves to do and what he has to. Most of all the fact that Shakespeare, more importantly his (?) writing is what made the era, not kings or queens, not soldiers or politicians, words. A pen is mightier than a sword.The acting is truly top notch. Rhys Ifans in particular is extraordinary as De Vere. The only two films I remember him from are "Notting Hill" and "Mr. Nobody", in both of which I disliked his performance. Apparently "Anonymous" is a pinnacle not only to Emmerich's career, but to Ifans' as well. The other actors are alright, but Sebastian Armesto is exceptionally good as Ben Jonson. He is quite young (he's a bit older than me) and I wish him the very best on his journey to the big Hollywood, he deserves as much. Rafe Spall as William Shakespeare himself is quite annoying I might add, but perhaps it was the whole point to his character, who knows. I sure hope so for his sake. All in all the dialog is masterfully written and executed for the most part.This movie does have a few problems, though. The camera work could use some work (whether a pun was intended or not remains to be discovered by scholars in a thousand years or so). "Anonymous" is shot too close often times, but it's nowhere near enough to ruin the experience. Also, I didn't exactly like the parallels with Shakespearian plays, I thought they were contrived and phoned in to be later used as plot devices. This was exactly the case. Plus, some of the characters motivations on their actions weren't all that clear. These problems are not numerous in the slightest and don't really contribute to the massive black hole of story inconsistencies Hollywood is known for today.It is a shame that "Anonymous" didn't do well in the box office, according to Wikipedia (as of the time of writing of this review) it made roughly the half its thirty million USD budget back. Roland Emmerich knew it was a risk, but he took that gamble anyway and I am glad he did. By this move he proved that he's a competent director that can make a really good film without chasing after the wagons of cash. And you know what? One good film is all that matters to me, it means little that the director has almost Michael Bay like status. Besides, do you really think a film of this stature would've seen the light of day without a figure such as Ronald Emmerich? That's where another mystery lies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'All art is political, otherwise it would just be decoration.' ANONYMOUS is first and foremost a beautifully crafted film - script, direction, lighting, costume, music, cinematography, acting - and whether or not the viewer buys into the premise that the plays and sonnets of Shakespeare were the work of Edward de Vere instead of the apparently illiterate actor 'William Shakspar' is unimportant. Controversy abounds in every field of study - politics, religion, science, poetry, the origin of man, etc - so the veracity of the film's take on history is not the issue. The film so beautifully brings to life the period of Queen Elizabeth and the flavor of those times and so richly floods the screen with delicious dialogue and comedy and human frailty that it is immensely successful. Roland Emmerich directs with a firm grasp on Elizabethan ambiance and John Orloff's screenplay is wholly convincing.The film's beginning - after Derek Jacobi introduces the concept of the possible misconception of the true William Shakespeare's identity to a contemporary audience, underlining the fact that Shakespeare is as alive today as when the following story begins - is a bit difficult to follow as the timeframes change back and forth throughout the film to make the story plausible. The young Queen Elizabeth (Joely Richardson, daughter of Vanessa Redgrave who plays the aged Elizabeth later) is a flirt and has affairs, one with the young Earl of Oxford (Jamie Campbell Bower), becomes pregnant, and gives birth to a son whom the Earl is banned from ever seeing or knowing. Years later the son is called James de Vere and is the current Earl of Oxford (Rhys Ifans in a brilliant performance) who rather than tend to wealth prefers to write plays, works that he passes on to Ben Jonson (Samuel Armesto) in whose theater the plays are performed by an 'anonymous' playwright. The plays have become the favorite entertainment of the aged Elizabeth I (now Vanessa Redgrave) and De Vere soon feels the need to protect his privacy and asks Jonson to accept credit for writing the plays, but Jonson in turn passes that authorship to an illiterate actor named William Shakespeare (Rafe Spall) who uses the lie to increase his popularity and wealth.Coloring the atmosphere is the palace intrigue of who will be Elizabeth's heir - and the Cecils (David Thewlis father and Edward Hogg son) decide it must be James of Scotland (not a choice Elizabeth would make). But since only Elizabeth and de Vere know who the blood heir is the intrigue passes into near warfare with the Essex rebellion against the Queen.Many of the known characters of the period are included - Christopher Marlowe (Trystan Gravelle), the Earl of Essex (Sam Reid), the Earl of Southampton (Xavier Samuel) - making the notion of keeping tack of all the derring-do of the court a bit tedious at times. But there are so very many moments of memorable beauty in this film that the occasional befuddlement of who is who and what is what simply doesn't matter. Whether the viewer buys into the identity of William Shakespeare as history has described him or to this far more credible story of the man responsible for writing the greatest plays the world has ever known is inconsequential. Settle back for a glorious cinematic achievement brimming over with Elizabethan color and intrigue and frivolity. One of the finest pictures of the year. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect blend of fact, fiction and history.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are reading this, you must be interested to know more about this movie. I write this because I have a strong interest for movies in general. Now let's go back a few hundred years, 400 years actually, to an era that was witnessing the birth of theatre ? the founding concept behind the world of cinema we love so much today.Set against a huge political backdrop, this finely crafted and well written film takes us through the renaissance period of Europe and its influence on modern England. It is the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, a time when democracy is yet to be conceived. As such, public works of literature or writing of any sort is considered a sin and a crime punishable by law. It is at this point when a young Edward de Vere captures the attention of Queen Elizabeth while scripting and performing in a juvenile version of "A Midsummer Night's Dream". Considered a child prodigy and a literary genius, Edward is sent to live with the Queen's personal adviser, William Cecil (David Thewlis). On the first day, a rivalry flourishes between Edward and Robert, William's son. Their revulsion towards each other carries on into adulthood when Edward scorns the Cecils by using the Queen's favor to promote his increasingly popular plays. After an affair with the queen and siring an illegitimate son, things turn bad for Edward, who is now the 17th Earl of Oxford. Not only is he blackmailed into a loveless marriage with William's daughter, Edward is forced to never reveal his authorship over his literary works. Forced with this taboo, Edward appoints fellow poet and writer Ben Jonson (Sebastian Armesto) as the author of his works, but the plan backfires when stage actor William Shakespeare (Rafe Spall) claims ownership over Edward's playwrights. From here on, the plot thickens and doubles in pace. What follows is a premeditated plan to claim the throne of England and includes treachery and treason, lust and greed, betrayal and beheading, and culminates into an explosive yet tragic finale.I am no historian, hence I cannot lay claim to this film's historical accuracy or lack of thereof. However, I can say that this is one of the best political thrillers I have seen in a long time. Like "Amadeus" or "Braveheart" before it, "Anonymous" is either created from loosely based facts or widely spread rumors. Either way, the screenplay here is the work of pure ingenuity in seamlessly integrating fact, fiction and history. So much so, the bulk of the story here deals with the origins of the first and most revered playwright in the history of English literature. So it goes without saying that the screenplay has to justify the context, and in doing so, John Orloff has come out with one of the best original screenplays for 2011. Cinematically, it becomes irrelevant whether William Shakespeare actually wrote those 37 plays and 154 sonnets, because Orloff has re-written history and has done so as a master storyteller. Isn't that what cinema or theatre is all about? As seen in his previous films, German director Roland Emmerich has an uncanny appetite for blowing things up; Earth included. Coming from a director with that reputation, this is a welcome change in the world he has created for this film. Emmerich has taken an intriguing political piece and painstakingly built a whole world around it. Cinematography is not only epic in scale, it is also the first to benefit from the light sensitive and ultra high resolution Alexa camera. The result is never-before-seen art direction in digitally creating a visually stunning canvas of the renaissance period. Of all the things Emmerich got right, what works for him the most is the all-British cast and the captivating performance from these actors. Rhys Ifans as de Vere and Vanessa Redgrave as the queen are phenomenal. Like a true Shakespearean play, inbuilt comedy and tragedy come from Rafe Spall as the fraudulent Shakespeare and Edward Hogg as Robert Cecil, the film's second antagonist and the thorn in de Vere's side. Actors included, Emmerich seems to have deliberately boycotted anything remotely Hollywood. Strangely, this works in his favor as the film is pleasantly void of clichés and predictability.I really can't find anything to poke a stick at, except the seemingly confusing time-shifts throughout the movie. The narration starts in a theatre in present day New York, then flashes back to the Elizabethan era, then goes back 5 years and then further back 40 years. Before concluding in NYC, the entire narration pans back and forth within this era. Although this gets a bit irritating at first, it appears to be necessary by the time we get to the end of movie. What would be the point of a good drama if it does not stimulate the curiosity of the audience? There may be a lot of controversy behind this film's historical accuracy. Then again, I really doubt John Orloff or Roland Emmerich started out towards making a documentary or a biopic. Instead, what we have here is a memorable period saga made possible by an ingenious script, flawless acting, benchmarking production design and art direction, all put together by meticulous direction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than just tragic irony</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To all fans of film AND Shakespeare out there, I'll try and keep this short. There are two separate issues as far as "Anonymous" is concerned. 1 - Whether or not it is a good, entertaining film. 2 - Whether or not it does any justice at all to the Oxfordian theory of authorship regarding the plays that have come to us under Shakespeare's name, which, whether or not one agrees with it, is a serious if highly speculative theory backed up by a lot of painstaking research of those who made it famous. Usually, people who care for issue no. 1, don't care much about issue no. 2, and vice versa. Those who don't care about the authorship question can ignore the second half of this review.On the first account, there is nothing much to recommend this film over any other in similar genres. It offers the usual fare as far as Hollywood productions about Elizabethan England are concerned: good production values, good costumes and sets, a plethora of (irony or ironies) English Shakespearean actors, a fair amount of humor and thrills which speak to modern audiences, and a good yarn about conspiracy and power games behind the throne. Ifans is interesting as De Vere, and the buffoon who mocks Shakespeare quite funny. If this is the sort of thing you like, you might enjoy this film.On the second issue, this film is a ludicrously funny tragedy. The Oxfordian theory of authorship is riddled with many holes and insurmountable difficulties even when conducted under close historical scrutiny. It certainly didn't need Emmerich and co. doing it any favors by turning it into a very funny joke of absurd anachronisms and howlers. This film has as much to do with actual history as "Life of Brian" has with the New Testament. Which means of course that as a satirical comedy, this film is a success. After all, the only thing that keeps the Oxfordian theory afloat in academic circles is the careful attention its advocates must give to historical detail. All this talk about "keeping to the spirit" of the idea is nonsense, therefore, because the only people who care about who wrote the plays are exactly the sort of people who know and care about the historical facts (such as we have them) and will cringe at this film's absurd travesties of time, place, and common sense. The list of "goofs" on the IMDb webpage is only a small fraction of the outrageous rubbish this script has dreamed up. On this account, this film is total and utter nonsense, but it's funny nonsense. Shakespeare can rest at ease in his grave. Emmerich may succeed in pinning Marlowe's murder on poor Will (one of the best historical jokes in the film), but he won't take away from him his right to his plays based on this unintentionally funny tragedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can't really say I enjoyed watching this movie. Visually it's a great movie to look at but other than that, this movie has far too little else to offer.Most people are hating on this movie because it's filled with historical inaccuracies and basically non of it is based on any facts, even though the movie presents itself as if its telling a true and historical story, concerning Shakespeare and his well known stage-plays. This however was not the problem I had with its story. Actually I don't see anything wrong with it. I mean, if it takes an entertaining but yet fictional story to get more people interested in Shakespeare, than so be it and I don't have a problem with this at all. But thing I do have a problem with is that the story of this movie just isn't much good really.It's a movie about Shakespeare but let me tell you that there is very little Shakespeare about the script itself, though it still is being written as a serious attempt, at a Shakespeareing like tragedy, complete with incest, conspiracies and murder. But it really is a story that just never takes off and fails to ever become a true involving or even just interesting one. To put it boldly; I just couldn't care less about the story or anyone in it!But no, it still most definitely was not a movie that I hated watching. It still has some qualities to it, which mostly comes from its visuals and atmosphere. I thought that the movie did a fantastic job at recreating its time period that it is supposed to be set in, with some great looking sets and costumes and atmospheric camera-work. In that regard this movie is still a real surprise, since it's coming from director Roland Emmerich, who normally really isn't being subtle with any of his movies and enjoys destroying the world, in really most of his movies.It really is still a movie with some qualities to it and I'm sure it also got made with all of the right intentions. It just really wasn't a movie I ever could enjoy or was grabbed by.6/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful movie that merits more than one viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a wonderful movie that is very thought provoking. The argument about who really was Shakespeare and how could one man be so prolific and accomplished will go on forever. This film puts forth one theory. It is well acted and the costumes are fantastic. Redgrave deserves an Oscar nomination for her role as the aging Queen Elizabeth. It was released at a good time, but the brief flurry of advertising did not pack the theaters. Perhaps the subject promised a boring historical drama, but that wasn't what the film delivered. It was suspenseful and kept my complete attention. The plot has some unique twists that only become apparent during post-viewing discussions. I am looking forward to seeing it again and it is unfortunate that is already gone from the theaters. It deserves to be viewed on the big screen with an outstanding sound system. Will it provoke more thoughtful discussion on the subject and create new fans for Shakespeare's works, only time will tell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To See, or Not to See? That is the Question</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With all due respect to the writing and literature professors I depended on to educate me as I earned both a Bachelors and a Masters in English, I feel I must admit that I haven't read a word written by William Shakespeare, nor have I seen one of his plays. I've heard nothing but good things, though. And looking back on his history, I marvel at the fact the he rose from his very humble roots to become what many consider the greatest writer in the English language. Despite having thirty-seven plays, 154 sonnets, and several poems to his name, there are those who passionately argue against Shakespeare's authorship and declare him as nothing more than a front for the writer or writers who, for unknown reasons, could not accept credit. Several theories have surfaced over the centuries, but the most popular cites Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford as the true author of the works attributed to Shakespeare.It's this particular theory that forms the basis of Roland Emmerich's "Anonymous," a taut and deeply engrossing tale of political intrigue in Elizabethan England. I'm under no illusions that the film is in any way, shape, or form historically accurate, and to be perfectly frank, I don't think that matters in the slightest; remove history altogether, and you would still have the suspenseful multilayered plot, the rich characters, the flowing dialogue, and the stunning visuals. Whatever side of the Shakespearian fence you happen to fall on ? assuming, of course, that you're deeply embroiled in this debate, in which case I think you have too much time on your hands ? my sincerest hope is that you will set aside your principles for 130 minutes and simply enjoy the film for what it is.The film's innate theatricality is beautifully exemplified by bookend sequences taking place in present day New York City, in which we see Derek Jacobi lecturing a full audience on the falsehood of Shakespeare's literary status. We quickly discover that the story is actually a play that's being performed. At least, that's how it initially appears; just as the first act begins, the film transitions into a full-scale period piece, meaning we have actually been transported back in time and are bearing witness to the events as they unfolded. We follow Edward de Vere (Rhys Ifans), whose penchant for writing political plays is stifled by his status as an aristocrat. He seeks out English playwright Ben Jonson (Sebastian Armesto), recently arrested on charges of treason, to stage and take credit for a new play based on Henry V.After the performance, however, a young actor named William Shakespeare (Rafe Spall) steps onto the stage and proclaims himself as the playwright. Thus, history has been set into motion. As portrayed in this film, Shakespeare is an illiterate drunk. We see not a trace of nobility, grace, or genius ? he's a mercilessly ambitious opportunist looking to become famous. I wonder: Is this depiction nothing more than dramatic license, or is screenwriter John Orloff so unconvinced of Shakespeare's literary prowess that he wanted to discredit him on all levels, including his personality? I lean towards the former, although Orloff has been vocal in his skepticism for over twenty years. No matter; when I look at this movie, I see a lurid drama first and a historical interpretation second. I'm of the opinion that all audiences should view it that way.One of Emmerich's more interesting narrative techniques is frequently shifting the story back and forth through time, revealing not only young and old versions of the same characters, but also a labyrinthine power struggle between the Tudors and the Cecils over the succession of Queen Elizabeth I (Vanessa Redgrave). I don't want to reveal too much here, since half the fun is in experiencing the twists and turns. What I can say is that it ties in with a rebellion led by Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Sussex (Sebastian Reid). I can also say that de Vere is more closely affiliated with the crown than you might think. A key character, who I will not reveal, sums it up beautifully with this line of dialogue: "Isn't it delicious? It's almost like a Greek tragedy." Roland Emmerich has had his fun with a series of apocalyptic science fiction films, and for much of the time, I was along for the ride. Say what you will about the plot of "2012" ? you cannot convince me you've seen a movie in which cities are more spectacularly destroyed. Having said that, "Anonymous" is certainly one of the best films he has ever made. Despite its questionable perception of William Shakespeare, and despite its glaring historical inconsistencies (see Wikipedia for a complete list), the film is a tense, challenging political thriller that always keeps you guessing. Regardless of how familiar you are with Shakespeare's works, regardless of whether or not you have a vested interested in their true authorship, nothing should hold you back from seeing this movie.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stick to blowing stuff up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK. I confess. I am English and I object to a German stomping all over Shakespeare. I also am one of the boring majority who think he wrote or had a strong hand in writing most of what has been attributed to him. If you want to get into a big row over whether the boy did or didn't there are numerous chat rooms that will float your boat. I will stick to the film. Despite its great cast, super cinematography and interesting theme this is just a poor effort. Totally heavy handed, it can't just posit that DeVere wrote one or more of the plays (oh, and the sonnets as well). No, we have to be inflicted with the conceit that he first offered them to Johnson, who being too honourable, let Shakespeare steal them. So, not only was Will too thick, but Ben also is not capable of writing anything worth watching. In case you didn't get this the first time Raef Spall is made to play Shakespeare as an Elizabethan lager lout in a performance that would make Pauly Shore look like Olivier.Then we drift to the heavy handed conspiracy theory round Cecil and his family. Missed the point that DeVere doesn't want to marry into Cecil's family? Never mind, we'll play Mozart's Requiem over the wedding ceremony to drum the point into your brain. Missing a bit of slap and tickle? The young, strapping DeVere does the wild thing with the queen and drops a sonnet or two in the process. Oh, and we find he wrote "A Midsummer Night's Dream" at the age of about eleven and captured Liz One's heart then.As implausibility piled on top of daft conjecture, the cabin attendant on the 'plane I was a passenger on while I watched this pile of nonsense announced that we were due to land and they had to turn the in flight entertainment off. First time in many years of traveling and a life of watching films that I was relieved for the interruption. Skip it. Really.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having followed the Shakespeare authorship question for ten years I was looking forward to this film. And the results could not be more disappointing. If this was a film in the style of Amadeus or Shakespeare in love, it would perhaps not be so objectionable. The purpose of these films is to showcase the great art of Mozart and Shakespeare to a background of an entertaining story (partly even the same music as in Amadeus was used in this film, so the epigonery should be clear). However, apparently the purpose of the writer, John Orloff, was different. His intention was to bring forth the "oxfordian" point of view that the 17th earl of Oxford Edward De Vere was the true author of the Shakespeare drama. As such, In my view he has committed two great betrayals. First, the strength of the Oxford case rests in the close knit relation between Edward De Vere's life and Shakespeare's dramas. The incidences are so numerous and specific that for most who seriously study the subject, the case appears overwhelming. In the words of Orson Welles if De Vere did not write Shakespeare's dramas, there are an awful lot of coincidences to explain. This I think should also have been one of two great themes of the movie: great art is not created in vacuum. Great artists cannot simply invent stuff out of the blue. They have to draw on their own life experience and put it into their art. This is also why most adherents of the oxford theory tend to be artists while the adherents of the opposing "stratford" theory tend to be academics. So the main storyline should have been to focus on De Vere's exceptionally interesting life and follow it closely and accurately - and see how they fit into his plays. Instead, Orloff's main storyline is some wild and incredulous theories about intimate relations between De Vere and Elisabeth I. This storyline makes the movie come away with a taste of ridiculous soap opera. Curiously, when John Orloff was confronted with historical inaccuracies in the movie, he responded that he was inspired by Shakespeare, who also invented things out of the blue - thus supporting the arguments of the stratford point of view. Perhaps this shows why John Orloff is no Shakespeare. Equally serious is how the movie betrays the tragic greatness of De Vere. De Vere was one of the most highborn nobles in England. His ancestors had been Lord Great Chamberlains since the days of the Conqueror. Yet, by his life he squandered his family fortunes and family name and ended destitute, resigned to live on alms from the queen. "O what a wounded name...". In the movie however, De Vere is depicted as a noble at the height of his power, one of the most powerful players at the Elisabethan court. So the film is awfully bad. There is a difference between great art and cheap romantic fiction. "Anonymous" belongs to the latter. Hopefully, next time some great artist like Kenneth Branagh can take charge of the project.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"So full of shapes is fancy that it alone is high fantastical"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The great and lasting interest in Shakespeare arises from the fact that the author, whoever he may have been in real life, was a highly talented writer, rightly hailed in the introductory material from the First Folio of 1623 as a transcending genius of English literature. What is Genius? Rhys Ifans, portraying the Earl of Oxford in "Anonymous", shows us this passion for his writing gift in an early scene. He is in his library, surrounded by dozens of play manuscripts, of which the overwhelming majority have never seen the public stage. His compulsion to see them performed and published is evident in the character's pathos. He must find a way for that to happen. In the environment of the Elizabethan Age, there was no choice for Oxford, the highest ranking nobleman at the court of Queen Elizabeth I, other than to allow another man's name, "William Shakespeare", to be posted on the playbills and printed on the title pages of the plays. This was the price, and Oxford felt it deeply, as shown in a later scene towards the end of his life. He approaches one man, the playwright Ben Jonson, who knows Oxford and his work as a fellow playwright. Oxford seeks from him the recognition and acclaim that has been denied him: are his plays really good? Jonson replies that Oxford has become"The Soule of the Age". The tandem of Vanessa Redgrave and her daughter, Joely Richardson, played the part of the Queen at different stages of her life with a no-holds-barred attitude. They sought to show the private personality of the Queen without sycophancy, without adhering to the stereotypes of recorded history. Was she a Virgin Queen? Official English histories answer in the affirmative, and one must agree that this stereotype was heavily promoted by officialdom. Those contemporaries who took issue with this public portrayal usually did so behind the shelter of a foreign residence. "Free speech" was not much valued by government officialdom, and that being the case, some have come to question the doctrine of the Virgin Queen. They have postulated of a "Prince Tudor", born of the Queen, with possible implications to the royal succession. Over the past fifty years, a number of writers have, searched material in the Shakespeare canon, particularly the Sonnets, for possible concealed truths. "Anonymous" goes full tilt in support of "Prince Tudor", arousing controversy among Oxfordians. The present reviewer perches solidly on the fence on this issue. "Prince Tudor" has not been proved, neither has it been disproved; thus it is an open question. It's a movie. Producers, directors, and writers always take liberty with facts. This was certainly the case the other authorship film, "Shakespeare in Love", which would seem to be much more lacking in factual backing than "Anonymous'. What do we know of "genius"? Rollo May discusses it in his book "Love and Will". For May, "Genius" is a particular gift, a capability and a talent far beyond the scope of the ordinary, given rarely and coming with a price. It comes with a passion. To pursue one's genius is not an option; it becomes an obsession which he or she must pursue ? May refers to this as following one's "Daemon". This obsession burned inside the likes of Michelangelo and led him to that perch underneath the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel for years. It also burned in the breast of the Earl of Oxford. To date, with few exceptions, the English Departments of the colleges and universities of the world have closed rank and held fast to their tradition that the true author of the Shakespeare canon was a gentleman from Stratford-upon-Avon. However, the deficiencies in their argument have, in the past 150 years, led a number of prominent dissidents,* not bound by the immense pressure towards conformity in English Department academia, to cast doubt on this assumption. The Stratfordians rely heavily on authority and tradition, but it was such an attitude that supported the notion that the earth was the center of the solar system. We know how that matter came out once the evidence was gathered and presented to the educated public. By now, the Oxfordians have marshaled extensive evidence in favor of their man, the Earl of Oxford. This evidence has been presented in three peer-reviewed journals: Elizabethan Review, The Oxfordian, and Brief Chronicles, while books by Charlton Ogburn, Richard Whalen, and Mark Anderson, among others, cover the subject in depth. A branch of the Oxfordian movement supports the "Prince Tudor" theories, based upon their analysis of inferences they see in Shakespeare's Sonnets. "Prince Tudor" is an idea that remains unproven, but not disproved. The matter could be settled by comparative analysis of DNA from the tombs of Queen Elizabeth I and the Earl of Southampton, but the prospect is remote of this happening in our lifetimes. So while Emmerich and Orloff present a wildly entertaining film, based on a lot of historical facts to some extent scrabbled together. "Anonymous" is a work of the art of filmography, but not a documentary. It is a film which may be respected and admired on its own terms. But would the Bard, whoever he might have been, appreciate this sort of drama? In his own words, "So full of shapes is fancy that it alone is high fantastical". That's a line from perhaps his greatest comedy, "Twelfth Night". * The list of prominent dissidents to the Stratfordian theory of the authorship of the works of Shakespeare, publicly expressing their Doubt About Will, includes Justice Harry A. Blackmun, Michael William Cecil (8th Marquis of Exeter, 17th Earl of Exeter, 18th Baron Burghley), Charlie Chaplin, Charles Dickens, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Sigmund Freud, Sir John Gielgud, Tyrone Guthrie, Leslie Howard, Jeremy Irons, Sari Derek Jacobi, William James, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, Justice Lewis F.

		<shortDescription>An absurd and outlandish travesty but rather enjoyable and not to be taken seriously at all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Shakespeare and indeed for that matter, Elizabeth I will be turning in their graves. Anonymous should have been an intelligent polemic about the identity of history's greatest English writer. It should have been brain food for the masses ? thought provoking, intriguing, stimulating ? and capable of generating critical debate in the cafes and bars of this country. Sadly, it is none of these things. Instead, the director, Roland Emmerich, has already made up his mind and has shamelessly reduced Shakespeare to a bumbling opportunistic bit actor on the make. Worse still, there is a hint that the great writer has no appreciation of the literary arts and is in fact semi-illiterate and hates books! Unfortunately, this clumsy characterisation reveals a huge structural contradiction in the script. Shakespeare was an actor and thus had to learn lines and in the delivery of those lines, in order to be considered a commercial success, had to be appreciative of the contextualisation, nuances and meaning of the very words he has to read, learn, speak and presumably act! How is it possible then that Shakespeare could have been portrayed as an ignorant and uneducated oaf who dislikes reading?!? It gets worse; Shakespeare's anonymity is wrapped around a ludicrous back story of English politics in which Elizabeth has to protect her reputation by hiding the number of illegitimate children she has borne as a lustful young queen. Chief amongst these outlandish and simply laughable claims is the idea that Edward De Vere, the Earl of Oxford (who actually wrote all those plays, poems and sonnets according to Emmerich), is actually one of Elizabeth's (many) bastard sons and in a love scene that will have you squirming in your seat for its sheer absurdity unwittingly commits incest in their youth. This is exacerbated by yet another deception in which Henry Wriothesley, the Earl of Southampton, is shown to be the bastard offspring of that early night of lust between De Vere and Elizabeth. So not only has De Vere slept with his own mother, he has also produced offspring with her. Talk about keeping it in the family!! I could go on. What about Will Shakespeare (the real one, not De Vere) bumping off Kit (Christopher) Marlowe because he was going to spill the beans on the truth, or Robert Devereux, the Earl of Essex, rebelling in 1601 to protect the queen (from her advisers) rather than attempting to overthrow her. Any student of history or anyone just interested in Tudor history will be astonished, amazed and ultimately disappointed by such bizarre claims with no supporting historical evidence whatsoever.These illogical claims simply ruin the film and its main premise to intelligently explore the debate surrounding Shakespeare's identity. If Emmerich's intention was to stimulate debate in this topic he has unwittingly achieved the reverse because nobody (in their right mind, unless you believe that the Apollo moon landings was a huge cover up or that there is a large alien spaceship in the Nevada desert hidden by the US government) can accept these facetious claims even on face value. If, however, you do believe that the human race is the progeny of an alien race and their landing marks are etched out in the Atacama Desert then you will lap up Emmerich's allegations like a thirsty dog, but please do continue to count sheep in your straitjacket.There are two saving graces in the film. The first is Rhys Ifans and the second is Mark Rylance. Ifans has serious acting talent and should dispense with the comedic roles that got him started in 'Notting Hill' and which he continues to peddle in rubbish like 'The Boat that Rocked'. Not only does he look the part but he makes the film work with his examination of De Vere as a Renaissance Man who understands the power of words and their ability to politicise the 'mob' (masses) in an age when social hierarchy is strictly observed and enforced. A back story concerning De Vere's intellectual renaissance would have rounded his character out but that is not Ifans's fault rather than the scriptwriter's remiss. Rylance plays one of the actor's in Shakespeare's theatre troupe, 'The Chamberlain's Men' and as a renowned and talented theatre director, playwright and actor himself, gives meaning, nuance and beauty to Shakespeare's words during the film. The best thing Emmerich did was to cast Rylance to mouth the Bard's words and legend has it that somebody more in tune with theatre direction directed the play's scenes in the film (perhaps Rylance himself). I hate to think what rubbish the film would have become if Emmerich had directed these scenes himself when his own filmic upbringing taught him to describe a film (the concept) in as few words as possible on the back of a post it note (Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer you have a lot to answer for).Let's be generous. Despite these severe drawbacks the film is ravishing to look at and rather enjoyable in a 'Hello' kind of way (not to be taken too seriously or in this instance not seriously at all). All the central performances are great and the music reminds you of 'Shakespeare in Love' (another flawed but ultimately superior and more believable romp through Shakespeare's life as a playwright). The best thing about the film, however, is its emphasis on the power of words, the beauty of Shakespearean verse (whether in iambic pentameter or not) and an interest in English literary tradition. If this film is able to inspire children in schools to study Shakespeare and literature so much the better. For English and for that matter, History teachers as well, 'Anonymous' will be a welcome addition to their DVD collection to be shown to their students at the end of term.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly Entertaining Film Will Introduce Edward de Vere to Millions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a beautifully written, acted, directed, and photographed film with a complex structure that is, nevertheless, easy to follow. The acting is uniformly brilliant, anchored by the astonishing performance of Rhys Ifans as Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford. I was riveted from start to finish.However, I see the Shakespeare-was-Shakespeare contingent of the reviewing press has the long knives out for this film and, not surprisingly, are not honest enough to admit that their real beef is the authorship angle.The New York Times typist, for instance, says that the Oxfordian theory, "sometimes granted the unwarranted dignity of being called a theory, is hardly new." I say, okay Mr. Smartypants Stratfordian, since you feel there's scant evidence in favor of de Vere, let's review how ALL Shakespearean biographies are written, inasmuch as we know about ten solid facts about the fellow from Stratford (including: his entire family was illiterate, and the only writing in his home other than the Bible were some business receipts). The gullible or uninformed may not know this.This is how they're written: The author begins with the assumption that the Stratford businessman wrote the works attributed to him and then reverse engineers a lengthy biography with (uniformly) such constructions as "Plays such as the Merchant of Venice are so replete with Venetian lore, geography, and local intrigue that it forces us to conclude that Shakespeare must have snuck off across the Alps during those fabled Lost Years." In other words, we don't know squat about him but since we assume he wrote the stuff we can postulate that he must have blahblahblahblahblah.That's all they've got--reams of speculation for the faithful.And yet, these preening literary flimflammers (and sycophantic academics seeking English department chairmanships) have the nerve to dismiss the far more coherent narrative that plausibly postulates de Vere as the author behind the works attributed to Shakespeare. The sonnets, in particular, closely correspond to de Vere's personal life in a way that cannot be easily dismissed.Now, the film takes liberties with actual facts of the Oxfordian theory in order to make a compelling drama, but a sound case is made in many good books--one of the best being "Shakespeare by Another Name: The Life of Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxford, the Man Who Was Shakespeare" by Mark Anderson; also, good resources can be found on the internet at the Shakespeare Oxford Society website. Nevertheless, it is a highly entertaining film that will introduce millions to de Vere and the very real possibility that, however reluctantly, he concealed his authorship of the celebrated works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was Shakespeare a Fraud?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in the political snake-pit of Elizabethan England, Anonymous speculates on an issue that has for centuries intrigued academics and brilliant minds such as Mark Twain, Charles Dickens, and Sigmund Freud, namely: who actually created the body of work credited to William Shakespeare? Experts have debated, books have been written, and scholars have devoted their lives to protecting or debunking theories surrounding the authorship of the most renowned works in English literature. Anonymous poses one possible answer, focusing on a time when scandalous political intrigue, illicit romances in the Royal Court, and the schemes of greedy nobles lusting for the power of the throne were brought to light in the most unlikely of places: the London stage. -- (C) Sony PicturesAs an average movie-goer, I had no idea that Shakespeare's authorship was ever questioned. I didn't know there were theories that existed that other people might have been the true author of the plays, one of which the film focuses on is Oxford. But as far as what ANONYMOUS achieves, it certainly opened my mind as an individual that there is a possibility that another person might have been the true writer of the plays. I mean, why not? It makes the whole thing pertaining to Shakespeare's plays much more interesting. At the most basic level, ANONYMOUS does one thing right: It's damn interesting and entertaining.Even as a person who never liked Shakespeare's plays (especially the dreaded ROMEO AND JULIET), the film manages to be involving. I was compelled throughout the film, and what makes it work are the actors. Most of them are on the top of their game, including Rhys Ifans who is unrecognizable as Oxford compared to his role in HARRY POTTER 7 PT.1. Even his stares are intense. Rafe Spall as William Shakespeare seems to have a field day with his role, portraying him as an attention-seeking, moneygrubbing actor. I'd also like to point out that Sebastian Armesto, playing Ben Jonson, seems to have an unexpected greater amount of sreentime than anyone else in the film, and he does well in his role as the aspiring writer who plays as a messenger between Oxford and Shakespeare.Another interesting thing to point out is that the film really doesn't focus on the whole authorship debate a lot. We see that Oxford is the writer giving the scripts to Ben, but other than that, the film pretty much brushes it off to the side and, instead, focuses more on the relationship between Oxford and Queen Elizabeth I as well as the Essex Rebellion. As you can tell, the cast is pretty huge, and I have to admit the first 20 minutes of the film is pretty confusing. We're introduced to a world with many characters and time periods jumping all over the place, but it gets easier to grasp once you get to know the characters.Overall, ANONYMOUS is an interesting and entertaining film that will get people talking about who the real author of the plays are. The least anyone would get out of it is two hours of a fun "what if?" scenario. The performances by the cast is what really makes the film, though. If it wasn't for the cast, the film wouldn't have worked. Additionally, haters of director Roland Emmerich might find themselves pleased that ANONYMOUS is a character-driven film that doesn't rely on things being destroyed every five minutes. I'd like to see him make more films like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anonymous (2011): Dir: Roland Emmerich / Cast: Rhys Ifans, Vanessa Redgrave, Joely Richardson, David Thewlis, Sebastian Armesto: The first big issue with this film is its claim that William Shakespeare isn't who he has always represented to us through history. Apparently Roland Emmerich's film claims that he was a stage actor who performed plays written by someone else. Impressive directing choice for Emmerich whose films often included the loud and pointless crap such as Independence Day and Godzilla. Here he intrigues us with his arguments, or downright ticks off the scholars who spat upon his film's argument. The performances are top notch despite one's questions regarding their actual historical selves. Rhys Ifans plays Earl of Oxford who is the anonymous and whose words are never associated with him because someone else is given the task. Elizabeth the I is played by Joely Richardson in her young age where she entraps the young playwright and their affair leads to a son and a secret scandal. William Shakespeare himself is portrayed as uneducated and hopeless idiot who cannot write but only express. This could be problematic to some viewers. The art direction is a high point particularly during the appearance of a newly built theatre. Ifans is given a great privilege as a gifted individual unable to take credit or ownership for the writings. Redgrave gives off a near sexual longing for the very words being expressed while Richardson is more the black widow feeling. Sebastian Armesto plays a fellow poet and playwright. The result is a curious and well produced deception. Score: 7 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well produced, extremely well acted, beautifully presented. Worth seeing. So,what else would you need to know about this film? It is deliciously entertaining and an interesting exploration of Shakespearian authenticity.I am neither a Stratfordian nor an Oxfordian but have a fairly open mind about exactly who, and what, Shakespeare really was. In that context, this was a very pleasant film.It did not resolve any issues for me (I am an Englishman and have never.exactly, worshipped the Shakespeare of my school days, 50+ years ago)but did enthrall me like a good detective story. If the purpose of a film is to entertain, to absorb me into the story, this film certainly meets that criteria. I bought the DVD cheap and had it sitting around for 12 days (there is no significance to watching it on the Twelfth Night). Frankly it didn't look as interesting as others I bought at the same time.Which just goes to show that not everything is as it seems at first glance. That, I guess, is the main thrust of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful, but watch with a grain of salt; Anonymous rewrites history.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anonymous was about the myth that William Shakespeare did not in fact write any of his works, that he was just a front man for an Earl who, to respect his station in society, could not reveal that he was a playwright. I wouldn't venture as far as to say that I believe that myth, but I would say that it made for an extremely compelling film and I left feeling quite inspired to go read Shakespeare's complete works.Rhys Ifans played the Earl of Oxford, the "man behind the magic" in Anonymous. Having only seen him in a few minor roles in movies like Notting Hill and Elizabeth: The Golden Age, I was delighted to see him take a lead role by the reins and really own it. He was wonderfully pompous, dark and tormented. I was amused by the make-up artist's choice to have him wear black eye-shadow the entire movie, but somehow it worked. He was kind of like the "emo-kid" of his day, wearing all black and pouring his soul into his art, his writing.The rest of cast were quite excellent as well, with Vanessa Redgrave and Joely Richardson sharing the role of Queen Elizabeth I, and Rafe Spall as the ridiculous William Shakespeare. The Shakespeare in Anonymous was a self-centered, drunken buffoon, a depiction which I felt was both ballsy and amusing. It takes some nerve to write a pivotal literary and historical figure as a complete idiot. Never-the-less, it was essential to the story and I enjoyed the different take on history.The artistic elements were stunning. The drama was thrilling. The content was very thought-provoking. I highly recommend Anonymous, especially to those who love historical dramas/period films. I'm saddened it only showed in select theaters. It just goes to show what the general populous is drawn to and it's not historical dramas. If you are a hard-core traditionalist when it comes to history and Shakespeare, watch the movie with a grain of salt. The writers rewrote much of history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing and Well-Presented</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, both the cinematography and characterization in "Anonymous" are outstanding. The scenes of London, circa 1600--particularly those of the Globe Theater--are truly stunning. All of the cast are quite natural in their roles, and Redgrave, Armesto, and Spall give exquisite performances as, respectively, Elizabeth I, Ben Jonson, and Shakespeare. This is one of the few films I've seen where the great (alleged?) playwright himself plays a prominent role, and it's fascinating to see Shakespeare as he may very well have been. If you are interested enough to read a review of this film in the first place, watching "Anonymous" should prove to be a rewarding experience.With a very general knowledge of Shakespeare's life and his more famous plays (particularly "Hamlet") and some of the more famous historical characters--Ben Jonson, Christopher Marlowe, the Earl of Oxford, and a few others--I was able to get the basic gist of what was going on in "Anonymous" and appreciate its dramatic twists and surprises. Still, it helped to stop the film and consult Charles Boyce's excellent commentary-encyclopedia, "Shakespeare." I might recommend reading up a little (a quick google should be sufficient) on the lives of Shakespeare himself, Elizabeth I, and perhaps most importantly, Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford, before watching this.While it's important to remember that this is a work of fiction(and some of the details are certainly inaccurate), the basic story it presents seems plausible. One would have to be quite an expert on Elizabethan England in order to fully understand the complex political situations presented here. Nevertheless, all the details and intimations leave room for multiple viewings of "Anonymous," noticing new things every time.</fullReview>

The depiction of London in the Elisabethan times is impeccable to the tiniest detail and Vanessa Redgrave's performance is magnificent. The plot concerns the lifelong works of prolific and celebrated author William Shaekspeare, yet he is only a secondary figure in this historical and political thriller. The audiences are confronted with the question of how did Sheakspeare, the illiterate son of a glove maker, produce such masterpieces. Was it indeed him ? Through a- not-so-well-knit plot, but still a twisting one, we are presented with all the backstage power games of the royal court, the intrigue, the love affairs, that seem to have inspired Edward De Vere, Earl of Oxford into writing the celebrated plays. That is ,at least, Mr. Emmerich's suggestion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More like eponymous, am I right?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's long been posited that the man we know as William Shakespeare did not, in fact, write any of the many plays and sonnets for which he is still known 400 years later. Anonymous's premise is that it was the Earl of Oxford, Edward De Vere, who penned the classics and used, indirectly, Shakespeare as a front for the performance of his work. But even if you buy that premise - and it is not essential that you do - the movie is overplotted, dark, and dreary, but with terrific performances by Rhys Ifans, Vanessa Redgrave, and others.It seems Edward has all of these plays that he's been writing, to his wife's consternation, and he wants to see them performed. But plays are not held in high esteem in London in the late 1500s; to avoid sullying his family name, the Earl provides a local playwright named Ben Jonson (Sebastian Armesto), of whom the more learned of you may have heard. Jonson has his own troupe perform one of the plays, the audience goes crazy, loves it, and so all is good. Except when young Jonson is arrested for sedition, because of course anything that makes the nobility look bad is by definition seditious. And so it goes.All right, so there's conflict. Class versus class. The place of poetry and of creativity in general in society. Did I mention the French also have designs on the throne of Queen Elizabeth I (Vanessa Redgrave) as well? Oh yes, it's one of those movies. Everyone seems to be angling for something, sort of the norm for costume period dramas. I like that, to a point. Intrigue is good. And this is also one of those movies in which everyone seems to be sleeping with someone they shouldn't be, or at least knows about someone in that position, which leads to blackmail, which represents the plot of every British period drama ever, basically.Overall, the acting is fine, particularly by Ifans and Redgrave (but of course). Most of the rest of the cast, although competent, is dispensable, even the character of Shakespeare himself. Jonson's more interesting, and Armesto is sufficient, but he's no Sir John Mills. Or Sir Paul McCartney, really, but he tries. There's no hamminess, which is nice, but the passion is relegated to the leads and the leads alone. Some caveats. For one thing, although London of the period is basically a muddy city, I don't recall seeing anyone with a speck of dirt on them. OK, sure, the nobility gets to walk on half-foot-wide planks to avoid the mud, but still. No mud? Seriously? And no one has a hair out of place, even under the rotten, unsanitary conditions. Also: way too many characters. Picture this: It's dark, it's gloomy, it's dirty, and all of the men look the same. Someone would rush into a scene, breathlessly importing news of, well, import, and everyone in the scene would instantly recognize him. And I'd be like, "Have we met?" I couldn't keep track of them all.And it wasn't just the characters. There are too many plots. Who wrote the plays? That would have been a nice plot to stick with, and instead of giving us the answer in the first ten minutes, leave it as a - stay with me, now - twist at the end. Then you don't get bogged down with endless prattling about the queen doing this and the earls doing that and ships and swords and why are there guns when other people have swords and on and on.Well, you get what you pay for, sort of. The sly ones look sly, the foppish ones look foppish, the witty ones try to be witty, and the queen wears the weirdest makeup in the history of painted faces. In this case, the movie's the thing, wherein we don't even see a king. That's a bad play on words. Let me try again. This movie shouldn't have stopped at being titled "Anonymous"; it should have been written by Anonymous as well. I'm making it out to be worse than it probably is, because period pieces aren't my bag (unless they're Dangerous Liasions), so for the sake of fairness I am adding a half star to the review.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Was Shakespeare a fraud?" This is a question that has been debated for years, and it is a question once again proposed in Anonymous. The one thing above all others that can be said about the film is that it's a huge step out of the bombastic disaster movie comfort zone of director Roland Emmerich. While probably not his best film, it's arguably his most ambitiously intentioned.And his direction turns out to be a nice fit. His visual stylistics are more refined and less explosive than previous ventures such as The Day After Tomorrow or 2012, in that they're actually quite subtle. Bet you thought you'd never see him do THAT in one of his films. Among the elements that set it apart is its smartly constructed art-direction, beautifully applied hair and makeup (Especially when it comes to aging David Thewlis by several decades), finely lit photography, and the elegant wardrobe by Lisy Christl. He also gets lucky with his dependable, if at times hammy cast. Rhys Ifans is particularly excellent as Edward de Vere, the Earl of Oxford. So much so that it becomes difficult to take your eyes off of him in any scene he's in.However, in the long run, Anonymous still falters. Somewhere in the film's screenplay, the full impact becomes dulled, but maybe that issue has more to do with the uneven film editing. The film's hopping between different periods of time and separate sub plots becomes distracting, and the case the film is trying to make is not always convincing. Even though it's already pretty long (Although, it really doesn't feel like it), the film could have taken some more time to back itself up, and even things out. Never the less, it still makes for an interesting watch.**1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

I feel like those viewer's who concentrated so heavily on the question of who actually wrote his works missed the over all theme and message of the movie. Though the movie does follow a somewhat popular theory that Shakespeare himself did not right the volume of work attributed him, the main theme is based around the works themselves, and how they have the power to influence not only the people who read and view them, but politics also. Anonymous is a great work of fiction that will leave you with a picture of just how human we all are, and how the works of one very special man can touch us all, regardless of who that man really was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Entertaining Movie! Elizabethan Drama at its Best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is without doubt one of the best films in recent years and it has been served with a gross injustice with underexposure of limited release in cinemas worldwide since its release in October 2011. Is this another Shakespeare conspiracy? Makes you wonder. Whatever! Watch this movie for the historical drama entertainment. Despite the controversial nature of the subject matter and the disagreements on the truth, there is little if no profanity in the movie and no nudity and any sexual encounters, especially those between Edward De Vere and the Queen, are tastefully handled. Watch this film with an open mind please and to enjoy it. Roland Emmerich, the Director, John Firloff the Screenplay writer and Paul Kreitz (who wrote the book on which the screenplay is loosely based) conspired together to produce this wonderful piece of drama which entertains from beginning to end. Take an opportunity to know a little about William Shakespeare, Edward De Vere and the Cecils before watching the movie because it will enhance your understanding of the storyline and sub-plots. There are many inaccuracies in the film. Roland Emmerich will be the first to acknowledge that. Anne De Vere for example, Edwards wife, died in 1588 but in the story, she is there at the end. The end of the film superbly connects to the beginning through Ben Jonson and the stage of the Theatre which after all is where Plays are meant to be performed. I did not quite get in the opening sequence why the Theatre had to be in an American city (New York?) and Derek Jacobi arrived there rather than say the modern Globe Theatre in London. Never mind that. The dramatic effect of the story, the scripting, the acting, the directing, the cinema effects, the costumes (Oscar nominated) and the overall smoothness of the film are exemplary in their perfection of film making. History does not lie but often the facts about history do and this film brings to public attention what may be the truth about the Tudors not what actually is. You will perhaps be bemused by a comic idiotic but nevertheless astute Shakespeare, a used and abused poverty stricken Ben Jonson, power obsession of people like William Cecil and the purpose in life of people like Lord Essex. There are some wonderful quotes within the film and here are a couple: "Plays are the work of the devil, born from a cesspool of plague, whoredom, thievery, fornication and heresy" "And it shall be remembered as long as words are made of breath and breath of life" The film will open the minds of many more people to the subject of the Shakespeare authorship previously unaware of it and to be fresh in its research and investigation while others will be content to watch the movie purely for its entertainment. That is how it should be. It should not be watched with a documentary frame of mind. It is a movie based on certain facts and conjecture. It is NOT a documentary. What Emmerich and Firloff have done in the movie, they have brought together historical events from the Elizabethan period and told an enlightening story. Whether you believe it or not, that is up to you. By the same token, do you believe in other conspiracies such as one to kill Lady Diana back in 1997, to kill JFK 1963, Hitler suicide 1945 etc, all presented conjecturally in films over the years. This movie is every bit as good as 'Shakespeare in Love" and "The Queen". If it does have weakness, it is in not making clear the transitions in time when there are flashbacks. Most people watching this movie, I suspect, will never have heard of Edward De Vere, so I do think that should have been worked on more but having said that, it is beautifully filmed when it happens ? 1598 to 1548 and you must pay attention closely. The same can be said about the two killings done by Edward De Vere in the story of the young man and later the fencer. Of course all the Plays are in the wrong order, depending if you are an Oxfordian, Stratfordian or even a Baconian but again, never mind that because it really does not matter. The Plays of Henry V, Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet, Macbeth are used for tremendous dramatic effect. I cant wait for the prequel which I understand is in the planning about Edward De Vere's early life and later this year 'Last Will of Testament" about Shakespeares last Will. Long live the King I say! But be there to see his crowning glory. Thank you Mr Emmerich for giving us such a wonderful entertaining and interesting movie.</fullReview>

A stupid Shakespeare, count of Oxford - a Charming Prince , Virgin queen like a doe,Cecils as bad guys, childish lines and need to place reality in the plays style. Small attention to atmosphere and few not nice historically mistakes. But, at end, you do not throw with stones against it. Maybe,it is not a masterpiece, may be a terrible insult to our sacred knowledge, but , like a drawing by a child, in few parts,it is touching. And the delicate scene of A Midsummer Night Dream is really special.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One "Anonymous" Sensation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know more than the average bear about the background of "Anonymous", and yet I had trouble keeping up with it, often saying to myself, after a scene was over, "Oh, that must have been?." (Fill in the name of one of the many historical figures portrayed in this film who lived at the same time as Shakespeare. (Ben Johnson, played by Sebastian Armesto, has a conveniently prescient line when he tells Anne De Vere (Helen Baxandale) that, if history remembers you or I at all it will only be because we lived at the same time as him (the author of the Shakespeare works). Which is true of all except Queen Elizabeth and members of her court who have their own fame/notoriety.While I am not hostile to the Oxfordian theory (BTW, the conviction that someone other than Will Shakespeare of Stratford-on-Avon wrote the works attributed to him is called anti-Stratfordianism, while the view that the true author was or could have been Edward De Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford, is called Oxfordianism), I am unable to give "Anonymous"?the first feature film I know of that puts forward the Oxfordian position?a hearty endorsement either as argument or as entertainment. (I say "puts forward" rather than "advances" because I am not sure this movie can actually be said to advance the case for Oxford.) ***It is difficult to review this movie without spoiling a few things***To be sure, it must have been great fun for the Oxfordians behind this picture to put together this almost (but hardly quite) Shakespearean tragedy. Take, for example, the murder of Christopher "Kit" Marlowe (I at first thought he was supposed to be Thomas Kyd, another Elizabethan playwright and friend of Marlowe's). How delicious for an Oxfordian to have Marlowe murdered in a London alley by none other than Will Shakespeare! (For the record, Marlowe was stabbed to death in a house outside of London by a man named Ingram Frizer and seemingly years before the murder in the movie takes place.) The in-joke is that Marlowe has been championed by some anti-Strats as the true author of Shakespeare's works. Thus the Oxfordians kill off their hero's rival.How delicious, too, to spice the plot by having Oxford be the illegitimate son of Queen Elizabeth as well as the father of one of her other illegitimate sons, Henry Wriostheley, the Third Earl of Southampton. (Good Lord, how the long blond tresses on Xavier Samuel in this role make him look exactly like a painting of Wriothesley!) While many of the twists in the plot are based on historical facts, much is highly speculative. For example, after executing Lord Essex for his part in the Essex Rebellion?which seems to be at the heart of the multiple intrigues happening in this movie?Elizabeth inexplicably saved Southampton from the executioner's ax. The movie suggests that Oxford pleaded for their son's life. The idea that Southampton might have been one of Elizabeth's illegitimate children is not limited to anti-Strats and has been put forward by others as an explanation for the commutation of his sentence. But not all Oxfordians think that Oxford was also one of Elizabeth's bastards. ("Henry is my brother? he's my son? he's my brother? must I draw you a picture?") Ultimately, the point of view of the movie is that of Ben Johnson, supposedly the keeper of the secret identity and, yet, to history, the one most responsible for promoting the accepted Stratfordian authorship theory. Of course, the fun of writing fiction is that you can make up anything because you do not need to prove anything; it's just an entertainment. The pitfall is that part of a story could be true without being quite as sensational as the fictional version makes it out to be. Exaggeration and sensationalism only convince so long as they are not exposed to the light of truth?or perhaps just the sunlight beyond the theater's exit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Accurate? Maybe Not...But Very Very Clever Indeed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is definitely my type of movie. A movie that combines my interests for monarchic history, political intrigue and Shakespearean literature ALL IN ONE! It presents to us the premise that the William Shakespeare we know is just a front for a certain Earl of Essex who could not claim authorship because of political reasons. The twisted tale woven by writer John Orloff may not really be accurate historically (who knows?), but definitely,it was very imaginative and clever, as delivered to us on the screen by veteran director Roland Emmerich. I will see Emmerich now in a different light after disliking his more famous works, like "Independence Day," "Godzilla" and the clunky "2012."The story took its time in expounding on its complicated plot lines. Some viewers may be turned off by the flashbacks and fast-forwards in scenes, as we meet the characters at different ages played by different actors, which may really be quite confusing at first. But you will certainly be rewarded greatly for your patience in hanging on. The actors were generally British and not really well-known to many, except perhaps for the exceptional Vanessa Redgrave as Queen Elizabeth I. Rhys Ifans played the elder and very talented Earl of Essex with so much tragic restraint and nobility. Edward Hogg was properly slimy in his portrayal of the treacherous adviser Robert Cecil. Rafe Spall plays loutish actor Will Shakespeare with ironic glee. I heartily recommend everyone to watch this film. It is now showing exclusively in Ayala Cinemas only. Films of this devious wit and admirable cleverness are really rare to come by, and we should not waste the chance to watch it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Surprisingly Well-Made Period Drama from Roland Emmerich</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So wait?Roland Emmerich, the man responsible for nearly every disaster film in the past two decades and rivals only Michael Bay in cinematic destruction, has put out a period drama? Emmerich has destroyed just about every major landmark through alien invasion, global climate catastrophe, and even Godzilla; at one point, he decided it all wasn't enough and essentially destroyed the world in 2012. I guess once you reach a certain pinnacle, it's time to tone it back down a bit and the result in this case is ANONYMOUS. I had a hard time believing it myself and, when the positive reviews started floating in following it's limited release, I became curious enough to check it out myself. The premise was enough to ignite my interest: what if William Shakespeare was a fraud? Apparently this is an actual point of contention among certain literary scholars, but there are theories that Shakespeare is not the true author of the 37 plays and 154 sonnets for which he is attributed. The movie posits that Edward de Vere, the Earl of Oxford, created these magnificent pieces of literature. In the early seventeenth century, when the question arose as to who would succeed Queen Elizabeth I as the ruler of England, de Vere wanted to use his writing to incite the people of England against the Queen's adviser, Robert Cecil, and his plans to crown James I of Scotland as the new king. Told through the eyes of aspiring playwright Ben Jonson, we watch as lecherous stage actor Will Shakespeare steps up to claim credit for the anonymous plays and land a place in history.Emmerich would've been the last person I'd ever expect to put together an interesting Shakespearean drama, but he actually manages to pull it off. This is a complex story, well-told, with rich characters and great performances. It's everything you don't expect from the man who brought you 10,000 BC. Admittedly, the story can be a little too complex at times. The whole thing is a flashback within a flashback within a story framed as a play. It might sound a bit complicated and it can come off that way on the first viewing. I know it was for me. Once you wrap your head around the structure of the whole thing, it's a lot easier to enjoy. The primary story takes place in two periods, the events of Edward de Vere doing his part to establish the Essex rebellion and unseat Robert Cecil and de Vere's younger years when he become involved with Elizabeth and was forced to marry into the Cecil family. It can be a tad annoying because there is no rhyme or reason to the time shifts and flashbacks occur without any mention so a first viewing needs a lot of reorientation as you watch to keep track of the events. Once you've adjusted, you can start to enjoy the intriguing story piecing together. In the end, I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I'd expected to.I can't say I buy into the "Shakespeare is a fraud" camp but it makes for an interesting story. The film paints the Bard as a drunken buffoon (played wonderfully by Rafe Spall), a man capable of reading well enough to learn his lines but couldn't write a single letter much less an entire play. In the film, Shakespeare is merely a pawn, a swindler who finds an opportunity to rise into unjustified greatness and milk it for everything it's worth. Still, he is not the focus of the story here. That would be the Earl of Oxford, Edward de Vere. Edward is played by Rhys Ifans. I've only ever seen Ifans in FORMULA 51 (does anyone else remember that movie?) where he played an obnoxious weapons/drug dealer with a passion for soccer. He annoyed the ever-loving crap out of me in that movie but he blows me away in ANONYMOUS. That man has got some real talent and I hope to see him develop more of a presence in the future. And then we have the incredible talents of Vanessa Redgrave and her daughter, the beautiful Joely Richardson, as Queen Elizabeth in two stages of her life. The majority of the cast are unknown to me but they all put on fantastic performances. And seeing as how this is a Roland Emmerich film, CG is a given. In this case, it's used to enhance the sets and expand London into a widespread, living breathing town and it looks amazing! This is one of the best representations of seventeenth century London I've seen recreated on film. ANONYMOUS may be a little more complicated than it needs to be, but it's a great movie that paints a picture of one of the most famous people in literary history in an interesting new light.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is one of the most endearing and brilliant films I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Waiting to see it on DVD turned out to be a lucky choice; the director's commentary is almost as entertaining as the movie, which is such an impressive romp I was compelled to look up the reviews in the English papers, The Guardian and The Independent. For once there is such clear bias and pettiness in those quite negative reviews that even everyday Brits are likely to squirm uncomfortably.This movie makes the new big screen Sherlock Holmes series look downright pedestrian. The sets are so seamless they boggle the mind; far superior to anything I've seen elsewhere. First, that anyone had such a wonderful conception of Elizabethan England, and then, second, that they were able to find people capable of putting it flawlessly on screen. Studio Babelsberg where it was shot must be the most cutting edge studio in Europe. What a triumph the sets, costumes and makeup are, and that's just for starters!The acting is superb and without the slightest hint of contrivance since they are all real English actors. I particularly liked Rhys Ifans, Edward Hogg and Jamie Bower in their roles as the older Earl of Oxford, Robert Cecil, and the young Earl of Oxford. Roland Emmerich, the director, points out in the commentary how David Thewlis plays William Cecil at four times in his life to perfection, and I must admit I hadn't really noticed that the first viewing. Watching it again during the commentary I see what he means but am not sure many others are any more likely to see it the first time either.And that may be the only real flaw in this marvelous movie, namely that it can be somewhat confusing as it jumps back and forth in time without giving you very much help. My suggestion? Don't work that hard at sorting it all out. Your suspicions are likely to be borne out in the end.Truly this movie has nothing much to do with real history. It is meant to be a pleasantly diverting experience of high artistic ambitions, and though the English may hate it, I found it both extraordinarily successful and unforgettable. One of the best movies I've seen in a very long time. If I were Emmerich, I would be most proud of this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From the people that brought you Universal Soldier comes... Shakespeare?!?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anonymous... except he isn't. Roland Emmerich's supposed expose of the true author of the collected works of Shakespeare ? Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxford, asks us a simple question. Is it plausible that the great Bard himself had no great lineage of artistry, and that the words of Shakespeare were written by the son of a glove-maker?Actually, it does seem plausible ? an inspired playwright rising from relative obscurity to courtly appreciation would seem to make for an entertaining narrative. However, this is not the tale that Emmerich chooses to spin, and based at best loosely on historical events, poses a hopefully more plausible scenario ? that the works of Shakespeare are in fact a series of political allegories penned by the spurned incestuous lover of Queen Elizabeth to manipulate her and thus thwart his father- in-law's plans to control the upcoming succession. More plausible? Certainly not. But this is cinema. Suspend your disbelief, cast aside your scorn for the trailers promising to give us 'the truth', and enjoy.Anonymous is a well paced political thriller, generally easy enough to follow, that plays fast and loose with history as we know it. The cast are flamboyant enough, the sets are appropriately dirty and tension is built to a fairly satisfying climax. However, Emmerich's decision to marry the film to the idea of authorial identity has left it labouring the point. The steadfast focus on the origin of the plays draws attention away from the characters at times, and occasional lines referring to artistry and the longevity and power of words seem self- serving at best, uninspired at worst. But the film looks good, and, when viewed with a healthy tolerance for the ridiculous, relatively good entertainment. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the best moments were the excerpts of Shakespeare's plays being staged, the rendition of Henry V particularly stirring. It actually makes one want to go and see the plays in performance... which is probably not the reaction for which the producers and financiers of Anonymous were hoping.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roland Emmerich ? what a man! He can wreck up a city like nobody's business, rack up a big bill for the producers, and rake it in at the box office. He claims he's done with disaster movies so we get a historic drama about this so-called Bard of Avon and the conspiracy theories surrounding his origins. Thrilling, even according to the trailer. I. Can't. Wait.Spoilers ahoy! I'll be ruining a two hundred year old theory about Shakespeare's real identity. Don't blame me, you should have studied the Oxfordian theory a bit better when you were in English Lit 101. I'll use prose for you unwashed masses.The year is 1604, or is is 1598? Or was the 2 year later flashback from 1609? In any case, Edward de Vere just wants to be a writer. So he writes a lot. Everybody knows it but nobody wants to believe that he's capable of such disgusting acts, so he picks a suitable pawn ? playwright Big Ben Johnson (named the Big Clock after him, you know!). Ben Johnson just wants to be a writer too and wrings his hands about ruining his reputation with brilliant plays. Bill Shakespeare comes on the scene, scribbles his name all over the place, and becomes an instant success. Hurray! So ? that's it? Nay! The rest of the movie covers de Vere's early wanderings in Queen Elizabeth's farthingale, jumping around in time juxtaposing the girlish Jamie Bower with rugged manly Rhys Ifans. There are uprisings, the discovery of penicillin, and wenches all beautifully costumed and scripted in iambic pentameter.Emmerich plays this as fast and loose as he does any film. Big problem, since he's dealing with real people, real events that didn't happen long enough ago to have passed from known fact into highly compressed myth. I'm sure in 1000 years, Shakespeare will have penned the monarchs of England in to existence with his godly pen, then took on the form of an Earl to frolic amongst his creations. For now, we actually know plenty about all of these characters and the historical facts surrounding them. In Emmerich's version, Shakespeare was a minor character ? a dunce of an actor who couldn't handle the success. All of the intrigue and political tensions were fictional, but not even wildly so. They were wrong enough to be unbelievable, but not so unbelievable to be interesting. If you're going to make up history, make it fun!I can only surmise that Anonymous is a weak attempt at getting some sort of Oscar nominations. Every year, some historic English drama wins something. Might as well throw that hat in. The movie wasn't particularly well dressed or lavish, sets were sparse and small, and it lacked the one thing a movie needs ? a plot. I can sit through anything if it's interesting, but every moment of "action" was covered in the cleverly cut trailers. The "twist" was unpredictable (as in, arbitrary and out of nowhere) and didn't even change the film one bit.Once again, Roland Emmerich steals hours of my life, openly mocking me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am an Stratfordian, let's get that clear from the get/go. I am however not someone who would hate a movie because of the message.My favorite movies are Shawshank, Green mile, Benny&amp;Joon, THHGTG, Lord of the Rings. I can enjoy History of the World part I, Robin Hood, Spartacus, Gladiator, and others that take history as inspiration... yet deviate for entertainment purposes. I wanted to see this movie to see how the anti-Strats would bring their message, and I have to say not very well.But halfway the movie, I found myself not caring... not caring whatsoever, if the Spanish Armada had shown up and won the day (not all that unusual in the fictional history in this movie) and I was asked if the characters in the movie had to be spared?? My answer would probably be which answer ends this movie faster.The images are great mind you that is why it gets a few points but the characters, not one of them I could care about. The queen was too dumb to be a secret mother of all those boys (no girls as far as I could tell but I didn't care, remember) and too much into bedding everything in pants and not interested in state which seems to be unusually odd. DeVere was unbelievable in his attempt to put politics in plays without the ones paid to spot it finding out, while the commoners of London spotted it immediately.... Shakespeare was way to uneducated and dumb to be a convincing front-man. Jonson... odd,, a man of the theater not recognizing good/great plays when he sees it?? Marlowe, in very good shape for a man dead for years... (sorry but that was so totally stupid, the death of Marlowe was Shakespeare's opening in playwriting)So no unfortunately even though i am hugely interested in the subject of Shakespeare authorship, and love to read other people's opinions, debate them and learn ever more, i am going to watch Shakespeare's Henry V this summer (historical incorrect probably, but entertaining, I am told) if it is as entertaining as Much ado about nothing I am happy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Historical fiction account of authorship controversy makes for good film; reconstruction of early 17th century London done w/ care</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Audiences may sometimes divide themselves when it comes to historical fiction. There is the faction who appreciates a fictional story assigned to a true historical figure to create an engrossing book or movie. Conversely, there arises a vocal minority who deride the story as an affront to what actually happened in history; they worry the uninformed masses will be swayed by the fiction and falsely believe the fiction to be true. Such is the case with Anonymous.In this story, which furthers the case of a scholarly minority who do not believe William Shakespeare (Rafe Spall) authored all of those plays, Edward de Vere, the Earl of Oxford (Rhys Ifans), was the true genius behind the words. As an Earl, his station was superior to writing and associating with the rabble in a place such as the Globe Theatre. However, his gift required an outlet. He heard the voices of his characters and felt the physical need to commit those voices to paper.Left at this level, the film would have been more scholarly and actually about the canon itself, but director Roland Emmerich (Independence Day, 2012) appears to have desired a more suspenseful thriller. In this era, Queen Elizabeth 1 (Vanessa Redgrave) is at the end of her Golden Age and the issue of royal succession is on the English court's mind. Most expect the title to fall to James I of Scotland including the Queen's most trusted adviser Edward Cecil (David Thewlis). There are those though who would like the crown to stay closer to home, one such person is Edward de Vere.Edward recognizes the power of words. When words successfully capture an enraptured audience, they can move them to weep, poke them with laughter, or even stoke their anger and morph that audience from mere observers into a mob. To ensure he remains as the man behind the curtain, Edward de Vere hires Ben Jonson (Sebastian Armesto) to be his cover. Jonson is already a moderately successful playwright and is loathe to sell out his proud signature on works which are not his own. Mistakenly, he relays the situation to one William Shakespeare.In Anonymous, Shakespeare is a buffoon. He drinks too much, spends too much time and money with whores, and is even illiterate. Since he is an actor, he can read; however, he is unable to even scribble his own name on parchment. The remainder of the film involves different factions scheming to ensure their man is in line for the throne, the resentment of Ben Jonson over Shakespeare's fraudulent fame, and mostly stuffed into the background are the plays themselves.Sections of the most famous scenes of Henry V, Romeo &amp; Juliet, Richard III, and Macbeth are briefly staged in the theatre, but they are not the focus. The faces of a stunned crowd, the roving eyes of Ben Jonson and Edward de Vere are in close-up, but the words are overshadowed. The suggestion that a glove-maker's son with a grade school education from an out of the way village named Stratford-upon-Avon did not author all of those plays is intriguing. A figure such as the Earl of Oxford with his first rate classical education and firsthand knowledge of the world outside England makes for a plausible argument against Shakespeare. However, Anonymous truly is historical fiction.Just as Shakespeare doubters gleefully point out the striking lack of evidence missing from his authorship such as original editions, lack of fame in his lifetime, no mention of the plays in his will, etc? there is also scant evidence Edward de Vere authored them either. Furthermore, the political intrigue in Anonymous is also severely stretched in the credibility department. I will not belabor the details, but if you are already aware of who becomes king after Elizabeth, the tone will be a bit less suspenseful for you than those of you who do not know about the succession.I recommend Anonymous mainly due to its wonderful production value. The streets are covered in garbage and mud; one must skillfully walk on strategically placed boards placed on top of the mess to avoid sinking into its depth. The reconstruction of the Globe Theatre is done with care and accuracy. Furthermore, in a time when films are routinely shoveled out for the masses to blindly consume based on the bottom line and more frequently their ignorance, Anonymous at least concerns the worlds' greatest ever author. Whoever wrote those lines, be it Shakespeare or Edward de Vere, at least somebody did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoy films that are based upon a new idea. I thought that with Anonymous that was what I would be watching- Shakespeare a fraud- highly doubtful, but I thought it would be interesting to watch how Hollywood would interpret a historians account of why Shakespeare was not who he said he was. The film Anonymous attempts to be seductive, sexy, witty and adventurous- all of the attributes of any of Shakespeare's work, but it instead some across as troublesome, clique and annoying.Rhys Ifans I have been a fan of for some time, but here is his role of Earl of Oxford he is almost unrecognizable as an aging man who believes the world can change by force of words as opposed to force of sword. Noble are his thoughts, but his actions through the film- flashbacks to his romances with the ladies, the violence done by his own hands as well as a marriage that was paved with selfish intentions- all beg to differ. The Earl of Oxford pretends his whole life and comes up with these brilliant stories about life, love and death and the audience is expected to accept that this wimp of an Earl is the brains behind the words that have shaped the English language and is the goal of any writer to strive for the grandness that is Shakespeare. No way- Ifans does not pull it off. Throughout the movie there is no remorse for his ill-fated life and the shocking secret! that is reveled towards the end of the film takes it over the top awful. Serously?!?!?While I understand the talent of Vanessa Redgrave, it is wasted here in this mediocre film. Rafe Spall as the real William Shakespeare should not have been allowed to play such a pompous, womanizing, idiot. Throughout the film the use of William Shakespeare is slung with amazement and wonder- but Spall plays an actor who is needed in name only, but even so, the character of Shakespeare was one that truly put the nail in the coffin of awfulness that this film does to the real William Shakespeare. There are some positives about this film and that is why I gave it 3 stars instead of 1. The way that England is portrayed- everything from the taverns, the scenery, the Globe, is excellent. The costume and the music elevates the film, but cannot save it. The history- that of Queen Elizabeth is just wrong. If Shakespeare's memory and life was dragged through the mud, than Queen Elizabeth was pulled along with him. If one is truly interested in watching a film about the life of Shakespeare that are so many others the surpass this film. Shakespeare in Love- for all its wrongness, is leaps and bounds better than this Anonymous. Or just do yourself a favor and pick up a Shakespeare play or sonnet- that would be time well spent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all let me make clear I don't give a lick about the historical accuracy of this film. I am not basing my negative feedback on that because this is a work of fiction, and was presented as such. Yes it is based on historical figures but loosely and is meant to be entertaining. Unfortunately it is not and has nothing to do with the history behind it. The story is quite simply a complete mess. It jumps around in time over the course of 50 or so years without any warning, explanation or even a courtesy date at the bottom of the screen to let you know where the story is. I think I was almost half way through the movie before I realized some scenes were in the past...its that confusing! They tried to pack far too much pseudo history into one film. The movie could have just been about the conspiracy behind Shakespeare not writing his plays and gaining fame from someone's work but instead there is a whole other story about the end of Queen Elizabeth's reign and the plot to take her throne which completely swallows the main story about Shakespeare. Its too much...all at once...and its very poorly executed.There are some solid performances in this movie. The actors literally save this film from being a complete loss. The best of the performances is that of Sebastian Armesto, who plays Playwright Ben Jonson. He gives a truly outstanding performance that is far beyond what this film offers. Rhys Ifans also gives a good performance as the mysterious and shamed Earl of Oxford. I don't think the script is deserving of the performance he gives it but still he does a good job. I know many people idolize Vanessa Redgrave, but I thought her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth I was very dry and boring. She looked the part and had a certain royalty about her but she did nothing for the arc of the character. Something everyone should know about the film is that William Shakespeare is portrayed as a complete drunken, illiterate buffoon. With that in mind Rafe Spall does a decent job portraying him as exactly that. The character is completely unlikable and annoying and stupid and Spall is all of that unfortunately for him.Roland Emmerich was an amazing director. He did some truly outstanding work in the nineties and then I think gradually began to deteriorate culminating the awful and ridiculous 2012. This, once again, shows that he is not paying attention to the final product and is maybe being overly ambitious without following through the way he should. History fans and fans of English and Shakespeare will likely be horrified by the enormous liberties taken with this film but sometimes fiction is just fiction. Also the film has moments of really beautiful scenery which is likely CGI but regardless has some really lovely moments. Unfortunately the story and plot and script bogs this down straight into the mud. Skip it because it deserved all the negative criticism. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How little do we know,... and really understand...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Assuming just for a moment, and I repeat, just assuming that this is based on solid documentation of facts (which this work of... what? Art? Fiction? Dumbness? Shallowness? For you to judge...), which indeed is by far denied by various very competent and serious critics of the works of Shakespeare throughout the ages (and mind you,... there were many contemporaries who already tackled with this "plagiarism" problem), then it would simply represent a sort of dramatization a la "Amadeus",...But alas, this work, if one can call it that, just because it was put together by someone with a Name, such as Roland Emmerich, is flawed and boring at best. Those who have deepened the subject already know about these misguided views, and some may even concede that some Sonnets, not the plays, may have "borrowed" bits and pieces from elsewhere. Then the question is: so what? Do these exposed facts make this movie into something special? In my humble view, not really, nor is the highly praised acting in it anything but conventional in my tired eyes.This movie can only be considered a good movie, by those who know absolutely nothing, or just fragmentary pieces of the actual biography of William Shakespeare.Besides, drunkenness was the favorite past time of the Brits since Roman times... And while we are at it, Ben Jonson, and even Christopher Marlowe, could beat Will Shakespeare in that past time by a far length... So therefore, in that instance at least, there is really nothing new or scandalous about it.So now, what really memorable is there to be watched in this movie that catches the eye? Except costumes and settings? Not much. And this should receive praises? I wonder...Methinks that movie makers these days pass away their time in deconstructing history and the biography of others, considered by many as giants (whether wrong or right, is a matter for others to judge), just to make themselves feel better somehow... Is it a form of psychotherapy they are practicing for themselves? I don't know and I cannot judge this, since I am not a Psychoanalyst, but there must be such a component beneath these efforts of theirs, to drag everything that is of some value (or at least has been until now) through the mud of their contorted and sick minds.I don't know what these people are smoking or snorting up their noses, but this, always in my own and very personal view, has absolutely nothing to do with true creativity, nor taste.It just shows us how jaded and ignorant some people, especially high placed people these days, can be, and how pretentious they can become when they reach the top.A nice dose of humbleness and a bit more wisdom would suit them best, but alas, they keep on coming with these preposterous and ill-fated (apparently not by a vast majority of viewers, naturally) subjects, stating facts that are not grounded in any serious publication, and which may probably be more suited in trash papers like The Sun or other gossip Newspaper of sad present fate...But then again, my opinion may not count much these days, since everyone is out for a shock-treatment, rather than using their own brains for something useful and truly constructive.How easy it is these days, to destroy the work of a lifetime of people who really did sweat their daily bread and butter, and how sad it is to see how other less talented (at least in my view) people, struggle to become the "talk of the town", for their own personal satisfaction.Oscar Wilde and Noel Coward would probably know this phenomenon better than I, and would probably have much more to say in this regard, certainly with a lot more style than I could ever muster, and even be able to add some very poignant notes to what I just described.Alas, such sublime authors do not exist anymore, and all we are left with are some comic strips and cheap literature that entices just the occasional reader to open a real book. What a loss for us all. How sad...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's just possible that this movie takes fewer liberties with English history than did William Shakespeare in his history plays. (That's "possible," not "likely.") But here's the difference: the history plays were written by William Shakespeare, and this movie was written by John Orloff.If you really believe that the Earl of Oxford was the "real" Shakespeare, I have a bridge in San Francisco Bay you might want to buy from me. But that's for later. Meanwhile, "Anonymous" has as much to do with a serious presentation of the "case for Oxford" as it has for the "case for alien abduction." In Orloff's version, Oxford can't help but write one brilliant play after another because he hears voices in his head. Now there's a premise for another movie, maybe with Shakespeare hearing voices, etc., etc., but nothing comes of it here. It's just, you know, voices in his head. Also, he's somehow squandered most of his family's wealth, though it's not explained how. Quills, ink, and paper seem to be his only expenses.Since Oxford is a noble, he's not "allowed" to write plays. So to get his creations in front of the public, he tries to get Ben Jonson to front for him. Jonson thinks the plays just aren't him, so when the drunken, obnoxious, illiterate, whoring, egotistical, sleazy-looking ham actor Shakespeare offers to take on the job, Ben agrees.Oxford makes sure that every play he writes has a political message, and that message is usually to subvert Lord Cecil, Oxford's father-in-law and the real brains behind the throne now that Elizabeth is half senile. Why? Why, to keep King James of Scotland from inheriting the realm as Liz wishes. But what's wrong with that? Who knows! Not John Orloff! All he knows is that Oxford wants the Queen's lover, Essex, on the throne. Why Essex? Beats me. Would Essex make a better king? The movie doesn't say, so I guess the answer is obviously yes.SPOILER: for no reason at all except to make you go "Whoa! Dude!" Oxford turns out to be Liz's bastard son. As well as her other lover! Whoa!! Dude!! Have you ever seen a Shakespeare movie like this? I doubt it! After this revelation, and after Essex has his head removed by the Royal Executioner after the theater audience has stormed the palace waving pitchforks (which they must have brought with them to the show), Oxford dies for no particular reason. But Ben saves the plays. And King James loves them! (Lucky for us all, Ben was the only rioter in the front line to survive bullets and cannon balls fired point blank.) Expressive acting by Derek Jacobi as the Prologue (a device cleverly borrowed from "Henry V") shows up everybody else as just pretty good. Fine costumes and sets - when you can see them on the unusually dark screen. No rap or grunge in the soundtrack.I hear you saying, "Hey, jerkface, it's just entertainment!" So very true if you're entertained by a pretentious plot that makes little sense on it own terms and that wildly distorts history without making it any more interesting. (The mammoth stampede down the ramp of the Great Pyramid in director Emmerich's "10,000 BC" was one of the great all-time movie scenes, in my opinion.) What's a little bit creepy is that "Anonymous" is openly devoted to showing the real William Shakespeare as a contemptible idiot and Elizabeth I as lacking all notable qualities except lifelong horniness. I guess there's a demand for films that depict history's greats as "really" having been corrupt, disgusting louts. Why is that? Best scenes: Oxford recites or composes a sonnet while Liz gives him oral sex. Later, Shakespeare (murderer of Christopher Marlowe) secretly tails Oxford disguised in a fake beard-and-nose on a stick, and hides behind a chicken so he won't be seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is TONS of examples of proof that the real William Shakespeare wrote the plays he has attributed to him. Half of the real people in this movie acknowledged him personally as the author in his lifetime. Legal documents, other authors, scholars all say Shakespeare was the guy. No one questioned the plays until 1848 - 232 years after he died.Actors John Heminges and Henry Condell knew and worked with Shakespeare for more than 20 years. In the 1623 First Folio, they wrote that they had published the Folio "onely to keepe the memory of so worthy a Friend, &amp; Fellow aliue, as was our Shakespeare, by humble offer of his playes".This would have been a great movie if it had any truth in it, they should have used the actors and scenery to make a movie about the real author of the plays - William Shakespeare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really wanted to like this. I tried so hard, but it just wasn't happening. Anonymous is one of the nine thousand films from this past year that decided to utilize a split-time narrative, and it's one of the ones that butchered the device the most. Working from John Orloff's script, the first hour jumps back and forth through four (I think?) different timelines so rapidly that none of it makes any sense. At most points I couldn't tell which character was which (I'm pretty sure there were at least five present in more than one timeline and only one of them was played by the same actor through each one) and I had no clue what was going on in terms of narrative.The basic plot will tell you that this is a fictional telling of the much-debated topic of whether William Shakespeare's work was written by the man himself or if they were written by Edward De Vere, Earl of Oxford. It seems that any history fanatic will be quick to jump down the throat of the makers of this film and criticize them for historical inaccuracies, but honestly that's an easy complaint and a pretty ridiculous one since the film isn't even presented as a recreation of history. Rather, it's staged as a play within the film (it opens in the present day, which threw me), and the whole thing feels as though it's done as historical fiction. It's a fictional story and pretty easy to accept as such for anyone who doesn't have a stick up their ass, but that doesn't mean the film isn't ripe with other flaws.Moving past the incomprehensible first hour, even when the film sorts itself out into a more coherent structure there isn't anything interesting going on. After finishing the film I can hardly tell you anything about it other than the basic plot progression. There's an interesting theme in dealing with De Vere where for a few brief moments they explore the kind of remorse one could have over watching someone else receive massive praise for work that is rightfully yours, but the character isn't given nearly enough time to really delve into it deeply at all. Instead we focus more on things like the Essex Rebellion against Elizabeth I, which takes up a majority of the plot and doesn't fit fluidly at all within the Shakespeare storyline, where we get to experience a myriad of actors hamming it up in the most unfortunate of ways.In fact, the whole cast is pretty miserable here, with the one exception being Rhys Ifans as De Vere. Ifans fits this character like a glove, again proving his versatility and expertise as an actor, but it's a shame that the product around him is such a disaster. Everyone else ranges from dreadfully wooden to even more dreadfully theatrical (which is usually appropriate for Shakespeare but I guess that's the difference between Shakespeare and someone trying too hard to be Shakespeare) and it all ends up being a rather unfortunate experience. It seems like the split-time narrative was just a lazy device used when they realized that their actual story wasn't interesting at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie boring and extremely long: 130minutes for this movie is definitely TOO MUCH.The movie doesn't have any sort of excitement especially during the first half of it. The second part becomes more interesting and intriguing, however the confusion of the theme of the whole movie and between the characters make this movie illogic and tiring. The theme of the movie isn't defined in fact there is a lot of confusion between the fraud of the Shakespearian works and the conflicts of the era that surrounded the crown.As a movie on Shakespeare and on the dynamics of his success I wanted to see a deeper analysis on W. Shakespeare's character, instead what we're shown is just a synthetic outline of this character. For the first part of the movie the audience doesn't sympathize with any of the characters: Ben Johnson is pointless, we might feel him only during the ending scenes, but I think is a hateful character and the Earl of Oxford that should be the protagonist doesn't seem to be it.Moreover, I HATED the reconstruction of London made by computer, it gave to the film this sense of artificiality and surreality, which didn't helped at all the plot.I admit, the acting was fairly good and the story itself is very interesting as a new vision of Shakespeare's fame and works. However,the film lacks of any sort of excitement and characters study.I recommend this movie to everyone that wants to wast 2 hours of their lives!</fullReview>

Edward played by Rhys Ifans, who i normally don't find interesting or like, gave a capturing performance as Edward. He was able to give the presents, the power and the authority needed to play this role. As well as Jamie Campbell Bower who plays his younger self, who managed to capture the seductive and charming side of Edward.Vanessa Redgrave plays Elizabeth the first, who performance was different from others I've seen. She shows the queen's...Fun side, if i may put it like that. As well as being authoritative when needed to be. Joely Richardson who plays the younger Elizabeth, and who is Vanessa'a real life daughter, managed to do the same. She shows her beauty, her devilish side and maybe a bit rebellious nature. As the film goes on, there are a lot of plot twists that i never seen coming. This film capture the beauty, the dark side and the passion of the Shakespearean era and if you've ever done of Shakespeare's alleged plays, many are mentioned and will have you reciting along.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now is the winter of our discontent, as the movie Anonymous try to be or not to be, a good movie. In my opinion, it was alright.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to give credit where credit is due, Director Roland Emmerich known for his semi-entertaining disaster flicks, took a risky undertaking, making a political historical drama thriller about William Shakespeare not be the writer of his own's plays. That's take a lot of guts! The movie is set against the backdrop of Elizabethan England during the Essex rebellion against the aging Queen Elizabeth (Vanessa Redgrave) and her crude adviser William Cecil (David Thewlis) and his son, Robert Cecil (Edward Hogg). The film states out the theory that it was in fact Edward De Vere, Earl of Oxford, (Rhys Ifans), who penned Shakespeare's plays so that he convince the people of England to overthrow their ruler in favor of the Earl of Essex (Sam Reid) than the Cecil's pick of King James. The movie might not be historically accurate as it should be, the film presents a nearly absent King James as the Cecils' candidate, and Earl of Essex (Sam Reid) as a threat to his succession. In truth, Essex was King James of Scotland's most avid supporter in England during the closing years of Elizabeth's reign. I do find the absent nature of King James kinda annoying. He should had a bigger role since the plot revolve around him. Most of the characters are portray in an unlikeable role, even Edward De Vere was a bit of a jerk and cowardly. The idea that he has to hide under anonymous identify for the safety reasons is outrageous not hero like and not true to his real life counterpart. The worst had to be William Shakespeare (Rafe Spall). I really hated how negative, he was portray in the film. Even if he didn't write the plays in a film, he was still a brilliant actor and writer not a clueless selfish murderer. Yes, Shakespeare is suggested as the murderer of Christopher Marlowe (Trystan Gravelle) in this movie, despite in real life, Marlowe died in 1593 in a different neighborhood, than Shakespeare was staying. The movie really re-date a lot of plays and events to fit the 1601 Essex Rebellion, but the film fails to mention that he wrote a lot of plays that had no hints that it could relate to being against the current government at the time. The movie portray William Shakespeare/Edward De Vere as an innovator as people are surprise that he wrote a whole play in blank verse. In truth, blank verses been around since 1516, way before Shakespeare was born. Not only do the movie question William Shakespeare status as a writer, but also in the fact that the Virgin Queen, might not be a virgin, after all. That was pretty daring. Despite the historic inaccuracies, the movie had a lot of twist and turns that could be viewpoint as realistic and really were shocking! None of these controversial theories sound too outrageous when you think about it, but let it be known that the movie plot is indeed fiction, unless told over-wise by historians. The film was indeed entertaining well made. I really got into the time period with the set, costume, and visual/special effect design. The script was smarten more-well written than a lot of Roland Emmerich's previous films. Love how Shakespeare's plays themes are mixed with this script. Mad props to screenwriter John Orloff for that. Still, there were some faults to the script, such as the structure of the movie narrative, making it look like its being portray as a play within a play within a play. It's such a time-jumping format. I also didn't like the fact that the movie was nearly humorless beside William Shakespeare is well-known for his humor. Another is how the movie doesn't understand, symbolism like the Tudor rose, which it isn't a real flower. Still, there were lots of action, sexual tension and great acting to make it watchable. It's sad that a lot of people crap on it, without giving the movie a chance. There was a lot of unneeded heat when this movie came out due to the fact that a lot of one-sided biased William Shakespeare supporters AKA Stratfordians stubbornly couldn't open their eyes to a different viewpoint and the fact that It was Roland Emmerich film. Let's remember, he did make some good movies and made some stinkers before, but this movie is far from a stinker! Still, I'm not going to overlook the faults of the film, and praise it, like cult-like indoctrinate Oxfordians AKA people that believe that somebody else wrote the plays. While it's not that far off, that Shakespeare didn't write his plays due to the facts: that there are few records of Shakespeare's private life besides his taxes return, the layout of education in that time period with royals are must likely to able to travel, and get proper training in literacy in aristocratic sensibility, or familiarity with the royal court. Also that others works from author like Francis Bacon, Christopher Marlowe and others could mistake for William Shakespeare over the years is possible. People like Sigmund Freud, Mark Twain and Whit Whitman believe somebody else wrote William Shakespeare, but I have found in my own belief, that William Shakespeare indeed work his plays due to other well-documented evidence like title pages, testimony by other contemporary poets and historians, and no evidence links Oxford to Shakespeare's works. The most compelling evidence against the Oxfordian Theory is de Vere's death in 1604, since the generally accepted chronology of Shakespeare's plays places the composition of approximately twelve of the plays after that date. I do think, William Shakespeare did steal some ideas &amp; had influences from other writers from the time. Plus, half of his work are just rehash re-tellings of historical events or earlier manuscripts works from other authors like Edward De Vere. So, there is no real wrong answer to this. Overall: I had look at this film in open approach, and despite my overall belief, found it, worth watching despite its fails.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant Acting, Directing And Script. Very similar to a Shakespeare (?) Tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea that Shakespeare did not write the plays attributed to him is not a new idea. There are countless conspiracy theories about who wrote these plays and when. I can say that while I knew nothing on the subject, I found Anonymous to be a very entertaining movie. Set in England, Anonymous tells the story of the Earl of Oxford, a brilliant playwright who keeps his talent hidden from the world. As he continues to write these plays, tension grows as the world wonders who will succeed Queen Elizabeth I. Through a series of events, his plays become a key part of a battle for the throne. In the midst of it all, Shakespeare claims the plays for himself and earns fame across the country. The script is brilliant. Since it is based in a real time period, you know how the movie will end yet you long to know how you will get there. The movie is easy to follow and isn't longer than it needs to be. It is written as if it actually happened. In fact, I found myself believing the events were true at one point. Of course, when you think about it you realize that the probability of a political revolution headed by a playwright during the era of Queen Elizabeth I is unlikely. Sure sounds unlikely when you put it that way. In the movie there is no room to tell us why Shakespeare didn't write the plays. They can only tell us what might have happened if the Earl of Oxford actually wrote them. The script provides no factual evidence; it just asks us to believe. The sets and costumes are fantastic as they should be and give the movie added realism. Roland Emmirich does a great job directing the movie, creating an atmosphere which makes us interested and keeps us on the edge of our seat. The acting is excellent with Rhys Ifans as the Earl of Oxford stealing the show. Rafe Spall as Shakespeare is also excellent providing us with a different view on the person we thought we knew. The others, including Sebastian Armesto, Vanessa Redgrave, David Thewlis and Edward Hogg also do a good job. Anonymous is a successful political thriller because of the script and acting. We know where the movie is headed and are excited about how it will happen. This movie is less about Shakespeare and more about the plays. I suppose that if it did focus more on Shakespeare it wouldn't work. The movie plays out exactly like a Shakespeare tragedy except for the fact that one man turns out to be the big winner. Guess who.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roland Emmerich's 'Anonymous' as a pleasant surprise. After his abysmal directorial ventures like '10000BC', 'The Day After Tomorrow' and '2012', I had given up on him but then 'Anonymous' came along. The title and poster have already generated my interest which was further fueled by the tagline 'Was Shakespeare a Fraud'? Fans of Shakespeare (not 'his' works) may not like the fact that the movie questions Shakespeare's credibility by portraying him as a fraud (which may be a possibility). 'Anonymous' is a work of fiction but it does raise some interesting questions regarding that time period and the literature. I myself don't find it unlikely that he may not have written everything he's been credited for. John Orloff weaves an intriguing tale of love, betrayal, fraud, literature, theatre, murder, envy and power. The narrative isn't chronological and can be confusing in the beginning but once the viewer puts the pieces together it runs smoothly. The art direction, costume and makeup department have done a terrific job. The performances are solid, especially that of Vanessa Redgrave, Rhys Ifans, Joely Richardson and Sebastian Armesto. In the end, Emmerich's 'Anonymous' offers a new take on the Elizabethan era. Even if a majority of it is fictitious, the question remains did Shakespeare really write all those plays and sonnets? Maybe he did, maybe he didn't.</fullReview>

There were moments were I almost fell into a coma of boredom or despair for a beverage, while in other instances this picture had me glued to the seat with some really brilliant photography and acting. First of all this was a script with a lot of dialog for an Emmerich film. In fact, another thing that makes this picture a riddle is that it's not Shakespeare in Love. It's not something your girlfriend makes you watch and then you have to admit you like it. It's a tragedy, in a very Shakespearean way. I truly don't know. This movie breaks all the rules of going easy on the viewer. It really had me confusing characters for a while. And you know, it's not artsy-fartsy and no-artificial-lights - it's a full-fledged costume party with a bit much pathos in some parts and not enough time to develop the plethora of characters (or some of them) into truly likable/unlikable characters.However, I am impressed. Emmerich can make movies that try a lot and fail a little. With more focus on the serious and less attempts at the supposedly funny, he could go on making movies like this that would hit. Yeah, I know comic relief is an invention of Shakespeare, but I didn't like the attempt... farewell ye all</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anonymous is well acted but, especially for those who know the period's history and are familiar with the Oxfordian premise of authorship for Shakespeare's works, it was a confusing mix of facts, inferences, rumors, and fantasy... historical fiction. For example, the suggestion that Elizabeth I had many affairs and bastard children is dubious. The role that Samuel Johnson played in the drama over-states history, and Shakespeare is unlikely to have been the buffoon portrayed in the film. It's good enough to gain award nominations, and I recommend it for enjoyment with a large dose of salt for what it infers. Watch it closely for some amusing anachronisms.

		<shortDescription>Presents a case that William Shakeswpeare did NOT write what is attributed to him.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the writer and director well state in the DVD extras, when you write about a historical event or person, especially something that happened over 400 years ago, it simply is not possible to present something accurate. So there is no claim there. However they seize upon an idea presented by some that William Shakespeare had neither the education nor travels to allow him to write what he did. Instead they looked for historical figures who lived at that time and who DID have all the attributes, and this fictional (but perhaps plausible) story results.The story has the Earl of Oxford (Rhys Ifans), who had traveled extensively and who spoke several languages, enjoying writing poems and plays. But as a person of a certain position could not have them presented as his own. Many were directly or indirectly critical of key government figures and it would have been political suicide for him to claim them as his own. His choice was to have a mediocre writer, Ben Johnson, claim them and have them popularized.But along comes William Shakespeare (Rafe Spall), depicted as a marginal actor, almost a village idiot personality, and who could read but never learned to write. And for certain he had not the intellect to tell the stories that are today attributed to him. But after an early performance of one of the 'anonymous' plays, when the crowd clamored for the author he stepped forward and took the credit. Because of the actual ruse by the Earl of Oxford, neither he not Ben Johnson could say anything and, as we sometimes say, the rest is history.The movie is very well made and in look and mood often reminded me of the comedy 'Shakespeare in Love.' But 'Anonymous' is definitely not a comedy and takes its subject very seriously. The way it is made and edited, encompassing 3 distinct time periods, it was pretty difficult at first keeping track of the characters and the relationships. But with dedicated watching eventually it all makes sense. All the actors are good, but my special mention is for Rhys Ifans as the Duke of Oxford. He famously played the goofy Spike in 'Notting Hill' and here he shows how large his range is, superb as the Duke. The critic Ebert has a good, accurate review. Of note he states a couple of reasons why he thinks the theory of an anonymous writer is not credible. As far as I am concerned, I don't care. I never have been a Shakespeare fan, I managed to avoid Shakespeare in high school and college while going for technical science degrees, and while I appreciate what the body of Shakespeare works has done for world literature, I don't care if he wrote or an anonymous author did. The question however makes for an interesting movie.However one summer back in the 1990s my wife and I visited Stratford on Avon, walked the town, sat on the river bank drinking beer, and stayed overnight at a B&amp;B. So I guess that means I have a bit of Shakespeare in my blood, even if he never wrote anything!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gotta Love Roland Emmerich</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A pretty incredible farce in which the premise of film has the true author of all of William Shakespeare's 400 plus works of literature being the Earl of Oxford. In addition, Shakespeare himself is portrayed as an illiterate actor, who seizes the opportunity of fame and fortune, and assumes the identity of an anonymous literary prodigy. Directed by Roland Emmerich (Independence Day / The Day After Tomorrow), the visual effects are stunning, and what you have come to expect in an Emmerich production. The recreation of the Globe Theater and old London circa 1550 -1604 is truly a beautiful sight to behold on the screen.Rhys Ifans (best known by me as Spike from Notting Hill) stars as Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, the film's protagonist, obsessed with the written word; however, his position in society as noble precludes him the ability to make his true identity as author known to the public. In order to get his written words onto the stage and into the public eye, De Vere (Ifans) makes contact with an up and coming London playwright, Ben Johnson (played by Sebastian Armesto) to produce his plays. Conflicted with producing his own works, Johnson confides with his close friend and actor William Shakespeare (Rafe Spall) for guidance. For financial reasons, De Vere's initial work "Henry the V" is produced, and brought to the stage with resounding cheer from the crowd. As the crowd rants for the playwright to come forth, Shakespeare grabs the parchments containing the play, and steps forward as author to the public. De Vere is irate that a lowly actor has become his spokesperson to the public; however, getting out his written word in order to sway public opinion is much more important.An incredible movie, fraught with lies, deceit, incest, deception, and in the end a beheading; I loved this film. Of course I am a true anglophile, so how could I not. However, I must note that this film needs to be watched with little or no distractions, or you will miss key plot points. So enjoy and GOD SAVE the QUEEN!!! SEE MORE OF MY REVIEWS @ THE FARIS REEL on FACEBOOK.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>History, Hollywood, hidden secrets? Spoiler alert</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have heard of this theory for quite some time... That William Shakespeare was a front for various people like Francis Bacon, in this case Edward De Vere and many others, who at the time feared that their free thoughts could be interpreted as treason against the crown due to the extreme religious hatred and politics of that time. Consequentially they hire a fool actor to play the playwright and risk him under the axe instead.This film sees the RSC take it to that further level. You could not have a play that was more Shakespeare than this story of the playwright and his mystery. Nor more esteemed or talented actors.This is most certainly a thought provoking and almost revolutionary challenge to the establishment view. I loved it and consider it essential viewing, especially for Historians.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was so excited when I saw this movie, but I had doubts as well because the critics are horrible. I decided to watch it anyway. I had no regrets. I have always loved Shakespeare, but I kept an open mind while watching this movie. At first it was pretty confusing as it was quite hard to understand old British English, but it finally got together in the end. There was no moment where it got boring, the tense kept building up. After watching it, you'll truly see why the critics are bad for this movie, as this movie twisted all the facts you've known for years and turned it 180 degrees to something totally different. I swear, for those who love twists in movies, you'll love this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Better known for end-of-the-world popcorn flicks 2012, The Day After Tomorrow, Godzilla and Independence Day, Roland Emmerich proves there's more strings to his bow with this highly competent period political thriller. If you can go along with the main conceit ? that Shakespeare was an illiterate, drunken buffoon who was putting his name to the Earl of Oxford's plays ? then Anonymous presents a delicious tale of deceit, lust, betrayal and violence. The quasi-Gothic setting, gloriously photographed by DP Anna Foerster, compliments the mostly on-song cast, featuring Rhys Ifans as the conflicted Earl of Oxford, Vanessa Redgrave as the tinderbox Queen Elizabeth I and David Thewlis as the malevolent William Cecil. Rafe Spall doesn't impress as much as the obnoxious Shakespeare, but Aussie boy Xavier Samuel takes another step closer to stardom with his solid work as the Earl of Southampton. An intriguing history-amending yarn that sees 130 minutes fly by.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An absolute masterpiece, where word and image collide in perfect unison. Rich in meticulous detail, filled with visual splendor, it offers first rate performances from the entire cast. At its heart it is a story about consummate obsession, the story of a father and a son pitted against an embittered queen, and caught in a sticky web of political turmoil and conniving mendacity. It is also an intriguing journey into the life and world of William Shakespeare, who was indeed the 'Soul of Ages' and captured the hearts and souls of millions. It brilliantly depicts how plays are created, brought to life on stage, and the powerful affect words can have on the masses and those who govern. It questions the freedom of speech and the imprisonment of creation. Set in the political snake-pit of Elizabethan England, Anonymous speculates on an issue that has for centuries intrigued academics and brilliant minds such as Mark Twain, Charles Dickens, and Sigmund Freud, namely: who actually created the body of work credited to William Shakespeare?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Devoid of historical facts, aside from the names of the characters and the correct century, it is a mass of delusions. It is Emmerich's dream of some other world reality. That, coupled with the shuffling and jumping back and forth from one time period to another, it was the ultimate in confusion. All the guys had long hair, beards and mustaches, at whatever age they were and there was no way to know who was who in any given scene. It's as though the film editor accidentally dropped all his film in a shredder and then had to meet a deadline so he just glued all the pieces back together as he picked them up out of the mess on the floor. I just wanted to walk out of it but with movie ticket prices what they are I sat through it to the bitter end. My wife loves the Elizabethan period but even she was grossly disappointed with this pathetic waste of celluloid and its mishmash of historical facts. Everybody associated with this POS, except the costumer and property manager, should be ashamed of themselves. I will grant one thing, the costuming and sets were good.

		<shortDescription>It's not about the Shakespeare-Oxford controversy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hamlet is about Hamlet's resentment of his uncle; Othello is about Othello's possessiveness of Desdemona ; Twelfth Night is about Viola's love of Orsino. You would think, therefore, that Roland Emmerich's new film Anonymous, which promotes the theory that the 17th Earl of Oxford, Edward de Vere, wrote Shakespeare's plays would be about a tussle between de Vere and Shakespeare.Nope.In the two hours' passage of the film, Oxford (a wooden Rhys Ifans) and Shakespeare (played as a fame-seeking semi-illiterate bumpkin by Rafe Spall) meet rarely and then only in passing. The real conflict that drives the film arises from a plot to place one of Queen Elizabeth's bastard sons on the throne of England after she dies. Opposing the conspirators is Robert Cecil, Elizabeth's Puritan adviser, played with appropriately gloating malice by Edward Hogg.As the plot develops, de Vere -- the father of one of the would-be usurpers -- occasionally passes manuscripts to playwright Ben Johnson (Sebastian Armesto), who arranges for their production.And that's about it for the controversy.As a piece of conspiracy drama, the film succeeds. The acting is competent (although Vanessa Redgrave is given little to do as the aging Elizabeth) and the plot -- apart from the authorship issue -- is well-constructed. But it is not particularly about who wrote the plays, nor about Shakespeare, so do not see it with the expectation of an erudite dinner conversation to follow. Emmerich, best known for his FX-rich end-of -the-world epics such as The Day After and Independence Day, cannot resist over-the-top action. So there's a scene in which a mob storms out of a production of Richard the Third intent on killing the hunchbacked Cecil and runs into an ambush of heavily-armed soldiers. Slaughter ensues. I suspect this is a piece of fiction, dreamed up by writer John Orloff as an excuse for Emmerich to insert some computer graphics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On an initial screening it is difficult to recommend this beautiful but long-winded thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A man introduces a modern play, detailing how everyone has been fooled about who Shakespeare was and suggesting that someone else wrote all of his most famous texts. This story is then projected back in Elizabethan England, as we are introduced to a playwright named Ben Jonson (Sebastian Armesto), who is being hunted down. The story then cuts back again to an earlier period where Jonson is called upon by Edward de Vere (Rhys Ifans). De Vere realises that he can inspire political movements by using the plays to sway the public. Given politically inclined art is outlawed, he forces Jonson to attach his own name to the works. Yet Jonson is overshadowed by William Shakespeare (Rafe Spall), a buffoon who jumps on the stage at the end of a production, claiming authorship over it. He successfully blackmails the Earl, threatening to announce the truth if he isn't paid. Meanwhile, the Earl is caught up in a conspiracy involving Queen Elizabeth I (Vanessa Redgrave) and a number of figures who are looking to become her successor. Roland Emmerich is a director who revels in disasters. Some are intentional, like the sci-fi epic Independence Day (1996) and others, like Godzilla (1998), are just plain bad. Anonymous is Emmerich's most mature film so far. It's handsomely crafted, offering the scale of a medieval epic and yet it's efficiently acted to resemble more of a closed door conspiracy thriller. For all of Anonymous' qualities, of which there are many, it's a near impenetrable film. A fascinating premise is undone by a narrative so clumsily told and convoluted that on first viewing it is impossible to realise how any of these characters relate to one another and what is going on. The film is inept with its time frames. The opening quarter alone shifts between three or four different periods, using flashbacks and moving the narrative backwards and forwards in time. The narrative is disjointed without any clear reasoning. There are two major threads running throughout the film but they're not given equal weight. The film has advertised the focus on Jonson and Shakespeare but much of the story is actually devoted to the conspiracy involving the Queen. This is problematic for a number of reasons. It leaves the parallels between the two strands thinly stretched, scarcely determining that two different men forgo an opportunity for greatness in the public eye. It also means the film is scattershot in perspective too. Characters fade in and out of the story, with less interesting figures taking up ample screen time. It's a common ploy in Emmerich's film to use a broad spectrum of figures because it enlarges the landscapes of his narratives. It was sufficient in Independence Day as the archetypes were visible. A lot of the side characters here are only vaguely established, making the story opaque when it chooses to focus on them. Rhys Ifans brings power and conviction to his role but he fades in and out of the story and has less dialogue than we would like when he's on screen. He still has the best line in the film when he says: "All artists have something to say. Or they'd make shoes". Neither of the two writers are particularly well developed though, with Spall's comic relief at odds with the darkness of the rest of the film. There are still some spectacular moments that demonstrate Emmerich's visual flair. His use of use of establishment shots is distractingly frequent but he draws some striking images. The fog over the river and the snow falling on the cityscapes gives the film an occasionally chilling atmosphere. And there are fine touches, like when the film montages through many of Shakespeare's most famous works on stage, glimpsing several masterworks. It is extraordinary to consider how some of the greatest texts of all time were written not only without computers or word processors but even ordinary pens too, leaving merely the brush of a quill on loose sheets of parchment to preserve these texts over time. Perhaps in calling this film 'Anonymous', Emmerich is alluding to appropriation: the name of a text or an author is irrelevant if the essence of a classic Shakespearean tragedy is retained at the core of the narrative. That's captured somewhere in this film too but Emmerich can't unscramble the labyrinth with any cohesion. It's a rare case of a film that might improve on multiple viewings but on an initial screening it is difficult to recommend this beautiful but long-winded thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only way to enjoy Anonymous is to ignore the historical facts it mentions. This doesn't refer only to the conspiracy theories that are in abundance. Just as an example, cross-referencing the funeral of Elizabeth I on internet doesn't reveal frozen Thames, which was more visually appealing for the movie, merely a procession heading to Westminster Abbey.Bearing in mind that we're possibly watching an alternative history thriller set in Elizabethan era, two premises are woven into a story full of suspense. Firstly, Elizabeth I had children, mentioned mainly as bastards throughout the movie. Secondly, William Shakespeare didn't write any of his plays.Apart from the discussion about the historical accuracy, Anonymous without doubt praises the work of William Shakespeare and the genius of the author whoever that might be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>debunking the theory of the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie and the theory it is based on takes a few historical facts and then builds speculation out of it. There are several historical figures introduced in the movie that did live in that era and the movie does accurately portray what happened to them. For example, in the movie Chrsitohper Marlowe, a famous playwright of that time, is found dead in an alley way from a stab wound. This is historical fact. However, the movie goes on to suggest that Christopher had discovered that William Shakespeare was a fake and was demanding a cut of the money and William, not wanting to share his wealth, offs him. That is not historical and there is no proof that Will (the actor) was with him the night Christopher Marlowe was murdered. Another thing that happens in the movie is that William Shakespeare goes to Lord Edward demanding more money, which he then uses to build a theatre and according to the movie also uses it to commission someone to fashion a coat of arms for his family name. These two things did happen, but historians believe it was because William Shakespeare, being part owner of the previous theatre, got a certain cut of the money that the troupe The Lord Chamberlain's Men (later known as the King's Men) earned when they performed. Also as part of the troupe, he would not actually own anything he wrote. It became the property of the troupe and the theatre owners. Another thing that the movie claims is that almost all the nobility of that time was Queen Elizabeth's illegitimate children. Queen Elizabeth is known as England's "Virgin Queen," so it seems highly unlikely that would be true. However, there is no record of her ever having had sexual relations but there is also no proof that she didn't. It is perfectly alright to imply that she might have had a few illegitimate children and that they would be raised as nobility. However, it is too much when the movie also tries to say that Elizabeth had a child at 16, who is also Lord Edward the closet playwright, and with whom she also has an illicit relationship later on in her life that produces a child. Queen Elizabeth committing incest seems unlikely, even if she was a Tudor. It makes for a great story but it should not be presented as historical fact.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intriguing Elizabethan thriller reflecting the authorship question</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roland Emmerich delivers plenty in this (speculative) account of the Elizabethan end of days. If it suffers from anything, it is that it cannot decide quite whether to be the warm comic melodrama of Shakespeare In Love or a nimble political conspiracy thriller in the manner of any number of contemporary American flicks. Essentially, Anonymous is the latter. The robust intrigue of the Elizabethan court reflects this model with ease (as Shekhar Kapur's Elizabeth also demonstrates). Emmerich capably weaves in the seemingly secondary issue of the authorship question to elevate the potency of the plays' cultural impact. Though the film's intent is bounded in a formal 'wooden O' of its own (the conceit of Derek Jacobi presenting the film as if it were a staged Broadway production) it is less about Shakespeare and who he might have been than about the machinations of the court.The film has some super reconstructions of the plays staged at The Globe theatre and CGI extrapolations of the Thames. The acting is above average. Vanessa Redgrave is a spirited, wild Queen whilst Rhys Ifans as Oxford and David Thewlis as Cecil (Snr) are superbly restrained, the real power struggle. I found the film long: the shift between the politics and the plays cooled the latter rather than firing the former. For all that John Orloff's screenplay is consistent it is surely an insuperable task to combine a modern vernacular for the bulk of the film alongside the iambs of the verse to which homage is being paid beside it. An admirable, heartfelt sprawl 6/10</fullReview>

The movie Anonymous takes the position that Edward de Vere, the Earl of Oxford, a prominent figure in Queen Elizabeth's court, anonymously wrote Shakespeare's works. Much of the film is about de Vere and his troubled life. Realistic violence makes this a compelling historical thriller.-----Stop here to avoid spoilers-----Production required a great deal of work depicting scenes of Elizabethan plays, court intrigue, and life at that time. I enjoyed watching rowdy audiences in primitive theaters. In one scene, when no play was showing, the audience was entertained by watching a bear fight a pack of dogs.

		<shortDescription>A serious attempt to dramatize the Shakespeare identity problems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film contains various historical errors, but its intention is a serious one. Many deep-thinking people who have no vested interest are convinced that the ridiculous, essentially uneducated, and untravelled figure of William Shakespeare (or Shaksper/ Shaxper), an actor and theatre manager, could not possibly have written the 'Shakespeare plays'. Whoever wrote them was extremely highly educated, knew Latin and Greek, was familiar with royal circles, and had a close familiarity with Italy. So it does not take a genius to realize that William Shakespeare was a 'front' for someone who dared not speak his name. This film portrays this problem with great gusto. Rafe Spall plays the historical William Shakespeare as a self-centred, pin-headed, whining bore, and I would not be a bit surprised if that were accurate! But in this film, he is a minor character. The film takes as its premise that the Shakespeare plays were really written by Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxford. He has been a serious candidate for the authorship for a long time, at least a hundred years. He is generally considered less likely than Francis Bacon as the secret author, but he is certainly a respectable possibility. In this film, Francis Bacon is not mentioned once. An even more surprising omission from the story is the Earl of Leicester, who according to the 'Bacon is Shakespeare' hypothesis was the father of the Earl of Essex and Francis Bacon by Queen Elizabeth. All of this is carefully omitted from the film, which promotes a rival story, though both agree that Queen Elizabeth had illegitimate children, and that the Earl of Essex was one of them. The film is also thoroughly correct in stating that the play Richard III was a portrayal of the scheming, murderous and hunchbacked Cecil, a figure of hate in the Court who did have a hunchback. (The historical Richard III was not hunchbacked and was not at all like the character portrayed in the play.) But the film distorts the truth by showing a performance of Richard III on the morning of the failed Essex Rebellion against the Queen in 1601. It was not Richard III that was performed on that morning, but Richard II, which dealt with deposing a monarch (the historical Richard II was indeed dethroned). An authentic manuscript memoir of the period records the Queen as saying in a fury about that play: 'Dost thou not know that I am Richard II?' So the point was taken, but in the film this is changed. The director Roland Emmerich does not mind changing historical facts to improve a story, as he proved in his film "10,000 BC" (2008). Emmerich has made a series of blockbuster films concerning disasters, such as THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW (2004), GODZILLA (1998), and INDEPENDENCE DAY (1996). He thus seems an unlikely person to concern himself with the minutiae of Elizabethan court life. He does surprisingly well at this, however. The main character is the Earl of Oxford, quietly and effectively played by Rhys Ifans (a Welsh name pronounced 'Rees Eevans'). Queen Elizabeth is expertly played by the ever-amazing Vanessa Redgrave. Ben Jonson and Christopher Marlowe are not portrayed in a way which can be considered to bear any resemblance to what they were really like, however. But let's face it, this is a serious attempt to make such a film, and it raises important questions in dramatic fashion, and is therefore a very welcome production indeed. It is in a wholly different category from the silly and pretentious Shakespeare IN LOVE (1998), which caused such an unjustified stir many years ago. David Thewlis and Edward Hogg are very good at playing the villainous father and son, William and Robert Cecil. One can never be too nasty about those two! The script is by John Orloff, who is not at all well known but has done an acceptable job. Babelsberg Studio was used for this film, and the special effects are excellent and splendid, especially in the recreation of Richmond Palace as seen from the River Thames. The real reconstructed Globe Theatre in London is used to portray The Rose and The Globe of ye olden tyme, and Mary Rylance, who for so long presided over The Globe, appears on its stage in this film and is very good. All the period details are carefully attended to, and whether it be accurate or not, the film is very good. Historical errors in a speculative reconstruction of a historical enigma are thus permissible, whereas in straight history they are not. After all, as far as the true authorship of the Shakespeare plays is concerned, anything could be true. In my opinion, the only impossibility is that the historical William Shakespeare wrote those plays and poems. But there will always be fanatical opposition to such a suggestion. After all, consider the economics of the situation: the town of Stratford upon Avon survives upon the myth of William Shakespeare, and a large portion of the British tourist industry relies upon it. If you challenge the myth, you put thousands of jobs and tens of millions of pounds of tourist revenues at risk. When a false consensus is rooted in money, as the Shakespeare myth is, there is no digging it out, and it is like that terrible plant Japanese knotweed which can never be eradicated from any garden once it has invaded. And speaking of royal courts, I can inform all interested gardeners that I have examined every inch of the gardens of Buckingham Palace, and Japanese knotweed is simply everywhere, choking the place, and entirely out of control. The Buckingham Palace gardens are not a place where, as 'Shakespeare' said, a peaceful breeze can 'softly breathe upon a bank of violets'. As for the royal gardeners, they should receive a right royal spanking for allowing this to happen. Or they should be forced to watch Shakespeare IN LOVE by way of punishment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite what one would expect, but not as bad as you might think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Anonymous" asks the question: What if Shakespeare was not the actual author of all his works? However, the film is ultimately not even really about that, and that whole angle is almost secondary to the entire rest of the plot of the film; it doesn't necessary concentrate on its claims that Edward de Vere actually wrote all of what Shakespeare claimed as his work, but rather briefly explains why the credit was transferred before pushing the story more into the realm of de Vere's life itself and his relations and attempts to save the throne from being bestowed upon King James of Scotland.However, with the back and forth through time and the somewhat complicated plot, with many characters who all look somewhat similar and thus hard to keep track of, the film is a bit complicated for my liking. However, the clever thing about "Anonymous" is that even if the title theme is almost secondary to the plot, the entire movie, with its intrigue and backstabbing and...incest...it plays out like a work by...Shakespeare. Or de Vere. Or whoever.So, for that, I give it credit.Directed by Roland Emmerich, who is best known for films like "Independence Day" and "The Day After Tomorrow," this was a surprising change of pace for him. With direction not nearly as calculated as his previous works, he still did an alright job with holding together a period ensemble, even if the story was slightly difficult to stay on course. Rhys Ifans is solid as Edward de Vere and Vanessa Redgrave, as Queen Elizabeth I, is always a pleasure to see on screen. There is really nothing negative o say about any of the performances in the film. There is just something that didn't quite gel about the final product.Not many critics liked the film, but I think it may be because they expected a serious period piece with serious insight into a conspiracy rather than what the film is, which is a light film of period fluff filled with excellent Oscar-nominated costumes and an idea that maybe the conspiracy theories could be true.I certainly expected more from this film, there is no doubt, but the final product is still an entertaining, albeit slightly long-winded look at monarchy, treachery and the power of the written word...oh, and yes, what if Shakespeare was indeed a fraud.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly flawless masterpiece that will keep you thinking!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recommend this film as one of the top films of 2011. It is a film filled with layer upon layer of deep emotion, that will leave you deep in thought for days afterwords. It will make you curious about the life and times of Shakespeare and hopefully it inspires you to watch and read the entire works of this playwright.If you enjoy history, and critical thinking this is a movie for you, regardless of how close to the truth really is. It really makes you think about the era, the royal family and human nature and mirrors the works of Shakespeare in it's breadth of tragedy, comedy and history. I believe that the acting is superb and deserving of great awards. A well told story for a modern, thinking audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shakespeare would have loved it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So many people slam this movie because of the, ahem, *creative* history of employed, some because they simply can't bear the thought of any slur against 'the immortal bard'. I don't think they're giving this film a fair crack.As a movie, I think it's actually rather good. It has everything a good Shakespeare play has, and Shakespeare himself wasn't above twisting history to his literary advantage.I found issues with the way Elizabeth was portrayed, unable to make her own decisions, dithering and rather foolish. She was actually off the chart smart; spoke four languages fluently, regarded by all Christendom as a formidable stateswoman, and kept a position of immense power whilst being plotted against on all sides. Elizabeth I was nobody's fool. Having said that, Vanessa Redgrave's performance was compelling, and her wizened visage a good match for an aged Elizabeth (who maintained a pale complexion by rubbing white lead into her face, which over time ate at her skin rather cruelly), but - when will Elizabeth ever be portrayed on film with the black and missing teeth which made her diction difficult to comprehend? Incidentally, Elizabeth has also been blamed for writing Shakespeare's plays at one time or another. Nonsense, of course.Shakespeare, one of Elizabeth's favourites, is portrayed as a vulgar, ignorant brute, who even murdered Kit Marlowe (who was killed in a bar fight, and whilst the reason for the fight is suspect, it definitely wasn't Shakespeare he was fighting with)! A curious friend to such a highly intellectual head of state. I think this film could have been made without assaulting the character of Shakespeare to this extent.Whilst I found some of the characters unconvincing, the portrayal of those characters was done well. Except for the foppish Jamie Campbell Bower, fresh from an equally limp performance as King Arthur (and I expect the main reason that show didn't get a second season): he is his usual effeminate and ineffective self, and simply doesn't pass muster as a tough guy that Elizabethan noble women would have swooned over.I did enjoy the scene with the Earl writing the name of Shakespeare in different ways - an interesting alternate explanation for the presence of this genuine document, which is normally considered to be a poseur's attempt at portraying himself in the best possible way, with multiple different spellings of his name (though to be honest, we've probably all done that when fist composing a signature that we keep for the rest of our lives).And was Shakespeare really responsible for writing 37 plays, 154 sonnets, and at least 4 other poems? Probably he didn't write them all - it's entirely likely that several were incorrectly attributed to him. Not least because the sheer volume of work is frankly impressive if written in prose, but compounded by the much enhanced difficulty of writing the whole lot in iambic pentameter - it defies belief.How did a poor playwright actually have such a fantastic classical education that allowed him to write (mostly) accurate historical plays? How did such a prolific playwright also find the time to prepare and perform the plays himself in London, and run a business as a Stratford grain merchant? I suspect that mistakes were made and the personages and works of several people have been inadvertently rolled into one (which Graham Phillips has been asserting since 1994), but many of the premises from this 1920 theory simply don't hold water.Nevertheless, what difference does it make? I think this is one major point the film has against it - who really cares if it was one person or ten people who wrote in similar ways, written by princes (earls?) or paupers? I take the movie as a story in its own right - it's beautifully staged, well acted, and by turns shocks and amuses. Despite glaring errors in characterization and historic fact, it does manage to draw you in and think about it well after the film has ended - which in these days of 90 minute movies that I can't remember an hour after I saw them, I consider to be pleasing bang per buck, and the positive and negative discussions after the fact are all extra entertainment value, and I can't actually remember having witnessed so much controversy about a movie's storyline in my whole life! Or as Shakespeare (or whomever) once said:'Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things; Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished'And, indeed, we have...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So an Oxfordist tries to suggest that the film's preening insult to human genius is not a legitimate reason for hating the film, and tries to pretend that centuries worth of Shakespeare scholarship adds up to an equivocatable 'theory.' It's of course not surprising that the latter immediately calls to mind creationists dismissing evolution as a theory. Looneys are indeed cut from the same sad cloth. As for the former argument I'm reminded of a composer I knew who refused to see Amadeus because he found the notion of showing us Mozart farting was insulting to Mozart. Given what's known about Mozart it seemed a rather priggish attitude. The narrative thrust of Amadeus was entirely about the dichotomy of Mozart's character, or I should say what appears to be a dichotomy only because we've been raised in a Christianized, Cartesian duality: the earthy and the sublime are not supposed to co-exist. But of course they do and making such a formidable display of that fact is what made Amadeus such a triumphant work. By the same token, though, is Anonymous entirely and infinitely objectionable per se. It is as though the plot of Amadeus was that the farting Mozart not only could not have written his sublime works but it is revealed did not write them, it was all Salieri all the time. Or worse, Mozart's works were written by the Count von Colloredo, because of course only a nobleman could have have such lofty feeling. There is a grotesque self-loathing in all things Oxfordist. That self-loathing is what blinds them to the fact that the weave of their suppositions does not withstand even the slightest tugging at before it falls apart completely. It's what makes them ignore the incontrovertible fact that the actual texts left to us signed by Oxford are pathetically inept, that not a one of the geniuses of Shakespeare's age was noble, that the nobility has contributed jack squat to English literature since ... when really? ... Sir Philip Sidney? Does anyone really want to hold him up beside the towering geniuses that have emerged from the lower classes? The sad truth is that Oxfordists are the literary equivalent to the tea party, and what Anonymous is trying to pull is the equivalent of a film about the American Revolution where the founding fathers were all Puritans bible- thumpers with a contempt for the common weal and a distrust of book- learnin'! Perhaps one day the Koch Brothers will finance the making of such a travesty. I can only hope anyone with any sense rises up to condemn it out of hand, and not try to pretend that it's a legitimate 'version' of the truth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shakespeare's plays, Shakespeare's movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw the film and, frankly, I'm surprised it found an audience at all. Oxenfordians are always making the case that Shakespeare wasn't an actor and couldn't even read. The film makes it clear that he was both an actor and a literate (although with limitations as a writer). If you're looking for a thought-provoking two-hours traffic of the screen, you'll also be disappointed. The film plays so loosely with facts that it's really hard to take offense. It might as well be set in Middle Earth for all the similarity it bears to actual events of history. Of course, if you're looking to rehabilitate the Earl of Essex' image, it does take a (very weak) stab at that. As a film, it's actually quite boring. My interest in going was to see what arguments the filmmakers might come up with that a dyed-in-the-wool Stratfordian would be hard-pressed to refute. No such arguments are on offer. Apparently, De Vere started publishing his plays and performing them on the stage (in a very strange sequence) at a very early age, and everyone close to him knew he was the author. If Elizabeth and the Cecils knew, who was there left to offend? The people obviously didn't care, at least to judge from their universal hatred of the Cecils (where does that come from, by the way?). Was De Vere simply a coward? He claims to want to use the plays to make a political statement. Good luck with that. Richard II is replaced by Richard III as the play put on for Essex prior to the Earl's rebellion, apparently just to get in another dig at the younger Cecil. (Everyone from Thomas More on had characterized Richard III as a hunchback. It may have been wrong, but that was the conventional wisdom.) Richard III was also Shakespeare's most popular play in his lifetime and would already have been familiar to the mob. As a cinematic experience, the film also falls flat. It's dark and depressing. I had expected more color and Renaissance attitude from the reviews. The acting is so-so. I liked Redgrave's Queen Elizabeth, and was amused by Mark Rylance's "player." Derek Jacobi sputters his way through a pointless prologue and epilogue. But the most charismatic screen presence, for me, was Ralf Spall's Shakespeare, and I'm sure that wasn't intended. I appreciated his impishness and bad manners, a welcome counter to the appallingly boring De Vere and his fellow Earls. It's been said that Spall belongs in another movie. Would that I had seen that movie! The only thing that got me through this film was the anticipation of the reveal: when and how does De Vere find out he's the Queen's bastard (as well as lover)? But even that was a letdown. Why hadn't Cecil used this information against his arch enemy when he might have gained some benefit from it? And how does De Vere react? By crying. Too many tears, not enough laughs in this risibly bad attempt at revisionism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those who want things historically correct, or accurate, this movie will not be one that you will enjoy. It does have the wonderful look of the era and the grandeur, but it is a complete work of fiction. Movies can entertain without being accurate, and this one is enjoyable if you can sit through it. It is not a movie for the current generation since the f-bomb is not in every single sentence and people are not being slaughtered. It is a movie for an older generation who enjoys some substance and thought provoking dialog in their films. Again the movie is fiction, but it does have some very fine acting and direction. It will not be the greatest movie about Shakespeare, but it is worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid, interesting film; however an equal waste of potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prior to watching Anonymous, I did not deem the theories surrounding Shakespeare being a fraud to hold much validity, however, if nothing else, this film completely altered my perception upon this controversy.Anonymous is, generally, a solid, well-acted and intelligently paced movie, however, the concept it adopts is a very interesting one, especially for those interested in literature, thus I felt that perhaps the film relies to heavily upon the ideas it proposes, as opposed to its execution.The movie felt to grow increasingly ambiguous as to its direction, and seemed to feel irrelevant to the key plot. Although this ensured that key points in the film were more effective and distinguishable, the entertaining but seemingly insignificant sub-plots rendered the film as less engaging than it could have been, and felt, in some instances, as if such plots were used as time-fillers.In addition to this, I left viewing with the impression that perhaps Rafe Spall was the wrong choice for the role of William Shakespeare; this is not a criticism of his acting ability, but a suggestion that it made the film slightly unbelievable, as most would imagine Shakespeare to be very different to that which Spall conveys on-screen.Overall, I feel that Anonymous could have been a masterpiece, however only reaches the standard of a solid film. Despite this, if nothing else, it will more than likely lead to you having a quick search for information surrounding this controversy, as the idea it imposes is undeniably intriguing and, for this reason, Anonymous is unlikely to be a forgettable movie.</fullReview>

Great ensemble performances, particularly by Redgrave as a mildly senile elderly Elizabeth. Nice tie-ins with the Shakespeare plays; I particularly liked Anne DeVere's speech about "ok, you've slept with your mother, put that in one of your plays," which I gather is a reference to "Titus Andronicus." The story held together well. I really liked the portrayal of Jonson. Not a classic for the ages, and frankly I liked the humorous approach of "Shakespeare in Love" a little better, but it was enjoyable and I'll probably watch it again at some point.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Earl of Oxford? Okay, I've heard Marlowe, Jonson and other members of that period's London Literary community so why not the long forgotten Earl. A few thoughts: 1. Shakespeare wasn't just a great writer, he may well have been the greatest writer of all times. That is very intimidating to some. Recall how Homer is described: He was blind and could not have known about the vivid images of which he wrote; His daughter wrote the stories; He simply retold old Greek tales. Never once trying to accept that a writer so great could have actually existed. Shakespeare falls into that same category. 2. Play writing is different than the novel, poem, letter, etc. You need to be around actors to "workshop it". The Earl could not have done any of this 3. Good breeding-like the Earl, or strong academic credentials-like Marlowe do not guarantee literary success. Or else the entire best seller list would be full of Ivy-League English Professors. Give Willy Shakespeare his just reward.</fullReview>

Instead, he selects a satirical playwright (Sebastian Armesto) to assume authorship.While audiences are enraptured by his first play, when the writer is brought on to the stage, the Earl is shocked to learn that his hire has shirked responsibility onto an actor, Shakespeare (Rafe Spall).Inspired by a theory suggesting Shakespeare did not pen his own plays, Anonymous takes poetic license with history, but not without raising some valid questions.Fortunately, with Shakespeare's authenticity in question, we can now say "Macbeth" in a theater without fear of consequence.

		<fullReview>William Shakespeare is England's literary lifeblood. He is to us what Elvis is to America, what Napoleon is to France, what Da Vinci is to Italy. Take Shakespeare out of England and you don't have England. Roland Emmerich's film broaches a subject I thought was inviolable. It asserts that Shakespeare was not the man we thought he was. It daringly alleges he was a charlatan; not even a writer, but a struggling actor.Rafe Spall (Timothy's son) plays 'Will' Shakespeare like we're supposed to hate him. And we do. He's bumbling, inarticulate, illiterate and uncultivated; the complete antithesis of the alleged true writer, Edward De Vere, Earl of Oxford, played admirably by Rhys Ifans. Edward had a dilemma. His rank, status and Puritan background intrinsically meant he could not be a playwright. His creativity was suppressed when he was fostered into the home of Queen Elizabeth I's adviser William Cecil (David Thewlis). He continued to write, but did so surreptitiously.According to the conspiracy, he compelled a contemporary writer, Ben Johnson (badly imagined by Sebastian Armesto), to put his name to his work. To curtail a prison sentence (for treason), Johnson acquiesced. At the end of one production, the crowd demanded to see the writer. Johnson hesitated. The Earl panicked. Will Shakespeare seized his chance and took the glory. The rest, if you believe it, is history.The story is told non-linear fashion, which at first was confusing, but became clearer as other narratives, such as the Essex Rebellion, developed. Vanessa Redgrave ? one of the greatest living actresses ? is majestic as Queen Elizabeth I. I have no clue what a queen could have been like in 17th Century England, but I'm happy to settle for Redgrave's decadent depiction. The dialogue, whilst a far cry from authentic, works because the film tries to appeal to a diverse crowd, for whom Shakespearean-English may not be the mother tongue. One scene made me feel the 12A certificate the film was given (in Britain) was misapplied. You can guess which one I'm suggesting is not fit for a 12-year-old.Emmerich has hitherto been (and will doubtless continue to be) purely a money-making director. Just take a look at his films: '2012', 'The Day After Tomorrow', 'Godzilla', '10,000 BC'. No one makes those because they contain serious messages. They make them for studio dollars. Big studio dollars.But here he has interrupted his Big Studio Dollars agenda to make a less prosaic film. For that he deserves credit. He's done a good job in assembling a fine roster of talent, directed them well and has shot a visually palatable film; one he can be proud of and one perhaps other critics will praise rather than pan him for. I just hope it doesn't put the tourists off.www.moseleyb13.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea of a drama is to challenge the audience to think differently from what they know, and to sell a new concept to them. This challenge was spelled out in stunning fashion by German director Roland Emmerich in his latest release, Anonymous; from that statement is one of the best movies of the year. Roland Emmerich attacked an iconic literary figure in William Shakespeare, like most productions there are historical inaccuracies, however it is the dramatic element that entwines you and not the straight history. Who knows if there is any truth to what is being portrayed and that should be forgotten when you are watching the movie, for most of us go to the movies to forget the real world; not to question it more. Emmerich uses the camera to set the film extremely well and from a cinematography perspective I enjoyed it and can truly see the benefits of seeing this film on a big screen. The storyline at times gets garbled with accents and period terminology but for the most part you can get through that to stay on point.Rhys Ifans, of whom I am a fan, plays the Earl of Oxford, and as a fan of his I found this part to be different. His portrayal of the character may actually land him an Oscar nomination, as well as one for Vanessa Redgrave as Queen Elizabeth. Both play their parts extremely well and add credence to the story. Rafe Spall plays William Shakespeare and does a nice job, but he was definitely out-shined on the film by Redgrave and Ifans. With an all British cast, if you are not familiar with British movies you will not recognize many of the lesser parts; and for that I find that the movie will drag for most of the general population. This is not a romantic comedy and is not a movie you can half pay attention to and understand it fully. Anonymous has the feel as if it was a drama written by Shakespeare himself, without the true old English in it.If you are a moviegoer that likes to see the entire list of Oscar worthy films in the theater then I would say see this one in the theater, there are cinematographic benefits to it. However, if you are just looking for a movie to see on a weekend, then wait till it's released on video and spend your movie dollars on something with more action that gets the full screen benefit. I did enjoy this movie and I would expect to see this nominated for a number of Oscar nominations.Grade: B visit our site at www.twodudereview.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All Art Is Political</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"All art is political," says Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford (the real Shakespeare) in this stunning movie and nothing could be truer for Anonymous. Emmerich and Orloff have challenged the gods of Elizabeth History (the Virgin Queen is no such thing), the literary gods (Shakspere is no Shakespeare) and the gods of succession to today's English throne (most likely unconsidered by the author and director).The main question asked in a preview in New York City was "is this true?" And the answer to the question is overwhelmingly "yes." Orloff and Emmerich have changed some of the dates around to make it into a coherent story, but the relationship between the characters is exactly what happened during the Elizabethan era. The movie is a stunning directorial effort by Emmerich showing that he can do more than just blow up planets. He gets the maximum in performances by the entire cast. They are not actors in a scene but somehow people who emerge out of the 16th Century to grace the screen with their presence. If the costume director does not get an Academy Award, there is not a god in the Hollywood Heavens. Many Elizabethan movies tend toward the gaudy Seventh Avenue look, but these costumes enhance the reality of the movie. They are elaborate enough to distinguish the noblemen from the commoners, but no so much that it seems like a fashion parade of jewels and sequins. The attention to detail is spectacular: the oarsmen wear the crest of the Earl of Oxford as they row across the Thames. John Orloff has pulled off one of the most difficult tricks in writing, the flashback. The movie is tightly woven between acts in the present and the acts in the past that resulted in the present dramas. Usually this is interruptive, but with Orloff's clever writing it is a seamless blend between past and present, what did happen and what is happening now.Orloff and Emmerich are very non-committal and vague when it comes to their historical sources, other than to say the movie was well research. So rather than being anonymous myself, the key historical book that reveals Shakespeare as the son of the Queen, and much more, is Oxford: Son of Queen Elizabeth I.

This is a "royal court" intrigue ... and the jumping back and forth in time doesn't help clarify the plot.The film intends to "shed light" on who the real author of Shakespeare's works might be.

		<fullReview>"Anonymous" is a story that accounts the theory that William Shakespeare did not write all the works credited to William Shakespeare. Instead the true author is Edward, Earl of Oxford, a nobleman of the court of Queen Elizabeth I. It is known as the Oxfordian Theory. And it is a real theory; it's just not a good one."Anonymous" is a Shakespearean story but directed by Roland Emmerich of the action-thriller genre. Not a good mix. The film is already down on two accounts. It can be hard to sit through when they make declarations like Shakespeare was illiterate and just a drunk, egotistical actor. I don't think illiterate theatre actors actually exist.Then we get into axiomatic problems with the story and the characters. At first, Edward is presented as both a gay man and as a power-seeking man driven by the need to have others regard his success. Play writing and producing was a path he saw where he would be responsible for other's emotions and he would be rewarded with money and respect. When we jump back in time, Edward is now a (married) ladies man jumping into bed with a young Elizabeth and every other maiden in the house. He's also not driven by power or success but just the simple joy of writing, of expressing his inner-self. They never touched on his sexuality again and seeing as he never took authorship of his plays and secretly passed them on to others to be produced, I don't think they ever meant to portray him as power-hungry.Surprisingly, able to arise above these fundamental character issues was Rhys Ifans playing the cryptic Edward. He was hardened when he needed to be, inviting when he needed to be, and best of all, he was almost able to convince me that he was, in fact, the true author of Shakespeare's works.Although I disagree with the theory presented and even the point of making such a movie, they did eventually touch on the heart of the matter. We don't celebrate the man, but rather the verses he wrote. That I do agree with, just not how they got there.</fullReview>

Director Roland Emmerich, best known for disaster films like Independence Day, recreates Elizabethan England in delicious detail, from dirty streets to robust theaters.What he doesn't do is convince me that the Earl, Edward de Vere, was the author (the Oxfordian Theory).I have to catalogue the notion in my head along with the claims for Sir Frances Bacon, Ben Jonson, and many others including a committee. That last one is my least favorite given the abysmal performance of every committee I have ever witnessed.However if you want to set your Tudors straight in your head, as well as the Essex rebellion aiming to dethrone Elizabeth I, this is a good place to begin; movies have that ability to make history comprehensible. Just make sure to be suspicious of the apocryphal parts like the Virgin Queen (Vanessa Redgrave) having an illegitimate son, de Vere, with whom she bears a child, Henry Wriothesley, the 3rd Earl of Southampton (Xavier Samuel actor and Prince Tudor Theory Part II in academic parlance). Incest may not have been a Tudor rarity. With the crowded, intrigue-plagued streets and court, it is not difficult to imagine the shenanigans?Emmerich has the good sense to let the Queen and Earl know of their nasty relationship until late in their lives.Some delightful moments occur from several plays at the Rose and Globe theaters as the groundlings join in the fight with the French in Henry V and Polonius is stabbed in the arras in Hamlet. Although Anonymous is darkly filmed, it eventually points out that the playwright, being the soul of the age, will transcend even Elizabeth in our cultural memory.Just who that author may be is not as great as the plays' 400-years' preservation.

		<fullReview>Anonymous handles the issue which has intrigued the most brilliant mind of all times: are all these famous works to be credited to Shakespeare? The movie version of this dilemma has amplified sex, betrayal and violence as to be more entertaining for the audience, with the result of turning the narrative into a tragedy. The plot's basically a cross between Elizabeth and Shakespeare in Love, with all the related political machinations, opportunism and tragedies arising. There are many facts here, the viewer has to possess a strong familiarity with history in order to be able to understand everything. Overall it's a detailed and inconsequential inquiry of Elisabethan England. There's a bit of plot incoherence but rebellion, court intrigues and lies give a convincing view of that era. The cast is not stellar but the motion picture is well acted though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moments of brilliance, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I almost walked out. I truly almost did. In fact, I actually, for the first time in my life, dozed off about a half dozen times for five minute naps. Othertimes I was almost riveted, while yet at other times I nearly threw my mango flavored Icy and nachos at the screen.It was that kind of a film going experience.But, to the film. The film doesn't ask the audience to contemplate whether Shakespeare wrote the works he was said to have authored. No. Instead the film just comes right out and says from the get go that Edward De'Vere, Earl of Oxford was and is the author, end of story. But, the film then takes us on a wild Lewis Carrol like roller-coaster literary ride, presenting to us Tom Clancy like machinations and geo- political and domestic manoeuvrings as to why and how Edward De'Vere was and is the author. We're privy to secret meetings of all kinds on all levels of the Elizabethan social strata of Elizabethan England. We are flies on the wall as the characters connive, contrive and convince one another that what they're doing and want is right for them, and maybe for England as well. We hear about secret affairs, plots against key actors, reasons for quelling or censoring acted works inspired by real life characters and events.But, for all that, I nearly walked out on several occasions. Roland Emmerich, bless his Bavarian heart, and true to his own version of film making, gives us several plots and a story that's got more coils and twists than a length of rope at a lasso contest. This happens, then that happens, we learn something about character A and how it affects character B in situation C, and so on, and so on. Is so and so sleeping with such and such, and if so, what are the political consequences and so forth. I mean, I found myself saying "Oh, come on!" a few times out loud, and became quite impatient with a film whose pacing, though steady, seemed to carry to much of burden for the material it had to bear.The whole Edward De'Vere tale is pretty involved in the minutiae of the tale, but as a whole it's pretty straight forward. And this author believes that if a director like Roland Emmerich, known more for disaster and action flicks than heady literary themes, had just stuck the basics, and even perhaps let some one else helm the thing, then the film might have held together a little bit better. Right now is seems very much like a late night show gone wrong.... however intriguing it might be from scene to scene.For me, I had been anticipating this film for some time, as I am a firm believer that the actor, Will Shakspeare did not author any of the works, but was used by several authors, notably Edward De Vere, as a front for material that was incendiary. Having said that, it doesn't mean I had to like the film, because honestly I didn't care for it much, largely because it's paranoid garbage.Me, well, at least I'll sleep well tonight.Watch at your own risk, and don't say I didn't warn you.p.s. upon reflection, I bet Emmerich made this film to show how absurd he and others think the De Vere "postulation" is, in their opinion. Too bad, because it really is more than just speculation, but a conclusion based on Mark Anderson's work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How science will cause English professors to renounce their faith.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sony's curiously defensive posture from its provision of beautifully rendered study materials for grade school teachers is in anticipation of a volatile issue. Very much as if today's queen of England suddenly announced the whereabouts of a hidden child - her child. There are passionate people out there protecting Shakespeare from scientific analysis. They believe we must keep the bones at rest. However, a growing throng have unearthed the bones of truth. They look for signs of pregnancy, venereal disease, even the proverbial dismembered hand holding a lost manuscript. A vicarious journey often far more dramatic than the results, like the recent discovery of "Sue" the T-rex 67 million years old. Her bones changed hands swiftly from paleontologist, to Native American, to a US district court judge and the FBI, back to the Native American, onwards to Christie's which sold her for $8.3 million, then divided up between Ronald McDonald House Charities, The Field Museum of Natural History (Chicago, IL), the California State University system, and Walt Disney Parks and Resorts.Coincidentally, today at Hatfield House - where once Queen Elizabeth the First enjoyed the performances of plays - scholars from the Royal Veterinary College are analyzing Sue's sacred bones. We definitely want to see the truth about the queen and de Vere. Of course, their bones will be treated as gently as Sue's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With high hopes and expectations, as me and my friends entered the theater to watch the movie,we were glad that we got the ticket in-spite of being house-full.. and believe me that was a mistake.. in the first fifteen minutes only the film starts irritating you and you will wish to go out of the hall. with a bunchful of overacting by Gravelle and Redgrave, the film irritates you even further.. don't know what the director Roland Emmerich (2012, 10,000 BC, Godzilla - with mathew broderick) wanted to show in this film as he completely failed to connect to the audiences.. he has not even being successful in entertaining in even one of the scene of the movie.. the movie gets stuck,and starts getting on to your head.. there is nothing much to be said about the movie as it is a complete disaster.. My suggestion... don't go to watch this film,rather enjoy India Australia stunning series sitting at home,and watch Indians doing their best at the commonwealth games which is being conducted so beautifully in Delhi this time of year! ...Could have been better, but the overall strict prissyness takes the film down..</fullReview>
