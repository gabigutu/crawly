		<shortDescription>A Charming, Hidden Gem Of A Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It never ceases to amaze me how movies like this get made.No car crashes, no explosions, no pyrotechnical performances with people screaming at each other or themes/bravura megalomaniacal rants that self-consciously have "Please nominate me for an Oscar" whispering in the Academy's ear.No, instead we're given a quiet, enormously fascinating, compassionate, well-intentioned film that sits back and realizes that above beautiful cinematography (Which it has in spades), before performances which nail you to your seat (Which it carries in abundance), the most important thing of all is story. And K-Pax despite all "common sense" in Hollywood, throws out every safe-bet to get a movie produced and gives us just that. Wonderful story. Marvelous story.I don't need to talk about that. Everyone from the science fiction fans (Who appreciated the depth and seriousness of the subject matter) to the warm n' fuzzy brigade (Who "Get the message" of the movie) have done their part to praise the various facets of a film that refuses to be categorized and is simply a very, very good story.And perhaps because of that, because no one knows precisely what it is, just that's it's wonderful--Not unlike Prot himself--the people who came to this picture and created it have made a film that doesn't slant itself one way or the other but does a wonderful job of juggling seemingly disparate elements--the science, the drama, the message,the psychological aspects--and approach the movie fresh-eyed and innocent. The cinematography is, at times, simply beautiful and inspiring. And Iain Softley obviously had an enormous respect for the material because when it came time to tell the stories and let it speak through the actors, he pulled back, kept it simple and left the audience to witness to incredible performances by Jeff Bridges and Kevin Spacey to leave viewers with the same feeling; the acting is beautiful and inspiring.Kevin Spacey's "Prot" is a wonderfully understated character with the gentle, knowing presence of an outsider who understands. It is his very calmness and seeming omnipotence that make his emotional outbursts, when they come, that much more intense and painful for audiences. He brings to the story the delicate sense of ironic humanity that comes from someone who may not actually lay claim to being human.Jeff Bridges provides the warm, tired, cynical but still hopeful center of the film that provides reality to Spacey's quiet otherworldliness. Jeff Bridges is the much needed Everyman of this movie who is like so many of us out there; intelligent, wanting to do the right thing, essentially a good person at heart who is perhaps little lost and a LOT tired of the shackling nature of every day life in a first world nation. He asks the hard questions, he clings to his perceived reality. But he also wants to help. And all he's looking for is an excuse, some kind of spark to ignite his hope.I suspect that K-Pax is going to occupy the same space in most people's hearts as that of a good book. I can't see it raking in buzillions of dollars, despite the fact that far, FAR less worthy films do that every summer. Instead, it will carry along, fondly or even maniacally supported by lovers of the film by word of mouth, quietly finding a new audience and making change where ever it goes. It's a gentle, engaging, quiet film that punches viewers between the eyes not through editing, action or shouting, but through that most basic and often forgotten art of cinema, finding a strong story and just letting it tell itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inspired storytelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>K-Pax is a very intriguing film. Is Prot (Kevin Spacey) really an alien, or is he a mentally deranged human who just thinks he is an alien? That is the question that Dr. Powell (Jeff Bridges) must answer before the self proclaimed deadline that Prot sets for his departure from Earth.As the film unfolds and more evidence is uncovered, both theories grow in credibility. His ability to map from memory the area of the galaxy where his home planet is located indicates a knowledge that no human could possibly possess. Yet the hypnosis sessions lead us to a real person with a very real and traumatic life, filled with devastating events that could have caused such a personality aberration. The ending seems to give the answer, but is just ambiguous enough to make you wonder if you really know. Normally, I don't like lady or tiger endings, but this one is tantalizing. I have my own theory that fits all the clues, but I don't know that my theory is any more correct than anyone else's.Director Iain Softley (`Wings of the Dove') spins the tale delicately, with great skill. This is a rare example of the director staying in the shadows and inducing outstanding acting performances out of talented actors to let the story dominate. This is not to say that the directing is technically inferior, because it is excellent. However, Softley remains unobtrusive, delivering great power through the use of subtlety, a pleasant change from today's vanguard directors who visually grab and shake the viewer as if to scream, `Look how brilliant I am!'Kevin Spacey once again delivers a marvelous performance as Prot. This is a part that is extraordinarily demanding, requiring Spacey to render the cool and logical Prot one minute, and then switch gears to conjure his tormented alter ego under hypnosis the next. Spacey is so believable as both alien and human, it makes the viewer's task that much more difficult. Jeff Bridges is also terrific as the relentless psychologist who becomes obsessed with learning the truth about Prot.This is inspired storytelling for the thoughtful viewer. I rated it a 9/10. If you must have closure at the end of a film, this movie will be very frustrating. However, if you like a fascinating mystery that keeps you thinking long after the credits, you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotionally Involving Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Life is comprised of infinite possibilities; some known, others a mystery and destined to remain so. And what of the vast unknown, the realms beyond which knowledge has no established boundaries or parameters? Who is to say what exists or what is possible? Valid questions, all of which are raised and explored in the story of a particular individual's personal journey, a strange and dramatic odyssey that defies facts and logic, in `K-PAX,' directed by Iain Softley, and starring Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges. In the wake of an incident in New York's Central Station, a man named Prot (Spacey) is transported to a psychiatric hospital in Manhattan, where he is delivered into the care of Dr. Mark Powell (Bridges), who attempts to uncover the truth about his patient, who claims to be from the distant planet K-PAX. It quickly becomes a challenge for Dr. Powell, as Prot, with his calm, direct, forthcoming manner and a propensity for produce (he eats bananas peels and all, and Red Delicious Apples are his favorites) is quite convincing. But it's Powell's job, as well as his nature, to be skeptical. Prot's claims, however, remain intact and stand up even under the most intense probing and the watchful eye of Dr. Powell, who finds himself in something of a quandary-- Prot even tells him the exact date and time that he will depart for K-PAX, a scheduled return trip that allows Powell but a short time to sort it all out. And Powell just can't seem to get his mind around the idea that he is dealing with a real alien being; and it's something he is going to have to resolve quickly, if he is ever going to know the truth. And he has to know. The truth, after all, is the only thing that is going to set him free in his own mind. Softley has created and delivered a sensitive, thought-provoking film that challenges the viewer by sustaining the mystery surrounding Prot while forcing you to reflect upon your own concepts of what is, in fact, possible. And as you never know for sure about Prot until the denouement, you are able to identify with Powell, seeing the situation from his point of view and trying to solve the riddle right along with him. Softley creates an atmosphere of wonder and a real sense of being confronted with something that is truly unique as the story unfolds and you begin to realize that Prot just may be what he says he is. And in the context of the reality to which the film is disposed, it's an engrossing matter to try to wrap your mind around. How do you react when all of the evidence is contrary to the physical limitations we've set for ourselves? While at the heart of the film there is a resounding depth of humanity that is evident, not only in Prot, but in Dr. Powell, as well. All of which makes for an extremely engaging and gripping drama. As we've come to expect, Kevin Spacey gives a brilliant performance as Prot, presenting his character from the inside out, emotionally deep and physically convincing at the same time. This is a unique individual, and Spacey brings him to life with care and the ability to share those moments that are particularly revealing, which adds to the believability of the character and the credibility of the story itself. For this film to work, it is essential that we believe who and what Prot is; we do, and it does. Spacey simply pulls it off magnificently. It's a memorable performance, from which evolves a character that will stay with you for a long, long time. Jeff Bridges, meanwhile, emerges on equal footing with Spacey, adeptly making a very real person of Dr. Powell. It's a fairly straightforward role, and the challenge for Bridges was to take this very normal and ordinary character and make him unique in his own right, which, opposite the character of Prot was no small task. And, again, for this film to work it was necessary for Bridges to rise to the occasion. And, with exceptional skill and being the consummate professional that he is, he succeeds without question. Bridges infuses Powell with an underlying complexity, and is so giving in his performance, that it makes the interaction between Powell and Prot vibrant, and at times intense. It's a demonstration of two of the finest actors in the business doing what they do best, creating a dynamic that is alive and inspiring. It's a great job by Bridges, who never attempts to steal the spotlight from Prot, which serves to raise the level of the film to an even higher notch. The supporting cast includes Mary McCormack (Rachel), Alfre Woodard (Dr. Villers), Ajay Naidu (Dr. Naidiu), Vincent Laresca (Navarro), Kimberly Scott (Joyce), Conchata Ferrell (Betty) and Saul Williams (Ernie). An entertaining, emotionally involving film, `K-PAX' is a dissertation on possibilities, as well as an examination of the ever evolving complexities of the human condition. It's a film that demands an open mind and rewards those who are able to approach it on it's own terms and embrace it. In the end, it makes you realize just how real K-PAX is; and it makes you appreciate Prot's journey, and just how much we all share and have in common with those around us, human or alien. And it may just make you reflect upon your own journey-- where you've been and where you're going. And that's the magic of the movies. I rate this one 10/10. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most underrated films of the past decade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Due to a very misleading advertising campaign, I saw this film in theatres at the relatively young age of 10. The trailers on TV portrayed the film as a comedy, and I bugged my parents until they took me. After seeing the movie, I was blown away. I had no idea what to think. Totally different than anything I had seen before, leaving far to many questions for such a young mind. Needless to say, I loved it. This morning was the first time I'd watched in in probably 2-3 years, and I still think it's one of the greatest films made in the last decade. Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges are both in top form, as a mysterious man who may or may not be from another planet, and the psychiatrist that develops a bond with him while trying to decipher his mystery. The supporting cast are near perfect as well, each resident of the mental institution is incredibly convincing in their own way. The open ending was handled very well, giving lots of evidence to support whatever you believe happened in the end. How this movie failed to receive at least a nomination in that year's Oscars is beyond me. If you haven't seen this film, run to Wal-Mart RIGHT NOW. The DVD is usually in the bargain bin, pick it up! 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heart Warming and Funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>K-PAX is exactly what a heart warming film should be. The story is about a mysterious mental patient Prot, played by Kevin Spacey, and his unbelieving psychiatrist Dr. Powel, played by Jeff Bridges. The two have a very friendly bond, and as their relationship grows Dr. Powel can't help but wonder whether or not there is more to his mysterious patient, who insists he is from another planet called K-PAX. This film is very funny, and Kevin Spacey pulls of well placed one liners as if it was his second nature. K-PAX is a smart film, and I wasn't expecting it to go where it did. In the end, I found myself thinking about the small things in life, and the wonder and magic of the every day life we so often take for granted. I left the theater with a warm fuzzy feeling inside, and for families and couples on a date, K-PAX is a splendid film, that will not disappoint. I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in something more than the monotonous releases of glossy, action packed, gore fests.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film IS brilliant...... without a doubt. Watched it a while ago after constant pestering from family members who are right into their sci-fi films (which I am not), and thought it was quite good. But after recently watching a few documentaries on outer-space etc we watched it again... and it IS good.Kevin Spacey is without doubt one of the greatest actors ever and I really like Jeff Bridges (Big Lewbowski, Blown Away, Arlington Road). The film revolves around a patient in a nursing home who claims he is from another planet. Yeah right, you think... but what if his story is so believable that even his psychiatrist begins to wonder if he is telling the truth.That is how the story evolves with Bridges going through all kinds of emotions dealing with Prot (as he is known), his own psychiatric colleagues, his wife and family, his brother-in-law and his cosmologist astronomer work colleagues (who after getting some data from Prot, pretty much admit that he might be telling the truth!) A great film... that get's you wondering.....8/10 Dave</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite an amazing movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally, I think Kevin Spacey is one of the greatest actors of his generation, maybe the greatest. This in combination with another amazing actor named Jeff Bridges, it can't be bad. And that's exactly what this movie is! "K-PAX" is one of the most pleasant surprises of the latest years. To start with has the movie a brilliantly written story. It's part of what makes the movie so great. The other aspect that contributes to the greatness of the movie is the acting. The combination Spacey-Bridges really works.This was already the second time I saw the movie and I'm sure it won't be the last time. "K-PAX" has everything. There are moments which are extremely funny, parts that remind of a true thriller and others which reminds of high-class drama. I think this movie deserves a much higher rating and a lot more awards. Great movie! 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Usually I do not like movies with/about aliens but K-PAX is different. The actors are great in the movie - especially Kevin Spacey played his character breathtaking! The movie never fall to a lower level - the suspense is always in the movie and you absolutely wanna know how it ends, what's about Prot... You have to think a lot after the movie over the movie because there are a few open questions... Is Robert Porter Prot or is Prot only using Robert Porters body as a means of transportation. How can he see uv-light and how can he know that much about astrology. But everybody can make his own end and can decide in what he wanna believe. Very good movie with an excellent Kevin Spacey!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best movies ever, the idea of a double interpretation involves we all. Would be Prot a schizophrenic or an E.T? (No doubt in my opinion, but let's keep the question open...). Kevin Spacey, the big screen monster, plays Prot as it should be done. Let's not forget Jeff Bridges and his great psychiatric. Lastly, a masterpiece that speakes for itself. Can keep our eyes wide open from the beginning to the credits and our minds thinking even when the movie is over. If you still didn't watch it, go right now! And again, again...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a fan of Jeff Bridges so I snapped this up on DVD without having seen it previously. I instantly became a fan of Kevin Spacey, also.The general plot of "alien in human body" has, in my experience, been done to death, but I liked the approach taken in K-PAX, which struck me as quite different and much more sensitive than most. Bridges makes an excellent doctor (you *want* to tell him what's on your mind) and Spacey's expressions and gestures are perfect in the role.The interaction between Prot and the entirely human characters in the clinic is delightful, particularly the subtle manipulation of their behaviour.The ending is bittersweet - I like Prot's choice, but the final scenes (with Bridges) made me teary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>KPAX &amp; Eastern Mores</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In KPAX Softley brushes on the subtleties of Eastern Religious Mores from the small archetypes embedded all over the film to the actual purpose of Prot. Spacey (Prot) assumes a predominantly didactic role throughout the entire film - it is as if the statements he makes embody general truths about a culture of peace which is strongly promulgated in Buddhism and Hinduism. It can be said that Prot is the eye of the storm - the world is in disarray and is 'bright' and the false veil of reality is what everyone else sees, but Prot sees truth - he sees the minute - and appreciates it and at some points fears it as he transcends his social construction of reality and becomes more humanly.The film is particularly detailed, therefore I would recommend that you watch it at least twice to see how Softley interjects nuances. Listen carefully to the narratives at the beginning and end as they truly touch on concepts not commonly presented in western philosophies.9 of out 10 rating - Superb - with nominal room for improvement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Now if you'll excuse me, I have a beam of light to catch."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following a mugging incident at New York's Grand Central Station, an innocent bystander (Kevin Spacey, "The Usual Suspects") is arrested by police who believe him to be under the influence of hallucinogenic drugs. We can understand why they think this, considering how the man politely informed them that he wears his dark glasses because "the light on your planet is really bright." And so Prot (as he identifies himself, pronounced as rhyming with "goat,") is shipped off to the Psychiatric Institute of Manhattan, where a weary workaholic doctor, Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges, "The Big Lebowski"), attempts to understand this man's so-called delusion.Prot's manner is courteous and cooperative. When asked why he believes he has been institutionalised, he matter-of-factly replies that it is because "you think I'm crazy." Within minutes, after satisfying his insatiable newfound hunger for Earth-fruit, the completely forthright Prot has revealed that he is an extraterrestrial from the planet K-PAX, which resides 1000 light-years away, circling the binary star system Agape and Satori located in the Lyra constellation. He also details how his infinitely-more advanced species has already mastered faster-than-light travel, through harnessing the energy of light, an accomplishment that is allegedly eons away for the human race.Powell is understandably very skeptical of these outrageous claims, though he is nevertheless fascinated by them, and commits himself to understanding how Prot came to believe such a thing. Meanwhile, Prot uses his time to observe his fellow patients in the psychiatric ward, eventually offering everybody around him something to live for, and hope of a cure. On July 27, Prot later reveals, he will depart again for K-PAX, and he can only take one human with him. Of what will actually happen on that date, nobody is certain.Originally slated to play Dr. Powell ? with Will Smith as Prot ? Kevin Spacey stepped into the main role when Smith had to withdraw from the film. You can tell that he had a lot of fun with his character, the completely matter-of-fact delivery of his sometimes ridiculous dialogue ("Your produce alone has been worth the trip") often eliciting genuine laughter. There is undeniable intelligence behind many of Prot's words, but logic maintains that he must be delusional... mustn't he?The audience is led back and forth between the possibilities ? for the first segment of the film, we almost accept the possibility that Prot is an extraterrestrial (this is a sci-fi movie, isn't it?!), before being totally convinced when Prot inexplicably displays an impossible knowledge of the astronomy of a newly-discovered planet system. A final investigation by Dr. Powell offers us a neatly-packaged terrestrial explanation for Prot's delusions, but this is just as quickly whisked away, and we are left scratching our heads again. The film, quite rightly, keeps its ending open, leaving the audience to contemplate what they've just watched and to discuss it with those around them. Nevertheless, whether you believe Prot to be an alien or not, two irresistible certainties linger in your mind: the Universe is, indeed, a fascinating place, and perhaps there are higher forces that we humans are yet to discover.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful &amp; intricate film of excellent performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was truly surprised when I first saw this movie directed by Iain Softley; it differs in so much ways from the usual Hollywood mass-production. The plot itself is simple - Kevin Spacey plays a mental patient Prot who claims to be from the planet K-pax who arrived to Earth by a beam of light, while Dr. Powell played by Jeff Bridges tries to help him to solve his delusions... First of all, I must admit the cast is perfectly chosen: Kevin Spacey is really brilliant in portraying the intriguing character of Prot, always walking in the fine line of convincing us that it is real and then making us wonder whether he is delusional or not... Some of the gem scenes include the one where Prot innocently eats the whole banana (even the peal) while in session with Dr. Powell; or the observatory scene where he confidently shows his knowledge of the K-Pax system to the astonished astronomers... Jeff Bridges on the other hand is the subtle, rational side of this movie, and he delivers it perfectly. There is a whole other cast of excellent actors (like Saul Williams' convincing performance as Ernie) who make this film truly work.K-pax has it all, elements of comedy; Sci-Fi, even psychological thriller (concerning the Prot's identity) but most importantly it can be categorized as a heartwarming drama. The main premise of the movie is quite intricate, but the director never lets it get loose, he always keeps it believable and yet two-ways interpretable. The camera and photography have almost a crucial part here, continuing the main idea of light travel, there is much focus on light-shadow play, lightning settings - one of the memorable scenes is where Dr. Powell holds a crystal figure in his office which refracts light in a beautiful way while all the time he suspects can the idea be true? Subtle and slow paced, intriguing and pleasurable, K-pax is truly a gem to watch, one of the kind movie that may not be for all tastes, but those who see it - might fall in love with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What planet are you from, anyway?As for Kevin Spacey, he's Prot (rhymes with bloat) from K-PAX in the movie of that title. He arrives in Grand Central Station on a beam of light - at least that's what the opening shots of windows with sunlight streaming through them suggest. "Brother came out of nowhere," says a panhandler. And the mysterious stranger learns that it's best not to tell an officious cop, "I'd forgotten - your planet is really bright." Next stop Manhattan Psychiatric Institute where he intrigues Dr. Mark Powell, played by Jeff Bridges. Prot is "the most convincing delusional" Powell has ever met. Not only does he eat bananas peel &amp; all, then observe that "Your produce alone is worth the trip"; he diagrams for a group of astronomers a planet system, K-PAX included, that would explain perturbations in the orbits of a star cluster near the constellation Lyra. And Prot's neurological exam reveals that his eyes, unlike those of ordinary humans, are sensitive to ultraviolet light. So maybe Prot is more than an arrogant schizophrenic who spouts stuff like, "Let me tell you something, Mark. You humans, most of you, subscribe to this policy of an eye for an eye, a life for a life, which is known throughout the universe for its... stupidity. Even your Buddha and your Christ had quite a different vision. But nobody's paid much attention to them, not even your Buddhists and your Christians."As the alien mastermind in Roger Corman's "Plan Nine from Outer Space" says: "The problem with you humans is that you are stupid: Stupid! Stupid! Stupid."Since he's a superior being from the superior civilization on planet K-Pax, Prot sets about healing his fellow mental patients - "the usual job-lot of colorful eccentrics," film critic Roger Ebert calls them, "who behave as if they have intensely studied 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.''' NY Times critic A. O. Scott is also reminded of Cuckoo's Nest: "In the movies, of course, the patients always cure each other. If Jack Nicholson and Winona Ryder can do it, why can't Mr. Spacey?" One scene, in which all the patients are shouting with joy over the appearance of a blue jay in the courtyard, may also remind the viewer of Robin Williams teaching a roomful of catatonics to sing, "I love New York in June, How about you?" in another movie about how wonderfully romantic mental illness is, "The Fisher King."Like Robin Williams' Parry in "Fisher King," Kevin Spacey's Prot also turns out to have a HRT (Horrible Repressed Trauma). Via hypnosis and a frantic internet search, Dr. Powell reveals that Prot is the compensatory creation of a little boy whose father once died, and who became a man who killed the murderer of his wife and daughter in New Mexico on July 27 - the very day Prot plans to return to K-Pax and take one of his fellow mental patients with him. When Powell attempts to convince Prot that he is in fact Robert Porter - Here's your picture in a high-school annual - Prot responds that the doctor needs to take good care of this Porter fellow now that he's found him. Dawn on July 27 finds Prot replaced by a catatonic Robert Porter. But another patient, a woman who's spoken only once, to Prot of course, is gone without a trace. In the closing scene the camera pauses for a moment on the wrap-around sunglasses Prot wore to protect his eyes and the note he's left that says he will be back soon; then moves on to Dr. Powell's reuniting with his college-age son, as Prot had recommended. We hear Prot's voice advising the psychiatrist that since he has only one lifetime he needs to "get it right" this time. So: Did a real being from outer space occupy the body of an amnesiac for a while? It's really hard to care. I've read a few professional critiques of the movie. The consensus seems to be that Spacey &amp; Bridges have invested their considerable talents in a dubious cause. Rolling Stone's Peter Travers is typically dismissive: "Oscar voters have been sucking up this holy-fool hooey for decades. Starman, The Fisher King, Phenomenon - name your poison. But you wait in vain here for a spark to animate the old conceit about how the nuts are saner than we are." +++</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better and more intelligent films to come out in the past two or three years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When any of us sit down to watch a film we need to make one of two choices - are we going to believe the premise is possible, or are we going to believe it is impossible? In TOY STORY and SHREK, will we believe that toys and animals can talk? In BACK TO THE FUTURE, will we believe time-travel is possible? In THE MATRIX, will be believe one can travel between reality and virtual reality? In SUPERMAN, STARMAN, and E.T., will we believe that a being from another planet can visit us and interact with us? The answer is perhaps obvious, "yes" if we are to become immersed in the story and enjoy the film.This film, "K-PAX" is just like that. If one sits down to it and buys into the premise, that it is possible for Prot to be from a far-away planet called K-PAX, then it is a totally absorbing film. One of the best I have seen in a long time. Ultimately this film isn't about aliens or space travel, it is about the human condition, and about finding out what is really important to us. The character, Prot, is a catalyst in this story and it doesn't matter in the end whether he really is from K-Pax.some possible SPOILERS - On my second viewing of K-PAX, tonight, I took careful note of everything that was said and presented. When you do so there should be no residual doubt that Prot, in this story, really is a K-PAXian. An alien who is completely harmless, and who is more like a guardian angel than anything else. One who can travel anywhere he wants on a beam of light, taking one and only one person with him. Through most of the story he takes the catatonic Porter with him. At 5:51AM on July 27th, 2001, he returns to K-PAX, leaves Porter behind in the care of the good doctor, and takes one of the patients with him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lame copy of Argentinian film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had a lot expectations about this movie but when i started watching it, it was soon evident to me that the storyline was lifted from a famous Argentinian movie of the 80s called "Hombre mirando al sudeste". And when i say lifted, i mean its almost a copy but no reference to the original is found anywhere nor any info about the script or rights being purchased by American producers/director. It is a pity, because i like Kevin Spacey. But watching so obviously a copy made me feel uncomfortable and ended up hating it. You cant beat (or steal) a classic. Plus, this movie seems to lack some of the deep and uncomfortable questions that the original creates in the viewer; the story is sort of "bleached". So, if you are thinking about watching this movie, go and watch the original version instead. If you have already watched it, go and watch the original too, you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the most underrated movie I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It never ceases to amaze me how people's minds work.First, you have a brilliant actor - Kevin Spacey - pulling off perhaps the best acting performance of his career as Prot. He claims to be an alien, gets locked in mental institute (understandably), and knows all sorts of things he shouldn't know about astrophysics.So is he an alien or isn't he? The psychiatrist, played by Bridges, tries to find out, but the question is ultimately left for the viewer to decide. That is what I love about the movie: it doesn't preach. It doesn't demand us to believe in Prot. But at the same time, the movie does raise some questions. Do we really know how the universe works? What if - that is the question this movie wants to - and manages to - raise.Then you have the ending, which isn't Hollywood-like, it only slightly touches the usual clichés about family and stuff, yet it is hart-warming and beautiful in its own silly way. I won't go deep into it so I won't spoil it for anyone, but please watch closely throughout the movie, and be prepared to use your brains a bit at the end.The movie also plays a lot with audiovisual stuff. Beams of light are shown throughout the movie accompanied with beautiful piano music, perhaps because Prot allegedly arrived on our planet with a beam of light. This play with light makes the movie a subtly beautiful experience.Altogether, this is an incredible work of art.So you have all this - and what do the critics say? Most of them simply call it cr*p, and if they bother to explain why they think this way, they mumble something about this movie belonging neither to the scifi genre nor to the psychological drama genre (like the critic of the Guardian magazine). Well, get this to your heads: A GOOD STORY DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE A CLEARLY DETERMINED GENRE.I repeat, in case the professional critics didn't quite understand what I said.A GOOD STORY DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE A......Ahh, what's the use. The critics ain't gonna understand it, no matter how much I yell. Luckily, there are always people who are open to a good story. This review is dedicated to those people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheap, ham-fisted, non-credible "hints" ruin this completely</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This would have been an enjoyable film if it had not been for the ludicrous, ham-fisted "hints" which overwhelmingly forced viewers to conclude prot essentially HAD to be an alien. The film shows prot easily and quickly "schooling" the best astronomers in the world in 20 seconds flat, complete with super-brilliant hand drawings and equations to prove his point to the awed scientists (not that he and his silly drawings wouldn't be laughed out of the place by any real-world astronomer, but still). You can't do that kind of thing and leave any room for the delights of ambiguity.Over and over, the film FORCES the viewer to reject the mental illness hypothesis, leaving all genuine uncertainty and ambiguity logically closed off, even though that's the only credible explanation. But that's the only way the film would have been enjoyable! Also, any scientifically educated viewer would immediately see that prot's denial of Einsteinian limitations and his references to tachyons are totally without merit since prot and Bess decidedly have mass. Thus, no educated viewer could credit prot's claims, even though the film FORCES everyone to believe he's actually an alien.Boo! What a waste!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is just a rip off from one excellent Argentinian movie which English title is: "Man Facing Southeast" - USA or "Man Looking Southeast". K-Pax doesn't reach the same level at all. The original film was much deeper and more simple. Story started directly from a mental hospital in an ordinary day except that there was on patient too much. Then the nursers and doctors are trying to find out who this extra patient is and how did he get in to the hospital. Otherwise the story is more or less the same as in K-Pax, but I don't understand why there is no mention about the original story in credits. Does anyone know any reason for that?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>HOMBRE MIRANDO AL SUDESTE, (MAN LOOKING SOUTHEAST)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although, supposedly, there is a book in which this mess was based on, I just couldn't stop thinking about another, better Argentine film directed by Eusebio Subiela, HOMBRE MIRANDO AL SUDESTE, that came out a few years ago. The premise is the same, almost to the point that I thought, K-Pax was a remake of that other film. Kevin Spacey should employ someone with keen insight to advise him on what films to appear since he, obviously, either goes for his gut feeling, and or, the money, and the results are not very pretty, as was the case with last year's fiasco, Pay it Forward. On the other hand, this actor can make very interesting choices in the theatre and also he has a fine sense of helping other worthy causes, as he did with COBB, at the Lortel Theatre in NY, in which he spent his own money because he thought it was a good play.There are people that keep comparing him with that other actor who makes dismal choices, but Spacey is an intelligent individual who can act, be it in the theatre, television, or films and he deserves better material in which to shine on his own. Let's hope The Shipping News will redeem him for the bad selections he's made in his career. One can only hope that if this medium fails him badly, he can come running to the New York stage any time soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kevin Spacey has a very good performance in this movie, as he always does. At the beginning, the story is quite interesting, and the level of knowledge about the K-Pax planet and universe that Prot possess almost made me believe that he actually came from that planet. I still don't get how did he know how to draw that solar system. The movie becomes very dramatic as we discover Prot's true identity and his horrible past, and the tension is starting to increase as he announces that he is going to return to his home planet. In conclusion, i think K-Pax is a good movie and is worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is not a cereal, but a planet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a truly brilliant film, and an inspired story from the novel by Gene Brewer. Brewer subsequently wrote three sequel novels and is finishing the fourth and last sequel as I write this. (The sequels have not yet been filmed.) I had to see this film a second time just to make sure I really admired it as much as I thought I did, but my conclusions were that I admired it even more the second time around. One reason why the film works so well is that the casting of the central character, who calls himself Prot, is so perfect. No one could have done this as well as Kevin Spacey, and I doubt that he has ever done anything better in his career. Spacey combines the most ordinary looks with the quirkiest and most compelling personality. No one can chomp a whole banana, skin and all, like he does here, and retain that bland look on his face, resembling 'Mr. Nobody'. Even Mr. Bean could not pull that off. As stories go, they don't come much stranger than this. One day Prot appears in Grand Central Station, emerging from a dazzling beam of light. (And by the way, I have the original Brassai print, for those who know who Brassai was.) He claims he has arrived on a beam of light from the planet K-PAX in the constellation of Lyra, where his planet has two suns which rise simultaneously only once in 200 years. He is able to draw the complex orbit for some astrophysicists, and astounds them. But he is taken away to a lunatic asylum, as any extraterrestrial would of course have been in those innocent days before the Patriot Act, whereas today he would automatically go to Guantanamo Bay and be given a free orange suit. Jeff Bridges plays the puzzled psychiatrist ('I believe he chose me', Bridges says of Prot) who tries to work out who and what Prot is, and finds it very hard going indeed. Tests reveal that Prot can see ultra-violet light, but this is not followed up in the film. Is Prot therefore a bumble bee? Is he a spaceman? He claims to travel at five or six times the speed of light, and speaks of tachyons. (Tachyons have nothing to do with tactility, so it is OK to let your kids see this picture.) Or is Prot a human named Robert Porter, with 'Prot' being some kind of contraction of 'Porter' perhaps? In any case, he knew Robert Porter, or maybe he is Robert Porter, or maybe he is not really Robert Porter now but was then, or oh what the hell. Prot says that at 5:51 AM on July 27th he will return to K-PAX, as he has booked his entry time for then. He says there are no faster-than-light visitants coming and going at our planet, but that they are so common at K-PAX they would bump into each other if reservations are not made in advance. Sure enough, something bizarre happens at that moment. But what exactly it is which has happened is not really clear. The film uses hypnosis a great deal in the story, as Bridges wants to regress Prot and try and get the answers as to who he really is. (He suggests that small lead weights will make his eyelids heavy. I expect they would, too!) He suspects that Prot is really a dual-personality. For clarification on these issues it is wise to consult the book OPEN TO SUGGESTION, and also Ernest Hilgard's DIVIDED CONSCIOUSNESS. But can one be a dual-personality and still be an extraterrestrial? Now, there is a question which has not yet occurred to astro-biologists. Or does coming from a binary star system make one a binary personality? Do Prot and Porter rise and set at different times? And what has all this got to do with Sirius B? (That's a joke.) This is a roller coaster of a mystery which exists in more than three dimensions (and you can forget Minkowskian space-time too, because that's inadequate to explain anything, even if you have not 'misread your Einstein', to quote a line from the film; four dimensions simply aren't enough, and even Kaluza and Klein cannot save you.) This film should appeal to anybody who likes sci fi, to anybody who does not like sci fi, to anyone interested in extraterrestrial life, to anyone not interested in extraterrestrial life, to astro-biologists, to eggheads, to bigots (extraterrestrials must not get an amnesty and be allowed to vote!), to sceptics, to believers, indeed because the story is so very mysterious, to just about anybody with a brain, and I believe there are still a few of those left. The only weak spot in the story is the 'embittered wife' motif. Bridges has an embittered wife who is always getting at him. Admittedly, that is better than the usual embittered ex-wife who haunts all modern American movies, but it is the embittered part of it that bothers me. Are there any American wives and ex-wives who are not embittered? The film would have escaped all accusations of formula if the formulaic embittered wife had not been thrust into the story to annoy us. Surely there must be a few wives somewhere who welcome their husbands home in the evening, exhausted from work and needing some comfort, who do not immediately attack and blame and castigate them? What I am saying is: is there such a thing today as a contented American wife? And if so, may we see her soon in a film, please? But putting that objection aside, this film is major mind-teaser, and long live mind-teasers! If we only had more films like this we might even remember how to think again. And just imagine what would happen to our world if we all turned our brains on instead of continuing to sleep-walk through our lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deserved More Consideration For Best Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this movie 3 times now and ended up with 3 different views as to who Prot was. It was a extremely well done from screenplay to final cut. It had incredible acting by everyone in it, especially Kevin Spacey who is simply a a HUGE talent. Very well directed as well as every scene led me where I needed to go. The film reminded me somewhat of 'One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest' from years past where much of the quality of the film stemmed from brilliant acting by those playing the part of mental patients. Quality casting of these so-called 'bit' parts really give a film its realism, in particular David Patrick Kelly, Saul Williams and Peter Gerety and the rest of the 'patients' were excellent. I'll certainly rent this film this many times again. Even though it is occasionally on TV, it is much better with the uninterrupted flow of a DVD. Jeff Bridges was made for his role of Dr. Powell and meshes perfectly with Keven Spacey. Even the music is bang on. Bravo!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prot (Kevin Spacey) is taken in mental hospital, when he tells people, he's from planet K-PAX. Dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges) takes interest from him, because Prot is very coherent with his story and he seems to know things, which are even beyond the knowledge of astronomers. So begins the quest of truth to find out is Prot really who he says he is, an alien from planet K-PAX, or is he just a man, who happens to know much. On the side Prot seems to be of assistance to many mentally ill patients in the hospital.Kevin Spacey does another excellent role as Prot, creating a picture of complex person who could be anything he says he is. He, in many ways, holds the whole movie together with his overall charisma. Jeff Bridges does excellent job as Dr. Powell, who learns a lot from his patient, turning from tired man, who tries to avoid encountering his problematic relationship with his own son, to a man, who finally takes the responsibility from himself and of people around him.Story of the movie is wonderfully told, form the view of Dr. Powell: it's all about his encountering of this mysterious man and how he tries to prove, that he's not an alien. But things just keep rolling, and soon the line between fiction and fact are tied into a knot hard to open.Movie let's the viewer to make his own decision about Prot, there are things left open in both ways, which all could be a diversion or a simple as a fact to prove Prot is an alien.A wonderful film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Getting It Right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iain Softley's "K-PAX" starring Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges is a very special movie. Softley's humanity tale taught by an "alien" or not, finds solid material in Charles Leavitt's screenplay based on the novel by Gene Brewer. Under his direction, Softley generates from what could have been an entirely star-powered vehicle by Spacey and Bridges into a touching and inspiring experience. Spacey plays Prot, who "arrives" at a New York train station. During an incident Prot proclaims that he is from another planet, and consequently committed to a local mental institution. He is assigned under the care of psychiatrist, Dr. Mark Powell (Bridges) who is intrigued by Prot's conviction or delusion that he is from the planet K-PAX, a thousand light years away. Mark's interest in his patient highlights he is a workaholic. This has alienated his second wife, Rachel, and Mark also has a son in college from his first wife that he has not spoken to in years. Is Prot really from K-PAX? The movie takes an interesting turn when Prot gives Mark's brother-in-law Dr. Steve Becker (a good Brian Howe) and his world class astrophysics colleagues a lesson on his "home" world-- or is this to be believed? "K-PAX" asks the interesting questions. Marks asks Prot about laws on his planet. Prot says "All beings know right and wrong." That ends up being an endearing theme of "K-PAX". It about getting life to work. There is a great partnership between Spacey and Bridges. Spacey's Prot is definitely the more showy of the two roles, though one depends on the other much like Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise in "Rain Man." Jeff Bridges is acknowledged. His Mark Powell is genuinely dealing with his life which isn't working, and coaching his patient who is also contributing to him. Bridges brings such a level of compassion, conviction, and intelligence to his role. Kevin Spacey is awesome. He gives Prot the questionable inhuman edge-- aloof, intelligent, though connected to people. His Prot is self aware of the perceptions, and is loyal to Bridges's Mark. Spacey does an amazing balancing act-- so effortlessly. Is he human? Spacey keeps us guessing. along the way, Spacey may get another Oscar. The strong supporting cast is lead by Mary McCormack as Mark's nearly estranged wife, and Alfre Woodard as Mark's boss. In the end "K-PAX" is a movie about getting it right, and it also does so itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was disgracefully lame. Wasted are the talents of two of Hollywood's finest actors, Jeff Bridges and Kevin Spacey. In this cloying sci-fi drama, Spacey (in a half-comatose, Coneheads impersonation) plays Prot, a man confined to an institution who claims to be from the planet K-Pax. Playing his cynical psychiatrist, in an embarrassingly underwritten role, is Jeff Bridges, who furrows his brow here enough to earn membership in the Nick Nolte School of Frustrated Acting (and cops a new-millenium mullet that makes John Tesh's coif look almost sane). The psychiatrist, of course, neglects his family, including prototypical loving wife (another thankless studio role for Mary McCormick).Of course, there is a general wave of goodness in the film, the kind that makes you want to vomit. Late in the film, Prot explains to a character eager to explore K-Pax that he should explore Earth more instead. It is a hackneyed comment, and it is explored constantly, in a lame excuse for Hollywood to tell us we don't appreciate the world around us as much as we should."K-Pax" is a film assembled from the worst parts of "Awakenings," "The Day the Earth Stood Still" and, because of Spacey's saccharine character, "Pay It Forward." It drags at a snail's pace and is largely a waste of time. In fact, "K-Pax" has a chance to be this year's worst film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alien? Or delusional human?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By sheer chance I stumbled on this movie searching movies starring Kevin Spacey, who is a terrific actor. I also found the storyline intriguing so I rented the DVD. I'm glad I did. I give this movie 9/10. Why? Because it's a very good movie. It's not a typical Hollywood blow-'em-up/shoot-'em-up. It doesn't rely on CGI or even special effects to puff it up. What makes it a good movie then? It has an intriguing idea and a good script to go on. It has very good actors and good direction. But most of all it is a compelling story of a very strange man who may, or may not, be an alien.A man (Kevin Spacey) appears, seemingly out of nowhere, in Grand Central Station in New York City. A woman is robbed by two hoodlums and this man tries to help her off the floor. In the scuffle the police arrive. At first they think the man robbed the woman, but a witness steps forward to clear him. But he gives the police such strange answers to their questions that soon he finds himself in the Psychiatric Institute of Manhattan where he's assigned to resident psychiatrist Dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges). Dr. Powell determines the man's name is Prot (inexplicably pronounced to rhyme with note&#x2015;why not just spell it Prote?) and he claims to come from the planet K-Pax, which lies about 1,000 light-years away in the Constellation Lyra. Powell of course thinks Prot's delusional and prescribes medication for him but mysteriously it has no effect on him. Dr. Powell claims Prot is the most convincing delusional he's ever handled. But through several hypnotic sessions he sees emerge a more human side to Prot. Soon Prot is making a significant positive effect on the other patients. He tells them he's returning to K-Pax on July 27 (2001), a planet he's described to them as an idyllic and peaceful place, and tells each one he will take one of them back with him. Soon all the patients are vying with each other to compose an essay why he, or she, should accompany Prot to K-Pax.At a lawn party he's hosted, Dr. Powell talks about Prot to an astrophysicist friend and tells him of Prot's claim to come from a distant solar system. The man is intrigued. Dr. Powell asks him for some questions with which he can query Prot to test his claim. Prot comes through in flying colors. Based on his answers he's invited to be interviewed by a group of astrophysicists and astronomers. He blows them over with his intricate knowledge about the solar system and its two suns from which he claims to come. Does Prot really come from K-Pax? Or is he a savant who has the capability to rapidly master the intricate knowledge of a field that only specialists would know? At another lawn party Dr. Powell hosts, Prot attends. An incident with a water sprinkler system causes Prot to lose it. Dr. Powell sees in this Prot's human side showing through and become convinces Prot is from planet Earth like everyone else. Through a little sleuthing, he traces Prot to a small town in New Mexico where he identifies him as Robert Porter, a man who had worked in the local stockyard as the man who stunned cattle before they were slaughtered. Porter lived a quiet isolated life with his wife, Sarah, and daughter, Rebecca. One day a drifter stopped by and raped and then murdered Sarah and murdered Rebecca. Porter discovered the drifter and killed him in a fit of rage. Then according to the official record he died by drowning in the local river although his body was never found. The date all this happened was July 27 1996. Suddenly Dr. Powell sees the significance of Prot telling everyone he's returning to K-Pax on July 27 2001. Dr. Powell is now convinced something very serious is going to occur on the fifth anniversary of the deaths of Prot/Porter's wife and children. The date comes. Prot/Porter turns catatonic. One patient, a young woman who never spoke to anyone, is found missing. The movie ends with Dr. Powell pushing a catatonic Prot/Porter in a wheel chair implying to him he knows what happened to the missing young woman. Prot/Porter has a cockeyed grin on his face. Is he Porter? Or Prot's human shell (Robert Porter's body) after Prot's departed with the young woman to K-Pax? Well, who knows? Normally, I don't care for ambiguous endings but this one worked OK.It was interesting to see a young Aaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman of Breaking Bad) playing a cameo role as Dr. Powell's estranged son.NOTE: The Constellation Lyra's major stars are about 1,000 light-years away. Dr. Powell remarks this is quite far away. But in terms of the Milky Way galaxy, whose diameter is 100,000 light-years, a 1,000 light-years away is not really far in galactic terms. Any star found within 1,000 light-years radius of our sun would be considered a member of our stellar neighborhood.9/10</fullReview>

The plot is quite new and interesting, telling the story of a person coming from K-pax, the development of the story keeps the attention of the audience that wants to discover more about K-pax.In certain scene could remember a bit the great movie "One flew on the cocounest" but it develops in a different way avoiding to become a simple replica.For sure if you enjoy this movie you should watch "One flew on cocounest" as you will adore the movie and the acting of Jack Nicholson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>my take on K PAX the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen K-Pax many times, the first time was in a coffee shop when I was traveling in Amsterdam. Needless to say, I was intrigued the whole way through. After reading some of the posts it's obvious that the director did everything on purpose. (is he an alien or not?) That is to say, discussing the movie like this is exactly what Softley would have wanted, much like Donnie Darko.I argue that Prot is indeed an alien and will argue this assertion using epistemology. (rationalism) Basing the argument on science, Prot can (1) detect ultra-violet light which is undetectable to the human naked eye, (2) can a provocative, brilliant knowledge of the solar system, a level of education that dumbfounds the most proved scientists, confirms my position that Robert Porter was merely a host body for Prot during his trips to Earth.Subjects like this are common in Hollywood, but K Pax prevails where other failed.

		<shortDescription>Spacey from another world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>K-Pax is an amusing movie with some good scenes, but it is worth the viewing for Spacey's performance alone. My apology to Denzel Washington, who is an excellent actor, but Spacey was robbed when Washington won the Oscar versus Spacey's performance here.The scene where Spacey falls to his knees and washes himself in the sprinkler is absolutely haunting. Spacey perfectly conveys pathos. I do not think anyone could do better in any setting. Most other actors could never get off the line concerning planetary perturbations, or earth produce either. Spacey makes it look easy.Spacey is the best actor active today, and K-Pax is an excellent vehicle to display his brilliance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great philosophy movie.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like movies that will make you think, this is absolutely one of the good ones. I always liked David Lynch and Cronenberg. They have always made high-quality movies.Iain Softley has directed K-PAX brilliantly. The movie tears in feelings and philosophy of the mind and world. Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges both delivers superb acting skills. It caught me, I did not take my eyes away from the screen during the movie. On the other hand, if you are hoping for a special effect sci-fi movie, this is not for you. The story is being dragged a bit, which can be a bit boring, but also works as a way of building up the theme of the movie. Enjoy this film, I did..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Any movie that makes you think these days is worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thinking as a result of a movie? What a concept! But K-Pax does make you think. It has some singularly silly moments, yet it somehow all gels to make an interesting, worthwhile movie. This is partly due to the excellent performances of all the cast members, from the actors playing the children and those who were the mental patients to Kevin Spacey and Jeff Daniels. I think my main quibble with the movie is the title, and the fact that the planet is named K-Pax in the first place. It is so obvious, since you don't even have to have taken Latin classes to know that "Pax" is peace, and the point of K-Pax is its peacefulness and lack of emotional stress. But aliens don't use human languages on their own planet, do they? Or is Prot simply giving us the English translation of his planet's name, and if so, why bother? I'm assuming that the purpose is to emphasize that this is a morality play, with a point to make about how people live and how people should live. But it's very heavy-handed, and I think it hurt the movie at the box office, as well. Nevertheless, I would recommend K-Pax. My husband and I were still discussing in the next morning, and that's my measure of a good show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvellous, one of the best films of 2002</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is one that will certainly make you think. Kevin Spacey gives a marvellous performance as Prot, an alien who has arrived from K-Pax, a planet a great distance from the earth. OR is he actually an alien, or an extremely clever patient from a mental home? The authorities seem to think the latter and lock Prot up anyway.As the film develops it becomes quite clear that this is no ordinary patient, however, and Prot displays his knowledge of planets that only a handful of specialists know. It is a really heart warming film, and makes us question who is right, and why we believe them. The ending is left quite open to interpretation, which is wonderful, as you make up your own version of the end, and discuss it afterwards. Spacey gives great performance, and deserves recognition, and the screenplay is fantastic, with some very memorable lines and situations. I am still saying some of them now in conversations, which is a testimony to the writing, and I saw the film about 6 or 7 months ago. A must see film, you will not be disappointed unless you are looking for car chases and explosions. Great film.</fullReview>

Half of the reviews were spoilers alone but also revealed a lot about what people didn't like about it.The main issues that people had (Spoiler) was that you never truely knew if Kevin Spacey was an alien or not. And I think that it's sad that people get their mind set on wanting the fantasy to be true that they let it affect their review of the movie.As such is with life that we may never know what the truth of the universe is. And so the movie shows this, but it in no way negates the philosophies that the movie was trying to impress upon people.

		<fullReview>Think 'Starman' meets 'Twelve Monkeys' meets 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest' meets 'Columbo' and you're somewhere close. Spacey &amp; Bridges deliver accessible performances to help one quickly understand their complex characters. Funny one-liners and drole observations by Spacey's Prot (the 'alien traveller') abound, while Bridges' humanistic psychiatrist investigates his new friend's motivations. Not a 'whizz-bang' roller-coaster, but a thoughtful, delightful interplay between two magical actors doing their thing, while the supporting story and acting ensemble does precisely that. I'm glad we're over the cold war 'Let's Kill the Well-Meaning Alien' kind of story, and Kevin Spacey contributes to the casting irony by building upon the best elements of his talented co-star's previous sci-fi portrayal. A visual, aural and acting treat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Spaceman strikes again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amazingly cast, very well directed and not to mention a beautiful script. Kevin Spacey or as I like to call him The Spaceman (witch ironically fits well for this movie) gives another brilliant heartfelt performance in K-PAX. This film is definitely Oscar wining materiel, heck I'd be very surprised and not to mention disappointed if K-PAX or Kevin Spacey weren't nominated. K-PAX isn't one of those typical Sci-Fi little green men movie, it's much more then that. It has great dramatic scenes but also contains funny moments that you can think of later and they still make you laugh. Contrary to what most people think I thought the ending was very good, the conclusion wasn't exactly a conclusion, it left you thinking, it left you to decide what's what.Another great thing about this film was the soundtrack. The background beat and the music throughout the movie was excellent. It brought this intense beat in just the right scenes. I for one loved the sound of it and is very curious to know if it will be on the movie soundtrack.To conclude I most definitely recommend this movie, to people of all ages. I went to see it and loved it and I'm just fifteen. So for all you teens who think the preview of this movie looks boring or think `Oh, this movie's just for old people', well you couldn't be more wrong! Go see it and it might just surprise you. All in all I think this film greatly deserves a ten out of ten.</fullReview>

It brings us on the journey of a being, or sorts, called Prot (Kevin Spacey) who is found in a train station and since he claims to be from a planet called K-PAX, is transferred to a mental hospital in greater New York. Jeff Bridges becomes his psychiatrist and immediately becomes fascinated by his new patient's dilussion, but wants to know more, at any costs. The plot starts to un-needengly wander in the third act, but the performances (in particular by Spacey and Bridges), overall feel and an ending that leaves it up to the audience to figure out what happenned make this a good see in the theater.

		<fullReview>Fairly funny, a few chunks of heart-tugging, and very solid if not mindboggling performances by Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges, this movie gives one a bit to think about. It's a somewhat cerebral drama that still manages to be funny in parts. I have to wonder how Jeff Bridges felt, being on the other side of a "Starman" role...:)...Kevin Spacey, was, of course, wonderful. The big question unresolved by the end of the movie is: What was Prot exactly: a human being, or an alien? There is enough evidence presented throughout the movie that shows, if you tie it all together, he was probably a hybrid of both. :) You have to see all the clues and hints, though; but they are not notoriously hard to catch. It's a fun puzzle to try and unravel; and of course, in the best traditions of all alien visitors; Prot graces us with his wisdom and insights and special traits of the human race and what makes us special in the universe. A neat film. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are way too few movies like this. Myself, I really enjoy these kinds of twists that make the viewer wonder and speculate the ending (and of course other things). K-Pax is one of these movies, though it isn't perfect.Kevin Spacey plays a man called Prot, who is determined as mentally-ill for believing he is actually an alien from a planet named K-Pax. But after weeks of treatment, his story does not change and his case is brought to Dr. Mark Powell, played by Jeff Bridges. No matter what they try, Prot stays with his story, never slipping. After a time, the unbelievable starts to feel believable.Spacey fits the role perfectly and gets you to believe his story. The movie flows nicely up till around the half of the length. After this, the magic breaks as they start digging deeper into the past of the man calling himself Prot. I found it little disappointing, but the end of the movie corrects this somewhat.K-Pax is a wonderful movie, although not perfect. It shows that science fiction does not have to be about action or special effects (which more often than not takes the attention away from the real story). I really would wish to see more movies like this. They give me hope.</fullReview>

While Prot seems to be curing his fellow inmates, Dr. Powell is getting nowhere near curing Prot.A touching tale of discovery, with excellent performances from both Spacey and Bridges, this is simply compelling to watch.If your a fan of Kevin Spacey, you simply have to see this film, but there is plenty to entertain most movie lovers, Spacey has made better films, but this is definitely worthy.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Theory (Almost Completely Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie that will leave you thinking, is he or isn't he? While many people have complained about the ambiguous ending, it gives room for the audience to think and interpret it from the signs. This is my interpretation and theory, and I believe it is very sound. First, here is the plot. One day, Prot (Kevin Spacey) suddenly appears in the midst of a busy train station. After attempting to help a woman from muggers, he is arrested and sent to Bellevue, and later transferred to Dr. Mark Powell's (Jeff Bridges) hospital. Prot freely talks about how he came from the planet K-Pax and is here to do a report on Earth. Naturally, he is classified as a looney and is locked up in a low security level ward. He befriends the other patients and quickly convinces them of his story. In fact, he tells them he can take one person back with him. Soon Dr. Powell is beginning to question Prot's insanity and as the plot progresses, it is harder and harder to prove Prot wrong. In the end, Dr. Powell learns that Prot is Robert Porter, a smart man who worked in a slaughter house in New Mexico, when his wife and daughter were murdered. Prot claims that he plans to leave for K-Pax at a precise time on the fifth anniversary of the murders. The time comes and goes, and Powell finds Prot or Robert in a catatonic state. One of the patients is missing and is never found again. On to my theory: Prot is not crazy. Prot is from the planet K-Pax. Robert Porter is a friend of Prot's. On one of Prot's previous visits to Earth, Robert was a child, learning about the constellations from his father. Prot and Robert became best friends. After the death of his family, and Robert slaying the murderer, Robert decides to commit suicide. Prot is on K-Pax at the time, but he rushes back (in multiples of light speed) to stop Robert. So Prot takes over the thinking of Robert, taking over his body so to speak. Awhile later, Prot (still inhabiting Robert's body) comes to New York and is locked up. When he leaves for K-Pax on July 27, he takes Bess with him, but he must leave Robert's body behind. Hence, we now have the catatonic Robert.Explanations or clues:PROT'S KNOWLEDGE OF THE PLANETS AROUND LIBRA: As Prot says, any child knows about their own system. Only a few people on Earth had an inkling about the system, and Prot added to their knowledge. Robert Porter, while smart and knows his constellations, was no astro-physicist. DR POWELL FEELS CHOSEN BY PROT: It's true. Prot could've left the institute at any time, but chose not too. Prot's last words to Dr. Powell are, "Now that you've found Robert. Take care of him." Prot was probably staying there to ensure a place for Robert when he left. SUPER-HUMAN ABILITIES: It was a proven fact that Prot had a significantly higher sensitivity to sunlight and could even see UV rays. Prot provides his usual K-Pax reason, but there was no Earthly reason given. It was also mentioned that Prot was given extremely high doses of medicine with no effect.HELPING THE PATIENTS: Throughout the movie, you see Prot helping the other patients (or the patients discussing Prot's suggestions) to a better sane world. While the psychologist balk at Prot's help, Dr. Powell talks at the end of the movie about the new lives the patients are leading.THE SPRINKLER SCENE: The sprinkler is associated with Porter's home in New Mexico (which is ironically where Roswell is). Does Porter associate the sprinkler with the death of his family? Is her trying to protect Powell's daughter from that horrible fate? I have a different point of view. It is assumed that Porter had committed suicide in a river. Indeed, Prot (under hypnosis) is greatly concerned about Robert. I believe that Prot associates the danger with the water, not the sprinkler. He is trying to protect the girl from watery death, like he did Robert.HYPNOSIS: Dr. Powell feels that under hypnosis he can uncover Prot's true identity, but while Prot gives plenty of information, he never gives up his Prot persona and claimed homeland of K-Pax.THE SECURITY CAMERA: Why would the camera just give out for no apparent reason? MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCES: First, Prot disappeared for a few days to his trip up north. Funny, the patients are not at all alarmed. Indeed, they try to reassure the doctor. Sometimes I think they understand better than the staff. Naturally, the most telling disappearance is of Bess, the winner of the essay contest. Not only does she disappear at the approximate same time, but the only remaining clue is her winning essay.This is only my humble theory. You can conclude what you want. You can take Dr. Powell's theory, that Prot was merely a persona taken up by Robert Porter to mentally defend himself from reality, but that would be giving up too many plot holes.</fullReview>

The film has some powerful moments, but to me they just didn't add up to much. It sort of struck me like "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" which was deep, sort of, but I guess if there was a big theme I missed it. It can't just be me -- I "got it" about Amelie, and Pay It Forward, and The Big Kahuna. The ending is a nice touch.Now I'm curious to rent Man Facing Southeast, which K-PAX is an adaptation of, to see if it is better.Who should see this film:-- Sci-fi types who won't mind a little drama-- Drama types, this is just your thing.I'll give K-PAX a decent but not classic 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

Dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges) soon takes extreme interest in him, and even finds himself pondering if Prot is actually a supreme being from planet K-PAX, or perhaps he is only a forgotten human being with severe psychiatric issues.

I myself wrote what I consider to be a very good story that many have read and loved. But my wife, Son in law and friends all tell me they have heard it or read it before somewhere. I have enough integrity not to publish it nor to submit it, even though in my case this story actually happened to me personally. I have integrity but no money. So, Perhaps you are right Gene....so write away and laugh all the way to the bank. But at this point I am one viewer and one reader do not have much respect for you as a writer. Nice Movie though. And thank you Eliseo Subiela for a lovely and thoughtful story and premis. Hey Eliseo, Know any good Lawyers? </fullReview>

		<fullReview>An unhappy psychiatrist who no longer sees any charm in his profession, aware of the little help he gives his patients, sees his world tumble as a mysterious man appears in the institution he works in, saying he comes from a much more advanced planet. Telling such "truth" in a psychiatric institution is safe.The man claims to be projected with a light technology whose development in our planet is at a very primitive stage.He claims not to be the only one. There are several visitors in our planet.The man questions our manners and the effectiveness of psychiatric methods and institutions. He seems to be more helpful to the patients than the psychiatrists.He shows compassion through reasoning, and not through feeling.The patients believe in his words.The man shows clear messianic elements.He shows an interest in analyzing the human kind.Analysis classify him as a genius, and scientists confirm the scientific bases of his "delusions".The psychiatrist has an evident affection for the man. He worries about him and wants to help him. In order to do this he tries to uncover the man's past, convinced that he'll find a traumatic event that led him to this psychotic state. It becomes an obsession.The psychiatrist appreciate the conversations with the man (during walks through the gardens of the institution, in his office, or during the excursions he likes to take him to).The man walks in and out of the premises at will.Kids and psychiatric patients follow and appreciate him. He shows leadership.He has great knowledge on almost any subject.At times he seems to have a psychic connection with the psychiatric patients.At times he seems to express a hint of emotion, while he denies it.He has said that he will return to his planet, and will take someone with him.Each patient believes he will be taken.No, sorry. I'm not talking about K-Pax. I'm talking about Hombre Mirando al Sudeste (Man Facing Southeast), an Argentinian movie (which Brewer denies having seen) released 9 years before K-Pax.Shameful really.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie.. man.. it takes you away to another place altogether. I don't usually write reviews, but i had to write for this wonderful movie. It is unlikely that you will ever see a movie like this again. The beautiful way it displays emotions and humanity, with both the lead actors acting superbly, is the reason that even after watching the movie once, i keep finding myself watching it over and over again. Kevin Spacey is one of the best actors of this generation, so is Jeff Bridges. The soundtrack is so immensely beautiful, that by solely listening to the music, you can find yourself transported to anywhere you like. It will change your outlook of life. Its underrated, sure, but as i said.. No words to express what this movie is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am into many science fiction movies with all the aliens and humans fighting to win wars and all. But this one is totally different. Kevin Spacey is the man! He played the role at ease to guess his moves almost each and every second. The movie may seem to end but it has some open ended questions about the real prot, the missing patient and the sudden loss of consciousness near the end.If you think deeply, you will have the answer. I don't want to reveal more about this. Just go and watch! This is an entirely different science fiction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know. Just,just I don't know if it is the best.There have been plenty.E.T, Contact,even Cameron's Aliens are some of the best.Forget about the planet of X,Y,Z.Till.Till the time I watched it...It is devoid of some gun power, if you are into that thing for an alien movie.Its devoid of scenes where a giant alien is hovering over L.A and the US Air force is trying to bring it down.You are not going to find a skimpily clad fallen angel here.But what you are going to have is worth of a lifetime.An alien.Pun intended. An alien who is going back to his own planet.And before that he needs to finish a Herculean task of changing human psychology of how you take your things.May be a doctor- patient,a wife-husband, a son-father or may be even inter-inmates- relationship - this film cleverly did not distinguish any human distinctions or any boundaries just the way our Prot did not know about any relation, families or even boundaries back home.There are no thrilling stunts, there are no aerial adventures, still it gets you clung to to your seat while you watch it just because it remained correct in one thing-there is still time to rectify the human errs, there is still scopes to make amends for the follies we make in our daily lives.We do not get to see what the people of K-Pax are like, but we realize what magic can human emotions do.Do we really need to be reminded of what the protagonists are capable of? Haven't we watched the American Beauty or the Crazy Heart? We know by now what Kevin Spacey or Jeff Bridges can deliver.Something unearthly beautiful when their skills are so beautifully portrayed on screen.And if those merge? Bingo...So here we go.See the fire powers together in the same frame while you hail Mr.Iain Softley for making this brilliant movie.Emotional,power packed,humane- K-PAX is an unforgettable experience of a lifetime...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>K-PAX is a movie about a person, who says that he is from another planet. He thus is institutionalized in psychiatric department. In spite of taking medicines prescribed by doctors he continues to behave same way. Being from planet K-PAX, he even provides proper details and other facts related to the scientific jury specially assigned. The institution where he is hospitalized he makes special relations with the members there. There is an incidence related to blue bird. He promises the hospitalized members about his departure to his planet with date and that he is going to take only one person who writes the best note for him. He does that and story ends.Gradually in story it is said, he is a troubled family person. He also fears water; the film provides us with reason for same. Then what was the reason he behaved in such a manner. Well there are many theories but the one that I like goes like this. In various cultures we have heard about possession by negative entities, where the people are not in their own mind. A positive spiritual entity is capable of doing same but may be it respects ones different nature or simply it doesn't want to hurt. Maybe there's an alien race so superior that understands this and it blew other life in someone only for little time to show communication. There's a little bit of brain work here but I loved it and expect the same from most of the audience. Thus I recommend it.Rating: 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How did I miss this ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Had never heard of this film before, there wasn't much on TV and I came across it on catch up. Thought it looked reasonably promising and I certainly wasn't disappointed! Prot (Kevin Spacey) is a patient in a psychiatric hospital, whose claims of being a visitor from another planet cause quite a stir amongst the other patients, and capture the interest of psychiatrist Dr.Powell (Jeff Bridges). As the story develops we see the effects of the charismatic Prot on those around him, including hospital staff and particularly Dr Powell.Spacey is just great in this role, giving the character of Prot a depth and charm that makes the viewer really care about him and his story. He's such a fine actor he can make any character believable. Bridges is also very good playing the part of the psychiatrist who finds himself questioning his own beliefs and diagnosis. It's a film with no crashes, bangs or wallops so it probably won't appeal to the action fans (which appear to be in the majority on IMDb) and it's not for those who like a neat and tidy ending. It's thought- provoking, poignant, at times humorous and at other times sad, but it is a very engaging and watchable film. I really liked it and it deserves higher than the 7.4 it has at the time of writing.</fullReview>

While i loved this move 10+ yrs ago, i decided to re- watch with my other daughters... and wow i found that i had not even come close to really understanding the full message, and i'm not sure that i ever will entirely. "Every being in the universe knows right from wrong" is the line in this movie that makes me question government, religion and pretty much everything. It's extremely rare movies like this that i go to in order to having a remote chance at understanding the real nature of why were here. I have to give this a 10 because it just continues to stick with me in way that is different from most.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This grew on me as it went on. It has an intriguing premise but starts off a little slow, and is a quiet sort of movie. It's helped along by the talents of Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges and also a large secondary cast who are all interesting.Kevin Spacey is pretty awesome (funny, sarcastic, heartbreaking) as "Prot", a homeless man who claims to be from another planet. Committed to a mental hospital, he's treated by a psychiatrist (Bridges) who is at first is intrigued by his tales and then as he becomes more involved realizes the effect Prot is having on the other patients and tries to figure out how to help him.There is a scene where Spacey is under hypnosis and he switches from manic to calm in a blip, super impressive.I found myself throughout this wanting to believe that Prot was actually from K-Pax. And there's a bit of a mystery involved as Bridges tries to find clues as to his real identity, where is he from, what happened to him, How does he know all the science/universe stuff he does? Is he really an alien or just a damaged man who has chosen to live in an alternate reality because of some kind of trauma? I really wanted to believe. Towards the end Prot sets himself a time to return to K-Pax, promising to take one of the patients with him and so he does...This is one of those science fiction based on reality types of movies which can be tricky to pull off and I'm not really sure this works as its neither sci-fi or drama but I will say that I was affected by the end and left with questions which means I'm still thinking about it -always a good sign. 1/13/15 Nice little cameo from a very young (and cute) Aaron Paul.</fullReview>

Producer was very clover and that's why this film was excellent build up. I haven't read anything else, just watched the film. Am proud from all actors and actress who participate in this film, good job and seems like Bess just didn't play any simple extra paper, but she acquire a very important part in the movie.Clues for the answer, watch the movie and check who was Bess and her history also what really she wanted(she wasn't interested in K-Pass). Remember about the quote: I know who you are; By Bess. Then the letter she leave on the table for Prot, how is the same letter that appears in her bedroom if he kept them to select the one in going to K-PASS.Amazing that its been 14 years and nobody realized the real true. I think I may deserve a prize :-) I only watch the movie once and double check my conclusions about what happen with Bess and that answer many questions that people have about why Prot appears still in the wheelchairs mutely. Lol I am not good to hide the answer right? Producers and director would love to get in touch with you to discuss this. 773-614-0486 Renato Murillo. Thank you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun Movie, Keeps You Guessing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prot (Kevin Spacey) is a patient at a mental hospital who claims to be from a far away planet called K-PAX. His psychiatrist (Jeff Bridges) tries to help him, only to begin to doubt his own explanations.Apparently, at one point Will Smith was supposed to be Prot and Kevin Spacey was the doctor. That is completely unimaginable. Smith is a bit of a stretch for the alien role (though he could do it), and Spacey is clearly stronger as the alien than as a doctor (though he is always great).What makes this film so good is that while the viewer believes that Prot is an alien, it is never definitely established. Every so often the doctor throws in a doubt here or there. The line between genius and madman is dangerously thin.Roger Ebert wrote, "I admired how the movie tantalized us with possibilities and allowed the doctor and patient to talk sensibly, if strangely, about the difference between the delusional and that which is simply very unlikely." The film was also alleged to be plagiarized from "Man Facing Southeast" (1986), an Argentinian movie. As I have never seen that film, I cannot comment on any similarities.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my "Go To" movies when I want to be drawn into it and forget my daily troubles. Kevin Spacey in the lead role plays "Prot" a gentle intelligent man who claims to be from the world called K-Pax. Jeff Bridges plays the intellectual psychiatrist "Dr. Mark Powell". Dr. Powell is a realist who has an answer for most cases that come to him, but Prot presents something that he cannot quite put his finger on it. Dr. Powell takes Prot to his home to interact with his family and the movie makes a twist here showing Prot in a different light. Prot makes friends with everyone, staff and patients at the mental hospital that he was placed into. K-Pax brings this whole experience to a head in the last 20 minutes of the movie entangling the audience in everything that was explained and understood to what was left unbelievable in the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The bad news is that the movie has some flaws. For instance, in order to receive and apply the moral of this story, Dr. Powell needs to have some family conflicts. These are portrayed in a vague and unconvincing way. I also wasn't buying the hot younger wife. I could go on, but I don't want to dwell on the flaws because watching Kevin Spacey in action in this film makes them so much more tolerable. The performance is a pleasure, and at heart the movie is imaginative and interesting. The ending is intentionally cryptic. The viewer has been offered convincing evidence for two completely different interpretations of events, and is left having to consider both and perhaps struggle to reconcile them. Earth produce alone almost made it worth the trip to our world for Prot, just as the movie is almost worth watching just for Spacey's hilariously deadpan explanation of tortuous K-PAXian sex. Bottom line, it's an enjoyable movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I missed this film on general release and have just watched it on DVD. My expectations were low as I had read mixed reviews when it came out in 2001. However, I loved watching this film from the first frame till the last. I cannot remember smiling so much throughout a movie since 1980 when I saw "the Stunt Man". This film has a certain quality about it that is hard to quantify, but it is one of the most engrossing, captivating and enjoyable films I have ever seen. The storyline is intriguing and the casting is just right. There is something about the fluid camera-work, the seamless editing and the sensitive direction that gives this film a certain special quality that cannot be manufactured by some think-tank of executives. The film is helped by solid performances. Jeff Bridges, so often mannered and self aware hits the right beats in an uncomplicated and sympathetic performance. Kevin Spacey is believable as the ambiguous patient; a role that could easily have been over played; and the supporting cast are a pleasure to watch in a series of roles that could quite easily have encouraged some show boating or overtly cloying or mushy performances. This was an unexpected pleasure. I feel that this is one of those rare films that surpasses the original vision of its creators and somehow creates a world that the viewer wants to become fully involved in. It is very hard to critique this film in an objective way as what makes it connect so well with its audience is so intangible. If you want to see a movie that makes you feel good while you are watching it, then they do not come more highly recommended than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ultimately, the movie may puzzle audiences more than entertain them. It shows signs of intelligent life. It tries to frighten us into doing the right thing by declaring that there is no grace, no forgiveness, and no escape from our lives once we are done living. This movie is the best I've seen in a while. It really made me think, instead of all those horrible action/car/romance movies that's just full of stereotypical bull crap. I loved this work of art, and no review can take that away from me. When a new patient is brought to a mental institution claiming to be an inhabitant of a planet called K-PAX, the hospital seems just the place for him. Yet, except for certain otherworldly abilities, the "alien," he, appears to be perfectly sane. In taped therapy sessions he is asked about life on K-PAX - its lifestyle, principles, foods, language. He paints a consistent and credible portrait of a glorious utopia painfully unlike our own and yet so possible, could we only erase from human nature its greed and cruelty. It becomes easy, even desirable, to believe in his identity and homeland. But he insists that he must return home. As his announced date of "departure" approaches, staff and patients alike are thrown into turmoil: If he is mad, what will happen when the fateful day arrives? If K-PAX is for real...please, may they come along too?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on a novel by Gene Brewer, Iain Softley brings up this story about a man (Kevin Spacey) calling himself Prot and claiming to have arrived from a distant planet - K-PAX - who is hospitalized in the Manhattan Psychiatric Center. His doctor, Dr Powell (Jeff Bridges), suddenly gets into an abnormal situation, as his patient was being extremely convincing and in possession of very uncommon knowledge. Naturally, he does not really believe there's truth so he takes him to astronomy experts which failed to result and after having Prot turning the Hospital upside down, he finally realizes it all has to do with an old trauma and goes for treatment, with very interesting procedures, including hypnosis. Interesting how you can turn a singular psychiatric case into criminal- like investigation. On the other hand, the movie fails in astronomical and psychiatric accuracy and is very predictable. Including Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges the result is most likely to be successful, being two of my favorite actors brought by the US, especially Jeff Bridges, who can amazingly embody both psychiatry and psychopath with virtue. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An honest alien or a very delusional mental patient?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>K-PAX is one of the most wonderful, engaging, and interesting science fiction films I have yet to see. It is projected in its own sea of innocence not trying to establish a following of any kind, not trying to dominate the Oscars, but simply to tell a simple yet complex story of a man who convinces people he is from a mysterious planet in a constellation we homo-sapiens know nothing about.The man's name is Prot (rhymes with "goat," who is played by Kevin Spacey) and the planet is named "K-PAX." Prot is arrested at an airport for mysteriously hovering over a woman who had just been mugged. Prot is taking for psychiatric evaluation at The Psychiatric Institute of Manhattan where Dr. Mark Powell (Bridges) takes care of the man and listens to his convincing stories and his quirky lifestyle on this planet.We are told "K-PAX" is in the Lyra constellation, which Earth has little knowledge of. This only further makes the audience believes that Prot is being honest, but several instances in the film make us wonder if he's an honest alien or a very delusional mental patient who wants to believe he is from the planet. My opinion on the matter isn't vital, and I encourage everyone to form their own when watching. It's not something to strike a debate about, and I fear that by providing evidence I'll be spoiling what is one of the most intriguing science fiction tales in a blue moon.Prot's evaluation is a tricky one. He speaks with big words, long monologues, all in a calm and very subtle nature. He is a gentle man, not looking to harm, but looking to promote arguments and opinions as he is seen communicating with dogs in one scene and proving that we have misunderstood what Einstein has said for many, many years.Prot is definitely one of the most interesting film characters I've come across in quite sometime. Here is a man that has been treated like dirt, forced to deal with not being taken seriously until stumbling upon an amazing doctor, and has been lead this way and that and can still talk and approach people in a quiet and controlled manner. Never does this character become a bore because his antics and daring actions keep us amused and baffled. Even though he is technically a stranger to our planet, he has the gall to criticize our way of life even when he is being held for psychiatric counseling. Maybe that makes him one of the bravest characters too.K-PAX was developed from the book of the same name, and author Gene Brewer worked side by side with Charles Leavitt to write the script. I also enjoy when writers adapt their own books to film. It creates a more sentimental feel to the work rather than having some immediate stranger take someone else's work into thei own hands. Many, many films have been successful that way, but it's nice to see the original person adapt their own personal work on the screen in the way, shape, and form they themselves want to see it in.This is quite a film. It may take hours to sink in with some people. But somehow, this little gem managed to squeeze itself under the radar. Being heavy on the drama but very clear with the science fiction element, K-PAX is a thought-provoking and a completely genuine movie experience.Starring: Kevin Spacey, Jeff Bridges, Mary McCormack, and Alfre Woodard. Directed by: Iain Softley.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This always keeps a step ahead of the mind of the viewer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Dr. Mark Powell started his usual day at the public mental hospital where he works, he must have had different expectation of patients. But when a patient called Prot is allocated to him for diagnosis with an introduction 'Like a pussy cat', he finds himself quite involved more than usual. Prot claims that he comes from a planet called K-Pax and he is on a mission. While the good doctor tries to unfold the true identity of this mysterious 'alien' he finds himself amusingly bonding with him. As Prot is very through and informative on his side of the story Dr. Mark finds it challenging to make an influence on Prot with usual medical practices. Furthermore Prot starts to convince other patients in the hospital that he is a K-Paxian and the other patients begin to create a fan group around him. And on top of all that there is a certain curiosity within the intelligent members of some areas if Prot is actually who he says him to be as he poses some great knowledge which is still unknown to many. K-Pax is a movie which has very little ups and downs in the mood. It almost runs in a mid phase throughout. There is neither loud music nor moments of thrill unless there is one which last only few seconds rarely. And the whole movie is like a big conversation that happens between two people. And these two characters dominate the whole movie and without knowing we become witnesses to a medical investigation. Jeff Brdiges (Dr. Powell) and Kevin Spacey (Prot) makes a wonderful pair and simply strong in their character representation. They have totally different two ends to their roles and how they try to connect it together is simply fascinating. I must say that along with this lovely performance the plot works very uniquely without making the viewer bored. Having a dramatic and scientific background to it K-Pax always keeps a step ahead of the mind of the viewer. The story is completely unpredictable and much untold. Some say 'One Flew over the Kukus Nest' back in the day was similar but then again I personally don't know. My reviews at flickshout.tk</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'K-PAX' is an interesting and underrated film with a sci-fi/mystery air to it and certainly makes for involving viewing. Based on the novel by Gene Brewer, the film sees Prot being admitted to a psychiatric hospital, claiming he is an entity from a distant planet who has taken over the human body he inhabits. His psychiatrist Doctor Mark Powell tries to help ground him back to reality, only to be left with doubts over the authenticity of Prot's out-landish story.Having read the novel a few months before seeing the film, I have to say that Kevin Spacey was perfectly cast as Prot since he vacillates between delivering an almost childlike logic to the character and that odd sense that he is the one humouring Powell, leaving the audience wondering who is the patient and who is the psychiatrist, to the traumatised hysteria of his 'human' self. Jeff Bridges also provides an depiction of Powell as he veers from holding rigid views of the world to being left uncertain over what is true and what is madness.'K-PAX' is a warm film that not only throws up many questions as the story unfolds, such as how do we define madness and do creatures with such telepathic abilities exist out there in space, but also offers two engaging characters are the leads. The open ending leaves no certainties as to whether Prot really is an alien or if he is just a man with a sad past who invents this story to protect his psyche, so the audience is left to decide for themselves which resolution fits with their view of the film, but it's done in a poignant manner that won't leave people frustrated at being left hanging.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seeing isn't always believing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>K-Pax is not your ordinary Sci-Fi flick.It's about Prot a being who appeared on earth out of no where. He claims to be from the planet K-Pax. He didn't carry any belongings or ID so the authorities took him and sent him to a hospital because of his story being false.A Dr. Powell came to meet Prot and observed what Prot is like. The doctor doesn't believe Prot is from another planet. But Prot tells all the details on what it's like on K-Pax. That he's able to travel planets by light beams, has an appetite for produce, and claims that Einstein's Speed of light theory to be overlooked.Prot travels to Earth once in a while when there's enough light to travel. He's even able to travel around the earth with light beam travel. As Dr. Powell examines him he tries to convince Prot to stop the act, but Prot says he's not joking and is very serious about it. But the doctor decides to take a deeper investigating on Prot's past on Earth. And determine whether he's human or a being from K-Pax.This is a very good movie. It's not like other Science Fiction movies. It's more of a realistic fiction/Sci-Fi movie. It doesn't contain many special effects either. The main point of the movie is for you to decide whether Prot is for real or not. And that's one of the keys to this movie is believe or not believe.I was only familiar with Kevin Spacey in "A Bug's Life", but he was good in this movie too.I recommend this movie to those who want to see something that looks like a Sci-Fi flick but it's entirely different from what you'd see in an alien movie. It's definitely something to rent at the rental store.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie got to me. It's enigmatic, funny, sad, intriguing, peaceful and looks fantastic and sounds even better. I reckon most wouldn't rate this as high as 10 outta 10, but this movie has soul and in my books it's the most important thing that a movie can have.Jeff Bridges does his most memorable role and Kevin Spacey delivers, like he always does. I must've watched this movie dozens of times and find myself listening to Shearmur's amazing soundtrack from time to time. This is one instance I'm kinda afraid of to read the book when seeing the movie first - it might actually not stand up to how well this movie carries itself.Entertainment that makes you think and feel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The planet Xena and K-PAX</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Capital "K," hyphen, capitals "P-A-X." K-PAX is a planet. But don't worry, I'm not going to leap out of your chest. I'm not worried. It's just that I'm only familiar with nine planets. Well, actually, there are ten, but that doesn't matter. I'm not from Your solar system.Funny how this is correct. Brown found the new planet Xena (30% larger than Pluto with an admittedly eccentric orbit closer at one point than Pluto, thus a 10th planet) in December of 2005. I wonder if K-PAX didn't inspire him to look?This isn't the only instance of art inspired science. Recall the discovery of Martian moons after Gulliver's Travels, eh? Does anyone else think this is spooky?Perhaps the NASA probe to be sent to the planet Xena should be named in honor of Mr. Spacey's character, Prot? It would be a fitting tribute.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'A man from another planet.' Looks like interesting, doesn't it? Especially if the man is Kevin Spacey. He gave us a great performance as he always did, and he really made us believe that he came from K-Pax. We wonder about his story from the beginning to the final, is it real or not? This movie shows us that whatever the truth is imagination rules the world. Prot gives hope to the people he lives with, and this hope gives them a reason to live, hereafter they change the way they look at the world!Another thing I learn from this movie is that whatever happens we shouldn't lose our love to live. When the movie ends, I feel myself very good. There aren't many movies that make me feel so. The players' great acting and musics form this atmosphere and form a wonderful movie, but there is one bad thing: How does Prot know this astrophysical knowledge? The movie doesn't explain it.</fullReview>

I have only lived in America for a bit more than a year, but I can say K-Pax is always authentic, as far as it is never exaggerating and does not compromise the intellectual story.I found myself constantly wondering whether or not Prot is from K-Pax or not, and hoping, knowing that he is, which makes us all a bit wiser and happier.Being as surprising and exciting as a very good thriller, as intelligent and sentimental as a very good drama with two great actors of their time, this movie deserves a place in the best 100 movies of all times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When "K-Pax" came out, most critics slammed it. I, however, found it quite interesting. Portraying psychiatrist Jeff Bridges interviewing alleged alien Kevin Spacey, the movie gives us a new perspective on our own world. It's not a great movie, but Kevin Spacey does some really neat things with the role (especially the banana), as he does with every role.Maybe it was the fact that this movie came out a few weeks after September 11 and showed that most people are in fact honest individuals, or maybe it was something else, but I recommend "K-Pax". Is he an alien? I'll let you find out. Also starring Mary McCormack, Alfre Woodard and Ajay Naidu.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>K-Pax is a brilliant little film that asks big questions,, questions about life about thought and about the universe. Its most prominent question is on how we see stuff and if it has anything to do with how we think, or actually has more to do with how we think than what is actually there. It is about a regular man who works as a psychiatrist in a mental hospital in New York City. And one day the cops bring in a man who claims to be an alien from the planet K-Pax named Prot. This man is so convincing that the psychiatrist starts to question the beliefs he has had all his life. But than he finds out some interesting stuff about Prot. Some of the best things about this film are the perfect performances by the always amazing Kevin Spacey and the highly underrated Jeff Bridges, and the fact that it makes you keep guessing up till the end, and the fact that it is extremely well written. Watch it you will love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If ever a better movie were made, it would probably just barely pass by K-PAX. This was a remarkable movie, and I enjoyed every minute of it. Kevin Spacey was perfect in his role as Prot, and had me thinking right up to the end, that he indeed was from the planet K-PAX, especially when he draws the orbital pattern of his solar system. One of the things I liked most in this movie was, except for his hypnotic state, Prot actually had a serious sound to his voice, as if an actual alien possessed Kevin Spacey's body. Playing second fiddle to Spacey was Jeff Bridges, whose character as the compassionate and curious Dr. Mark Powell was equally as good. Many good things are to be said about K-PAX, and thanks to the producers and Kevin really deserves the name Space-y because it describes his character of Prot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautifully constructed "comfort" move for those who like to think a little</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first came across this film late at night on TV. I thought, random name and stars Kevin Spacey, may as well sit and watch. Quite frankly I was blown away. I had not expected anything from this film and it provided thought provoking and intriguing ideas, brought over to the audience by fantastic acting and beautiful cinematography.We follow K-Pacian Prot (Spacey) on his trip through New York, of course, he is a little "odd" and ends up in the local nut house. During his time there we are drawn in by the rapport between him and his psychiatrist (Bridges) who just wants to help "the most convincing delusional he has ever met" and by the effect he has on his fellow patients.For me this is one of those "comfort" films that you can watch again and again, and give you a warm fuzzy feeling inside. It is essentially a study of life, relationships and family, however the vehicle is very different, and definitely enjoyable. The film moves in sometimes uncomfortable directions, but ultimately leaves the viewer wondering, not disappointed, but still using the little grey cells once the credits have rolled.As another reviewer states, the final third of the film is a little inferior to the first 2/3. But nonetheless the overall result is a beautifully acted and well constructed story, which is sure to maintain a large cult following. I recommend it to anyone who needs a bit of chicken soup for the soul! 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite my reservations, I really liked this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have you ever had the feeling that you were almost certain that you would never want to watch a movie, just by reading the title? I know, it's an unusual question to start a review with, but for me it is an important one. I'm not exactly a fan of Sci-Fi movies, I don't feel the need to see space ships shooting laser beams at an unusual looking species of alien who comes from an unknown planet in a galaxy too far away to travel to. All I want is some decent, normal (human) entertainment and with a title like K-Pax, I was pretty sure that I wouldn't get it...This film tells the story of a mysterious man who claims to be Prot, coming from the planet K-PAX. Very understandably, he is taken to a mental hospital, where his psychiatrist, Dr. Mark Powell, tries to find out what exactly made his patient believe to be an alien and how he can help the man. And even though this 'alien' offers more and more convincing evidence that he might actually be real, Dr. Powell gradually finds out the truth. But in the meantime, he also notices how Prot is having a remarkable effect on the mental health of the hospital's other patients.When you don't take the time to keep watching this movie until the very end, than you might actually believe that this is a typical Sci-Fi movie, which it certainly isn't. This is actually a very powerful drama, that asks a bit more attention, but which is more down-to-earth than you might expect. Yes, even someone who doesn't like Sci-Fi can enjoy this movie. A good reason for that is of course because Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges are very convincing in their roles. Their performances are probably what made this movie really work and I'm sure that if they had chosen other actors, this might have become an entirely different, lesser movie. But the cast is made up by more actors than these two of course and it has to be said that they all did a good job. There really wasn't one who didn't fit in, and that's something you will not find too often in a movie.But even though this is a very nice movie with an interesting and amazing story, some very fine acting,..., there is one thing that didn't exactly do it for me. No, it's not the name K-Pax, it's the name Prot. That may not sound weird to you, but in my language that means 'fart'. I'm not saying that it spoiled my fun with this movie, but hearing a man being called like that is just weird. I wonder if no-one could have told them that, I'm pretty sure someone must have been able to find that out. Anyway, this is a special movie that certainly deserves a lot of attention from a large audience. I give it a rating of at least 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film that sets out to ask you all kinds of questions in all kinds of ways, using both imagination and psychology to do so, is a film that shouldn't be missed. Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges star in this charming tell tale of a man, never seen before in New York City, claiming he is alien and from another planet in another galaxy, called K-PAX. He is smart, and knows all about astrology, and other types of science in that department. Touching as a commentary on society as it is a family film. In the style of films in the nineteen seventies, such as Lumet and Donner, this film is dealt on adult levels, and adults will probably be the ones who get the most out of it.Commenting on society, Prot(Spacey) prances through the film in sheer delight, and it is delightful to watch him perk p the patients of the mental institution of which he is placed(after a false communication in the film's opening) and Bridges character is trying to understand the truth, as to whether Spacey is real genuine article or just a hoax with Disassociative Identity Disorder.The interesting thing here is that you could go both ways, there are traces of DID, and also traces that he could be telling the truth. He is very smart, here, Spacey's Prot, and he knows so much about our solar system(and his) that one is kept believing until the final minute.I did not think I would like this film, but I do...very much. And I recommend it to anyone with an imagination. Give it a try...7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>sentimental but supremely acted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>K-Pax scores points for the acting, for the originality of its ideas, and for being thought-provoking enough to confuse me thoroughly. It loses points on mushy sentimentalism and on being thought-provoking enough to confuse me thoroughly.I'll start with the positives. Kevin Spacey, Kevin Spacey, and Kevin Spacey. Wow, this guy can act! He comes across as a convincing alien, schizophrenic, and grief-stricken human being, all while remaining likable. Certain scenes gave me the shivers. Jeff Bridges pulls off a solid performance as a dedicated doctor obsessed by this unusual case to the point of straining his family relationships, and really holds his own nicely next to Spacey. The strong acting in this movie is undeniably its best point.Originality is also a big plus. Although it's based on a book series, and there are rumours it might be a ripoff of a different idea altogether, to me it was original enough to separate itself from the multitudes of alien movies already out there. K-Pax was really a simple story, but brought in physics, philosophy, psychology, and more angles than I could count. It was funny and heartwarming and truly different from most of the formulaic movies out there.However, either I'm getting dumber or the movie forgot to explain certain things. I can't say too much more without giving away the ending, but there are some pretty serious plot holes in this thing, and the ending is likely to leave most people scratching their heads. Smiling, but scratching their heads.If you ignore the inconsistencies, and the excessive focus on Mary McCormack's role as Jeff Bridges' wife, K-Pax is thoroughly enjoyable. I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original storyline with fascinating main character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I watched K-PAX it was with no expectations what so ever, since it hadn't got much attention in Denmark for some reason. I accidentally saw the title at a video store, and since it seemed interesting enough, and had Keven Spacey in the main role I rented it. I must admit I was blown away by both the storyline and the character Prot (Kevin Spacey) The storyline is simply this: A man (Prot) is found wandering around, claiming to be from another planet called K-PAX. Then he is placed in a mental hospital where a psychiatrist (played by Jeff Bridges) is to analyze his mental health. It's the interaction between the psychiatrist and Prot and between Prot and the other patients that's really interesting and fascinating. The movie is filled with a wonderful quiet type of humor and irony (and I just love the part where Prot states that the fruits we have on earth, alone is worth the trip ... and eats a banana - with the peel still on :D That's one of my favorite scenes) And I'm grateful for the fact that ind the end it's left up to the viewer to decide what to believe and what to think - no real answer is given to whether or not Prot in fact is telling the truth or if he's just a mentally disturbed person. Too many movies leaves nothing for the viewer to ponder about, and in stead explains EVERY SINGLE detail (because OF COURSE the audience can't make their OWN conclusions, and OF COURSE the audience can't THINK for themselves) which gets boring after a while. I can only recommend seeing this movie - it's just one of those movies that you can watch again and again and never get tired of. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is always disheartening for me to hear terrible reviews on a movie, only later to watch in awe as it evolves into something beautiful. It is sad (in my opinion) that everyone has somehow missed the point here. I will admit I have a bias to what I refer to as a "moralist" picture, That is, a movie with an underlying plot that somehow brings a character to a greater enlightening. Though K-pax's moral is not deeply hidden, I believe it has not yet been completely grasped, at least by the reviews I wasted my time reading. It's true, this movie is not for the A.D.D. as it can be slow at times, but never boring. Bridges and Spacey are at their best, especially the hypnotizing scenes, and both are underrated.Ok, here it is, the part I like......Warning! Spoilers!What keeps our interest is the ongoing "is it true, or isn't it" debate. At times you think it must be, and as the story unfolds it appears false. It flips you around from time to time often making you wonder how in the world can they end this.Well what I didn't catch until the very end is that not only had Prot taken the body of Porter, but he had specifically taken Porter's body for Dr. Powell's purposes. Thus the unusual knowledge about the doctor at their first meeting. The unfortunate circumstances that afflicted Porter were what Prot used to affect Powell. If Powell hadn't found out about Porter's past, he never would have realized how much he had taken for granted his own family, and reconciled with his son. It is interesting to recall Prot's statement about soap bubbles. Prot became Powell's soap bubble; he took the form that was necessary for not only Powell's healing, but also many others in the psych ward.I put a heavy priority on family. Dr. Powell's neglect of his own, could have been the downfall of his second marriage, instead we are led to believe he has been awakened. Though the Sci-Fi aspect is tough to let in, it is effective. Maybe this one goes out to the work-aholic with a family at home.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yep, haven't dreamed about a film for a long time, I think it can have that effect, because you really want to/have to concentrate on this film. Two brilliant actors, Spacey and the ever-underrated Bridges. The film never leaves it's position of is he/isn't he? which leaves you a little hungry at the end. This is a film for people who love difficult movies, Mullholland Drive springs to mind. I guess there must be a cult-following for this film. Anyway 'scuse me, no time , I'm just off to K-Pax.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't comment on movies as often as I'd like, but I just had to do this one. Kevin Spacey is brilliant in this film, as someone else already mentioned, as expected. He could have carried the entire film by himself, and it's not the easiest story for some of our more level-headed peers to sit through. (mind you, I loved this movie) But Spacey also gets the role that has the most potential. What astounded me most (unfortunately for Spacey, nobody expects anything less than superb acting from him) was the the easy grace with which Jeff Bridges carried his role. It could have so easily become a standard character, and the script was good, but not exceptional. The interaction between the two actors is what lifted the film high above average, and it was an amazing experience to watch this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Movie, Buoyed by Good Acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot is interesting enough, but not terribly unique. A man claiming to be from another planet is deemed to be mentally ill. The audience gets to guess whether his claims are true.Clearly, the strength of the movie is the acting. Kevin Spacey is particularly good (as expected) in the role of the alien being. Jeff Bridges does a fine job as the therapist that alternates between believing and disbelieving this man's story.The pace of the movie is quite slow. The direction should have picked up the pace or the movie should have been edited to a shorter length. I think there are scenes that could have been cut without changing the content of the movie. A couple of scenes were overly melodramatic, but Hollywood movies seem obliged to pander to a formula - at least a little bit. It wasn't overdone, though and did not hurt the movie overall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Difficult To Truely Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSKnow what? over the last few weeks, I've written reviews for a good few films &amp; despite some of them being awkward to write about, none have been so awkward to analyse &amp; review as K-Pax. There's a reason for this. Despite the beautiful cinematography &amp; excellent acting (Spacey needs a dry performance &amp; he delivers it well), this film is awkward as it's something I could talk about for hours. Nowadays everything I watch or read or even just witness in the street, I consider it's metaphysical, moral &amp; existentialistic standpoints. This film gets me to consider Descartes' notion of Mind-Body Duallism (the mind being immaterial &amp; the body material, aka the mind and body are seperate), it gets me to consider the notion of the universe (a quote at the end by Spacey particularly affects this) &amp; it gets me to question how society treats people we consider "insane" (this influences me in a similar way as "One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest" does). The problem is that despite being happy to discuss these topics, they aren't particularly relevant in a review about a film. So here goes, an attempt to review K-Pax without actually going off on one on the nature of the universe.Kevin Spacey is (in my view) easily one of the greatest actors of the last twenty years. Whilst his performance is dry (it needs to be for the role) in this film in comparison to stunning performances in Usual Suspects (also a bit dry) &amp; especially in American Beauty, this performance is worthy of his name.Visually this film is amazing &amp; the script is excellent (as to be expected when a film is adapted from a successful book). This sided with the acting &amp; what more is there to say? I suppose two things to say are the admitted flaws with this film. Whilst I do have nothing wrong to say for it, I confess there are moments of a bit too obscurity. A friend of mine complained that certain parts of this film are so blatantly out of this world that they almost force a conclusion upon you, rather than really leaving us with a completely open conclusion. Whilst his point has great merit, I can't help but feel that one or two ten minute scenes are not worth condemning a 115 minute film. Even Casablanca had 10 minutes or so of dullness &amp; that is easily one of the biggest (if not THE biggest) films of all time. So for 100 minutes of excellence, I think it's worth excusing 10-15 minutes of technical fault.One final note, I've never actually read any of the books (although they're now going to be added to the pile in the corner of my room which need reading), but on the dvd there is an alternative ending. If anyone would be able to tell me which ending is used in the books (as if it matters) then I'd be grateful. Like most good films however, I do think that yet again the creators have chosen the right scenes to cut out of the movie &amp; the right ending to go with. So theres another reason why the creators of this movie should be proud.In the end of the day, all I can say is that k-Pax is well worth watching, but don't be surprised if you come out of it &amp; spend the next however many days questioning the universe and other topics brought up in the film. Watch this film and enjoy! Now I'm going to go buy the books and perhaps actually get round to reading them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid drama/sci-fi, Kevin Spacey rules!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prot (Kevin Spacey) is a mental hospital patient who claims to be native to a distant planet called K-PAX. His psychiatrist, Dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges) tries to help him, all the while trying to understand Prot and find out if he is really from K-PAX.This movie doesn't really fall into any particular genre. One big part of K-PAX is drama/ science-fiction, another part fantasy, plus, add to that a dash of comedy and you begin to get what K-PAX is all about. The story (as you see above) isn't too complicated or deep, but it still offers some good twists and turns of the plot that may still surprise you as they did me. No special effects or graphics accompany this movie, and there's no need to have them, the music in the film is great however. A techno soundtrack along with a terrific piano piece makes K-PAX sound sci-fi and makes certain scenes intriguing.Kevin Spacey is the heart of the movie and plays a very convincing alien (Prot) from the planet K-PAX, emotional with great facial expressions, Spacey does a fine job in the lead role. Jeff Bridges is Dr. Powell, that aids and attempts to understand Prot. Bridges is also excellent in his part. Bridges and Spacey fit together very well and they should, after all, they've both had a lot of experience. The wife of Dr. Powell is Rachel Powell, played by Mary McCormack. McCormack plays her part well, showing the frustration from having her husband gone and so dedicated to his patient. Alfe Woodard plays Dr. Powell's coworker Claudia Villars, we don't really see Claudia too much, but overall she puts in an alright performance.K-PAX is rated PG-13 for "a sequence of violent images, and brief language and sensuality", and that covers it. As far as "violent images" go, we don't see too much. A few people that have quite a bit of blood on them, but that's all. Language is as follows: 1 "f" word (wow, only one!), 11 "s" words, and a few uses of the Lord's name in vain. Not too bad really. The "sensuality" part is just from when Prot explains to Dr. Powell how reproduction works on K-PAX, nothing terrible, just something about it feels like "having your nuts in a vice." Not too bad on the content level for a PG-13 movie, it could have been a lot worse.In conclusion, K-PAX is not a bad movie. It won't stun you, but it is enjoyable and kind of fun to watch. It has some funny parts, sad parts, really sad parts, and, well you know what I mean. It's a story of a mental hospital patient, what do you expect? All in all a good rent for those of you looking for a good drama that you can kick back and relax to, K-PAX is a well done movie.Bonus! If you've seen this movie already, like it, and are thinking about getting the DVD, I would highly recommend it. It has loads of extras to look through, and even an alternate ending and deleted scenes. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange and unsettling science fiction movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Real fans of science fiction know that there is far more to the genre then just space ships and weird looking aliens. The potential for some real drama exists without depending on the least of special effects. We see a fine example of this in this film. It is tempting to explain away the film as a morality story without the slightest science fiction in it, but a close observer will certainly disagree.A man claiming to be an alien from another planet is culled into a psychiatric ward after being discovered in a public disturbance. He is attracts the attention of the ward's head physician who discovers he has an eerie and unexplainable talent for astrophysics. The doctor's convictions about his patient are also troubled by the discovery of other circumstances in the man's history.The film seems to yield occasionally to small platitudes, but the story's basic motivation is never surrendered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Change the way you look at the world.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To have a visitor from another planet would have to be one of the great fantasies that we as humans always seems to have. That is also true of the many movies, which are done on the ?Alien life form' themes. Movie classics such as the brilliant ?E.T- The Extra Terrestrial', ?Flight of the Navigator', ?Close encounters of the third kind' are just to name a few. Then in 2001 a little film starring two-time academy award® winner Kevin Spacey called ?K-PAX' came to our screens. While it might not be as good as the aforementioned movies, K-PAX is an original movie that tries to make the illogical, logical. When an innocuous man is detained in the aftermath of a mugging, he is handed over to a seasoned psychiatrist at an under-staffed public hospital. The police turn Prot over to Dr. Mark Powell after he politely tells them that the light on their planet is too bright for him ? much brighter than back home on the distant planet K-PAX. Prot says he is on a fact-finding mission, and patiently explains how his experiences on earth contrast with life on K-PAX. He finds much to like here, but says he will return home before the summer ends. Dr. Powell is haunted by dark fears for Prot, and is determined to use every tool at his disposal to discover the man's truth before it is too late. As the days before his announced departure race by, all the patients vie to go with him back home to K-PAX.The makers of this film did a pretty good job with it. I like how the story has a feel that ?it might or might not be true', as that is what we as the audience are asked to decipher. Directed by Iain Softley in such a unique way that you have to take close notice of what is happening or you might not be able to understand what the story is trying to tell you. The story for the screenplay, written by Charles Leavitt, is taken from the novel by Gene Brewer, and is an inspirational type of story, but is also a little weird at the same time. Then there is the clever use of light in almost every scene of the film, which is one of the important devices that the film has. Prot tells us that light is his form of ?travel' and I believe that having the lighting of the film the way it was, is deliberately trying to say that Prot's ?story' could be true after all. The light used in this movie is different to your average movie, with this side of the movie done particularly well by cinematographer, John Mathieson. Kevin Spacey is an actor who has taken on roles that are just that little bit different. He was like that in the brilliant ?American Beauty', and he has done it here again. I like how his character wears glasses for almost the entire the movie, in addition to the way that he shows us that everything on earth is ?plain and simple' to him. Yet Prot also gives a very big clue to his strange existence on K-PAX, when he shows his intelligence to some astronomers, in one of the great scenes of the film. Prot also fits in well with all of the patients at the hospital, helping them to become well again. Many of the scenes with the other patients are of a great highlight to the entire movie. The other main star of the film is Dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges) whose character is in a rut, because his family life is not what it could be. Until he meets Prot, he is a doctor who has no real challenges as a psychiatrist, however when he discovers what type of being Prot really is, he continuously dismisses what Prot saying is the ?truth'. Yet his character leads me on to one part of the movie that I did not like at all, when Dr. Powell hypnotises Prot, to try and understand his strange patient that little bit more. When Prot is under the influence, his character becomes what I would call is ?bizarre'. He also changes, which for me shows how powerful a thing hypnoses can be. Through many sessions of the hypnoses, with a doctor checking over Prot's physical state, exclaiming to Dr Powell that Prot is in ?some sort of danger'. In my opinion, hypnoses is a terrible thing to let anyone do to you, because when you let someone control your mind for any length of time, it could impact on the decisions you make in the future. K-PAX is a movie that I find to be very original to say the least. I also like the story that it presents and the way that we are challenged to see whether we believe that Prot is a being from another planet or not. Having been treated by a great psychiatrist for a little over a year now, I realises that it is not an easy profession to be a part of. Many movies also show how difficult it can be to treat patients within the psychiatric profession, because they would come up with some weird and wonderful stories. If there were such beings from a planet like ?K-PAX' visiting Earth, it would be weird to see them here on earth. But would we believe their story? I am sure that is a question we would have to ask ourselves many times. CMRS gives ?K-PAX': 4 (Very Good Film)  </fullReview>

I was pleased with everything about K-Pax, from the acting and the story and the scientific elements and psychological issues, to the ending. It's not an especially upbeat or happy film, though it does make you chuckle from time to time, but I found it to be especially entertaining and thought-provoking.

Some of Kevin Spaceys actions in this movie are very funny. When he was up in the tree, for example, and when he was talking to the "queen" mental patient, the way he hid half his face around the wall and just stared.To simply put it, right from the start you'll be hooked, and if you really love drama's you won't be dissapointed.A solid 85%.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nicely done movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this both times I watched it. And both times, I walked away thinking about it, and the "morals of the story" a great deal. I agree with another reviewer in that the movie is not centred around the sci-fi aspects you might expect from an alien-on-Earth movie, but rather is about the human condition. The characters in the psych hospital provide a great insight in to that, and how they go from hopelessness to hope. This movie has touches of sadness to humour to sympathy to the final "is he or isn't he". That final question was well handled and even though some might argue you don't know what happens in the end and the question goes unanswered, I feel it is done in far more detail than something wishywashy like say, the movie Ronin (with Robert De Niro) where you never find out what's in the box and feel very frustrated because of it. I highly recommend K-PAX. 8/10</fullReview>

It was about hope, resurrection, healing and finding an inner peace. It was purposely ambiguous, which is fine. But, ambiguous is one thing and confusion another. I felt the plot unraveled in the last 1/3 and the last scene (well after the credits----did you miss it?) only reinforced the mystery.

		<shortDescription>Captivating Drama with Superb Acting!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When first approaching this movie I thought, oh no, not another alien comes to earth movie. But much to my surprise, it turned out to be a captivating drama highlighted by the superb acting of the film's two stars Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges. Spacey plays "Prot" a man who seemingly "appears" in Grand Central Station (without his razor). When he tries to help a mugging victim, he identifies himself to police as a visitor from a far away planet named K-Pax. Naturally the police assume he is unbalanced and send him to a mental facility. Later he is sent to psychiatrist Dr. Mark Powell (Bridges) for an evaluation. In the course of their conversations Prot gives convincing arguments to support his claim that he is an alien. He even impresses some world class scientists with his knowledge of his "home" galaxy, which is apparently only known to few. Back in the mental facility he is having a positive effect on the lives of several of the other patients. He gives them hope by convincing them that they can overcome their various handicaps. Meanwhile Dr. Powell is trying to unravel the mystery. He finds some of the answers by hypnotizing Prot and probing his past. Yet at the end of the film we are still left wondering, was this guy really who he said he was. Director Iain Softly skillfully keeps the viewer's interest by not letting to much of the cat out of the bag at a time. He is aided by an outstanding performance by Kevin Spacey, who is so convincing that you really believe his sincerity. He is particularly good during the hypnotic sequences. Jeff Bridges plays very well against Spacey as the concerned psychiatrist. Others in the cast include Mary McCormack as Bridges' wife, Alfre Woodard as his boss and David Patrick Kelly and Saul Williams as Howie and Ernie, two of the mental patients that Prot helps. A riveting movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Movie With Excellent Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit that I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie. I had expected it to be a fairly hokey sci-fi adventure, and instead I discovered it to be a truly thought-provoking adventure that certainly kept me guessing all the way through about the real identity of Prot - and that still has me guessing even after I've seen the movie. That to me is the mark of a truly good movie. Usually I'm left somewhat empty by loose ends that aren't tied up; I like a certain degree of closure to a movie. In this case, though, the uncertainty seems appropriate and added to the overall high quality of the movie.The performances were of generally high quality. I've always thought that Kevin Spacey was a decent enough actor - albeit one who in my opinion has not always chosen the best vehicles to showcase his talents and who has fallen into a certain pattern of playing emotionally challenged characters (His work in "The Shipping News" and "American Beauty" come to mind as examples.) The character of Prot certainly has elements of that pattern (particularly as the movie progresses) but Prot is also a very different kind of character for Spacey, and I thought that he handled the challenges of basically playing two characters in one (I won't say any more about that so as not to spoil anything) extremely well. Jeff Bridges also surprised me with what I thought was one of the better performances I have ever seen him offer as Dr. Powell, the psychiatrist charged with sorting out the mystery surrounding Prot.The story is well written, well developed and very interesting. As I said, it has the ability to keep the viewer guessing all the way through and beyond. The only real weakness to the story comes at the very beginning. I wasn't entirely sure why it was that Prot would have been taken into custody at the train station. True, the police originally thought he had mugged the old lady, but in truth he hadn't done anything, there were witnesses saying that he hadn't done anything and the old lady confirmed that he hadn't done anything. Why take him into custody? Because he had caused no trouble? Sure, he was a bit unusual and had no I.D. but - this is New York City for goodness' sake! That's reason to put someone into a psych ward? Struck me as a bit far-fetched, but it was the only real weakness I could see in an otherwise superb story.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What I think K-Pax really is!!Not really a Spoiler but a point of view</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching K-Pac, which was a very good movie, it left me wondering was Kevin Spacey an alien or human. Well the answer to that I think is neither. For those of you know Latin, which I'm guessing is none, pax is a latin word. And guess what it means, PEACE. That's right it means peace. So I believe what Prot is referring as K-Pax is actually heaven. Now that's just a guess but i do think i remember that his character was dead(or they never knew if he was or not). But i think the whole point was to show that one little peaceful can save a relationship. I am probably the only one who thinks but i didn't care how it related to some gay foreign film. I was trying to figure the real point of the film. I may be right or i may be wrong. But consider what i said or believe what you want.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In brief, as someone interested in science fiction, this is one of the better films recently released in this genre. Whilst there are the usual suspension-of-disbelief-moments required, it is a quite intelligent exploration of madness vs. sanity, and how far one can or should go when confronted with the possibility of the unknown. Perhaps these ideas could have been explored more fully, and I wonder whether the final quarter of K-Pax could have been reworked to greater effect. Some extraneous plot lines, for example, could have been easily excised.The music for this movie was truly outstanding. Congratulations on the composer for his work in this film. I found it to be both evocative and moving, particularly that which accompanied the opening credits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wonderfully uplifting tale of a man who is put in a mental institution for believeing he is an alien from the planet K-Pax (a delightful performance from Kevin Spacey) and good things seem to happen everywhere our alien friend goes ( think Field of Dreams meets Hearts in Atlantis). The film is supprisingly effective and will have viewers watching just to see what happenes next, thanks to a magical script and direction, not to mention great performances from Spacey and Jeff Bridges as the shrink trying to find out what is really going on. But the flim suffers from an ending that has some loose ends not quite tied up that may leave some viewers feeling short changed. Although due to some intense scenes it probably isn't family fare but still worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Film Is Generally Misunderstood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very few people I know who have seen K-PAX, understood or liked it, when, in my opinion, it is the best film to come out of Hollywood since Forrest Gump. The concept behind K-PAX is simple. A man suffers a horrible and overwhelming loss, one his mind refuses to accept. He, in course, tries to take his own life. Instead he survives, but has literally become another person. Prot from the planet K-PAX. This is not a case of split personality, Prot and Robert Porter are two very different beings. You witness Prot preform things in this film that are beyond all human capability, yet, it seems to never explain why or how. THAT is when you, the viewer, must use your greatest resourses, imagination and common sense. Prot can see Ultra-Violet light, he can come and go as he pleases. HOW is this possible if he were once as human as you or I? Medical Science has proven that we only use about 10% of our brain for everything from memory to bodily functions. It is my opinion that Robert Porter awoke after trying to drown himself, with the ability to use 100% of his brain capacity. And no one knows exactly what we would capable of if we could all tap into 90% of un-used brain matter. Prot WAS an Alien, one from Earth! The only person alive with the ability to use all of his brain. Let us not forget Bess. After nearly five years of being Prot, Robert Porter wanted out, he wanted to face and deal with his loss, and, he did, after doing so he passed his gift to sweet little Bess and she vanished without a trace. This film had OSCAR written all over it, but the Academy overlooked it. I highly recommend this film to anyone who dares to dream and uses their imagination. Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges are magnificent, as is this film.</fullReview>

If you have experienced trauma in your life, wouldn't you try to find ways to forget about it? Thats what K-Pax is about.Prot/Robert Porter, played by the beautifully talented actor Kevin Spacey, is an extra terrestrial who comes to earth trying to find ways to help others...and he did. His psychiatrist, Dr. Mark Powell, played by veteran actor Jeff Bridges, doesn't really know what to think about his new "patient". After a series of hypnosis sessions, he finds out the truth behind Prot's story. To avoiding spoiling this wonderful film for you, I'll just let you watch the movie, ok!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing, mystifying, intriguing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>K-PAX is in a class of movies that is rare today. It asks so many questions and leaves all but a few unanswered. So many movies lay out the most superficial qualities of mankind and the universe, and play on over-used themes and plot that amazes but does not require any thought to enjoy or understand. K-PAX is a departure from that pattern. Kevin Spacey exhibits his versatility, portraying a character, Prot, who is so seemingly human, but so persistent about his origins on the planet K-PAX. Certain things cannot be explained or rationalized. Others don't need to be. K-PAX touches on so many social, philosophical, and scientific issues. It opens the mind and the heart, and asks questions that don't want or need to be answered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misnomer about K-Pax being remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to correct what a couple of people have said about "K-Pax" being a remake of "Hombre mirando al sudeste" (AKA "Man Facing Southeast") Yes, the plot line is similar. In both, a man claiming he is an alien ends up in a mental hospital, where a doctor tries to cure him of his delusion. But NO, it is not a remake. "K-Pax" is based upon the novel of the same name by Gene Brewster. There is a notice on Brewster's own website which reads: "A NOTE FROM THE AUTHOR ABOUT MAN FACING SOUTHEAST: Universal Pictures has recently been sued by the owner of the English-language rights to MFSE. I first learned about this Argentinian film five years after I'd written K-PAX. Any similarity in plotline between the two is, therefore, purely coincidental." Hope this clears up any confusion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good film to watch, and Spacey is as ever at his best. Jeff Bridges, on the other hand, was either mis-directed or was left to direct himself or tried to direct himself. I found much of his performance stilted and cliched. I found most of his story-line cliched: overworked white-collar professional with a wife on the verge (or was this supposed to be a contrapuntal theme?!). However, the dual possibilities for interpreting the events make it an interesting film to ponder afterward. However, pursuing one logical line with one of the interpretations of the plot will lead to a dead-end, I think, very quickly. Unfortunately, there really is no way to confirm whether or not this is a flaw in the plot. I guess if I hadn't tried to "out-think" this movie, I might have liked it more. So maybe, it should just be taken at face value and left a mystery? Not every photo graph has an assassin hiding in the bushes. But the film presents options. I just wish that the possible avenues of investigation didn't end so quickly or easily.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think I liked this film much better the second time around. I'm not really sure why, but I just liked it a lot more. I love all the characters in the film very much.Possible Spoilers Ahead:The story is completely original and very interesting. I thought it was such a cool story. I love that after seeing the film there are good arguments supporting that he IS actually from K-PAX AND that he is merely an delusional human. If he isn't from K-PAX than where did Bess go? ...And how could he know the orbital patterns of the Lyra solar system? Although, it seems pretty possible that after that traumatic event in Robert Porter's life that he could very well go insane and become delusional. So, I guess I'm trying to say that I like that the director leaves it up to the audience to believe what he/she wants to believe.On top of an awesome story, the music is just incredible! I need to go get the soundtrack to this film. The film has some very interesting music.Like I mentioned before, all the characters are interesting and cool. Kevin Spacey did an incredible job with his role, as did Jeff Bridges, and let's not forget the beautiful Mary McCormack, she did a great job too. I'd never heard of David Patrick Kelly (Howie) or Saul Williams (Ernie) before, but I thought they both did an incredible job with their roles. Very cool (and convincing) actors. Great job guys!!!There really isn't enough good things I can say about this film! There was virtually nothing I didn't like about the film. I would definitely recommend watching this film, but please have an open mind while watching it. I hope you enjoy the film as much as I did. Thanks for reading,-Chris</fullReview>

I doubt that any actor other than Spacey could act as well as he did. Acting of Bridges as the psychiatric was also good and backed well Spacey's work. The alien gave some interesting comments and information of his "planet". No concept of family, of marriage, a cool life without much sentiments. He was amazed to see that all scientists were Doctors (Ph.D.) while none of them was able to develop mathematical formulas and calculations that he did in a short period of time.

		<fullReview>K-PAX is quite possibly one of my favorite movies ever. The story is original, compelling, heartfelt and involving, the theme is multi-layered, the humor bits are memorable and the acting is superb. The musical score is wonderful, haunting, poignant, strangely appropriate. I honestly don't think I can find a single flaw in this film, though I'm sure some exist for those hardened cynics out there to dig up. What I especially loved was how (and I'll say this without spoiling) when all is said and done, at least two entirely different stories are told, depending on your belief. This is very much a movie about belief and possibility, the central symbol being Spacey's last words to Bridges. I'm at a loss as to why this movie didn't win any awards, and being a creative artist myself with a persistent fear of my own work being misunderstood, the lack of attention given to this movie is pretty demoralizing.</fullReview>

I loved the scene where the sceptical psychiatrist says something like "But you would have had to travel 1000's of years at the speed of light to get here", Prot laughs at this primitive suggestion as if he'd just been told he came by a london double-decker bus! It had me thinking about the size of the universe for many days afterwards.The director Ian Softley also made the excellent "The Wings of the Dove" and is proving to be a director of thoughtful adult oriented films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are looking for a blockbuster type film, with explosions and alien creatures hovering above the White house, then i suggest you look in another direction because K-pax is just not that type of film. Put in such a genre because of its ties to life on other planets it completely denies all stereo types that alien films might have. Also put in another genre because of its set in a Mental Institution it is compared to such films as One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest. I would have to say that its a quaint mix of the two genres. We follow Prot playes by Kevin Spacey, a Mental Patient that seems to beleive that he is an alien from the planet K-pax and has been sent to Earth in Human form. His Performance is compelling and as always, Spacey takes the cake with his nack for playing weirdos in his films. Always on his toes with the sarcastic comments and nonchalant expressions Kevin is genius in this movie. Jeff Bridges i could say less for as he constantly remind me of " The Dude" from The Big Lebowski, as he plays a psychiatrist who is assigned to Prots case. He somewhat starts to beleive Prots stories of light travel and convincing characteristics,acting just as one would be if he was just sent from another planet to Earth. The end of this movie is the best part, a little bit predictable, but at the same time really makes you think about the truth. I have watched this film again and again on Pay Per View because the video store has been out for weeks, so just a warning that you might want to put this one on hold. Overall though, its definatley worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Unique Story With Imagination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>K-PAX is about a mysterious stranger who claims to be from another planet. He goes to help a lady who has been mugged, and when the police come, they question him...of course, his deadpan expression as he says he's from the planet "K-PAX" lands him in the mental ward.From there, Prot (Kevin Spacey) enters an interesting doctor-patient relationship with Dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges), which is really the heart of the film. Prot's revelations about life on the idealistic planet he's "from" helps others, including Powell and the other patients, make changes in their own lives. From their we get the main subplots of the film.About half-way through, the story changes direction a bit as Powell finds a link between Prot and an actual human friend from Earth that Prot had. He investigates this and finds several surprises about this friend of Prot's, that ultimately leads to Powell once again doubting Prot's claims to be an alien. This leads to a conclusion that allows the viewer to decide for themselves exactly what Prot is all about, and where the truth lies.All in all, it's a very good film, especially since it stands out from the rest of the films we see these days as an imaginative and creative effort. Spacey is terrific, of course, especially during the hypnotism scenes which allow him to display his range a bit; since Prot himself is a bit subdued and straight-forward in his mannerisms. The dialogue is done quite well and Powell is a believable character in that he is very skeptical throughout, but begins to believe in Prot just as the viewer does. In a way, it's easy to see yourself in Powell's position throughout the film. The movie does lose a bit of steam once Powell starts investigating Prot's relationship with Robert Porter (Prot's human friend), but this does lead to the conclusion, which is thought-provoking and satisfying. The direction is done well by Iain Softley, as the theme is flashes of light and rays of light; the method in which Prot supposedly (I'll leave it up to you to believe him or not) travels between K-PAX and Earth. Well worth seeing. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before seeing K-Pax, I had heard some mixed reviews on the film, so I sat down to watch this one without too much anticipation. This turned out to be a marvelous movie with some really great acting. Bridges and Spacey are wonderful. I think the problem some people had with this one is that they went in thinking it would have more of a Sci-Fi slant (StarMan, Close Encounters) and it was clearly not that at all. In a time where almost every movie in the spotlight is packed full of special effects and C.G., here is a movie that relies completely on acting and storyline. This movie could have just as easily been made 50 years ago, which is one of the reasons I like it. One of my favorite aspects of this one is that a viewer could easily look at two very possibile conclusions. Is Prote a Kpaxian? Watch this one and judge for yourself! The end of this movie will leave you thinking for a long time. After you see Spider Man, AOTC, LOTR, (I love all these BTW) or the upcoming MIB2, watch K-Pax. Its a refreshing change of pace. 9 out of 10!</fullReview>

DO see this film in order to see flawless acting: both Spacey and Bridges are tremendous -- you do NOT see them pulling the strings. It is a great example of "team" acting: no one-upmanship, only attention to making the characters believable. Good job all the way around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If a being did come from a planet 1000 light years away, would he arrive as a human, or more likely as a coherent energy which could occupy a human body? Prot was proven to have a range of vision beyond human, a non-human blood pressure and an amazing tolerance of thorazine. He lectured the elders about the orbit of a just discovered planet, which no one knew about outside of a handfull of astronomers. Near the end of the flick when the psychiatrist, played wonderfully by Jeff Bridges, asks him to admit the possibility of being a human, he says after the discussion to take care of the person whom the doctor was certain that he was. We know at the end of the film what happened. Was Prot an alien? Did he leave the Human body? Or was Prot really an alien? All in all, a very low key, intelligent movie and very enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw the trailer of the film, I somehow urgently wanted to see it and would not be dissapointed. The story of Prot, who claims to be coming from the Planet "K-Pax" is just so fascinating and at the same time so cute and warm. You always believe him, because all he says is just so convincing and keeps you thinking all the time. Kevin Spacey is just great and the score is just wonderful. It's a charming movie, that is very emotional, but never too emotional. Just really nice and exciting. Feels like the 2 hours are over in just a few minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superior fusion of sci-fi and psychological mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>K-Pax boasts fabulous performances, sensitive direction, a beautiful score and an intelligent script based on the wonderfully addictive book by Gene Brewer.It would be wrong to assume this movie is pure sci-fi. It works on many levels and addresses some deep psychological issues in a *very* moving way. The chemistry between patient and psychologist becomes more and more fascinating as the movie progresses and while the theme of trauma is addressed powerfully, it never overwhelms the viewer and is superbly offset by the cheeky character of prot, alongside the genuine concern of his therapist.I would give this movie ten, but for the fact that the wife and family of Dr. Powell are younger here than in the book, and this unfortunately sidesteps some deeper issues that are present in the text. Don't let this put you off, though. This is still a moving and intelligent movie that has an awful lot to offer. Direction is virtually flawless.The region 1 DVD is great too, with a good batch of extras including an audio commentary. Just a shame it doesn't really acknowledge the original author of the story, Gene Brewer.I would urge you to read the book if you enjoy this movie at all. It is brilliant and delves much deeper.Let's just hope they decide to make a sequel of Gene Brewer's superb follow-up, On a Beam of Light. The market for it will build and build.Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VERY imaginative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kevin Spacey gives another great performance as Prot, who seems to be an alien from the planet of K-PAX, light years from Earth. His demeanor is always very calm and he gives very logical answers to the questions posed by his psychiatrist, played by Jeff Bridges. He loves the Earth's fruit! Another example of Spacey's acting ability is shown during several scenes when he is put under hypnosis. But the one thing that stood out about this film was the imaginative script. I don't know how the author of the book on which this movie came up with such an imaginative concept, and almost made it seem possible that Prot actually IS from another planet. This movie is worth a watch, especially for fans of fantasy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of those rare movies with a little piece of magic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an absorbing and gentle way the story of a man who may or may not be what he seems is brilliantly brought to the screen. This is one of those priceless gems which every now and then bring back to the blase movie-buff a little piece of that magic they remember experiencing as a kid. Why is K-Pax so? That is the billion dollar question! The story itself is unusual, charming, intriguing, harrowing and yet somehow inspirational. It has no dazzeling effects, no pirotechnics, no specatular stunts or eye popping cgi, but what it does have are two leading actors who are absolutely at the top of their game. Completely natural, completely real. You know these guys. You've met them. By the end of the movie you feel as if they are your friends and all the way through you really care what happens. You empathise, you sympathise and the result is that piece of cinema magic that so often eludes even the most brilliant production. The direction is high quality, the cinematography is clear and crisp, the dialogue is natural and the supporting cast are superb. I won't go into the story which is in itself, superb. I will just say this is a rare jewel of a movie in which everything comes together in such a natural and unforced way that it doesn't end when the credits roll. It stays with you.Sheer class.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a truly enigmatic and beautiful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>K-Pax, while coming off as trite at certain points, especially in Prot's last comments regarding the regeneration of the universe and the glorified notions of family, is still a fantastic movie. The art direction is flawless,drawing appropriate attention to aspects of life that we take for granted. The light refracting off a prism, a blue jay nesting on a tree etc. The biblical allusions relating Prot to the Messiah are of course evident, although, seen in its own individual light, there is much elegance in the tale being told here. The planet K Pax, is described by Prot to be a wonderfully beautiful environment, almost like an utopian society, and yet their immense intelligence and capacity to be so isolated from one another makes it seem almost cold. Like the Universe perhaps, there is really no telling which world one would prefer to live in. The miracle that is K Pax, or the mix and match jumble sale that is the Earth. Spacey's portrayal is fluid and perfect, though a little too much like his other roles, there is no telling where Spacey ends and Prot begins. And i am seriously wondering if he is starting to get typecast and should leave off such in-depth roles for a while.It is a movie that excites the senses, and fires the imagination. And never have I craved a fruit salad more!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exactly what a great 'movie' should be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this a day after watching 'panic' room I am still absolutely baffled that they have a very similar rating. This film deserves 10/10 as opposed to negative 10/10 for panic room. Anyway I think the first comment on imdb sums up the film well. What is maybe more interesting than re-commenting on the film are the following comments, where people comment on the inaccuracy of its portrayal of a mental ward? and other absurd things. ALL MOVIES ARE FICTION. Even those based on fact especially when made by hollywood. In fact if hollywood got a chance every invention, heroic deed and advance of man would be down to the Americans, I digress. I advise you to ignore all negative comments as it is a fantastic film in terms of 'you watch it, you are engrossed from start to end and leave with a great feeling in your stomach and go away telling people to go and see it'. Any 'loose ends' are minimal not the gaping holes of unbelievability in other films. I just wish hollywood would spend more time getting decent scripts like this before they pump $millions into movies. Also unlike most hollywood films you don't get that moment 2/3 through where you realise they got bored and just wanted to pad it out to some/any conclusion, no it is great from start to end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>K-Pax is a great vehicle for Kevin Spacey who plays Prot, a visitor from K-Pax, a planet orbiting a binary star system 1000 light-years away. Forced into the psychiatric hospital run-around for all the usual reasons, Prot becomes the pet project of a psychiatrist played by Jeff Bridges. Bridges' character then becomes wrapped-up in Prot's story and even more determined to discover his real identity as an ever-widening circle of people around him come to believe Prot is from K-Pax. An "outsider" fills this movie with interesting observations of humans and a touching story about all that matters in the universe is what you choose to do in this instant. Some themes are reminiscent of the recursive reality in which the movie 12 Monkeys revolves. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning : Spoilers containedAs many of Kevin Spacey's movies, I think that K-Pax is a brilliant piece of cinematography. The movie not only impresses you by its atmosphere created by the music, the strange things happening, the lucidity and logic of the supposed alien character Prot, it also tries to respond to a few existentialist questions concerning our life on this planet.One of the keywords in this movie is "happiness"; almost all the characters in the movie are more or less unhappy from different reasons and, as everyone of us, they are trying to find their happiness. Seeing "the blue bird of happiness" creates a moment of exaltation for the patients, for a few moments they are content to live their life.A good way to reach happiness is founding a family, having a wife and kids; this idea is sustained many times in the movie: first of all by presenting Prot, the supposed alien identified by his name (PROT like Porter ROberT) and by his appearance with the character Robert Porter who lost his wife and daughter; although Prot does not directly express his regret for not having a family and considers normal that a k-paxian child should make his first steps in life learning from different people that are not his biological parents, you can feel his sadness for not having anyone waiting for him at home, not having a family and somebody who really cares for him. Mrs. Powell's remark `you don't know what you're missing' (when speaking about her family) is one of the only remarks in the entire movie remaining without a response from the logic `M. Know Everything' Prot.The only chance that Dr. Powell has to reconcile with his son can be understood in a more large sense; everybody has only one life, only one chance to live it and do the things right. This is a good reason for everyone to refuse being afraid of what could happen to him, idea which Ernie and Howie understood very well and got out of the hospital.Robert Porter, who could have left with his wife avoiding to become a `knocker' and to have his wife and daughter killed, had missed his chance 5 years ago; now he tries hardly to make the others happy or to teach them how to reach their happiness.The planet K-Pax has two suns and even if they only rise together once every 200 years, there should be more light on K-Pax than on Earth; but Prot wears sunglasses and says the reason is that the days on K-Pax are like the dawns on Earth. This lack of light expresses one more time the sadness of Prot (Robert Porter) who already missed his chance by losing his wife and daughter; he wears his glasses because he doesn't want to look at the light anymore, he stopped fighting. Prot has only about 150 years, so eventually he had never seen the two suns, he had never had light in his life as Robert Porter lost his father since he was a kid and then his wife and daughter. What Prot does, is though the opposite of the message transmitted to the others during the entire movie and most clearly in the end by the note left on the table near his sunglasses before leaving on K-Pax.The classic idea found in many other movies that people should enlarge their field of vision and learn to accept without eventually being afraid what they do not understand is expressed very well by Prot with his last words of a normal non-catatonic person : `I will accept the possibility that I am Robert Porter if you accept the possibility that I am from K-Pax'.The end of the movie gives no answer to the question `Is Prot or not from K-Pax?'; there is no answer because there should be no question.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>About 17 years ago, a movie called "El hombre mirando al sudeste" (Argentina, 1985) made its debut, winning a Goya and even a critic's award in Toronto.It is so strange to see its American version, and nobody even mentioning the original one.With the help of two big movie stars, "K-Pax" obviously has more resonance in the cinematographic world, even though it suffers from the same mistakes of the original (a rather quick development in a story that would actually take a few years in the happening, and a tendency to scream out moral deficiencies in an uneasy simple way) leaving the Argentinian film almost in oblivion.Did "El hombre mirando al sudeste" truly deserved a remake? Could "K-Pax" be considered better just because of its higher cost in production? Was there a need of a remake?I did enjoyed Spacey playing opposite Bridges. They we're great. But... why not promote the original version, instead of forgetting it or intentionally ignoring it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an exceptional performance by Mr Spacey as a man in a psychiatric ward who claims to be from the planet K PAX, one thousand light years from earth. Jeff Bridges gives what is tantamount to a good supporting performance as the doctor trying to save his patient from his delusions to the detriment of his own family life.An excellent supporting cast give a fair and accurate portrayal of life in a Psychiatric institution. It is nice to see such a place portrayed without the need to show the usual heavy-handed orderlies manhandling patients and uncaring nurses injecting patients with tranquillisers at the first sign of trouble.The film opens with the character Prot helping a woman who has been attacked in a train station. From that opening scene Spacey gives Prot an unearthly quality. From the childlike innocence of each new discovery the audience travels the journey with him. Spacey's Prot is smug, occasionally arrogant and almost Christ-like but his effect on his fellow patients is what captures the imagination. It's a funny, engrossing yet poignant film, which leaves you feeling both charmed and horrified.</fullReview>

There are many questions raised in this film but we are left to interperate the ending ourselves and this is a good thing as the emotional ride we have been taken on would have been spoilt by an easy ending. And we certainly don't get that. The way certain subject matters are dealt with in this film are both sympathetic and refreshing. Mental illness is very often used as an easy laugh in films of this type, but not so in K Pax. Instead the laughs and there a few come from Kevin Spacey alone.

		<fullReview>K-Pax is one of those rare films in which within the two and half hours of excellence your whole body goes through all of the emotions that a good film should possess, happiness, sadness confusion and anger.Kevin Spacey plays "Prot" and alien from the planet K-Pax (or so he says), he is sent to Dr Mark Powell played by Jeff Bridges a psychiatrist at a mental institute, here Prot begins to form special relationships with both the patients as well as the staff including Dr Powell, who seems to make it his duty to help Prot in whichever way possible. During te film Prots childlike innocence portrayed seamlessly by Kevin Spacey opens closed doors and makes Dr Powell see things in his own life that is missing in Prots. This film although lacking in the usual blockbuster gore, action and romance plays childlike into the hearts of those that watch it. Throughout the whole film it has an aire of mystery and when walking in without knowing what is going to happen, you still walk out at the end feeling as though you have missed some vital part, at the same time thinking "Maybe".This film is highly recommended, it was a pleasure to watch and brings more than one tear to your eyes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As an actor, Kevin Spacey is not to everyone's taste. His understated style can seem samey and smug. Whether or not that criticism is true, such a style is perfect for this film.Our story begins and ends intriguingly. Spacey plays a being calling himself Prot (pronounced "Prote") who appears out of nowhere in the form of a man at Grand Central Station and is taken from there to a mental institution ? because he claims to come from another planet, the name of which gives the film its title. While at the Manhattan Psychiatric Institute, he interacts with, and in some cases helps, the other patients, and his therapist, Dr Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges).There are good scenes throughout the film. My own favorites are when Prot is able to out-think some professional astronomers at their own game. Later, he predicts that a blue bird will appear to delight his fellow patients. A blue jay duly does appear, to the dismay of some of Dr Powell's colleagues who dismiss the patients' delight as mass hysteria.At the end, Prot disappears, sort of, leaving the other patients to live on and Dr Powell to ponder acting on some advice he gives. He does act on it, in a superbly understated scene that brings the film to a satisfying conclusion.Performances, not just Spacey's, are good. Of particular note are Jeff Bridges and, especially, David Patrick Kelly in a deep, credible performance as the obsessive compulsive Howie. The music, also understated (that word again!), is just perfect.The only serious weakness is that too many of the secondary characters, particularly Dr Powell's wife (Mary McCormack) and some of his colleagues at the hospital, are clichés.I first saw this on a plane. When it finished, I sat for half an hour or more thinking about what I'd seen. It still has that effect on me and I wish more films did.Recommended then.Rating: 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kevin Spacey is a good alien, and Jeff Bridges a good ole boy as the Manhattan psychiatrist trying to bring him down to earth. We are offered a rational explanation, but there are one or two unsolved mysteries so that the terminally credulous can argue that Prot (Spacey) really is from K-PAX, 1000 light years away. Just how did this guy acquire such detailed knowledge of `his' star system. How did Jeff Bridges get to be a psychiatrist? How did they find a mental hospital full of such warm and engaging characters? There is perhaps no mystery why the film became an in-flight movie so soon after release, but it's not totally silly and there is some interest in finding out where Prot really comes from.Spacey is given some good lines (I liked his ingenious explanation as to why Einstein's Relativity theory didn't apply to his journey from K-PAX), and the whole thing has a warmhearted atmosphere.</fullReview>

He wants to be picked up by the police and land in a psychiatric ward. He finds a doctor who is compassionate and intelligent so that his host body will be placed in good hands when he returns to his home planet. Prot is a very caring being who feels so badly for what happened to his host's wife and daughter that he eventually obtains good care for him. And that's the major thesis of the movie--let's take care of each other, even for those people whose lives are devastated by grief or mental breakdown.

While it has that certainly, it's predominately a sort of light drama, and a good one. It really does make you think.Because the ending of K-PAX is so delicate, you really can't discuss it too much without ruining it. Suffice it to say, it's quite good, and in no way deserves being labeled vague, as some of the reviews have done. It's so artfully done, that if you disagree you can happily believe the opposite is true, while leading everyone to an excellent conclusion.

		<shortDescription>Very enjoyable...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a very refreshing, intelligent and sweet movie. I really didn't expect much seeing the low grade most reviewers gave it, but was pleasantly surprised. The acting was outstanding and the plot was original &amp; interesting (I didn't think it was anything like the other movies it was compared to, e.g. "Girl Interrupted" which I really didn't like). K-PAX was very well done and never got boring. At no point did I look at the clock waiting for it to end, but only at the ending hoping that it's not going to end yet. (*minor spoiler alert*): Yes the ending for me was somewhat disappointing Prot-wise, but maybe it was better than directly admitting that Prot was just a lunatic. The scene with Powell and his son almost made up for it, but not quite...8.5/10, only because I believe an ending deserves more than 1 point.</fullReview>

The tone of the movie was excellent and the building of the plot, while predictable, kept you engaged enough that you did not notice that you could predict what happens next.The feeling of ease, comfort, and sadness we felt throughout and at the end were great and why we gave this movie a 9.We're still not sure exactly what the truth is and that is the best part.Highly recommended for sharing with that special someone on a Friday night after a long hard week.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Outstanding performance by Kevin Spacey as Prot. The plot, which rhymes with Prot, is a wonderfully written piece of work. When I saw this movie I really liked the way the dialog had been written, and the oneliners really made me law, though they surely hadn't been thought of as oneliners. Great movie, great Spacey... get into space!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant, thought provoking film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possible SpoilersAhh...another of the "nutter" movies I hear you say...We've had quite a number of them from One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest To Girl, Interrupted and A Beautiful Mind. Whilst they were all brilliant in their own ways, and Cuckoo's Nest and Girl, Interrupted were also quite similar, K-Pax holds its own, and is less about the institution as it is a character play between Kevin Spacey (Prot) and Jeff Bridges (Dr. Mark Powell).The basic premise is this: At the beginning of the movie, Prot "appears" in the middle of grand central station and witnesses a bag snatch. When he tries to help the lady, the police question him, and then proceed to take him to belview (a mental institution) in the belief that he is mad. From here he ends up at a different institution under the care of Dr. Mark Powell, who sums up his character quite well with the quote to his secretary "Who is it this time? Jesus or Joan of Ark?". But, as you soon discover, Prot has a few surprises of his own, as he and Mark interact, both the doctor, and the viewer, are left wondering if it could actually be possible that he's telling the truth, and that he's really from K-Pax.The acting in this film is second to none, with Kevin Spacey solidifying his position as an A+ actor, and Jeff Bridges proving that he has many a trick still up his sleeve.The longer that Prot stays, the more changes that start occuring in the psychiatric institute. The patients mental health improves. And Prot gives his views on life as it is in K-Pax.It is a movie of many levels. First it is a great character piece between two of the most exceptional actors around today. Secondly it is a movie about a psychiatric institution and how there is hope even for the most "hopeless" of cases, and that one should never give up. Thirdly, it is a movie to make you wonder...wonder about what other life forms there may be, and wonder if we could be talking to someone who is from somewhere else and not even know it.And the ending is one of the best i have seen from a mainstream hollywood picture in a long time, as you are left to discover for yourself what the truth is, without having it wrapped up for you by the picture.All in all, K-Pax is a brilliant film that i would highly reccommend to everyone. See it now!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An emotionally enthralling masterpiece with a message for all of us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dr. Michael Powell, a respected psychiatrist working a the Psychiatric Institute of Manhattan, is confronted with the most difficult case of his career: A man, who calls himself Prot, claims to have come from K-PAX, a planet revolving around the binary stars Agape and Satori in the Lyra constellation. Dr. Powell approaches the case by trying to confront with the holes in his made-up world - which he doesn´t find, even with the help of a befriended astronomer. Could he really be an alien?Kevin Spacey (Prot) shows (again) that he is to be counted among the most excellent actors ever. Note, that this movie is not set in some kind of sci-fi world, it´s supposed to be the real world, in which you would laugh at somebody who claims to have just arrived from a planet a 1000 lightyears away - and in which such a person would be where Prot has to go to, a psychiatric hospital. A sane among the insane, both intellectually and emotionally above the things that happen around him and yet with a extraordinary capability of empathy - a difficult character that is perfectly and convincingly portrayed by Spacey. Jeff Bridges as Dr. Powell did excellent as well, though K-PAX is no vehicle of displaying Bridges' - top-notch - acting talents due to his limited on-screen presence.Don´t think, the core of the story is just an insane guy or an alien, it´s much more than that: It´s an exploration of the depths of human social life. It will leave you thinking about what you think is the essence of life - and that is what makes this movie a rare gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a warm movie about our cold lives</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is not perfect nor purely fantastical. But its simplicity and direction truly deliver. Throughout the pacing of the movie, I keep feeling warm and mellow inside. Hoping that Prot is every bit an alien as he claims to be, simply because he brings so much hope for all of us, who are looking for a better life than the ones we have on Earth. Too bad that the rest of the mental patients couldn't hold their grounds against Spacey's brilliant subtleties and intelligence. Even Jeff Bridges seems too ordinary of a character, for a Starman himself. I do love how the movie shows the brilliant side to Prot, unlike some other alien-drama movies, which avoided a showcase of extra-terrestrial knowledge, simply because the authors couldn't handle it. The twist at the end of the movie gives Prot his humane side. A most welcomed performances and a warm movie about our cold lives.--------------------------- Best Bit [possible SPOILER] Prot looks outside the car's window and sees two children, one of them is holding a silver balloon with a green alien's face on it. The balloon gets loosen and lifts higher towards the night sky. Prot turns his head up to follow where the balloon went, the background music reaches a higher tone. Somehow I felt that that scene was the most touching of all. It is perhaps the culmination of our hope of a better life somewhere among the stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unanticipated Pleasure...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I saw the film, I had heard mixed reviews about it. I knew that many people disliked the ending, and thought the entire movie was a little odd. This is not a movie about aliens, and if you go in thinking it's going to be about aliens, I can see how you'd be disappointed. This is a movie about how we cope with trauma, what we value in life, and how we should treat each other. It's a surprisingly heartwarming film, and very original.As far as the quality of the film goes, I was not surprised there. Jeff Bridges turns in an expected good performance. But once again, I think the nod goes to Kevin Spacey on this one. Spacey has never failed to impress me as an actor. Just when you think he's typecast for a certain role, he proves you wrong. His dipiction of Prot is not only convincing and troubling, but also funny. Kevin Spacey has a knack for delivery of humourous lines (among his other talents.) I thought this was a wonderful movie. I was delighted, because I wasn't sure what to expect. But with this great cast, I should have known better. I recommend this film to anyone.4.5 Stars/5(I would like to add, did anyone else find great irony in the supposed alien character being played by a guy named Spacey? :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good movie. If thinking about a movie 24 hours after it ends is any indication, then this is a good movie!Kevin Spacey is Prot, a visitor from another planet called K-PAX, and Jeff Bridges is Dr. Mark Powell, his psychiatrist in a Manhattan Medical facility. Is Prot really a K-PAXian? Does Prot have a special alien talent for curing the mentally deranged? These questions and others are dealt with in a way that keeps the viewer guessing till the very end. There is a modicum of violence; however, it's not your normal BIFF-BOOM-BANG type of action and is handled in such a way as to make it tolerable.If I have any complaints about this movie, it's about the camera work and the ending. 1. The camera does close-ups 80% of the time and I find this annoying.2. I can live with the present ending but would have liked something different. I'll say no more in order not to spoil it.

		<fullReview>The One Word that came out of my mouth after seeing this movie?:WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Let me tell you, this is going to be a CLASSIC!!! I was dubious about seeing the movie, because I thought it looked tacky. However, I found it to be one of the best movies of the year (#2 on my list).The plot is that a man, who calls himself 'prot', claims he is from another planet, refered to as K-PAX. Ppl think "This man is insane", and the police evntually send him to an Insane Assylum to clear up his thoughts and send him back to normal. However, once Dr. Mark Powell, a psychologist, has a few talks with him, it starts to seem that he could be from the planet K-PAX. Is this possible? This question is asked a lot throughout the movie.The main reason you could enjoy the movie is because of all the other ppl at the assylum. They're acting is fabulous. The actors/actresses with these parts were able to show how they wanted, and would do anything, to get out. The ending of the story makes you feel sad for these ppl stuck here for life.THIS IS A MUST SEE MOVIE, I WOULD VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY MUCH RECCOMEND SEEING IT!!!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Sci-Fi Since Contact</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enter Kevin Spacey - suddenly appearing man with abnormally high intelligence, claiming with great persuasion that he comes from the planet K-PAX. Jeff Bridges, the psychologist, spends the movie trying to figure him out. Is he an alien or insane? It goes without saying that for an X-Files fan (the older seasons) this is an inviting concept. As in Contact (1997) my alien fascination was greatly satisfied in this spectacularly intelligent and moving film. It may be somewhat ambiguous, but that's the way we like these films, right? Add to that the fact that Kevin Spacey is doing his best work since Seven (1995) and you are bound for a joyride. You won't find better entertainment on the big screen this year.It was also interesting to notice that some concepts must have been inspired by Douglas Adams' classic sci-fi book Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Having said that, do not expect a pythonesque comedy. This is far more serious. Rating: 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kevin Spacey beams down another winner worth catching in the theatre...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once again Kevin Spacey delivers a terrific performance, this time as the likeable "alien" Prot in Iain Softley's("Hackers") new film, "K-PAX". Like a cross between "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest" and "Starman", this movie has a great "magical" feel to it and actually challenges the viewer to come to his/her own conclusions about the sanity of Prot and what the ending actually means.The many thought-provoking topics find its way into the genre-hopping script and it seems to work pretty well. While not the most fast-paced movie out there, the story unfolds in such a way that the viewer is not bored easily.Although it has been called "deceptive filmmaking", I'd like to think of it as creative. The story almost comes off as a not-so-creepy "Twilight Zone" episode. It questions many basic theories of family, life, and doubt in beliefs. The emotions cover hope to despair and everything in between. It makes you ask, "What if?" on many different topics, not just the alien aspect."K-PAX" is a definite crowd-pleaser. This is definitely worth catching in the theater, especially if you're a big fan of Spacey or Bridges. This is, in fact, probably one of the more intriguing films to come out this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true must see.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As theatergoers leave the auditorium, the same puzzled look appears on everyone's face. "What did that ending mean?" "What do you think happened?" In order to enjoy K-Pax, you must be willing to suspend disbelief for a few hours and leave your cynicism behind. Screenwriter Charles Leavitt takes you on a fantastic journey. The ending isn't packaged and sealed like most cinematic endeavors. It is left without masking tape to fill in the holes.Kevin Spacey plays Prot, a produce eating being from the planet K-Pax, who is sent to Dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges), for psychiatric help. He claims that the planet is 1000 light-years away in the constellation Lyra. He explains that he is merely a visitor to this "BA-3 planet", a planet in its primitive stages of evolution with a question mark for a future. After many conversations with Prot, Dr. Mark Powell struggles with the truth behind the tale. Prot tells us that there are no families on K-Pax, no wives, and giving birth is more painful and hideous than any human will ever imagine. Prot knows information about astronomy that only the top astronomers in the world are privy to. Prot baffles everyone but Dr. Powell, who makes it his mission to find out the real story behind the man in the sunglasses.Originally a role for Will Smith, Kevin Spacey first received the script for the part of the psychiatrist. After reviewing it, Spacey didn't connect with the psychiatrist character as much as he did with Prot. Three years later, the movie is out and Spacey is our alien. Spacey is just as mysterious in real life as he is in his movies. He always plays a character with a certain tick that tocks to a different clock. Nevertheless, with his sly grin and sweet as a puppy demeanor, he will remain on the top-ten list of the most brilliant actors in Hollywood today. This movie touches upon many issues and themes that face many families. For Dr. Powell, we see that he neglects his family and is constantly on a non-stop work schedule. He is even reluctant to invite his son from his first marriage to visit him. In an interview with Jeff Bridges, he states that the movie helps to make you realize that love and families are what get you through rough spots in life and his character is at constant conflict with this notion. Dr. Powell's wife, Rachel (Mary McCormack), shows that love when she sits by her husband's side in a wonderful scene before the climax of the movie full of Chinese food and compassion.The one thing this movie lacks is originality. Much of this comes from the supporting cast filled with the cliché asylum whack jobs. They are the same in every movie. One with a nervous twitch, the other one who doesn't talk, another one who says that everyone in the room stinks and, of course, the man dressed in sterile garb with gloves and a face mask who dares not touch anything in fear of catching a disease. We've all seen these characters before. It's time we throw them away and find a new batch.Regardless, the team of Bridges and Spacey is incredibly strong. Their energies coincide well in a scene, constantly feeding off one another to create a fantastic pace. This movie is a "must see" by me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sweet and sensitive performance from Spacey.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kevin Spacey, who may or may not be an alien in 'K-PAX', continues, with Tom Hanks, to carry this generation of actors into legendary status to replace the DeNiros, Pacinos, Hackmans and Hoffmans of the previous generation. His cool and composed performance in this film packs a peculiar power of compelling tenderness. Jeff Bridges reminded me of the way he portrayed himself in films like 'Thunderbolt and Lightfoot' and 'The Fisher King'. Playing a respectable second fiddle as he can be both a leading or supporting player and admirable in both. The story in 'K-PAX' is a little lazy and relaxed and ditto from the direction by Iain Softley but the resolution this film offers makes for thought provoking material. Although not a classic, 'K-PAX' will play well in all forms of media on a rainy weekend afternoon for the family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Possible spoilers)Well, is he or isn't he?K-pax puts two extremely talented actors together, playing off each other's strengths. And the producer and director accomplished their goal, I think: at the end of the movie, we walk out asking the above question.Kevin Spacey does a great job here as prot. He's believable. If an alien visitor did arrive here, we probably would put him in a psych ward just as our way of saying, "Welcome to Earth." And Jeff Bridges radiates sincerity. You can see him want to try to help prot, and you can see him start to believe prot's story, even though he uncovers prot's past here on earth.Or does he?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an interesting, intelligent movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did overall like this film. I feel compelled to comment because so many people didn't like how some of the more substaintial moments of the film were handled. (I'll try and be "spoiler free" here, sticking to moments seen in the trailers).Some comments surround the technical aspects of Prot's role. Sure, he does some impressive technical things in the planetarium. But, then, we're brought back to earth, if you will, by the next scene. The story could have easily become a chase movie, with Jeff Bridges trying to protect Prot from being taken away by "men in black" intent on discovering what he was all about. That's basically the E.T. story. And "Starman", too, which Jeff Bridges has already done once.They chose to go here with more of a "Miracle on 34th Street" approach: is he Santa / is he an alien? So I think they downplayed the technology stuff. Maybe not enough, but I think the audience expected to see some magic to make the question plausible. Is it over done? Yes, I'd have to agree it is. But, I'd bet that during the movie most are sufficently distracted by the story that these questions didn't come up. At least it's no "Planet of the Apes" when it comes to glaring plot holes.Very good acting all around and you could tell this cast had a great time making this film.</fullReview>

Spacey and Bridges were the key elements on why this film worked as well as it did.While some of the parts were a little bit too smooth (if only mental hospitals were so pleasant and doctors so dedicated), I really enjoyed the overall story.

		<shortDescription>The best film I've seen all year--a truly well-written movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen a movie of this caliber all year. The best reviews of this movie don't do it justice and the plot is both realistic and enthralling. Unlike so many other movies set in mental institutions, K-PAX really keeps moving and holds the viewer's interest. But most impressive is the lack of constant foul language and the need to portray unrealistic violence and rebellion in the hospital. Overall I rate this movie a 9 out of 10.The movies I rank in this category are only a few--"Air Force One," "Rainman," "A River Runs Through It," just to name a few others. The portrayal of human emotions is well-thought out and the movie doesn't over do it. The basic premise of the movie is that Kevin Spacey, playing the character "Prot," is an extraterrestrial being from the planet K-PAX located 1000 light-years away from Earth. No one has seen him arrive and he seems to have no family, no home, no identity. As the plot unfolds, his uncanny grasp of facts and knowledge pertaining to the planet from which he originates begins to convince his doctor and other patients that he is telling the truth. What happens from there is a wonderful theme of human emotions, love of others, and an undiscerning care for friends and strangers alike. This movie was not a tearjerker or full of romantic sappiness, but it did lend a new perspective on life and living it to the fullest. And the plot kept you dying to find out what would happen next. As I said before, I rank it as one of the best movies I have ever seen and I think you will enjoy it, too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to agree to what some other reviewers said before, the story has its logical flaws. Especially the stuff with the ultraviolet vision (which he really couldn't have faked) and the superior knowledge of the "k-pax" star system (this is a little more plausible though, he had some time to work it out). In the second half the movie simply does not mention all his incredible skills any more. Which is kind of stupid, considering he impressed some renown astronomers. The whole story somehow took a 180 degree turn. So why is this movie still that fantastic? Simple, it is the tremendous performance of Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges. Both managed to put so much in so little gestures that it more than saved the movie. It is to their credit that you simply forget the stories flaws (well, at least until some time after the movie) and just dive into it. I loved it. Period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting, enjoyable film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>K-PAX is a enjoyable, thought provoking movie. Kevin Spacey plays a man who might be an alien, or he might be insane. Jeff Bridges plays the doctor whose job it is to cure Spacey of his delusions. Every scene between these two great actors is perfect. They have interesting, intelligent conversations, so much more thought provoking than most mainstream films. The problems with K-PAX lie in the subplots. I am so tired of seeing men's wives in movies whine about how their husbands are never home. It's annoying. Cut out every scene with Bridge's wife whining and the movie is much better. The other patients in the mental ward with Spacey are cookie cutter characters. These are the same people we have met in every mental ward since ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST. Cut down on those scenes. Despite these flaws, K-PAX is still a very good movie. Spacey and Bridges are perfect. They have fun playing off each other. The ending is sure to confuse some people (I know one guy I work with told me he thought K-PAX sucked after I told him to go see it, because he didn't get the ending). The ending is the type of ending I love. It lets the audience decided what to think. I wish more movies trusted their audience as much as K-PAX does.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As many other reviewers have said, the plot is reminiscent of movies such as "Miracle on 34th Street" and "Fisher King" (especially with Jeff Bridges reprising an almost identical role).But with that said, I can continue in saying that I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie. Other than the opening sequence, I thought the direction of Ian Softely (Hackers, Backbeat) was superb. His mixture of mild pastel colors fit the mood of the movie in an amazing way, and the use of a soft yet exciting techno soundtrack brought an overwhelming breath of life, just like in Hackers (which is worth watching for its music, if nothing else).Some have said that the script was lazy ? and that may be the case, but when you combine two great actors such as Jeff Bridges and Kevin Spacey, my enjoyment of the movie just proves how amazing they are as actors. There is one emotional scene with Jeff Bridges (no spoilers here, you'll understand if you have or when you do see the movie) that left me shaken. Not many actors can do that, but Jeff Bridges is certainly one of them.And Kevin Spacey ? The only problem here is the role was made for him. It fits his character perfectly and it shows when watching the movie. He fits the brilliant yet egotistical yet compassionate role perfectly. If you've ever seen `Swimming With Sharks', you'll understand. He's eccentric without trying, and his pulls off the role of Prot with classic Spacey fashion.You have to be willing to walk into the movie with no reservations ? with just a desire to sit through a very enjoyable and heart-warming movie that has incredibly sweet motives and a message that will make you glad you watched the movie. If you don't have the ability to have a soft, pliable heart ? this movie isn't for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe Kevin Spacey has given his finest performance yet in this carefully crafted film. Prot's gentle kindness towards all humans, including (and especially) the mental patients he encounters, is a real relief for us after all the recent human atrocities we have encountered. Jeff Bridges (former "Starman") performs well as the increasingly confused psychiatrist who is finally brought to his own epiphany.This is a film which promotes thoughtful conjecture, and it is not to be forgotten. It portrays joy, delicate humor, tragedy and finally a rather comforting conclusion.May we all find his "bluebird of happiness".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Toned Down Sci-Fi That Speaks To Our Souls</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>K-Pax can be compared arguably to Miracle On 34th Street (is he Santa/an Alien ?) The treatment of the film is mushy and more suited for the romantic similar to our other favorite little alien, E.T.Its a story about a relationship between two beings.. one who may/or may not be from 1000 light years away.I think the most important thing is not to get hung up on whether Prot (Kevin Spacey's character) is from K-Pax or not. One of the films most important lessons is that we all inherently have the abilities to help or heal ourselves. We just have to believe in it enough. That we need to open our mindset to possibilities that we haven't thought about. And isn't that what sci-fi is all about ?The second key message is that if we get second chances to redo our relationships, to try harder to reach the people we love and should reach, then we should do it. Not only that, but we allow more time to spend with them because the work will always be there.I took these messages to heart especially in these turbulent times where somebody we take for granted to be there day in day, will not be.Like Curly's (in City Slickers) one answer to life which is whatever it means to you, K-Pax's ending is whatever it means to you (Stop reading here if you dont want the spoiler or my interpretation). In my eyes, Prot went searching for someone to take care of his friend Robert Proctor, assumed his body to do so. After his long search, he finally found someone (Jeff Bridges) that he could entrust the care of his friend to. Someone who wouldn't just roll him into a corner and stick IVs into him just to keep him alive. And when he found the person for the job, he went home.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the surface K-Pax is a feel good movie, however the directors do a good job of masking the underlying aspects of Kevin Spacey's character.I spent the first half of the movie toggling between whether or not his character could really be from the planet K-Pax. In the end the audience is still left with a myriad of possibilities of his true identity.Bridges character brings a passionate element to his role as his obsession grows and his doubts slowly erode away, yet he continues to maintain his professional objectivity. Spacey is perfect for the role as his witty one liners are a staple through out the entire movie.As to the criticisms of this movie from a technical and clinical perspective, don't most of us go to the cinema to be entertained and as a form of escapism? In the end whether or not you believe he could be an alien, you are left with the sense that whatever his true mission was it was certainly accomplished. A door is left open for a sequel on this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I keep hearing people saying that they didn't understand the ending or that they waited the whole movie to find out the truth about Prot and then were disappointed in the end. This movie is meant to parallel real life, there are mysteries that we will never know for sure the answer to. This is what makes life interesting! If we knew all the answers then we would stop wondering and when that happens then aren't we basically dead? This movie was so original in that it didn't do the typical Hollywood thing of telling all the little "children" (viewers) in the end how things are. We are left to make up our own mind. And that is what we need more of today, people using there own minds instead of waiting for an answer to be given to them. I guess you've gathered by now that I loved this movie! I thought Kevin Spacey was excellent. Some viewers I guess cannot handle knowing that it is possible for a grown man to have an emotional outburst of pain ... when I went to see this movie, a girl actually laughed hysterically at this very scene. Are people so closed that they have to laugh to hide the fact that they might be affected by this type of emotion! The only thing and it's a small thing that bugged me in this movie was the very "Hollywood" portrayal of a mental institution. I don't want to sound cruel but I don't think that in real life that all the people in a mental hospital would be so easily loveable with just a few laughable quirks. I am sure it is much more complicated then that. This movie has it all, humour, drama, mystery and a mind opening question that you the viewer is left to decide. Viewers should feel gratitude to the makers of this movie for not assuming that we are so simple minded that we need a Hollywood movie to answer all of our questions in life. If you want to be left with something to think about and also be entertained, go see this movie!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's start out by establishing that this movie was good, not great. Instead of jumping to everything, I'll break my review into categories.Summary: Dr. Mark Powell tries to understand and help a mental patient who may be a distraught and crazy man, or in fact an alien from K-PAX. Throughout the story, we try to piece the clues together and find out who Prot really is.Acting: Both Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges both give fantastic performances (Spacey's is Oscar-worthy.)Plot: Interesting, but drags at times.Technical Details: The movie appears rather dark because of the bad lighting. The direction is quite like the movie: good, not great.Overall, I would recommend this movie highly. I quite enjoyed it. This isn't a Best Picture, but it's good for a Saturday night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed K-PAX. I went in expecting a sci-fi movie, but it's really a drama with sci-fi undertones. Everyone in the comments are griping about the portrayal of mental patients, or the implausibility of an alien not knowing what a family is, or the fact that the ending gives no closure.Hello! It's a movie! It's Hollywood, therefore screenwriters/directors/producers are GOING to take creative liberites with reality.I found it extremely compelling. Throughout the movie, you don't really know if Prot is an alien. The movie explains that he sees ultra-violet, yet he has flashbacks (under hypnosis) about his life in New Mexico. Many people think that the screenwriters were runnign out of ideas. I think that they did it so that we need to draw our OWN conclusions about Prot.But what I really want to know is... where did Bess go? :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an excellent movie. If you look at the movie for what it is, then you should agree. Ignore the inaccurate portrayal of the science of Psychology. Ignore any political or religious statements made in this movie. These things are not integral to the theme or plot of the movie. If you think the theme is too soft or cliche, then maybe you should have paid more attention. The film was aimed at you. Personally, I thought it was an excellent idea to place an alien in our midst to make the cliche observations about the human condition.Seeing things as they are or should be can be alienating, so finding a fault in the delivery is understable. One comment someone made struck me. Someone had mentioned that if had walked away enlightened, I may not be a frequent visitor to the realm of reality. Carpe Diem is not a new concept to me. But the delivery of this theme in this movie is fresh and yes, enlightening. I walk away from this film reminded that I do not live in the realm of reality frequently enough. The reality that our time is short, "get it right the first time."If you are looking for a thoughtful film, go see this. Wait for Star Wars Episode II, if you want Sci-Fi.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A couple of things kept popping into my mind while I watched this movie that I just couldn't shake no matter how hard I tried. One was that almost everytime I saw Jeff Bridges in a close up I couldn't get over how much he's looking more and more like his father. Maybe that distracted me a little more than it should have and I missed what was suppose to make this movie more than it was, but damn, some of his facial expressions are just like his Dad. Anyway, the other one was the use of light throughout the film. In one scene you're bathed in it, and in another it might just be a speck on someone's cheek, but there are some very interesting ways in which light, or the absence of it, is used in almost every scene.Another interesting twist to me was the way in which Kevin Spacey's performance as prot, was reminiscent of the Jeff Bridges character in Star Man. The way he stood, and walked, and would sometimes crook his head was a low key version of the way Bridges played the alien.One last thing. I took my son (12) with me to see this and he was very disappointed. I think he was looking for more action than was there. This is more of an adult drama that the trailers led either of us to believe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can think of but one word to describe "K-Pax"- "Wow!" The cinematography, the characters, the script, the acting... it is all so amazing! I loved the way the movie played with light. I loved the symbolism, I loved the technical stuff, I just plain loved this movie period. Let's start with the plot. It was enticingly interesting, and most importantly, very different and original (I thought). The best thing about it, however, was not it's character development, it's witty dialogue, or it's techno babble, but the fact that it left so much open to interpretation. This is a movie that makes you think, that makes you "look at the world differently." It doesn't cram things down your throat for you to regurgitate later, but it lets you take it all in, and digest it over time- coming to your own conclusions. As for the cinematography- fabulous! It was almost as if you could feel the light on your face through the screen. There are so many interesting angles, so many manipulations, rainbows, interesting close-ups, different view-points, fresh takes on what we so often take for granted. Simply wonderful. Then there is the acting! Kevin Spacey, you are a god! Such emotion, such passion. You can tell these actors really cared about their characters and really wanted to do them justice. (I think I've found a new role model for my acting goals.) This movie is a definite winner- whether you like your movies mysterious, sci-fi, fantasy-minded, or dramatic, this movie has it all. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As an aspiring actor, i hate Spacey because he's TOO good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was so wonderfully acted, that i cannot begin to say how much i loved it: the deadpan/overflow of emotions of Spacey, the never quite sure what he believes Bridges, and all the members of the hospital. Spacey rose the bar on acting this time around. and if the world meets this new level of skill, then it's truly going to weed out the pretenders and bring the whole acting industry up a notch, at least.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is Kevin "Spacey"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview> Hi- Well for a lot of people this movie wasn't good enough or something, I don't even know (If you ask me, people nowadays expect WAY too much from movies, even though there are some very good ones that haven't gotten too much recognition, like A.I. and Hearts in Atlantis) Anyways, K-PAX may very well be one of those movies. But me?, I really enjoyed this. It was entertaining and kept my interest throughout the whole movie and the acting was definitely one of the year's best and there should definitely be a lot of OSCAR TALK about K-PAX. Kevin Spacey is such a great actor and this is proof. He is so genuine in this role that I kept thinking "There is no way this guy is human."Thanks. Oh yeah, you should see this movie. Thanks for reading my review.Take Care.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not too shabby</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was a lot better then I was expecting. I really enjoyed the story. The only thing I despised about the movie was the choppy little shots that were just thrown into the movie. One point the characters are out in a backyard and there are all these quick shots of flowers, the swing, and other elements. It was like the movie was trying to be more high brow. This parts are easily overlooked or forgotten about, so they didn't take too much away from the movie.It really was enjoyable. I don't know if I would watch it again, but I'm not disappointed I spent $8.25 to see it this time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>K-Pax is a good movie that is at times a bit too heavy handed in sending the theme to the audience. Spacey was good, but not great. I won't hold it against him. The endearing characters are the other patients in with Prot.I recommend that you see this movie with an open mind, and a willingness to take a small lecture.On a side note, the trailer for Royal Tannenbaums played before the movie. The packed theatre didn't laugh once. Not a good sign.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I think this film completely &amp; beautifully ignores the "Hollywood formula" that most well-funded movies of today are...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was well written and the acting is very strong. I think it succeeds in not following one of those usual "formulas" from Hollywood films and employs unique cinematographic and audio techniques to add to its mystique. It is very interesting subject matter and a very unpredictable storyline. I am always floored by Kevin Spacey's acting skills. He is outstanding in his profession. The only complaint I have of this well-done film is the lack of clarity in the end as to what exactly happened. I realize that it is a technique in itself to not have extreme and crystal-clear endings in films, but this one could be a little more spelled out. Overall, this one is a must see!</fullReview>

Mostly by the facets of Kevin Spacey's talent, it seems he has so much in him to give and he is able to transform himself into characters of such depth and reality. Jeff Bridges was captivating as the therapist. I am not going to tell anyone about the film but just that I am always interested in anything Kevin Spacey puts his touch on. I will see it again.

The whole movie is amazing, but it's a few of the moments that really get to you. Prot's line after a doctor telling him that he only knows of nine planets in the milky way, "Actually there's ten", is a sure fire make you think line. Spacey's portrayal of the different ages of Robert during the hypnosis scenes is simply amazing (Especially from an actors point of view), and the use of reflecting light throughout the movie will amaze you.***MAJOR Spoiler***In my beliefs, the end of the movie reveals that Spacey is an alien spirit who was embodied in Roberts body after the tragedy that happened in his life. After helping Robert come to peace with himself, he leaves his body, and takes part of Robert with him, taking the mental patiet as well.That's just me...***NO MORE SPOILERS***This movie was completely awesome, and if it weren't for the guy whining about his wife a row away from me, would have been a perfect movie outing... DEFINATELY go see this. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film, worth your time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was able to see an advance screening of K-PAX at my college. A free Sneak Preview is always good, but this time we had the added bonus that we actually saw a damn good movie.[MILD SPOILERS] Kevin Spacey impresses me yet again here with his portrayal of the character Prot. The acting is so good that at the end of the film, you can honestly question yourself whether he really is an alien, or merely a deranged mental patient. It is almost entirely to the credit of Spacey's interpretation of Prot that allows you to not be sure of the 'right' answer.Playing Prot's straight man is Jeff Bridges, as the psychiatrist assigned to help Prot realize that he is a human being. Bridges character of Mark is as down-to-earth as you can get, and a very comfortable opposition to the more 'out there' character of Prot.Perhaps the best part of the film is how it is all tied together, without strictly giving an answer. Seemingly un-important details near the beginning are given relevance near the end, and yet the big question of "Is he or isn't he?" is left up to the imagination of the movie-goer.In summary, K-PAX is well worth your time, and will be nominated for at least a few Oscars when the time comes, I'm sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A surprisingly refreshing and uplifting film. K-Pax is, without a doubt, one of my favorite films this year. I had the privelage of seeing it as a sneak preview here at CWRU.I am writing this now in a state of utter contentment and happiness. This is one film that will help restore my faith in mainstream American cinema. The plot felt somewhat familiar, but still intrigued me, the characters were interesting and the performances fantastic (in fact, Spacey deserves at least an Oscar nod for this performance). What really blew me away, though, was the cinematography. The camera seemed to play with the light in the most interesting and thought provoking ways. The film and the theme helped to showcase this fact wonderfully. I don't think I'll really ever look at a prism the same way.Visually interesting, emotionally moving and heart-warming, this is a film worth seeing in the theaters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to the Sneak Preview on Oct. 18th and was expecting more than the previews had led me to believe. I was not let down but noticed the film was a cross between One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Phenomenon and one scene from Arlington Road. The script, while similar to the films I listed above, was fresh and fast-paced with witty dialogue and philosophical revolutionary ideas. This is a film that every Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges fan will love! With light violence and little language(1 F- word)I highly recommend watching this as soon as it hit's the theater. I give it a 8 and 1/2 out of 10. You will not be disappointed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extraordinary film that mixes genres Drama. Science fiction. Fantastic. Intrigue.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Masterpiece of the genre, a great Spacey, for me his best role, Bridges in a splendid performance, and a great script, make every moment of the film not expect any surprises. Its biggest drawback might be an ending that does not convince the majority, as it is of those who come to the soul when the movie ends and you stay in the seat reflecting on the film in the first place, and the meaning of life. The extraordinary soundtrack adds those touches that make great leap tears at certain times.This film is an intense reflection about deepening capacity within people, is a whole litany of philosophical and existential doubts that anyone can raise the duration dedicating the film to look beyond Kevin Spacey glasses.It is definitely a great team (directors, screenwriters, actors) all contribute their bit to make this film, one of those tiny grains of sand containing so enormous that unbalance any scale.It is an excellent film, where good soundtrack music, interesting lighting and a dash addictive, make this film a really interesting film. Is Science Fiction? You have to see it to know how far we can carry that dream world where we believe there is life on other planets without special effects.The eternal question is whether this movie "Prot" actually came from K-PAX or was a crazy more. His knowledge of astrophysics was overflowing and knowledge to reach the hearts of the people even more. The answer is left to the viewer to complete the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Your produce alone has been worth the trip".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I finished watching this film with my wife and daughter, I was surprised to hear their reaction. They both believed Prot (Kevin Spacey) was an alien. Not only that, but they WANTED him to be an alien. I couldn't help it, but my reaction to that, because I'm in the midst of watching and reviewing the original Star Trek episodes in order on this board, was 'Fascinating'.When I first saw this film during it's original theatrical release, I recall being somewhat let down by it's conclusion. The story seemed to have what I considered a contrived ending. Watching it once again now, I have a wiser and deeper appreciation for the character of Prot, the shattered Robert Porter who subsumed his identity following the trauma of losing his family and exacting a revenge totally inimical to his true nature. Kevin Spacey is eerily brilliant in his portrayal of Prot, with a calmness of spirit and purpose that comes across as not only realistic, but oddly comical when the situation calls for it.All that considered, one still requires a certain leap of faith to make the picture work. I'm thinking here of Prot's ability to precisely pin point the location of K-Pax to the satisfaction of the scientists. There's no way to explain a million to one shot like that in the course of every day events. And of course, there's no way to explain the disappearance of Bess. Yet, the three tasks given Howie (David Patrick Kelly) were a wonderful sub-text to carry the picture forward, and brilliant in it's simplicity. Particularly that last one - 'stay here and be prepared for anything'. Isn't that the best advice any one of us can have?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very pleasant surprise with two terrific performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few actors can play off-the-wall quite as well as Kevin Spacey. On the one hand he's the most 'normal' looking of actors but then there is always that smile that says 'I know more than you do', the intonation in the voice that says 'I have a secret' and eyes that seem to look right through you. So when in this movie he says he's an alien from the Planet K-Pax you don't rush to disbelieve him; at least the psychiatrist assigned to his case doesn't. The premise is, of course, totally ludicrous yet Iain Softley's film is wholly convincing. I mean, if Kevin Spacey told me I was an alien from the Planet K-Pax I'd probably believe him.This is a classy entertainment, in some respects not too far removed from "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" with Spacey as a kind of Randall P. McMurphy figure whose influence on his fellow patients is considerably more benign and beneficial than that of the doctor's treating them, but in place of Nurse Ratchid we have Jeff Bridges' kindly psychiatrist, and Bridges is superb. There is something wonderfully grounded about him. He is highly intelligent and utterly anchored at the same time, the smart, likable boy-next-door who's made good.Ultimately however it is Spacey's film. It's a genuine tour-de-force, taking a real actor's delight in knowing just how good he is and just how good his material is. He ups the ante on what is already a first-rate film and if the final revelations err a little too much on the predictable at least the journey to them is worthwhile and finally very moving.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie is a lot better than the title</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"K-PAX". What kind of title for a movie is "K-PAX"? I'll tell you what: if you were to judge movies based upon their title, then this movie would have been a bust. Nothing about this movie seemed to appealing from outside, but once I watched it, I found the movie amazingly good. Kevin Spacey did a wonderful job as Prot, a psyche hospital patient convinced that he is from another planet. Spacey does a great job at playing rather quiet and introspective characters.The script was very well written, and it left one to continually guess what was really true: was Prot an alien, or had he suffered a mental breakdown. Either way, Prot provided enlightenment and changed the lives of all he came in contact with. Throughout the movie you are hoping for an answer to the enigma that is Prot, but quite impressively the movie ends with leaving it up to the viewer. This was a surprisingly creative and touching movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kevin Spacey plays a man who is a patient at a psychiatric hospital in New York City and who claims to be from another planet. In the research they did in several mental institutions, in order to make this movie, one of the questions Spacey would ask the staff was if they had anybody there who believed they come from another planet. It seemed that this belief was not uncommon because their answer would be there were like a dozen of them believers. Jeff Bridges plays the psychiatrist, whose job it is to try to determin whether he is a patient who is suffering from some kind of amnesia, whether he's had some kind of trauma, whether he's a multiple personality, delusional, exceptional ... On some level the film is about what happens when you encounter a stranger who has some rather extraordinary effect on all the other people around him. It is also a mystery where it keeps going back and forth between this question of "is he?" or "isn't he?", "could he be?", "possibly?", "no not?". It manages to walk this fine line right up to the end of the film. When doctors or people of science are looking at the facts up front and there's nothing to indicate the thing that the're worried about, for instance suppose someone goes in and they suffer from extreme headachs all the time and you're trying to find some evidence of that but there's nothing to prove that there should be this thing. It turns the situation very mysterious. At first, when Prot says he is an alien from the planet K-PAX, they attribute it to to some kind of psychosis or memory loss, but there's nothing to indicate that. So it rouses the doctors up and it peeks their curiosity because he has the facts of the world where he comes from.This movie is not about science fiction but about the science of humanity. What do we believe is true and what don't we believe is true? How do we begin to understand things that we don't see and things we don't comprehend? How do we categorize things in order to feel safe?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this to be a nearly perfect sci-fi drama. In that genre, it's #2 on my list after Independence Day. Spacey is terrific in this role--very believable. "How many doctors does this planet have?" is one of the choice bits of comedic satire I loved. And after he consumes a banana, peel and all with relish (gusto...not the condiment!), K-Pax's comment about the produce alone being worth the trip still makes me smile years later. The only detraction was the brutality of the murders and resultant catatonic state of the character whose body K-Pax inhabited. But that's only me--I don't like violence. It really is essential for the plot, and certainly not an unrealistic twist. It's a great movie and story.</fullReview>

It had me riveted to the seat and moved almost to tears. Also, add two of my favorite actors, a thick slice of "One flew over the cuckoo's nest" and it's not even a fight to win me over!

		<fullReview>K-PAX for me means Kindling ones Perception in conjunction with the unknown (X factor). It shows how one doesn't really take time to appreciate what is in front of you and you hope for something in your terms to happen. One always keeps looking for the unknown, and for some reason the unknown is not really an unknown. It's in you and you just need to search and find it. Live for today and do things today to make a better and content tomorrow. The movie is sending three messages for us;1&gt; Find Happiness , look for it hard until it stares right back at you.2&gt; Do something for others and yourself that will make a difference in yours and their lives.3&gt; You are here now. Situations may be bad, but that doesn't stop life. Life goes on. Help life to grow with you.The movie is an absolute masterpiece. Its like a fine painting or a classical Symphony. The movie grows on you and you cant help but think " what is it that I have to do with life in our world!!" A must see for movie lovers.Oh boy, Kevin Spacey, I wish the world would really see this actor and give him the appreciation and adulation he truly deserves. This is another one up his sleeve of commendable line up of movies that help shape his future legendary career.Kudos to everyone associated with this film and Thank you for this heart felt effort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say this movie affected me in ways no other has. Kevin brings Prot to life in a way that says to me "this is role perfection". His amazement with the things we have on this planet appears to be truly genuine. His unassuming nature as an otherworlder is genius, and his facial expressions speak volumes and they share a level of honesty not often seen in movies (my opinion, of course). His mannerisms in dealing with people (of this planet) are short, sweet, to the point, and they evince a way of thinking I only wish I could engender more often: Look at the things you have and try to enjoy life more; remember that work is only how you make a living, and family is all-important. His casual witticisms turn out to be lessons in life. So often movies start with a premise they want to get across, and they struggle through two hours trying to get a single point across (if there is one to start with). Kevin in K-PAX gets some of the most basic ideas across without even trying, and you actually REMEMBER them! (example: "Every being in the universe knows right from wrong, Mark."). One of my most favorite scenes in the move is is when he talks to and plays with Dr. Powell's dog, Shasta. His actions are so genuine and it just looks like he's having a great time playing with this dog!! There are just so many excellent moments in K-PAXIf I had only one thing to say about this movie, it would be simply to thank Kevin Spacey for the experience. Of the 700 movies in our collection at home, there are only two that I consider to be a true experience. This is one of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like this film. Kevin Spacey is a genius. What can else can I say?It's touching, and brings to light some things about homo sapiens that are really just plain stupid, and for the rest we're left to wonder how we ever ended up like this? Hence we have to consider if anyone in that psychiatry unit is actually 'ill' or just ill-fitting with the rest of society? In other words, is it something wrong with the patients, or something wrong with the world that will not accommodate them? Finally beginning to really see what my psychology teacher, Jon, who is insane as well, was really talking about...Tough question for an aspiring clinical psychologist...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of course this is one of such movies that will never happen for real but I thoroughly enjoy watching it over and over again because I like Kevin Spacey in everything he does and because the music, the philosophy, the use of light make this a movie with a very great sensitivity and that's very relaxing, compared to the too high number of senseless action movies like Matrix. We should have many more of such movies that tell us earthlings a bit about our own world, from the perspective of a far superior civilization. Nice to hear we also have things to envy though. I think I wouldn't really like to live on K-Pax when it's a place where I wouldn't be missed. This is a movie for everyone who'd like to think about what we humans are heading towards in our future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>PROT LIVES!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>****MINOR SPOILERS BELOW**** (don't panic, though, because I'm not giving everything away, but be warned none-the-less)Kevin Spacey (name very appropriate for the film) gives another stellar performance as "Prot," a visitor from a distant planet; who is in reality a normal human who has undergone a massive mental trauma 5 years ago...or is he.You see, this film leaves so many questions unanswered that it makes you question some of the underlying fabric of the movie:How does Prot know about the orbit of planets he could not possibly have seen (if he's human)?How can he communicate with animals in such an apparently believable manner? (Unless he is who he says he is)How could he (if he's just a messed up human) know math that would be well beyond his purview?How is it he manages to "escape" from what looks like a maximum security mental institute? Equally compelling is how he just reappears like nothing happened... ...And what happened to Bess?...Questions left unanswered. My take? Prot was "using" the body of our poor old friend, and left when it was no longer necessary to care for it, because Prot left him in the capable care of professionals that he trusted.So, like Frodo before him, "Prot Lives!" And always will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A role that's tailor made for Kevin Spacey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not suggesting that the role of Prot was in practice written for Kevin Spacey because it's very unlikely so but he most definitely fits in that role like a glove. He's so bloody good playing a bit sarcastic types like this was. Jeff Bridges was of course splendid too, he was surely a wise choice to fill the shoes Doctor Powell. However this was Spacey's film and completely his show. The movie "K-PAX" itself was great but it was just as great as I expected it to be. Part of me wished that it would be something more and it would surprise me in some way but it didn't. Nevertheless, this was a fine movie and it entertains and gives many laughs and smiles. I'll have to recommend it and if you like Spacey this would be a must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes a movie comes out that takes your breath away. This is such a movie, the cast are excellent, Bridges and Spacey scenes alone are worth the price. The visuals with light is mesmerizing, Iain Softly the director did a wonderful job, especially with the lighting, casting and choice of composer for the music. Edward Shearmuir is a great composer. His music blends so well with the abstract of the story line, intensifies at the appropriate tense scenes and just does the job. The story is very cleverly crafted to keep the viewer guessing right until the end and, even then, no definitive answer is given. However I would like to think there are enough clues and signs as the tale unfolds to point to the more extraordinary possibility as being the case. At the end of the day, if aliens really did travel to our planet from great distances, they could only do so by means we cannot even begin to comprehend. Once here, they are more likely to take form or a host which allows them to exist among us, than arrive in V style spaceships.There is a lot to learn from this film (which, although not as detailed as the book, is better that the book for mystery and realism). I loved this film from the start (even the music is excellent); it is a slow, unfolding mystery that manages to install different emotions and feelings within the audience. You don't have to like Sci-Fi to enjoy this film - there is something for everyone in it, and a lot to learn and think about. What we do in life, how we treat people and how we live our lives is the central theme for me. If someone is mad, does that make them less of a person? Does science, medical test and medication have all the answers? Happiness is a road, it is happening now, trap the spark and hold it there, you won't be disappointed. This provoking film is one that will stay with you for a long time after seeing it and is even better the second time.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've always admired Kevin Spacey, and Jeff Bridges is naturally respected. I didn't really know what to expect; was it similar to The Truman show where it seems like it should be really good but I don't know how I feel. The writing is intelligent in that many lines in intense moments make sense and is sometimes so much to take in that it's shocking. However there are other times where the dialogue seems to be too much creating an overstatement on the dramatic effect. This movie seems to have two types of scenes: Dramatic and over dramatic. I also felt like at the beginning, I had to decide if he was or was not really from this planet he says he is from. The good scenes outweigh the bad and all in all I still believe its a film of merit when looking at both Spacey and Bridges' filmography.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nothing to laugh at. Spacey carries this movie and saves it from being a disaster with his physical slapstick. The colors are amazing and seem to follow the mood of the story. The effects are very good for 2001, but this kind of unsentimental character piece needs a tight focus so all of the nuances of said characters shine through. The cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. Spacey's is not the restrained performance that the critics have described.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A subtle and quiet Alien visitation Movie, this one is a charmer. Hampered a bit by some unnecessary sleuthing by the skeptical Psychiatrist that is muddled and confusing. But there is a lot to admire in this slightly offbeat tale of a strange Visitor from another Planet.There is an amount of awe in watching the Stranger in a strange land pointing out Human arrogance ("how many Doctors are on this planet?"). The Shrink also does not take kindly to the Visitor interacting with his Patients even when he seems to help them. Egotistical EarthlingsThis is an unusual Sci-Fi void of SFX and instead includes Philosophical jousting and "What if?" scenarios. It is as touching in parts as it is wonderful. Ultimately a feel good Movie with enough to think about and quite a bit of intrigue. Although some have said that the ending is ambiguous, it isn't. It is as clear as a beam of light.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Quiet But Powerful Sci Fi Fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's Jeff Goldblum in Mr. Frost (1990) who presents an eerie and sinister otherworldly presence, there's Brad Pitt in Meet Joe Black (1998) who plays death, and there's the small boy who grows from a seed in Odd Life of Timothy Green, The (2012). This science fiction/fantasy offers up a unique perspective and character of Kevin Spacey portraying a purported alien from 1000 lights years away. What makes this movie so compelling is that it also is a mystery, a tantalizing puzzle tucked within a mental health venue and the line between reality and fantasy is quite blurred in this movie like displayed in The Fisher King (1991) but even more delightfully so. Along with a ethereal sound track and melody, this nicely off-balance and emotionally touching movie has the audience face up to innocence and the important matters of living using mental health conditions as a backdrop that is respectively acted and performed in a less harsh and dramatic presentation and with perhaps even more redeeming uplifting value than the sci fi classic Twelve Monkeys (1996) or the murder mystery of Shutter Island (2010).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An amazing look at the human psyche, K-Pax put a capital P in neon to the word Poignant. Kevin Spacey played the character Prot exactly as he should have, gentle and warm with just the right amount of satirical wit to draw you to him. I could write a description of the story, but I won't. All I can say is that as the movie draws you to the end I was actually wishing for an ending other than what I knew was coming. You will likely feel the same way, unless there is an empty space where your heart should be, heh heh...In short, you find yourself expecting the end to play out as it does, yet at the same time you don't expect it at all. All through the movie Prot helps the many other patients in the mental hospital, in ways that confound and amaze the professionals. One, a young Black woman, Bess, either won't or cannot talk through much of the story, due to the traumatic loss of her home in a fire. She has a few lines later on, but it isn't so much the dialog that grabs you. It is the realization at the end that she has somehow overcome her inner demons. All the patients look into her empty room, bed all made neatly. One says something to the effect that "She has gone to K-Pax". That moment, for me, crowned the story. But it does not diminish the rest of the story at all. Rather it validates every minute of the movie. Even though we find out at the end what we already knew, that Prot is just as human as the rest of us......you will not be able to keep from wishing Prot well on his trip back to K-Pax!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thought provoking movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>K-pax was a captivating film. Prot is played by Kevin spacey. The main question that weaves itself through the whole film and one that the doctor played by Jeff bridges tries to answer in the film. Is Prot a space alien or is he just mentally unstable, and Jeff must find out by the time Prot is supposedly to depart from Earth. The more the movie progresses the more it seems like either could be true. The ability he has to map where his planet is where no human has the ability dumbfounds experts. He has therapy sessions when he is under hypnosis start to bring up more real human traumatic and devastating events. We start to wonder how he can have these personality abnormalities. The end of the movie still shows a sense of being ambiguous and still you wonder what happened. The director shows with great skill to stay in the shadows and brings out strong performances from the actors. This doesn't mean that he is any less of a director to let the actors be. He delivers a power by being subtle and unobtrusive. Kevin Spacey shows his abilities as an actor by acting cool and logical as Prot one scene and then can easily switch to a more tormented personality next. He makes both alter egos believable and makes us the viewer with a more difficult job of trying to figure out which he really is. We then are left with Jeff who is excellent and becomes obsessed with trying to find out who the real Prot is. K-Pax shows us that life is contains of infinite possibilities, some of them are know others remain a mystery. With the vast unknown who are we to say what exists or what is possible. Who are we to say what exists or even what is certain. Both of these are looked into in a story in a individuals journey that is both strange and dramatic that challenges ones logic. All of these unanswered questions challenge Dr. Powell's nature. Powell has to know the truth get cant get it out of his mind and with the truth can set his own mind free. With this being a very thought provoking film that continues to challenge us by keeping the mystery on who the real Prot is and reflecting on what is possible. This is a must see movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay so this film to me deserves a 10 out of 10 as it ticks every box of what I want from a film which is:A great soundtrack. Lovely compositions when filming to exaggerate the mood/feel of the film.Outstanding acting - Honestly Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges are INCREDIBLE!! Not to forget the other actors at all, so much talent from every person.Interesting plot line and left wondering what the ending meant - This film makes you think! In a great way, it's a really interesting story, raising lots of questions and offering you as the viewer a delightful challenge.Emotional attachment to the characters - Oh, do I cry? How much do I cry? Every single time... I'm sure not many other people do... but for me the ending feels so sad to me. I can't tell if it's because of the ending, or if it's because I'm aware an amazing film is ending, or if it's that I won't see the characters again until I press "play" again.A lot of people say they prefer Kevin Spacey in The Usual Suspects. I love the Usual Suspects and I thought he was fantastic in that film also, however I don't really feel like you can compare his acting too much. He is a very convincing mentally ill patient in this film. He can play many different roles within the film and honestly I couldn't imagine anyone playing the part of Prot any better.I honestly recommend this film to anybody who wants something more REAL to watch. Although it leaves an odd question at the end, the whole film feels so real. The characters feel so real and down to earth. It is not a film where you go "Ah what are the chances of that?". The soundtrack is incredible also, suits the film very well and adds to the mood.It also has some simple but clever humour based around the storyline as well, just adding to the attachment of the film.Please watch this film, especially if you enjoy more psychological based films and want something refreshing and different to watch.</fullReview>

It is not "dumbed down" for Hollywood's sake.

		<fullReview>Ultimately, the movie may puzzle audiences more than entertain them. It shows signs of intelligent life. It tries to frighten us into doing the right thing by declaring that there is no grace, no forgiveness, and no escape from our lives once we are done living. This movie is the best I've seen in a while. It really made me think, instead of all those horrible action/car/romance movies that's just full of stereotypical bull crap. I loved this work of art, and no review can take that away from me. When a new patient is brought to a mental institution claiming to be an inhabitant of a planet called K-PAX, the hospital seems just the place for him. Yet, except for certain otherworldly abilities, the "alien," he, appears to be perfectly sane. In taped therapy sessions he is asked about life on K-PAX - its lifestyle, principles, foods, language. He paints a consistent and credible portrait of a glorious utopia painfully unlike our own and yet so possible, could we only erase from human nature its greed and cruelty. It becomes easy, even desirable, to believe in his identity and homeland. But he insists that he must return home. As his announced date of "departure" approaches, staff and patients alike are thrown into turmoil: If he is mad, what will happen when the fateful day arrives? If K-PAX is for real...please, may they come along too?</fullReview>

Ending doesn't seem to have much role in the movie, though it makes the point that KS was really an Alien life-form, which was also quite clear in the mid of movie when he astonishes the astrophysicists with his knowledge of twin star system and planet K-PAX.Gives plenty to think about.

		<fullReview>I was skeptical when i sat down to watch this. Many of Kevin Spaceys performances for post-American Beauty seem to be repetitive. I was wrong. This film had a nice contemporary feel with a smooth narration that brings you from beginning to end. As a film, it asks the question "What do you believe?". Most films of these types (i.e.-"Signs" and "Agnes Of God") usually have a hard time backing themselves up with proper explanation or motives. This one is more like "Agnes Of God" in that you can two ways with the ending. The story is simple, a man is found in the Big Apple, claiming to be an alien. Kevin Spacey, however, is a naturally gifted actor, and he seems vulnerable, yet resistant to the world which he is allegedly visiting. Jeff Bridges has a terrific sense of conflict, and as a man working in an environment as strange as the Manhatten Psychiatric Hospital, he seems rather suttle and in control. The film has a deep focus on the effect of all Spaceys' "Prot" touches. More so a psychological look at wounded people, not just the main characters, but the lesser seen ones too. Film Highlight: An intense hypnosis scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!!!Very good narrative, if somewhat conventional with the almost now clichéd ambiguous ending, the film gives evidence for both Prot's alien and human existence. Many of the twists are ever-so-slightly unbelievable but not enough to ruin the movie, thanks to all round good acting from the cast. I believe only Jeff Bridges under-performs, not to say he was bad, but not up to his usual standard. The film is not a typical sci-fi film as it deals with a lot of drama; there is not a great amount of action (no flying saucers or laser guns to be found here!), more a thinker than anything else. As i said before, the ending is confusing, somewhat of a cliffhanger as seems to have become the norm. If you're into this genre of film, definitely worth checking out and even if you're not, I still recommend a viewing if you catch it on TV.</fullReview>

OK, I admit that I haven't read the book but the film itself, although leaving lots of little pointers and red herrings, did tend to make me feel that the central character was just human. HOWEVER ! It was just so superbly crafted, acted and filmed that I did not care what genre it fell into. If "Sci-Fi" films were this good, I might count myself a SF fan.It is a lovely film - Whatever you can say about the Hollywood film "industry", this is what they do best.

The characters are good, with very attractive personality of Mark Powell who is extremely dedicated to his profession, thus getting you involved in the investigation process.

		<fullReview>K-PAX it's a movie that is not very common nowdays. Prot (Kevin Spacey) is a strange person that was sending to a psychiatric hospital. Dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges) is chosen to take care of this man. When Dr. Mark Powell try to "help" Prot, he discover that Prot it's a hard one. He has answer for everything that the good doctor send to him. Dr. Mark star to have some doubts about Prot if he is or not a human being. His knowledge about astronomy and others related subjects, impressed Dr. Mark. The question if Prot is or not an alien, is a focus in this movie. In my opinion he is a alien but i believe that are many people that disagree. I have some reasons to believe that Prot is an alien, but this a good point in this movie an open final. Moore, i believe that Prot for some strange reason is also a psychiatrist and try to help several people including the Dr. Mark. This movie has a focus in Jeff Bridges and Kevin Spacey with good performances (specialy Kevin). Some similarities can be found in Don Juan de Marco but this movie is superior.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SpoilersNursing a rather bad cold on a Sunday afternoon, I dug out the disc of K-Pax I bought quite some time ago but hadn't had time yet to watch. This turn out to be a wise decision. The movie took the attention away from a body somewhat drained by sneezes and a running nose, allowing me to be absorbed in a two-hour escapade. It was a soothing experience.I did not bother to question whether an asylum can really be such a heavenly place as depicted in the movie. Maybe reality is much closer to what we see in `One flew' which clearly attained a higher artistic achievement. In that particular afternoon, however, I needed some gentle warmth and K-Pax supplied it in general doses. The patients are wonderful. Doctor Powell (Jeff Bridges) is wonderful. The alien (purportedly, and open-endedly) Prot (Kevin Spacey) is more than wonderful. That is quite enough for me. Neither did I bother to determine which is the main theme of the movie: the asylum? the dedicated doctor? the suspense and the twist? benevolent aliens? all of the above? I wasn't particularly concerned. Close to the end, I did find the story of Prot's alternative existence Porter's story rather contrived. In fact, any tragedy will do. Still, the entire movie went down very smoothly. Last, but not least, putting Spacey and Bridges together is close to a guarantee of something that will be worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly, for all who haven't seen this movie yet, watch it. Unless you are a 100% blonde, you might not like it, but it makes one think in a way that puts a smile in your face and inspires you like none other. Unique moments in the film, makes you think of ones own past and gives extra motivation to fulfill ones goals.Anyway, this is what I think happens, there is an alien who takes over Robert's body, while still having a presence of roberts subconcious within. Its like a mixture of Robert and the alien taking over the body.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You've probably already gotten the gist of the story from the other comments. And it isn't a bad movie at all. Kevin Spacey is in a few ways a lot like the other characters he plays in movies like American Beuty and The Usual Suspects...very sober and pensive. However, another similarity I noticed and which I haven't found in too many other comments is the similarity with the general setting of One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest...mental institution, patient comes in and enamors and fascinates the other patients around him giving them hopes of getting out and having a better life again...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>PERCEPTION</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have not seen the film then dont read on because there are possible spoilers ahead.............. I have read the other postings about the film and the discussion over whether Prot was really an alien or just a mentally ill person. To me, the film was about perception. But, here is where it is very clever...its not just the perception of those who encounter Prot within the film but the audience as well. Like Mulholland drive, the audience is left with many questions. Was Prot an alien? Was he an alter ego of Kevin Porter, that by his very nature of being alien meant he did have to deal with the extreme emotions that Kevin would experience? After all, would an alien have any perception of emotions such as sadness or anger? Why was Bess chosen over the other guy who had the three tasks to complete...what was special about her? But more importantly, was the film about the Doctor helping Prot or the way Prot helped the Doctor? We are shown the facts yet there is still some doubt left and this is what makes K-PAX a great film. Many films lead the audience to a specific conclusion, which leaves little room for any discussion afterwards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kevin Spacey again picks a winner with K-PAX, an endearing movie that expresses profound revelations at human existence via the Prot character's naive, yet at the same time unquestionably wise, point of view.It's enjoyable trying to work out 'if he is or he isn't' as the plot expands and the Robert Porter character gets fleshed out. However some may find the ending a little unsatisfying but in reality it couldn't have been any other way.My few issues with the film revolve around the rather cartoony and over simplified portrayal of mental patients. I was surprised because the films plot shows a great deal of intelligence and I don't feel it would have lost anything by being more honest regarding how people with mental health problems behave.That said, I realise this was a movie and not a documentary and the film itself is exquisitly shot and the story unwraps at a pleasing rate. Bridges is great and Spacey delivers a languid and relaxed performance, more like a stand-up than an alien.A good film that will get you talking with your friends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is good stuff. Spacey is convincing as an alien because his acting skills so white dwarf everyone around him, that he appears to be from another planet in most films. This director LOVES extreme facial close-ups, which when overdone in cinema remind me too much of an Anacin commercial. To the point, Mrs. Howard Stern looks way too warty on these shots, and I found myself looking away. Also what was with the raccoon eye shadow on all the chicks? Was it supposed to be significant or just real bad make-up work? I suspect the latter. Another troubler was the use of biblical names, Sara, Rachel, Rebecca, which I know were meant to be allegorical, but just went over my head. Lets see raccoon eyes, biblical names...no i still don't get it. All that nonsense said, I think this was a good movie. Its not easy to make a film where the question of fantasy or reality is not decided. To me thats what makes most Stephen King stuff so lame. You present a a completely normal story and then release the supernatural junk and ask the audience to accept the paranormal occurrences as normal. KPax leaves these questions unanswered throughout, very cleverly I think. Interesting, I believe this was Jeff bridges last picture before his breast reduction surgery. Nice Rack!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nice way to pass a little time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You have probably seen every element of this film before. It seems to have been assembled out of spare parts, but that does not make it bad -- just ordinary. Here is an unchallenging, very competently made story of a man who might be insane, and might be -- as he claims -- an alien. There is evidence for both possibilities, presented as a series of cliches. Try "The amazing knowledge that stuns scientists", which the scientists don't bother to follow up. Or what about "The gentle inmate who cheers up the other cute and interesting patients in the psychiatric ward". Or "The psychiatrist who takes the patient home to play with his children". Spacey and Bridges walk through the whole film virtually deadpan, Spacey mostly wearing dark glasses. Any two actors could have done an equal job, although Bridges looks somewhat too old and there has to be a little explanation of why his wife is so much younger. If you like gentle sci-fi, injury-free hospital dramas, and a film that does not rely on stunts, special effects or sex to keep it going, its a nice way to pass the time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I avoided this movie for a while. I thought it was better than usual Hollywood fare, but it wasn't exactly ground breaking. I was entertained. Frankly I am not sure where the mystery lies in the ending. It's pretty obvious that Mr. Porter lost his mind and Prot beamed into him like some Quantum Leap episode. Basically he used Porter's body as a host until he beamed away leaving Porter a broken shell of a man. This is why he remained at the hospital because he knew Porter would need help. My main problem was with Spacey. I think he's an awesome actor and was far more impressed with him under hypnosis than the bland sometimes creepy Prot. For example he really reminded me of his character in SEVEN. I kept waiting for him to murder his fellow patients. It had some good ideas which apparently it stole from some other south American film. I will need to check that out as I rarely take anyone's word on anything. It is a movie you can watch with your family. I was impressed that they didn't have him using any alien powers to wow and amaze. It sort of reminded me of Highway to Heaven. Landon's character did use powers once in a while but mostly used the power of compassion and concern. I think in an effort to show that you don't have to be unearthly to make a difference.</fullReview>

The movie should be entertaining, it should surprise me and last but not least....afterwards...put my brains at work. Being ''OPEN MINDED'' is what my mom calls it.After reading the book ''Conversations With God'' and watching Artificial Intelligence, over a period of 2 weeks, I entered the world of a K-PAX-ian.First of all, this is NOT a great movie. Why did I sat out the whole thing? Because Spaceys answers to all the questions they shot at him, only in the first part of the movie, almost had me grabbing a pencil and my notebook.-Did K-Pax entertain me? It succeeded...The interaction between Spacey and Bridges is very interesting and enjoyable. (''Have A Seat''?) -Did it susprise me? Not really...I had the feeling that Hollywood would come up with this ending. The story itself gave little room for anything else. -Did it put my mind to work? Hell yes it did.....Spacey did just that for the first part of the movie. After that I kinda knew that Hollywood would have a hard time finding a proper ending for this flick. They failed.The sequel should be titled...''Conversations With Spacey''.Prot:---"Class B, Early Stage of Evolution, Future Unknown"----. I read a concept like this in the ''Conversations With God''.But overall? 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I watched this movie I could not help but be reminded of "The Prince Of Tides". That film too had a close doctor/patient relationship trying to sort out someone's mental state. Aside from the fact that the doctor &amp; patient (Barbra Streisand/Nick Nolte) were romantically involved in "The Prince Of Tides" &amp; Nolte's sister was actually Streisand's patient first who he was trying to help, there are similarities in both films. Both doctors take a special interest in their patients &amp; are determined to find out the devastating family tragedies that caused the states their in. Kevin Spacey is good as the sunglassed patient/"visitor" from the planet K-pax &amp; Jeff Bridges, as the doctor, looks like he wishes he were someplace else. Mary McCormack ("Private Parts") is the typical wife/mom character. The sci-fi twist is thrown in to make a movie that isn't very new or innovative a little more interesting.</fullReview>

He walks into the lives of people around him, leaving greater impact on their lives than other people. He shows the greatest astrophysicists the US can provide parts of the universe that they have never seen.Yet his shrink, played in his normal style by Jeff Bridges, refuses to commit to the fact that Prot is in fact a K-Paxian.And still in the end you're left to do your own conclusions with no particular help from any of the characters in the movie.Solid movie to watch and good movie to think about, afterwards.[EOF]</fullReview>

Prot (Spacey) actually gives such details on the solar system and location of K-Pax and when he even starts to heal people, I really didn't know what to believe. A very intense movie that keeps you alert with every detail. An intriguing end really left me speechless, so if you're a non-believer, see if you can figure your way out of this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed Kevin Spacey in American Beauty, and he is no less spectacular in K-Pax, even though the story line is lacking a certain something, and has a few too many simple solutions. Overall, however, the movie is enjoyable.The plot seems to be just enough to sustain the movie, however, its weaknesses are readily available if you care to ponder them. There is little room for character development, especially in the case of Jeff Bridges (Dr. Mark Powell)...you basically have to take what you get. And I felt that mental development of a few characters is much to coincidental to be realistic.As with many of Kevin Spacey's movies, its likely to be more enjoyable if you clear your mind of all expectations, and simply watch the movie with an open mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great title, reminiscent of `THX 1138' from George Lucas. However, although this might sound like another science fiction movie - which initially put off my wife ? this is an earth-bound tale devoid of special effects. Kevin Space, as a character called Prot, is either a visitor from a planet called K-PAX who can travel faster than the speed of light or someone very seriously mentally ill with complex and detailed delusions. Assigned to find out is Jeff Bridges as Dr Mark Powell who ? on his own admission ? becomes too deeply involved in the mystery.Spacey, an actor with an ?otherworldliness' about him and a surname to match, is utterly believable as the benevolent and insightful alien with a consuming taste for fruit. Of course, Bridges has been here before and performs well as the doctor who often cares more about his patients than his family. He was himself a visitor from outer space in `Starman' and he was a psychiatrist again in `Vanilla Sky'. Indeed so well cast are the two that it's hard to imagine that originally Spacey was going to be the shrink and Will Smith was slated to be the spaceman.There are some good lines (`I've got a light beam to catch'), but unfortunately it all looks rather familiar. The idea of a man with seemingly magic powers was done in `Phenomenon' and the cathartic revelations in the psychiatrist's office is straight out of `The Prince Of Tides'. Although there is much sentimentally, the ending is uncharacteristically down-beat and ? unless you're like me and watch all the credits ? you'll miss a tiny scene at the very end of this particular rainbow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>K-PAX is another one of those movies that try to make you think outside your world. The "What If..." scenario seems to go over well with audiences nowadays. Atleast it did with me. I found K-PAX to be an inspiring piece of filmmaking. It was nice. It didn't have much violence (except for one scene) and only one use of strong language. More of a drama than it was a comedy, Jeff Bridges does well as a skeptic mental hospital administrator *POSSIBLE SPOILER* who begins to wonder if a patient named Prot (played smoothly by Kevin Spacey) might actually be from a planet that Prot (pronounced Prote) calls K-PAX. *SPOILERS* Prot has the ability to draw star concelations from memory and other galaxy maps all from his head and claims that he came to Earth on a beam of light. He also says that in a few months he must return to K-PAX. With time running out, Jeff Bridges' character (who's name I forgot) tries to get as much information out of Prot before his time to leave comes. While I found the ending somewhat disappointing, it was still good and as I said, was very different. Kevin Spacey tries to stay all calm and Doug Hutchison like throughout the movie, but during *POSSIBLE SPOILER* a hypnotism scene, he finally breaks down and uses the F word while screaming at Jeff Bridges. I give K-PAX 4/5 because of the different and slightly confusing ending.</fullReview>

I usually really like Jeff Bridges, but his performance was limited by the writing and circumstances for his character. The movie had an interesting "peaceful" vibe about it (for the most part). Hints of "Cuckoo's Nest" appear, but not in as forceful a manner as in that movie. Since I'm a drummer, I'm instituting my new rating of 7 cymbal crashes. Spacey himself is responsible for most of these. See it for his performance.</fullReview>

All I will tell you is that if you're like me and you avoided this film because you saw the trailer and thought "Ugh. Another 'Pay It Forward' shlockfest?", don't worry! Universal did a horrible job of selling this film. I know exactly what the weasels in marketing were thinking. "If we sell it as sci-fi, women won't go. If we sell it as semi-inspirational drama, only women will go." And then Sept. 11 happened. America needed warm-fuzzies. Universal cranked out a trailer that made this look like L. Ron Hubbard meets Deepak Chopra and you couldn't have paid me to see it. Well, I just watched it tonight. Yes, it's inspirational, but more importantly, it's thought-provoking. It gives no easy answers and is not nearly as heavy-handed as I expected. The only people I don't recommend this film for are the very ones who need to see it most.

The material is delivered in such a way that no one can be 100% sure if Spacey is playing a psychotic, a guy from an alien planet, or a guy from k-pax inhabiting the body of a traumatized and repressed man...... although the movie ultimatley leans towards him being an "ill" person, I really want to believe hes an alien. If your a dreamer you might think likewise. On an interesting side note, the last line in the movie is pretty much the same theory I have concerning the universe.

Jeff Bridges turns in fine support as the shrink assigned to Prot (Spacey). Through his sessions with Prot, the doctor is deeply affected by the problems affecting his charge and learns several hard lessons. Through a gently humorous, full story, it presents issues such as love, separation, anger, and helping others and how the characters grapple with them is very involving. The mystery of who Prot really is and what finally happens to him keeps you thinking. Kudos to Bridges, Spacey and all involved for a wonderful movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie, great cast. Weird.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I want to say that this movie must be one of my now all time favourites. It's touching, it's not too long, and it seems to help me ran away from the war outside and see another aspect of life. First for the cast and acting: Kevin Spacey was great as Prot. Wearing those sunglasses did the trick, and it looked as he was looking at the world with a different view. His walk and talk were changed from other movies we have seen him in, like American beauty. Here Spacey is doing a great job as being different, while in American beauty he was an ordinary American living a normal life.One thing that did bother me in him was when we was playing Robert, he was too much like Prot. And the fact that they say it's the same body, it's a different person, and so he should appear. Bad change of character in one movie, while he can change them so well from one movie to the other.Jeff Bridges as Prot's therapist was good. He also did a big change from Dude in The Big Lebowski (1998) . The time when he starts believing reminded me a bit of the matrix. He had to believe to see the change. But even at the end, we see he wasn't totally convinced, his miss of the deported of Prot back to K-PAX was bad. A person who really wants and believes in something so much would never miss anything as important as the leaving of his now friend and alien. The leaving of Bess was as expected as. But did she really leave with him, that was the best part for me. The ending was open, and with that it was so un Hollywood. Now for the photo effects: I think the playing with the lights was great, it really added to the spirit of the movie, and the team of traveling in time was passed. Also the fact that changing with dark and bright added another dimension to the movie.All in all, I had a great time, it wasn't expectable as, it did give you something to think about, and it helped not thinking about life, rather going away to another planet.Go see it, rent it, drive-in it. Fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...for this movie. And when it finally came I was thrilled. Though, now, when I've seen it I might have had too high hopes. Not that the movie wasn't good - because it was - but it could have been better.I read the book several years ago. My mum gave it to me since she liked PROT and she thought that I and him had some similarities. In many ways we probably do. The book made me dream of the world of K-PAX and I really wanted to go there. "Pick me...", I remember I once said, as everyone else probably did when reading the novel.What bothers me most about the film though, is not the adaption itself, since it follows the book much better than any adaption ever has done before it. This is a good thing. However, bits and pieces are missing, and when leaving the theater I understand what it is that I miss the most: it is the politics of K-PAX! K-PAX is in the novel an anarcho-syndicalistic world in its most pure essence. It is a world without money, without rules, without "law and lawyers" as PROT states it. But it is still a world in peace.I remember when I read it that I said to myself that "this can't work in the US". And when watching the movie, I understand that it didn't. Actually, almost everything of the message in the book is erased! K-PAX is a lovely world - but what if we tried to re-create it here on Earth? Well, I guess the producers didn't want to take a risk developing a too socialstic idea on the screen.Gene Brewer's ideas are not only interesting. To me the ideas of the K-PAX-world is something we should try to create. If I said that to the capitalistic forces of the world I would be stoned to death. I do understand though, that an American film with these points couldn't be made in the world today. K-PAX, the REAL K-PAX-story (I mean the book) is light-years ahead of itself.But hey, we are only a class B-3 planet, so what do we know about the world?K-PAX is a very good movie. It is more sad than I thought it would be, but PROT is as nice and thoughtful that I always has visioned him. Kevin Spacey does a wonderful, maybe his best, performance. Jeff Bridges is also good, and it is a wise, if not strange choice, to cast him as the doctor when thinking of that he made STARMAN in 1984.PROT is yet an alien that is put in the line of Starman, E.T. and the rest of the friendly aliens from Hollywood. However, PROT has a message to us earthlings that the others didn't really have. You won't get this message by watching the movie; no, then you'd only get a good time. But if you read the book when you get home, then you will know what PROT really had to say.My vote: 7 of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good performances-- generic material</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>potential spoilers!!!!!K-Pax is undoubtedly a waste of the formidable acting chops of both Spacy and Bridges. Both men turn in subtle performances, peppered with believable vocal and physical mannerisms. The subject matter, however leaves alot to be desired. The fundamental flaw is that the film asks us to care about the Jeff Bridges character's family relationship without developing these characters at al. Neither the children or his wife are given any voice, nor is the reason for their familial strife explored futher than simply saying that Bridges is a "workaholic". Such a generic explanation is fine as backstory, but it cannot be used as the primary motivation for a protagonist's actIONSSPOILERS ALERT!!!!Nowhere in te film is this more evident than in the relationship between Bridges and his estranged son. This relationship is dismissed with the explanation that " they don't talk." For one t have any emotional investment in their reunion, we must have a more significant esxplanation than this. This film purports to explore the worldly by means of the supernatural, but it merely glosses over the most fundamentally human elements of the film.An attempt at Capraesque schmaltz that lacke the social insight and commentary to acchieve that level of quality. A predictable, dull, and simplistic film. Bridges and Spacey wasted their time on this rubbish, but that doesn't mean you have to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kevin Spacey shines in a fairy-tale "PATCH ADAMS" meets "E.T."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Can Kevin Spacey do no wrong? Save for perhaps his little foible, "THE BIG KAHUNA", Spacey proves he can just about turn any role into a delightful character that viewers can somehow connect with and enjoy.In this particular story, "K-PAX" is the name of Kevin Spacey's home planet, and it is where he must return to on July 27th unless Jeff Bridges can convince him not to otherwise.Spacey plays, "Prot" (pronounced like 'boat'), a peculiar kind-hearted gentleman dressed in 'everyman's clothes' who enters the film at a crowded train station in New York and helps a lady off the floor who has just been mugged. Police officers arriving on the scene mistake Prot for the offender and after a brief questioning session, decide that something is missing 'upstairs' in his head and have him committed to a psychiatric ward and in particular to Jeff Bridges' care.Jeff Bridges is a highly over-looked esteemed actor. I've felt that his last few films (especially ones such as "THE CONTENDER" and "ARLINGTON ROAD") were some extraordinary high-lights of his career. In "K-PAX" he portrays Mark Powell, a psychiatrist who seems to be stuck in a rut with the same patients and their continuous never-ending problems. The patients at this institution aren't particularly dangerous, not really to anyone else but themselves. When Powell is introduced to Prot, we witness a strange connection between Psychiatrist and Patient that was non-existent with his other subjects.Prot explains to Powell that his is from the planet K-Pax and that he must return on July 27. What has he been doing here this whole time? What was his mission on Earth? Why does he have to go back? These are answers that only you will discover IF you see the movie.Prot's only objective in this film is that when he returns to K-Pax, he may only take one person with him. Unlike 1998's cliche'-driven tissue-in-your-hand 'fest "PATCH ADAMS", this film tries to avoid the saccharine-sweet route by having the patients actually believe in something and in doing so, making themselves a better person - Exactly, you won't find Kevin Spacey singing "Blue Skies" to the other patients or wearing a red clown's nose to make the children laugh. Prot helps turns the patients' lives around in offering them something that delivers hope, and it is not long before everyone suddenly wants to go to K-Pax.Powell is fascinated by Prot. You can tell that he wants to believe him and that this isn't just some usual babble he hears every day from his other patients. Prot has an aura of mystery around him and he is determined to discover literally down to the core, who and perhaps what, Prot exactly is.Several amusing scenes have Prot conversing with Powell's family dog and Prot mapping out the exact orbital system of the solar system he is from to a group of highly-educated Astronomers to prove that he isn't what Powell would describe as the case of a 'idiot savant'. But it is Prot's fascination with fresh produce that is one of his character high-lights.Several deeply disturbing scenes would include Powell engaging in psycho-therapeutic hypnotic sessions with Prot in order to gain further information about his past, and the final pieces of the puzzle that Powell will discover that fall into place will make this film something that a child may not want to see.Overall, I felt that "K-PAX" was heart-warming, touching and very smart in how it all falls into place. While there are certainly many plot holes to question, the film's conclusion will definitely have you talking it over in great detail with the person you just saw it with. Save for one curse word, I highly enjoyed this film and I would recommend it to just about everyone who isn't committed to seeing a film that involves things getting blown up and people getting shot.MY RATING: 9 'STARS' out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not what I was expecting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While watching the preview of this movie, I imagined an insightful Sci-Fi work that parallels such great movies like Contact or the Arrival. But this movie was not exactly what I was hoping for. Spoiler: As expected, the movie's plot line dangles between "so, is he from outer space or not," much like in Contact, where the question was "so, did she really go or not" to keep the audience interested. But, in Contact, the question was more significant in that her question involved the theological conflict between science and religion, the contests between the government and a nemesis billionaire, and the treachery of human selfishness. In contrast, Prot's influence never seeped out of the psychiatric ward. His "benevolence" was only felt by a small group of crazed people. This element alone makes "the question" in K-Pax less significant, and less exciting. Also, it was quite surprising that after Prot dramatically demonstrated his knowledge (perhaps the highest point in the entire more), which proved (at least to me) that he is from outer planets, that nothing was done about it (also seemed strange to me that they never asked Prot to simply get from one side of the room to the other side of the room in light speed, which could have proven his ability to travel faster than light). Maybe it was the philosophy of the writers to shy away from MIB or ID4 type of alien extravaganza, but I was expecting a whole new plot line after that point, something that would parallel the story line of the Arrival, where the "real" reason of why he is here is discovered (they also never made quite clear why he would come to Earth). My point is that the second half could have been much more exciting (and believable) than just watching Prot locked up in the ward, figuring out if he is telling the truce from hypnosis when the whole world could be changed by Prot's knowledge.  Maybe it was because I had a preconception of the movie, but I find myself not intellectually satisfied when the movie ended. This movie strikes me more like a "One Flew over Cuckoo's Nest" with a spaceman in it. Its not a bad movie. Just not as good as I had hoped. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** K-PAX.Every Actor has a dream run in their careers where their acting is in tune with the times. That is, a majority is tuned to accept a certain style as good acting, is it mass hypnosis? Or simply, the right choice of characters or it might as well be great acting, amongst the choice listed before I prefer to pick the last; Kevin Spacey is just now the best actor that we have, a pied piper of sorts, The dream began with, `Usual suspects'; a character that twists the story with dialogues and makes one believe the unbelievable, and the character Verbal Kint is film nouir, a Hollywood spook story. `L.A.Confidential' Jack Vincennes a stylish cop, that is silenced for he wants to eject his corrupt old ways, the scene where his eye lids are left open with his last breath escaping is film lore, a holywood crime story, `American Beauty' the suburban husband and father that releases himself from being exactly that, then it was Lester Burnham, a Hollywood folk story.K-PAX is a planet that is 1000 light years away and from there is Kevin Spacey alias 'Prot'. `Prot' visits planet earth for a period of 5 years and eventually disappears, makes no bones about the fact that he is a alien, obviously misunderstood, and is lead to the destination of the misunderstood, a lunatic asylum. Ofcourse the lunatics in the asylum change in the presence of this alien. (I cannot prevent myself from feeling good) What has Prot got to loose? He is really an alien that enters a body that commits suicide exactly 5 years ago (These Aliens are precise, unlike us Earthlings) in Arizona, where there are more alien droppings or sightings than raindrops, Ofcourse the man that commits suicide is Kevin spacey and thus Spacey becomes `Prot' So in short spacey is possessed by `Prot'thus the empirical conclusion, aliens do need to parasite human bodies, but do not go there, there is no effort to influence imagination, don't train your mind to visualize distant never to be seen planets and its life. K-PAX is a simple, honest, not so thought provoking Hollywood style story that uses an alien to define the paradoxes, our planet or mother earth is. The story is interesting, the layout is tested before to, much success, but why is it not thought provoking? The doctor that consults is Jeff Bridges and is quiet befuddled, in fact even before he begins to work with `Prot' which suits the constant expression that Jeff has mastered over the years in the various movies he has untiringly tried us. He puts that to good use in many of the introspective close ups that one gets to witness in the movie. Is this to explain the mood or is it just to remind us of Jeff Bridge's lack of acting skills? The befuddled Jeff even shares his anxiety with some astrophysicists when `Prot' seem s to solve a riddle, The riddle by itself is not important, It was a perfect setup to exploit `Prot', sorry Kevin Spacey's acting skills, (An `Oscar Moment') For those who are interested in the riddle can ignore the movie, then that angle of bewildered scientists is completely forgotten. This whole event is approximately 20 minutes of pure Hollywood. K_PAX has numerous questions and proclamations inbuilt, the age-old question on mental institutions, are they patients of the `society'? A minority that has trouble assimilating with the majority called `society'. This question is dealt with in singular detail in `one flew over the cuckoos nest' or more recently in the movie made by the German genius Tom Tykwer `Princess and the warrior'. In K-PAX the same question though looms large is unanswered or if answered is lost in the singular obsession to screen write Kevin Spacey. Jeff Bridges himself solves his domestic troubles in association with Prot, that is the outcome of his obsession with this alien patient `Prot'. The asylum is an ensemble of pretty seasoned lunatics; they are convincing and rather curiously friendly, they get friendlier, thanks to the presence of `Prot' or is it Kevin Spacey. The positives of the movie clearly outweigh the negatives, a positive movie driven by the charm of Kevin spacey. Kevin himself is brilliant, we cannot expect anything less from a actor that is at his zenith of his acting career, Many Self obsessed scenes surely will ring bells for the average emotional melodramatic moviegoer, that is a majority and also a definition for a `Oscar Moment', it is a family entertainer with the parents feeling good that the only question their juvenile would ask would be `do aliens look like `Kevin Spacey'His acting skills! When compared or not is alien to us. But from the choice of movies that he is been doing and will be in the next couple of years he soon will be a plebian.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It ain't over till....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once again, your patience and interest were rewarded. A scene inserted at the very end of the credits clarifies Dr. Powell (Jeff Bridges) response to Prot's (Kevin Spacey) final request. For those who didn't stay, you have another good reason to see K-PAX again.Need some other reasons? This deceptively simple allegory will peel like an onion revealing psychological, spiritual, political, scientific and comical layers. And the irony of Jeff Bridges (of ?Starman' fame) showing up on the other side of the intergalactic ? You've at least seen the teasers and know that Prot is a stranger in a strange land (Manhattan) with an unfathomable understanding of deep space and innocence to cut to the heart with simple questions. Dr. Powell is forced to question all he knows about treatment and family issues. The hospital administration and our political leaders should rethink what constitutes a threat to society. And our spiritual leaders need to rethink revelation (satori) and love (agape).This film begs for a sequel, leaving the Prot's future up in the air. He turns the tables on the doctors at the Psychiatric Institute Manhattan, brings patients to a new level of awareness through Zen-like tasks and bridges the communication between family and dog. This film begs - no demands ? us to read the book.Not since Memento (way back before 9/11) has a film succeeded in putting the audience into the shoes of the protagonist. Confused? You should be. Where is it written that a film should only make you feel good? What's wrong with one that challenges? After all, we are at an " early stage of evolution; future uncertain." Which leads me to a major message from K-PAX: sometimes the answers we seek are not as important as the questions we ask.So who is the real Starman? Next April, the Academy may give you their decision.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting Movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of all the movies I've seen dealing with alien life, this is by far one of the most interesting and well presented. Instead of having a character who is trying to hide his existance as an extraterrestrial, we have one who openly admits this, to such an extent that he is considered an insane human. Spacely's character Prot, answers all the traditional questions which one might ask an alien to prove that he isn't really human. Will some of his answers are obscure, I found them all quite satisfying. I'm glad the movie actually addressed such issues instead of leaving unsightly plotholes.*SPOILER WARNING* Lots of people seem to be bashing this movie for it's "You decide what happened" ending. My personal opinion is that this isn't the case. What I got from the story was that Prot's species had to somehow occupied a human's body in order to exist on earth, but the human would still be there, coexisting in the same body with the alien. Prot occupied and made friends with a human (forgot his name) in this way and visited often. On the night of the murder, this human broke down emotional and tried to kill himself. Prot managed to save the body but the man's mind was gone. At the end of the movie when Prot returns home, he leaves the body behind, asking the Dr to take care of it. Evidence that he was really alien is overwhelming. He could see ultraviolet light. He was able to diagram his solar system, which the world's top Astrologers couldn't do with the data they had. He disappeared from a high-security mental institution and reappeared days later. Finally, he was able to take one of the patients with him to K-PAX. So tell me, how could he not be alien. I got the impression that the director wasn't trying to hide the fact that he was an alien, especially considering all the hints and clues that were put in the movie. *END OF SPOILERS*Overall, K-PAX is a great movie which gives an interesting perspective on the issue of life on other planets. I recommend this movie and give it a 9 of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>K-PAX = Cuckoo's Nest + Phenomenon + Awakenings and more!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Only every now and again do I find myself "feeling" that feeling. I have slacked off in my worldly duties to review movies, present my thoughts to the electronic world and then hope I didn't steer anyone wrong. In this respect I say this is a good one if not a really great one!I am a Kevin Spacey fan. I mean, if you saw the film "The Usual Suspects" that's all I have to say,, oh yes "American Beauty" was a good one too!Kevin comes to us in this movie...out of nowhere, really! He appears from ??, in a NYC train station, witnessed by a homeless guy. He simply appears but is quickly arrested after an "incident". He is sent to a Psychiatric Ward in NYC.Following this opening scene the movie continues to gather steam and gets its footing. Jeff Bridges "Starman" is the Dr. who tries to help this troubled guy. Kevin Spacey you see is from another planet called K-PAX....at least that is his belief. Trust me he, takes you down that road and he is VERY convincing. Dr. Powell (Bridges) is partly caught up in this delusional world but not enough to impair his professional judgment. This guy, from the planet K-PAX, in the constellation Lyra (sp), calls himself "PROTE". He makes you a believer...oh you want to believe,...trust me!This may all sound silly or not believable but I tell you this, combine the story line with the cinematography, sound track and acting, then mix this into a linked and intertwined experience, you have one special movie!There are times of wonder, confusion, sadness and joy. These effects come to you at various times in the film but not in any special order. I will not give one clue away.not that there are clues, just the fabric of this film is one to be enjoyed from beginning to end. NO language or nudity issues here my friends but it is a little "deep" for some younger kids?You must let yourself go....at least for a time, to believe that the unbelievable is possible.Scenes to remember: Earth's produce (yes fruits and veggies!), The Dog on the Fourth of July, The "Visit", Planetarium, The Bluebird of Happiness, Light Speed and Tachyons....these all have discrete meaning after you have seen what I have seen.This film is extremely well done and emotions can carry the day if you have that propensity as I surely do.Finally to give you a sense, take the setting of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" (Spacey though is the Anti-Nickelson here) add the feelings of hope in "Awakenings" (Robin Williams, Robert Dinero) finally throw in the utter sense of, how is this possible?, with the John Travolta/Robert Duvall flick...."Phenomenon" now maybe you can sense where I'm coming from.Movies like this are very strong to me emotionally because they say things beyond the script. We are all here in this world, it's the only one we've got folks! So.. lets not destroy what we have, let's see the future together, let us not throw the special things in life away; family, friends and hope.That's what this movie does to you. You exit the theater, walk out that door and the Sun hits you smack in the face. You have returned to this world and you simply drive away to that life, to that future, to your existence on a small, blue, insignificant planet in a galaxy of millions, in a universe of trillions and trillions of stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Flew Over The Starman's Nest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was mildly entertaining but routine, politically correct and uneven. On balance, I'd give it a 6.0 out of ten.Kevin Spacey offers a pretty good performance but nothing we haven't seen before, and so he looks less multi-dimensional here than in past performances. Bridges is competent but certainly no great shakes in the role. And the acting was the best thing about the film.The script is a convoluted mess. The only good scene, in my opinion, was the meeting between Prot and the scientists. Most of the rest was postmodern, liberal psychobabble about vegetarianism and nonviolence being so much higher order than the crude ways of us meat-eating barbarians who call ourselves human. The ending was vague, predictable and unsatisfying, except for the fact that I was grateful it was over.If you want to see a more haunting movie about what it means to be human, see "AI." If you want to see a better Spacey performance see "American Beauty." If you want to see a good movie about the dynamic of a mental institution, see "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest." And if you want to see a better alien in America flick, try the old Jeff Bridges "Starman." This one borrows a little from all of those, never finding an identity of its own.A couple of notes. In the movie there was a character who would not go outside in New York City because of the contaminants in the air. He also wouldn't touch things because of the possibility of skin disease. Did anyone else see the parallels between the guy's paranoia and anthrax? I cringed a little at that. Also, might this have been a better movie had they reverse cast it? Bridges as the alien, Spacey as the psychiatrist? Think about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is your basic Hollywood "suspend disbelief" feel good movie. It's best to not be too critical about a movie that can suck you in right from the start, and have you depart knowing that they've given you the opportunity to leave feeling "reality based" or "fairy dusted". Kevin Spacey plays Prot, declaring openly and shamelessly that he's from another planet. He's taken to a mental ward (suspend disbelief; no-one goes to a Psych Ward for mere delusions these days) and the inmates come to buy his story, and the Psychiatrist (Jeff Bridges,tamping down his usual irritating facial and vocal dramatics) tries hard not to.Just when we've accepted that Spacey may be a genuine alien Bridges uncovers, through hypnosis, another possibility. Now the movie has us right in it's grip, desperately wanting Kevin to be Mork and not Sybil.I left feeling good, only later allowing the massive holes in the plot to rationalize their way in to my brain. I decided to be fairy dusted instead. As it is a feel good movie I'll allow the Director his fantasy about the state of mental health treatment for the chronically ill!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Prot Who Fell to Earth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read the reviews on this site and so far no one has mentioned an earlier -- and I think more powerful -- film: "The Man Who Fell to Earth," starring David Bowie. The film was pretty closely based on a 1963 novel of the same name by Walter Tevis. Research this earlier film for yourself, and then see whether the similarities between the two films make the later one seem almost a remake of the earlier one. Or a rip-off.For example: Prot can see ultraviolet light and he needs to wear sunglasses. The protagonist in "The Man Who Fell to Earth," Newton, has exquisitely sensitive eyes and he needs to wear sunglasses. The reproduction of both "aliens" is messy. If you take the Latin word for peace -- "pax" -- and compare it to the name of Newton's home world -- Mars, the Roman god of war -- the parallels become interesting.***PARTIAL SPOILER FOLLOWS:*** Of course there are huge differences between the films, but look at how Newton is changed by what ultimately happens to him, and ask yourself: does the question "Is he an alien" really matter? At bottom, despite the fact we always know that Newton is a Martian while we are left to wonder about Prot, by the end of "The Man Who Fell to Earth," Newton is simply another washed-up failure, doomed to live his days here like one of Graham Greene's expatriate Brits in some inconsequential, forgotten corner of the world.Seen in this context, I think K-PAX is diminished as a film, a product of a later, but more trivial, era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting psychological drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a Spacey fan so that was a great motivation for me to see this movies. I was also interested in the plot of one being trying to teach another race about living.[SPOILERS!!!]This movie was basically about a man who experienced intense heartbreak from a young age. He developed a split personality which only became manifest when his family was murdered. This alternate personality took over to shield Robert from the pain of loss. Of course, this isn't admitted until the very end and then only by speculation.There are some who believe thar PROT was indeed a being from another planet who visited through merging with a human's body and therefore PROT's comment about "Take care of Robert when I leave" would make sense, as well as Robert's catatonic state upon PROT's departure. It would also explain PROT's information about a constellation about which only a select few people had any information. These little episodes would give credence to this being-within-a-body theory.Personally, I believe in the first, not because I don't believe in aliens, but the former bears more weight. An experience like the one Robert experienced could make a person loose touch with reality in order for the body to go on living. Part of his mind wanted to die, the other part did not and so took over.As for Spacey's performance: I've always thought of him as a wonderfully gifted actor who has the uncanny ability to "become" the characters. I found his portrayal of PROT very light-hearted and easy to digest. It was not until he began the hypnosis sessions that I really began to see and feel Spacey's gift. His mannerisms, facial expressions, voice modulations and intonations all gave credence to the character of PROT. During the more intense hypnosis session, I found myself tensing and reacting along with PROT to the horrifying memories; a good way to judge whether the actor has done a good job of impersonating the character.All in all, a very interesting and thought-provoking movie that I would definitely see again.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first heard about this movie I wondered if it would be as good as "Starman" (the last thing I liked Jeff Bridges in)....well it wasn't. But before you decide to stay home or worse yet go see some of the other slop that is playing now down at the old local picture show, give K-Pax a try.The concept is so neat that one tends to overlook some of the meandering the screen play aka "Plot" seems to take at times. Kevin Spacey is really good as Prot from K-Pax or as a John Doe delusional that has something so horrible inside his emotional ship that he dare not visit it. Spacey's work is worth of some award consideration.Jeff Bridges is a big city psychiatrist who treats Spacey and declares that "he is the most convincing delusional I've ever seen." He does a workman like job but it really would have been better if he had spent more time in the comparative science areas like the astro-physicist scene where Prot dazzles with his knowledge of the heavens. But one must remember that actors say the words that are written for them and are directed by directors who want those words to be said, so go easy on Jeff. He was ok with the material he had.So go see K-Pax but expect less than you might otherwise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suspension of disbelief is central to the enjoyment of any good tale. In the case of K-Pax, I didn't find it that difficult to accomplish. Kevin Spacey-man's oh-so-rightly subtle performance and Jeff Bridges' turn as world-weary Dr. Mark Powell were right on the money. The film works best during the scenes involving the interaction between these two characters (Dr. Mark :"It's my job to cure these people, not yours!" Prot: "So why aren't you doing your job, Mark?"); although the interlude between Prot and some almost-glib astronomers was equally satisfying.Many of the professional reviewers I read just *hate* all the psychiatric patients portrayed in this film. Having had one experience of such "hospital-ity" some years ago, I must protest--I recall quite a few, shall we say, colorful characters, and these, though slightly exaggerated for the story's sake, were not that far off the mark.The one niggling thought that bothered me was the knowledge, in my case almost insuperable, that no psychiatrist would ever, *ever* take such a charge home to be around his own family; let alone allow him to be alone in his house with his wife. Of all the scenes in the film, this is the only one that didn't ring quite true, that should have been better done and explained. It didn't spoil the overall effect of the story, however (my DH disagreed with me on this and pointed out the necessity of getting Prot to communicate with the dog, and also to portray more of Dr. Mark's own problematic family life.)So *is* Prot or isn't he? An earlier reviewer here (willy calloway) put that question to rest, and I cannot agree more wholeheartedly with his logic. The ending of K-Pax is ambiguous only to the willingly blinded or imagination-impaired. As the Professor in C.S. Lewis' _The Chronicles of Narnia_ put it, "Bless me! What *do* they teach them at these schools nowadays?"(!!!) Recommended. I plan on seeing it again--and this time will not miss the add-on scene at the end of the credits!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>K-PAX is a worthwhile trip</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of all the things this film is being billed as -- drama, sciencefiction, fantasy and comedy -- I'll pick drama. It had a little less ofthe elements of those other genres I was hoping for, and whileK-PAX didn't meet my expectations (or preconceived notions, if youwill; never a good thing to walk into a movie theatre with), itsucceeds in being a satisfying, thought-provoking experience.After an altercation at New York's Grand Central Station, Prot(Kevin Spacey, "Pay it Forward"), a serene, gentle man who calmlyexplains that he is here visiting from the planet K-PAX, is taken to aManhattan mental hospital and put under the supervision of Dr.Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges, "The Contender"), a soft-spoken,easygoing psychiatrist. When even heavy medication fails toreverse Prot's insistence that he is visiting from another galaxy,Powell becomes very interested in his patient, who not only seemsto have a calming effect on the other residents of the ward, he alsohas an uncanny knowledge of astrophysics. His identity is acomplete mystery, which further intrigues the doctor. When Protannounces he's going home at the end of July and he can takeone person along with him, the patients all vie to be chosen. Asthe days before Prot's planned departure from earth go by, Dr.Powell struggles with a dilemma -- will Prot really beam up in anotherwordly fashion, never to be seen again, or will he have acomplete mental breakdown, harming himself or others?Personally, I found the look of the film a bit dark and dreary. It reallydidn't fit in with the story, at least not at first (K-PAX does take adark turn down the line). However, Prot wears sunglasses atalmost all times, because he cannot stand ultraviolet light; soperhaps the cinematographer was trying to help the audience seethrough his eyes. I'll buy it if that's the case, but I can't think of anargument for the irritating, often obtrusive musical score.Director Iain Softley ("The Wings of the Dove") takes it slow -- tooslow at times. Aside from the two main characters, the rest of thecast might as well have been cardboard cutouts. The roles thatwent to talented ladies such as Mary McCormack, Conchata Ferreland Alfre Woodard could have been played by just about anyone.My only guess is that their meatier performances ended up on thecutting room floor. For a movie that is already overly long even withall the fat cut, this is understandable. If you are willing to sit for two hours and focus on two excellentactors exploring some interesting concepts and questions (mostlyvia dialog in the doctor's office), then K-PAX is a worthwhile trip.Otherwise, you might want to wait and watch it in the comfort ofyour own home (on whichever planet that may be).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some masterwork, some cliche-- Overall, well worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boy-- What a mix. This is undoubtedly Kevin Spacey's best role. It is also a very good Jeff Bridges role, and an important one. He is so amazing, and such an artistic treasure. Movie lovers should see Bridges as the doctor character here, just to get another slice of his skill, vibe, and talents. He has, however, produced more compelling work elsewhere, but that's just my opinion, and a quibble at that."K-PAX" has some masterful moments and treatments. For example, Spacey's character, Prot, is a brilliant portrayal of the potentially mundane, yet thrilling, personality a real alien from another planet might possibly exhibit if he actually visited earth (as if any of us would know what that would be-- but it seems real!). However, most of the mental patient portrayals and the hypnosis breakthrough scenes were so bad as to be laughable.At times, K-PAX seemed to be made by a master filmmaker with a deft and mystical touch. At other times, it seemed to be made by a very talented college sophomore writing their very first school play. On balance, the masterful parts are well worth seeing, and the stupid, clunky, junky, cliched parts are deleted easily enough from your memory after you leave the theater.Overall-- very good movie. Coulda been better; coulda been WAY worse. I gave it an "8" out of "10."</fullReview>

Intelligence and humanity shine in both their performances. Spacey's faint little smile reminds me of a cat I once had who would stare at me with a look of "I'd tell you the secret of the universe if only I could believe you would understand." Meanwhile, Bridges connects! He really looks at people and you can see him think. A joy to watch. Another benefit of the quality of these two is they get surrounded by actors worthy of them.

		<shortDescription>we seem to have some discrepancies...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I looked over the 24 [as of 26 Oct] comments, there seems to be a polorized opinion of K-PAX. Some people, with dubious names such as John Shaft and CaptainGenius, thought it was typical Hollywood detritus, lacking in originality and deeper meaning. Others complained about its length and still others, its acting.For me, this film belongs among that certain, select group of cinema that poses far more questions than it answers. Other members of this group would be 2001: A Space Odyssey, Lawrence of Arabia and Apocalypse Now. All of these films were vastly influential in a technical sense, and even more so to their specific genres.It seems to me that people who write reviews today, especially amateurs, don't have any conception of how much effort it takes to make a film. Literally thousands of hours are spent planning the shots, designing the lighting and shooting blanks to get the acting tuned. People not connected with the film industry often forget how expensive cinema is; even Kubrick had a lot of explaining to do after shooting a million feet for The Shining.In short, directors unilaterally put much more into their films than the average film-goer will ever get out of them. For example, the only reason films like Citizen Kane and The Godfather Trilogy have books written about them is this: They're good enough to warrant the time it takes to dissect scenes and divine the meanings behind every little filmographic nuance.Iain Softley is a consistent director. Every single one of his films has been, primarily, about the love shared by to people. This love is often shown against a backdrop so encompassing, that it seems to become the focus of the film. This effect is intentional, by the way, to show how gossamer love really is. In fact, the backdrop for Hackers was so rich and detailed, that many viewers [and critics too] simply missed the love between Angelina Jolie and Jonny Lee Miller.The plot of K-PAX was much maligned for being too slow and unengaging. Well, yes the plot was slow; there were no explosions to tide the viewer over until the next bit of humorous dialogue. People today are so utterly used to the one and a half hour film [which, I might add, as developed by the advertisers of the feature, not the directors] that they've lost touch completely with anything that outlasts a watery coke. I worked it out once, that ends up being some 60% percent of films that are just too darn long.I realize that this comment has little to do with K-PAX, but some of the opinions preceding this one so perfectly illustrated the impatience of the modern film-goer, that I felt compelled to point it out.It is quite sad to me to observe the complacency of film-goers today. That movies have to be fed to the viewer in small, individual and most importantly, simple, portions is one of the great travesties of modern filmmaking.People have forgotten that there were once, long long ago, a pair of masks above the screen of every movie theatre, one happy one sad. They've also forgotten that films were once shown aside great masterpieces of marble and paint. This film harkens back to those days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that I'm a lifelong SF (I never call it scifi) fan. And I've been a movie fan for just about as long.It all starts when a man appears in Grand Central Station. When he tries to intervene in a robbery. His spacy statements to the police about a long journey result in his being arrested and taken to Bellevue for observation.A psychiatrist tries to find what is at the center of his neurosis. At the same time Prot begins interacting with the other inmates, becoming both doctor and patient.There are definitely things that are different about him: his vision is more acute and sensitive than normal and his heart rate is all wrong. Along the way he amazes scientists with his knowledge of astronomy and astromechanics.These things, and a conversation with a dog, keep you certain that (on a specific day) he will "beam" out of the hospital and back to K-Pax. At the same time, the doctor is tracking down Prot's true history. This is done very well and does explain certain things, like why Prot is a vegetarian. But there is no satisfactory explaination for his "alien" attributes: the acute eyesight and the astronomical knowledge (to say nothing of the dog).I enjoyed the film a lot. Spacey's performance was wonderfully understated and Bridges was fine. I gave it an eight. An enjoyable evening at the movies.</fullReview>

To determine which conclusion the movie makes, one need only look at the explanations within the movie (i.e. A will be more explained if that is the conclusion, and B will subsequently be left unexplained). Take a few confusing aspects: If A is true, then Prot's random emergence in the beginning, his human bodily form, his extra-human eyesight, his vast astronomical knowledge, his ability to communicate with dogs, his disappearance, and Bess' disappearance are all explained. Basically, every single scene in the movie is accounted for under paradigm A.If paradigm B is assumed correct, of the above list, nothing is explained except Prot's bodily form. Thus, option A is correct: Prot is an alien.Foreseeing an objection, why would Prot have the memories of Robert if Prot were an alien? Go back to the first hypnotic scene. There is some tension in the audience because either Prot is an intelligent human or an average alien, and either way he would be beyond the susceptibility of hypnosis. And what is it that comes out of the hypnosis? A story about a family torn apart and the severe emotional distress resultingly inflicted.The entire series of hypnotic episodes turns out to be a moral for Mark. Supposing A, we'd assume that Prot had some reason for choosing Robert's body over all other bodies. This reason turns out to be to keep Mark from ruining his relationship with his son. In order to fulfill this goal, Prot takes on the memories of Robert, and even actions which Robert would take (i.e. the sprinkler event and vegetarianism and hypnotic hysterics) in order to make his point more convincing. So really then, now the only thing left unexplained is why Prot would go to such emotional and temporal lengths simply to teach Mark a valuable life lesson? And why even choose Mark out of all the problem-filled lives on planet Earth? There's only one solution: Prot is Mark's angel, his personal angel, his guardian angel. Nurse: Why is this patient so important? Mark: Because he chose me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film, but could it have been better?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film last night at a screening. Kevin Spacey was all that you could expect him to be, and the acting all around was excellent. However, I did have a nagging feeling that something was missing when the film was over. The plot takes on too many strange angles and doesn't explain them well enough-- at times it seems random things are thrown in to perplex the viewer further. Perhaps more care could have been taken to hide the hand of the writer.But I think I'm being too hard on the flick, because I have gotten used to neat, pat movies stamped out by Hollywood where everything works out and all questions are answered. In real life, this is rarely the case, so in some ways, despite the film's topic, it is more realistic than other movies.While this movie has occasional moments of comedy, it is not, in my opinion, an all-around comedy. None of the humor made me fall out of my chair with laughter. On the whole, the film is pretty well-rounded, and covers a lot of bases-- comedy, science-fiction, mystery, and maybe a little bit of romance.Worth seeing, but don't go in expecting this to be incredible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw a screening of K-PAX today at the Universal Screening Room in NYC. A screening for it was originally scheduled for Sept 11, but since that was cancelled, I'm keeping the invitation for that one as a historical memento. I saw it today in a screening room of about 60 people, and it was quite good. Well written, well acted, and well directed. Without giving anything away, I will say that the ending was not what I expected. A bit sad, a bit disappointing as a viewer, though it was legitimately written.BTW, The name of Kevin Spacey's character is pronounced "Proat", but it is spelled "Prot" in the credits and in the publicity for the film. Why?And I really wish laymen would be informed about Freud's status in the medical community. Wanting to say goodbye before Prot goes back to K-PAX, Jeff Bridges shares a toast of scotch with Prot, and says he doesn't think Freud ever tried this, but? The writer who wrote this line obviously isn't familiar with the fact that Freud is universally regarded among psychologists as a quack (at least as a psychoanalyst). Freud's theories were entirely unscientific, and the psychology community began reevaluating him in the 70s. By the 90s, he was all but dismissed. The November 20, 1993 issue of Time featured a cover story on Freud, with his head depicted on the cover as a crumbliing jigsaw puzzle next to the heading "Is Freud Dead?"Good movie. I liked it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've just gotten back from the advanced screening for k-pax in dallas. At first I thought the movie was a little slow and I started to feel like I was watching another bad alien movie about halfway through it. Like other alien movies, I felt insulted that a big hollywood star like Spacey was on the screen trying to convince me that he was an alien from outerspace. However, as the story developed, I began to realize that k-pax is a movie of human emotions rather than another "naive alien comes to earth" comedy. The movie has numerous laughs, but it is much more than a comedy. The movie suggests, "change the way you look at the world". Through the transformations of the various characters in the film, you are certainly allowed to see the world in a different "light". The film has a simple message. You may need strength, will, determination, or love to live in this world. But there is nothing that will allow you to see a brighter world, if you don't possess a certain four letter word. Spacey was excellent. I don't think it's an Oscar winning role. But he did a flawless job playing the part. Since there were a few weak places in the film(one particular scene involving a pencil), it wasn't a fantastic movie. But overall, it was a charming movie which carried a sincere message. I would recommend it, especially with all the crap on the big screen these days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This psychiatric hospital -- which is cleaner, more comfortable, and embodies more politesse than any psychiatric hospital I've seen -- is full of odd people. Some are allergic to everything. Others go to obsessive lengths to preserve the beauty of their youth and wind up looking like a gorgon. They're all pretty much disturbed and frightened.Except for Kevin Spacey, the one wearing the shades because his eyes haven't adapted to the light spectrum of this planet. He's here from K-Pax, a planet in another galaxy, collecting data like an anthropologist. The chief psychiatrist, Jeff Bridges, is curious about Spacey because he sounds so reasonable, so lucid. He wears a placid smile and answers politely, although sometimes neatly sidestepping the questions Bridges asks him.Spacey refuses to take any tests or medicine but a cursory physical exam reveals that he's only a bit off kilter but not very unusual. He has some weird astrophysical theory that stumps Bridges, so Bridges take him for a chat with some astronomers he knows. Their judgment: He could be right. They've never thought of it.Spacey claims he can travel at more than the speed of light and has to return to K-Pax to make an interim report. He disappears for two days, and then is found perched high in the branches of a tree -- where he may or may not have been all along.At this point, about midway through the film, we're in "Twilight Zone" territory. Could Spacey really be from another planet? Or is he just an exceptionally convincing psychotic? We don't know.Alas, we get to find out, and that's when the movie collapses. I don't think I'll give it away except to observe that it has little to do with the cosmos and a lot to do with ordinary human frailties.My heart sinks at having to say that Spacey isn't particularly good in the role of the interplanetary traveler. I love the guy. Not only did he bring such delicacy to the role of the detective in "L.A. Confidential" but he's from New Jersey. It's that mannequin-like smile and that sing song approach that torpedoes his efforts. Jeff Bridges' role is so stereotyped that it can't be ruined, not even by a talented actor.Too bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prot (Kevin Spacey) appears without anyone noticing. He claims to be a space alien, and the police takes him into custody. Dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges) tries to help him with his delusion. The problem is that evidence mounts that he's actually telling the truth.With such interesting evidence, there should be a much more excited response especially from the astrophysicists. There is a great struggle of whether he is or isn't an alien. It's a pretty good movie until he starts on the hypnosis therapy. It goes to an uncomfortable and unlikeable area. And it's not like he takes them by surprise. He tells them the exact time and date. You would think there would be an army of people sitting there watching him just in case. The movie is a good idea with a good actor. It just writes itself into a bad corner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Different" film is intriguing with great performances by Spacey and Bridges</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a unique film, and for that alone it gets high marks from me.The question is, is this guy (Kevin Spacey) a nut, or is he really from a planet called K-PAX? Solving the mystery is psychiatrist Jeff Bridges, who becomes obsessed with the case. There are lots of twists and turns, and you never can quite decide where the film is going...another point in its favor -- not predictable, yet charming.The two key actors here are Spacey and Bridges. I've almost always found Kevin Spacey fascinating, and especially so here. It would have been easy to be campy, but he resisted that, and turns in a very nuanced performance. I've never been a fan of Jeff Bridges, although every once in a while -- like here -- he turns in a great performance. As I was watching the film I decided that it wasn't Bridges I disliked (although I prefer brother Beau), but the roles Bridges often accepts. He's right on target here.The supporting actors all do a fine job here, although none stand out.The problem here -- at least for people like me -- is that at the end of the film you are not totally sure what has happened...it's somewhat open-ended.</fullReview>

Im really starting to get annoyed by those out there who are mad because "they thought this was an alien movie". Seems to me the new generation of "alien lovers" out there are furious when a movie steers away from anything that doesn't get its inspiration from Star Wars or Avitar. If you like a good mystery that falls into the Sci-Fi genre, then this movie is for you. Not to mention the soundtrack is perfect for this flick. Jeff Bridges and Kevin Spacey are perfect in their roles. I gave it 9 out of 10 only because there was an obvious rip-off of "Man facing Southeast", and its all too typical that they stripped all the Christian references out of it. None-the-less, a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's rare but welcomed pictures like "K-PAX" that remind me why I love going to the movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iain Softley's "K-PAX" is one of those movies that doesn't come around very often, but leaves you hungry for more like it when it does happen to "beam itself to our silver screen," as its star would probably say. It is a wonderful, contemplative little gem that relies on imagination, good dialogue, beauty imagery, and incredibly strong performances from an entire cast rather than kinetic action or bursts of consented clichés. But more than anything else, it is about possibilities. Possibilities that maybe we are not alone in the universe, possibilities that a mentally ill person can cure themselves, possibilities about our world and about life.The movie is not really about whether Prot, a mental institution patient played magnificently by Kevin Spacey, is really an extra terrestrial from a planet called K-PAX. It's about the possibility that he might be. It's not about the fact that he shapes the lives of people around him, most importantly his doctor played by Jeff Bridges; it's about the possibility that we ourselves can do these things. And so when Mr. Bridges becomes attached to Mr. Spacey and becomes determined to unlock the secrets about him, and perhaps himself, we find ourselves drawn into the story as well. And as Mr. Bridges ponders, we ponder."K-PAX" is an incredibly involving movie and I think that's what I admired the most about it and why I feel it's one of the best movies that I've seen in a long, long time. There is nothing wrong - absolutely nothing wrong - with a movie simply being a mystery, or an action picture, or just a science-fiction spectacle. There is no artistic or aesthetic crime in that at all. But when a movie and its makers take an extra step and make it about something, then it's very special. Now many would assume that a science-fiction movie is about nothing more than the imagination and oftentimes they are right. But Mr. Softley's film is proof that this genre can be just that. Even science-fiction (or seemingly science-fiction) can tell you something about life, about people, about our world at the same time that it makes you wonder.There are also the wonderfully fascinating dynamics not only between Mr. Spacey and Mr. Bridges, but with both of them and the other patients in the ward. Reminding you of that great 1975 movie "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," the picture evokes fascinating relationships between the characters so that we come to know a little bit about them. But at the same time, it reminds itself that it is not a hospital character study and does not dawdle on such supporting angles to the point where it becomes tedious.The imagination of this wonderful little gem is evident all over. In more places than just its story and the way it encourages thoughtfulness. Director Softley and cinematographer John Mathieson paint the screen with images that are breath-taking, making special uses of light using strobes and beams combined with wonderful camera movements and fantastic misc en scene. A combination with these and some clever, but balanced, uses of shadows makes for an incredibly beguiling movie to look at.Performances all around are excellent. As the mysterious patient, Mr. Spacey is concentrated, professional, appropriately restrained, and in complete control of himself. There's a tendency to play a seemingly one-note role like this with hokum, but he never strikes a false note. Neither does Mr. Bridges, who is completely convincing and relatable as the doctor who goes from searching for the truth to contemplating the possibilities of life and the world. These are two superb, underrated performances from two superb, underrated actors. In regards to the supporting roles: Mary McCormack is pretty but more than scenic as Mr. Bridges' wife and brings a lot of heart into her performance, Alfre Woodard is in control of her part as the skeptical ward chief. Bit parts of patients in the ward are played with enthusiasm and conviction by David Patrick Kelly, Saul Williams, Peter Gerety, Melanee Murray, and others.This is a wonderful movie, one of a type that I wish filmmakers would dare to try more often. It is well-acted and beautiful to look at and admire on a technical level, but is also beautiful, contemplative storytelling at its finest and I cannot deny that I was completely absorbed by it. I don't see many movies like "K-PAX" these days, but when I do, I am instantly reminded why I love the movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remembered this movie, after having watched it 4 or so years ago as a nice average feel-good movie. However, after having watched it again recently it is much more than that. Firstly, the story is not like your usual story, it is about a man, prot (capitals are for planet's names only), claiming to be from the planet K-PAX and having traveled here on a beam of light. He naturally ends up in a mental institution where the question arises whether he's really speaking the truth. Apart from his own story, he helps all the other very convincingly portrayed patients deal with their own problems, as well as helping the psychiatrist who's analyzing him.All this is what makes the film good. On top of it it's Kevin Spacey's and Jeff Bridges' flawless acting and the pure visual beauty of this film. Every single shot just fits. Every single shot (save a select few) also follows the same theme; there will be some form of play with lights, be it the sun through the windows with some shadows or a desk lamp giving a rainbow through a prism. This, together with the music gives it a very enjoyable movie, even if you're paying attention to it on a meta-level.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kevin Spacey finds a tailor-made vehicle here for his self-satisfied smile and glibly patient manner, portraying a New York City mental patient at Bellevue who claims to be a visitor from a distant planet called K-PAX. Jeff Bridges is the staff psychiatrist (and hypnotist!) at the hospital who takes an interest in Spacey's Prot, testing his knowledge about astrophysics but always coming up with more questions than answers. The other patients on the ward are a friendly, movie-colorful lot, and Spacey and Bridges manage a comfortable give-and-take (though the hypnosis scenes are strenuous), so why was "K-PAX" so maligned by professional critics? This smoothly-handsome film, adapted from the novel by Gene Brewer (also the associate producer), may be an unabashed commercial "product" but it isn't a cop-out. The tall tale weaves a squirrelly spell on its audience--a spell that may seem silly once it wears off--however it is an entertaining and satisfying endeavor for the time it's on. Bridges is controlled and professional, while Spacey gets some nervous highs and contrite lows (a dream for any actor). It would be easy to put down such a picture for its outrageous qualities, and I didn't much care for the opening where Spacey is seemingly arrested for no reason (nor a later one involving a freak-out at a holiday gathering). Nevertheless, the movie does find its voice, it manages a solid final act, and the character Prot is a memorable one. "K-PAX" isn't Oscar material, but it isn't campy or weepy, either. It's harmless fun. *** from ****</fullReview>

I was actually amazed at the end to find that I was still captivated by the plot.There was some seriously good acting by Spacey IMHO.Throughout the film and beyond they managed to keep a question at the forefront of your mind, and never answered it - was Prot really from a distant planet or was this a jumbled-up individual? I thought that would be revealed at the end, but it wasn't - the producers actually managed to create new questions instead of answering obvious ones.Top marks from me.

		<fullReview>Some people may think this movie is a little "out there," but all you really have to do is give it a chance. It is about an alien coming from the planet K-PAX, that gets abducted into a mental hospital. Once the main character is in the hospital he starts to talk about the planet he grew up on, K-PAX. Because of this an extensive study is done to see if he truly is an alien, or just one really crazy fake. While the main character is in the hospital he helps other patients while a doctor tries to decide if he really is an alien, making for one crazy ride. This is a great movie, and will keep you in the dark the entire movie, but give you a view of the overall picture every once in a while. So for the scifi fan in your family will LOVE this movie, but even though I like scifi I also know others who liked this movie that hate scifi, so I would definitely recommend to pick this up on your next movie night!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Science Fiction of mental illness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is rather interesting with how it deals with the concepts of science fiction and mental illness. The name or title of the movie is of particular interest since the actor Kevin Spacey shows some type of fluency with phonetic sounds with the psychiatrist played by Jeff Bridges. The father of psychology being known as Sigmeud Freud.Sigmund Freud was born May 6, 1856, in a small town Freiberg in Moravia. Freud's books and lectures brought him both fame and ostracism from the mainstream of the medical community. He drew around him a number of very bright sympathizers who became the core of the psychoanalytic movement. Freud emigrated to England just before World War II when Vienna became an increasing dangerous place for Jews, especially ones as famous as Freud.Again back to the title K-PAX is very interesting and as visionary as Kevin Spacey. If his character were to be from Russia he would know that K and X both sound the same. Maybe this is a logical notion that logic begins and ends with the same type of conclusion. However sound when heard is as beauty and truly up to the listener, which is how Sigmund Freud and some psycho-analysts base their theories. By listening to what the patient says. Again dwelling on how this film exposes science fiction in social science the title seems to toy with this notion of science theory. Again if Kevin Spacey's character was from Russia he would know PA times two is "Papa", which is father in Russian. Since this film seems to dwell on the father of psychological principles and science fiction it is interesting to analyze the title in this fashion.This film is a very good science fiction work, and I think it would make an even better book. As books often lend the reader the ability to create conclusions of the intangible aspects to their imagination. I think this film is not well recognized in modern cinema due to the flood of special effects that mesmerize the audience as a carnival ride would with acceleration! Which is why YOU must see this film.I think other great authors such as John Milton's "Paradise Lost", Dantes comedy "The Inferno", Plato's "The Republic", Homer's (Plato) the "Illiad" and the "Oddessy", all have the nature of this screen-play where the imagination is a key element.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>K-Pax explores the lives of a doctor (jeff bridges) and patient (kevin spacey) who meet one another for the first time when the patient is brought into the psychiatric institute of Manhattan due to his claims of being an alien from the planet K-Pax, belonging to the constellation lyra. Upon meeting each other face to face, the alien patient known as "prot" is psycho-analysed by the doctor known as Dr Powell, who is intent on proving to prot that his claims of coming from a distant planet are nothing more than a result of his insanity or false delusions. However, prot is not an ordinary patient. First off, he is much more intelligent than Dr Powell is and most important of all, he is convincing in what he claims to be and where he claims to come from. After a few sessions of psycho-analysing, Dr Powell is no longer sure what to believe in and what not to believe in. But there is one way to find out once and for all..Prot claims that he will be beaming back to K-Pax on July the 25th and he will be able to take one person from the hospital with him..The ultimate testament to his claims lies here..if he goes back to k-pax, then he was indeed an alien..if not, then he is just an ordinary human being exhibiting confirmed signs of delusionary behaviour.. But when the time comes, does he succeed even if his body is lying on the floor unconscious when he should have gone??? Judging from what i have read in this forum, there seems to be some unnecessary controversy as to whether or not prot was an alien..The answer is simple..yes! he was an alien...the reasons are as follows:1. His ability to see wavelengths of light up to 300 angstroms...impossible for a human being.. 2. His astounding level of knowledge and understanding of the planetary systems in the constellation lyra..something which even the best astrophysicists failed to understand?? 3. His ability to accurately interpret Dr Powell's dog's barking sounds??? 4. His ability to add spirit to the previously pesimistic hospital environment by curing the patients by making them cure themselves??? 5. And last but not least, His ability to beam back to K-Pax..This is evidenced by the fact that bess was missing from the hospital..she could not have escaped because she was a solitary patient who never had a history of escape attempts or regulatory infractions..why would she escape at the same time when prot was heading back to k-pax????..Although it is clear that prot was an alien, this is not the focal point of the movie.. This movie is about change..it is about making a new start with the people we love but were never able to do so before..it is about doing what we "believe" is right and acknowledging that this is the only time we have to make ammendments because the mistakes we make in life will be repeated forever...its about understanding our duties in our world and taking liability for them...Hope this helped guys...I rate this movie a 7..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say by a surprise reaction I thought this was a very good movie. Even though I am a major fan of Kevin Spacey's, I had my doubts about the movie. To me, it looked kind of boring, but it was very good.MILD SPOILERS...Prot is an alien from the planet "K-Pax" who lands on Earth. He is taken to a mental hospital, and put under a doctor's care. But the doctor is eventually getting more and more convinced that Prot is telling the truth. Prot tells the other patients he can only take one human back to his planet. Which leads to a somewhat surprising ending that I will not spoil.I would highly recommend this movie for a good watch.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its funny that when K-Pax was released it did not recieve to much publicity in the UK which is suprising because it is a very good film. It is one of those film that makes you think ,while also tugging on the heart strings. A film Such as The Fisher King or Dead Poets Society. Kevin Spacey is superb as Sprote , the "is he or isnt he" alien from the Planet K-pax as is Jeff Bridges , the shrink who makes it his goal to see if the Alien story is real. This is well shot,directed and performed and is one of the better films i have seen in recent months. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too simple - CONTAINS SPOILERS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie starts out fine, I like the idea and I like the stars, but it all gets just too darn simple for me. I hoped for something like "Starman meets Beautiful Mind" or some other movie, where they obviously have given way too much room for way too academic people to write in way too hard scientific stuff for general audiences. I really thought this was the case, since this one flopped. Well, this gets like "Starman meets a TV-movie version of One Flew Over Cuckoo's Nest" when the story SHOULD get going. Ahem, NO. Then there's the stuff K-Pax tells about his planet - so these aliens a 1000 light years ago have the same senses we do, they find the same kind of things attractive, or unattractive, as we do (visions, tastes). There are also flowers and mushrooms on K-Pax... all right, fitting for a kids' movie, but for ANYONE over 14? Skip this one, easily.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic, but not as deep as the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>K-PAX has got to be one of the best, most thought-provoking films made in the last five years. A wonderful plot with plenty of twists and some genuine drama, but unfortunately some of the unique humour present in the book version has been toned down. Nevertheless, this film also has some very funny moments. Prot is the most likeable "alien" since ET (though whether you beleive he is an alien or just crazy is up to you to decide), and some of his pearls of wisdom are extremely relevant. I get the feeling that very few people who have reviewed this film on here have read the books. I'm just finishing off the third one as I write this, and they're the best books I've read in a long time. Go out, read them, and see this film in a whole new light. Overall: 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spacey rides again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kevin Spacey is once again magnificent in this often brilliant, sometimes disturbing film which explores themes of sanity and psychosis. In the same way as 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' and more recently 'Girl, Interrupted', 'K-Pax' forces us to question our concepts of normality and tolerance of those different to ourselves. Spacey plays Prot, a patient given to clinical psychologist Dr Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges) because he is under the illusion/delusion that he is an alien from the planet K-Pax. Over the course of the film Prot performs several 'miracles' which convince the other inmates at the Institute, as well as some of Dr Powell's friends and family, that he is indeed an alien. Powell however remains convinced that Prot's delusion is connected somehow to an event in his past, which he must find out before the 'alien' returns to K-Pax. The revelation towards the end of the film is both disturbing and unexpected and we are left as the credits roll up still questioning not only the truth about Prot, but the correctness of Powell's actions in dealing with him. Spacey's portrayal of the often almost satirical Prot is at once funny and believable, and spars well with the cynical Powell. Bridges performs adequately, if at times a little wooden, but this film is more just another opportunity for Kevin Spacey to show what a brilliant and versatile actor he is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While K-PAX wasn't exactly great, it was much better than I thought it would be.  Kevin Spacey once again fits superbly into his character, and Jeff Bridges into his. There's some irony in this film, because Jeff Bridges once played an alien in a film as well. But one reason to see this movie alone is the acting. It really is wonderful. The plot we instantly get into, and we can identify personally with both characters, Prot (Kevin Spacey) an alien from the distant planet 'K-PAX' visiting earth, and Jeff Bridges who at first doesn't believe what Prot says, then becomes less skeptical after some interesting evidence plays on the screen. Both of these characters emotions deep inside are what some people probably could identify with.  If you want a pretty good drama/mystery with great acting, see K-PAX. It surprised me! 3.5/5 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie to be on par with "Man Facing Southeast", the South American film which I can only assume this one is based on. "Man Facing Southeast" is superior in many ways. for one thing, you find yourself going back and forth in your mind as to whether the main character is an alien or a human; several times during that film I changed my mind. Also, the ties he makes with the other patients are more compelling, as is the psychiatrist's home life. In "K- Pax", the psychiatrist's home life seems to get in the way of the bigger story, it borders on cliché. Nevertheless, "K-Pax" is better because it begins by giving us such believable reasons to assume he's an alien; such as when Prot replies to questions about light-speed and astronomy so intelligently. My suggestion: rent both and decide for yourself which is better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A new take on an alien theme: 10/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>K-PAX is an extraordinary, new take on an alien theme. It expands on the mystery of our existence, suggesting a personal, inner connection with beings from other worlds. We start to realize this when we learn from a hypnosis session that the alien Prot travels to Porter whenever the boy is in crisis. And if thoughtfully analyzed, the story is about Prot merging with Porter's body at a moment of great tragedy, reviving it with his spirit and consciousness, and later leaving it again - but as a post-traumatic catatonic body. Throughout the film, we keep guessing whether Prot is an alien or a human who has transformed through trauma - just as the psychiatrist's and our own beliefs about the existence of alien beings are tested. To give us a subtle clue that the two are different people - as the director points out in his DVD commentary - Kevin Spacey had a prosthetic change in his nose between character changes.The promise of a different vision of humanity and its place in the universe is given at the very beginning through the subtle futuristic, otherworldly photography. With its cooling, luminescent blue lighting and slightly hypnotic soundtrack, Grand Central Station appears like a spaceport - suggesting a story opening on new horizons. Prot's detached commentary on our planet: it's surprising, given our sense of morals, that we've made it this far - is a somewhat energizing, healthy look at ourselves from the outside.I give the film 10/10, but one upsetting thing was the absence of visible credits to the writers of the novel and its screen adaptation. I rate as superb Kevin Spacey's unearthly performance and Iain Softley's subtle, innovative directing. But I felt disappointed that `the making of' clip on the DVD had no mention of the creators of the original material and the artful dialog, which I think are pearls deserving to be noted.Thank God, I found that information on IMDB.com! I'm looking forward to reading the book by Gene Brewer.</fullReview>

K-PAX the planet far from here, where sexual inter action is a painful business, and where every K-PAXian knows the same about everything including all the planets evolving around K-PAX. There are no rules and there are no bosses. Traveling at multiple times the speed of light K-Paxians are scedualed for flights in and out K-PAX. It's just brilliantly made up.It's a movie well worth seeing for scifi lovers as well as dramatics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>K-PAX is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Kevin Spacey is great in his role as Prot, a mental patient who seem to have special effects on the rest of the hospital. Jeff Bridges is also good as his role as the psychiatrist who doesn't believe Prot's claim that he is from the planet K-PAX. After seeing some extraordinary things happen to Prot, the psychiatrist starts to believe him.K-PAX is a movie that has multiple twists and turns, and a hangover ending that keeps you guessing. K-PAX makes you feel good about life, and that's what film is all about.My Rating: 10/10</fullReview>

If you've already seen The Man Facing Southeast, don't waste your money, this is almost a verbatim remake, with some of the more humanizing scenes taken out. Fortunately, unlike some previous Hollywood remakes (i.e. City of Angels), the movie's philosophical points aren't changed much, and the ending is fairly similar, although this is slightly more saccharine than the original.</fullReview>

While the original had an air or mystery and wonder about it, this is just another series of sugar-coated homilies about how we should try to appreciate what we have instead of wondering about what else may be out there.

		<shortDescription>neeh.. better go rent the original one...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>most of you probably don't know it, but K-PAX is a copy of an argentinean movie called 'Man Facing Southeast'. The southamerican movie also talks about this very convincing patient who claims to be from another planet and with his special point of view changes the lifes of the people who meet him, both doctors and other inmates. Comparing both movies, the argentinean version creates a more involving environment and thru music and language relates you deeper into the characters delusion. The relation between Jeff Bridges and Kevin Spacey in K-PAX reminds me also a lot Marlon Brando and Johny Depp in 'Don Juan de Marco', another movie about a very interesting patient who convinces the doctor his delusion as an evasion of the reality is not as insane as it seems at first sight. Formally speaking K-PAX has fair performances by both JB and KS, but it's the least you can expect from them. My recommendation is to save 2 hrs of your time, and rather than watching K-PAX go rent Man Facing Southeast, the original movie, wich can be difficult to find, but exceeds in quality and performance (not in production quality) over this poor Hollywood version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When i first heard the idea for this movie i thought it would surely be good, with Spacey perfect for the role. Later i read the book and it only convinced me that surely it would be worth a watch, unfortunately , it didn't live up to expectations. The reason that this book works so well is that is in the style of Oliver Sacks, the psychiatrist who wrote about many fascinating true cases of his own. The movie offers none of this and the normal, is he or isn't he ambiguity is missing right from the start. From the word go, it's obvious to the viewer that PROT is indeed from another planet. Quite why people from another planet should demand that their planets name be in capitals when spelt in English is never explained.In short it's one more case where "the movie is nowhere near as good as the book."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, he's not an alien, his math is all wrong. Travelling six times the speed of light would not allow you to travel a thousand light years distance in seven years of time... more like about 160 years. Also, assuming superluminal travel possible, the relativistic effects of such high speed travel would mean that time on the planet earth would appear to speed up (from the travellers point of view). Therefore Prot would either arrive on Earth long after Porter had experienced a traumatic event, unless Prot possesses a prescience of what's to happen in Porter's life. Despite his seemingly superhuman capabilities... Also, how Porter messages Prot about his anguish is problematic... sms? e-mail? After all, Porter is the mere human.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For everyone who has wondered why aliens always seem to appear in the backyard cornfield of some near-sighted hillbilly, Universal Pictures and Iain Softley proudly present the arrival of planet "K-PAX" alien Kevin Spacey (as "prot") at New York City's Grand Central Station. Clever take-off on your mother's flustered exclamation? Of course, nobody believes Mr. Spacey. He has no spaceship, and claims to have traveled to Earth on a beam of light. Naturally, local police take him directly to a mental hospital...Spacey is put under the care of skeptical psychiatrist Jeff Bridges (as Mark Powell). Mr. Bridges wants to help his patient recover his good senses, but Spacey keeps insisting he is an alien from "K-PAX". This film version of Gene Brewer's novel has definitive answers, but seems to want the door left open a crack; the book is relatively unambiguous. They should have also changed the title. This was an excellent and successful adaptation, but given the personnel and opportunities for sequels, just a little disappointing, too.******** K-PAX (10/22/01) Iain Softley ~ Kevin Spacey, Jeff Bridges, Mary McCormack, Alfre Woodard</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch it for the Superb Performances!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'K-PAX', in many ways, is a confusing film. It starts well and catches your attention, then slips in the middle, than it again picks up, but the finale leaves you slightly confused. More than it's impact as a film, it's the Performances by Academy-Award-Winning Actors, Kevin Spacey &amp; Jeff Bridges, who make this science fiction and mystery film, worth a watch. 'K-PAX' tells the story of a psychiatric patient who claims to be an alien from the planet K-PAX. During his treatment, the patient demonstrates an outlook on life that ultimately proves inspirational for his fellow patients and especially for his psychiatrist. Based on the novel of the same name by Gene Brewer, 'K-PAX' entertains in bits. To give it's due, the concept is truly innovative &amp; catchy. And to an extend, the idea gets it's due, as the First-Hour, is very good. But, the Second-Hour loses pace and reaches to a slightly confusing culmination, which leaves you in mixed emotions. It ends up becoming a half-baked fare, that had a lot of potential. Iain Softley's Direction is good. The Screenplay works in parts. Cinematography, Editing &amp; Art Design are well-done. Performance-Wise: As told, 'K-PAX' packs in two stellar performances by it's lead cast. Spacey is absolutely superb as the patient, while Bridges is impeccable as his psychiatrist. And it's a treat to watch them share such a flawless on-screen chemistry, from start to end. On the whole, 'K-PAX' could have been a much better film, but the performances by Bridges &amp; Spacey alone, are enough to give this film a viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How could I possibly hate any movie Kevin Spacey is in?! He's simply a walking phenomenon that gets to materialize itself in movies every now and then. Not to mention the legendary Jeff Bridges. Don't get me started on this! Well, leaving prejudices aside, K-PAX is a heart-warming story; one that gently allures you to re-think our human behavior and existence. The story is about Prot, a madman who claims to be an extraterrestrial from a faraway planet called X-PAX. Prot is on a mission to explore Earth. During his journey of recovery/exploration, he encounters a lot of people, including his psychiatrist, whose lives he affects deeply. The story employs drama, comedy and even suspense to encompass/touch on all that makes us human. The outstanding, baffling ending leaves some questions unanswered, yet it satisfies the spiritual and dreamy part of our human nature because it leaves us with probability that MAYBE miracles do happens, and hope does exist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as I remember...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember watching this film when I was younger and being quite impressed with it. It recently came up in the TV listings and so I decided to give it a re-watch. It's very different to what I remember, or should I say, parts of it are very different to what I remember. I'll give you my thoughts after this brief summary (summary haters, and those that don't wish to know about the plot, please hop on a beam of light back to K-PAX while I write the next paragraph).When mental patient Prot (pronounced Proat) is admitted to hospital, he comes under the care of Dr. Mark Powell. Prot tells everyone that he is an alien from the planet K-PAX but Dr. Powell doesn't believe him. Unfortunately many of the patients do and they get into a bit of a frenzy when he tells them when he is leaving and that he can take only one of them with him. Now knowing the timescale, Dr. Powell is determined to find the truth about Prot and resorts to hypnotism in order to regress him so he can find clues to his past. He does find something, but is it too late, will Prot leave before he can put all the pieces together? and more importantly, who will he take with him? I'll end my summary there so as not to bring down the wrath of the K-PAX Spoiler Police.This film starts out very promisingly with the enigmatic Prot defying all attempts to get to his truth. I was happy in this fantasy world, but the story takes a turn about half way through that kind of shatters the fantasy and leaves you feeling kind of flat. In the end it becomes much more earth-bound and I (for one) felt kind of cheated by the ending, although it is kind of heart-warming.A great performance from Kevin Spacey as Prot, he fitted the part perfectly. Also worthy of note was Jeff Bridges as Dr, Mark Powell, he did a good job although I felt he wasn't really stretched by this part. Honourable mentions go to; Mary McCormack as Rachel Powell, Alfre Woodard as Dr. Claudia Villars, David Patrick Kelly as Howie, Saul Williams as Ernie and Peter Gerety as Sal.Having liked this one when I first saw it, I was a bit disappointed by the second viewing. Don't get me wrong, it's worth a viewing if you haven't seen it before if just for Spacey's excellent performance. I found it a bit too long at two hours, but it did have a nice soundtrack and there is some excellent cinematography. Recommended? if just for Spacey.My Score: 5.9/10</fullReview>

He effectively directed this nice movie.And cast's performances are considerable.Firstly, Kevin Spacey.I admired to his acting. He is so attractive with his strange attitudes.And the end of the movie is emotional.I like the words which Prot advised to Mark: The universe will be expand.And it will collapse itself.Then it will expand again.It will repeat this process forever.But you don't know is when the universe expands again,Everything will be exist as now. Whatever mistakes you make,this time around you will live through on your next pasts.Every mistake you make,you will live through again and again.Forever.Some i advised you to get it bright true.Because, this time,it is only you have.I strongly recommend you to watch this movie.Cansu Ay from Canakkale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>K-Pax is worth to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I watched it first time in the class, I couldn't understand the film clearly so I watched it once again. The film was certainly worth to watch. Prot had a excellent convincing talent. While watching I really believe that there is a planet like K-Pax. The film is not boring and everyone watch easily. there are no guns, no bombs and despite this the film was very exciting as action films. the film also gives some moral advices. the importance of being human, the values of family were mentioned in the film very good. after the watching film I searched the k-Pax planet on the internet but I couldn't find real things about it.finally after watching film I do not eat bananas anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>K-Pax -Goddess of Peace baring witness to Eirene</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>K-Pax is a useful if not interesting motion picture.The premise as to its underpinning is that an individual now named prot(played by Kevin Spacey)claims to have ancestry not of this world.His claim is that he hails from a planet outside of our solar system and indeed he,prot that is,is here visiting in principal.This initial introduction occurs at Grand Central Station New York City,New York whereby there is an attempt made to appear as if this person in prot arrives as if by a beam of light.It is a rather weak presentation and even more so it is this opinion that they will have to do better than that.I was not convinced and the scene even more so was constructed as a virtual mis-direction with prot being looked at unfairly and treated as unstable when he is removed to a state mental institution.The proof often perhaps if I might suggest only can occur over time which under a medicated state the unstable chemistry is stabilized an the individual then can be reached or so the logic goes.The concept of time is relative here and though time does pass the intelligence that prot brings with him provides for a very intelligent even humanitarian design upon the human kind.Prot seems to be having a very good if not inspiring effect on of all people the other persons who like prot are thought to have questions as to there fitness to live in society.It is worth noting that the guardians are never the ones to be taken over with only the more vulnerable being influenced by Prot.There is no mystery as such as to prot,that is his persona is not of one brooding presence but a persona a bit off center with real indications of more then mere intelligence but of insight.The picture indicates something of this know how of naturally occurring phenomena which prot provides information while all the while proving, as in self evident,that prot has intelligence beyond an ordinary account.His gift peaked the interest of the hospitals psychiatrist and so starts a journey to know better this highly in-tuned being in prot.The picture provides a almost compelling argument as to prots desirability and even more so prot is perhaps a little more than they(the hospital)are accustomed to having to deal with.Dr.Powell(played by Jeff Bridges),head of Psychiatry is intelligent enough himself to understand that what prot is providing is very ingratiating to a most learned accomplishment.Prot has real knowledge even foresight into natural occurring phenomena and though not ordinary his ability is daring if you will to be great,that is what it appears to be about.His position is real and almost rightfully so Dr. Powell goes out on a limb and gets involved with Prot.Prot is invited and joins Dr.Powell and his family and friends at a cook out at Dr. Powells home.Though this is not anything more than a step closer to a real challenge as to prots claim.The afternoon does not go entirely smoothly either though not all is lost as a result.Dr.Powell whose associates are of course other qualified persons as well queries such a friend and asks for a test of sorts as to prots statements.The picture gets interesting as prot writes and responds to these questions written by qualified persons so much so that his responses generate increased interest.Prot is for real to these persons,it is then arranged to have prot appear at what is a recently(re-designed)planetarium.This test if you will is being conducted by a small group of Doctors all being qualified in matters of astronomy,physics and so on.This is the scene whereby Prot now becomes great.He proves the existence of not only K-Pax but he is as well credited with the discovery of a black hole.It is a real demonstration of genius and prot perhaps is it.This is worthy of your viewing pleasure and a discovery is witnessed to,prot indeed deserves perhaps recognition with the discovery of the black hole alone.This is how this picture does something that it could not do otherwise and that was to outsmart the inability to prove otherwise.Prot is making a claim real or otherwise that is up to the challenge and he is great.The picture goes on to pursue further who this person Prot is,it is generally not believed that indeed he is from another planet however perhaps the topic as was suggested Extra Sensory Perception or ESP maybe an answer.There is some evidence that what is established may indeed be provided by an Extra Sensory Perception? Perhaps? Dr. Powell in an attempt to know better than what has already been established chases down a long shot and in so doing seems to have found who he believes prot is.One Robert Porter who by trade worked in Live Stock Slaughter providing what is referred to as a knocker.His home gives further proof of a tragedy which helps explain a number of unsolved items.There is an attempt made as Dr.Powell begins to know better the prot dilemma whereby Prot gives himself a date in which he intends to return to K-Pax.There is here much as in the beginning a good try though earthly bound prot must for now remain.This is not an un-interesting movie and perhaps worth an afternoon as such.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>K-PAX is by no means a bad film it is actually pretty good and at times moving as well as being funny. Kevin Spacey plays a man called Prot who is from another world, Jeff Bridges is the man trying to snap Prot out of his daydream only (shock horror) he begins to doubt his own explanations and thinks there could be some sense to what Prot is saying.The Acting is decent Bridges gives a fine performance and uses a wide range of acting skills. Eerily his character seems like his character from The Fisher King might be like 10 years on.As good as Bridges plays his character he is totally and utterly upstaged by Spacey who gives in my opinion an Oscar worthy portrayal of a man wanting to tell the world of his world but falling in love with our world, Spacey should of at least being nominated for an Oscar for his performance.Iain Softly directs the film with at times magnificent grace but he lets himself down at others by pacing the film terribly and giving no other characters any room to move around in, when they come into the film with important revelations it doesn't seem as important to the viewer as we don't know these characters.Recommended but a similar theme is much thoroughly explained in the much superior The Fisher King. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>K-PAX; a.k.a 'Kevin Spacey tells us what to do'.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kevin Spacey: Actor, sage, guru. I like the guy, I really do, but his character choices always seem to carry with them a certain smugness, even when there's a chance they might be from another planet! There's been innumerable films about an outsider appearing to teach us life lessons, but if we're dealing with an E.T, most of the time the writers at least have the decency to make him three feet tall. Here we never get a fix on the definite answer.I like movies that are open to interpretation, it just annoys me if I sense that the writers haven't figured it out EITHER and are instead counting on the audience to bridge the gaps that they themselves couldn't be bothered to fill. If the director did a DVD commentary and said: 'This was my interpretation', it doesn't stop everyone else coming up with alternative theories, but at least you get a sense of what their overall aim was, and whether or not they succeeded or failed in their task. If no-one knows for sure what they were trying to do, they can always hide behind the claim that they DELIBERATELY left things vague, instead of the ambiguity arising from shoddy plotting. Leaving us on a cliffhanger at the end is fine, suggesting that the story continues after we're done watching. Asking us to polish up the tale as a whole is another matter, and a sign that the affair is directionless. It's infuriatingly lazy when you have people being paid so much money to do their job well.It's easy to spot when the script is settling for convenience, which makes me think that there wasn't really a firm hand on it. Consider for example, the fact that we are told Prot is resistant to powerful drugs such as Thorazine, yet when off-the-cuff hypnosis is tried, he easily slips under at the first attempt?! How fortunate...The backstory felt at times like a shamefully obvious way to wrap up the moral that we should cherish the connections we make in life. Nevertheless, if you don't mind being made to feel inferior by the script, you should at least be able to appreciate the acting on show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raises Questions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There seems to be a trend in Hollywood for directors to center a movie around some plot twist that has its audience thinking. Whether or not the directors believe this leaves the market wanting more is a completely separate issue. Very much in tradition with movies like "Unbreakable", in an apparent attempt to combine intellectualism and entertainment for anti-intellectual America, the story of "K-Pax" has its audience members wracking their brains, but quite a bit more than your average "twisted movie". Firstly, this is done by giving the audience members a greater number of possibilities to consider as to the almighty truth of the matter - whether or not Prote is really an alien being from the planet K-Pax, or a simple farmer named Robert Porter who experienced a traumatizing event that left him out of touch with reality and calling himself an alien. Set conveniently in a mental institution, the audience is allowed some clues as to whom or what Prote actually is. While curing fellow mental patients like no psychologist who has worked there has, Prote was able to win them over as true believers. The scene in which Prote visits Dr. Powell's home and not only greets the family dog, but communicates very briefly with it as well seems to be enough to believe that he is in fact an alien, although one who can reach us on our level, which seems questionable for a highly advanced being we may think. Further evidence of Prote's down-to-earth behavior is given when Dr. Powell places him under hypnosis and asks him to "go back in time" to his childhood and to the cause of his hypothetical illness. At this point, one might stretch one's suspension of belief and say that Prote is an alien, given all the prior evidence, that is able to connect with us on our level but pays the price by being as susceptible as we are to emotions and psychological traumas. With that said, it should be noted that any of a number of theories can be put forth of which no evidence or basis is given in the movie itself. Such as Prote is indeed an alien from the planet K-Pax with absolutely no hostile intentions but was looking for a human body to borrow and so happened to chose Robert Porter, while having the capacity to express itself with an individual touch of humanity. This seems less likely when one bares to light the coincidence of an alien inhabiting a post traumatized man's body and spending the remainder of his visit in a mental hospital. Although this might simply be an exercise in suspending belief. Given the fact that Prote has knowledge beyond reference, according to the astrophysicists, in addition to the lasting effects on all those who knew him, in particular the mental patients and their observations of him, not to mention his knowledge of the exact time and date of his "departure", where Robert Porter turns out to be catatonic in the end, I would conclude that my theory of Prote being an alien inhabitant in Robert Porter's body is the most plausible. In that case, I find the concept of K-Pax to be quite original among science fiction movies, some may even consider its idea quite revolutionary, but may not receive this kind of recognition due to the fact that it lacked any worthwhile message.If there were a message in this movie, it is apparently hidden, I cannot determine anything other than to maybe stop underestimating people. Its purpose, again, ultimately seemed to serve as a starter brainteaser for the average entertainment seeking American.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much like Mork left Ork to come to earth for the second time and visit Mindy McConnell, Prot leaves K-Pax to come to earth for the second time to visit Dr. Brewer, a psychiatrist who thinks that Prot is a crazy human but it becomes increasingly likely that he's the real deal.But there is a mystery to Prot's background, a mystery Dr. Brewer is determined to unravel and the way he does so, with the minimal of clues (always the best in mysteries) is quite clever and interesting.Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges (forever THE DUDE whether he likes it or not) are brilliant as alien and earthling. The whole movie is very beautifully made with wonderful use of rainbow colors, great editing, fun supporting characters and a delightful score by Edward Shearmur. Seriously, if you're stressed then this is THE movie to calm you down.Movies about aliens fascinated by strange earth customs are always enjoyable. Spacey might not be running around wild like the manic Robin Williams, quite the opposite actually, but his grace and dignity are far more than most humans match up to.K-Pax attempts some kind of ambiguity in the ending but if you hang around to the very end of the credits you'll realize that Dr. Brewer is still curious of Prot's origin's despite what his Robert Porter evidence is telling him. The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby/DTS 5.1 sound and loads of interesting extras.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is about Prot who is most definitely an alien, from K-Pax, though none of the viewers actually get to see "The Real Prot". Kevin Spacey isn't actually Prot. Prot exists within Robert Porter. He is the one who saves him from drowning and just before he leaves Earth, he says this to Dr. Mark, "Now that you have found Robert, look after him". When Prot leaves Earth, he exits from the being of Robert Porter and leaves him behind for Dr. Mark and his team to care for because Robert Porter has undergone tremendous trauma (with his wife and child being murdered) and is no longer himself and needs Psychiatric care. At this point Prot also does what he said and takes one person with him, Bess. The movie was good and keeps you guessing till the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reminds me of "The Little Prince"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(There be spoilers here.)Having read Antoine de Saint-Exupery's "The Little Prince" several times, I find "K-PAX" bears strong resemblances to that book. Prot appears from nowhere, insisting he is from another planet. He comes across across Mark, a man who is in danger of losing his son. Mark keeps asking Prot questions, but instead of answers, Prot asks questions in return, causing Mark to think about his own life.When Mark is able to get Prot to respond to his questions, he finds out about a troubled life "back home". Prot is even leaving five years to the day of event (much like the Little Prince left on the anniversary of his arrival). When Prot "leaves", it looks as though he has died, and only a shell remains (the catatonic body). Here, the movie differs slightly from how "The Little Prince" ends: in this film, the body remains, but someone else's body disappears; whereas in the book, the Little Prince's body disappears mysteriously the next day.Both stories end in the same way, though -- the one who has ultimately been saved (Mark) gazes at the stars, looking for the one that his friend circles around on his home planet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the story of a psychiatrists encounter with an alien visiting earth on a fact-finding mission, or is it.Kevin Spacey (American Beauty) plays Prot a researcher from the planet K-PAX. Jeff Bridges (The Big Lebowski) plays Dr. Mark Powell the psychiatrist assigned to evaluate Prot's condition and state of health. Powell's soon begins to question his own diagnoses that Prot is delusional. Is this really a visitor from another world, or is this just a man completely lost in his own world. The story moves between Powell's exchanges with Prot, glimpses in Powell's home life and Prot's encounters with his fellow in mates.I was looking forward to this movie, but was slightly disappointed in it. Maybe I was expecting something different from what I got. The story keeps moving and points an accusing finger at some of society's ills. It has a good blend of humour and drama. It does keep you guessing as to the identity of Spacey's character right up to the last possible minute. However I think that was the problem I had with this one. Too much may have been made of the 'Is he, isn't he' theme. Spacey and Bridges worked well together throughout. It would be easy to give Spacey all the credit, but he is given the more interesting character. Bridges does make you believe that he is just a guy who, although over worked and under pressure, genuinely cares for the people he treats. Spacey again hits the mark with a thought out performance with attention to detail, although he does go a bit far with the banana.Iain Softley (Hackers) keeps it simple. No real use of fancy camera angles, but a lot of use of light for reasons that are made clear early in the plot. Softley's job was made easier for him as Bridges and Spacey would swap rolls and practice scenes during the set up of shots to get the other characters view of the situation. Softley's previous projects have been to say the least, uninspiring. This is however is an improvement.Although I may be give off a slight negative response. I would still recommend this as worth see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't be fooled by Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges' inclusion in this movie - it's only average. It's pretty slow and there are some big plot holes and failures of logic. The director tries his best to make a film that is basically two talking heads visually stimulating, but he can't hide the fact that this is a very slight story with not much to say. Loose ends are manufactured rather pointlessly, and then only just tied up in quite unsatisfying ways (for example, Bridges' character's marriage problems seem to just shrivel up and die with him hardly making any effort at all; and the character of Bess - which could have been pivotal - is instead totally one-dimensional); It's barely funny and sentimental rather than moving. Not bad if you don't mind not being engrossed in a movie, but I kept feeling there were missed opportunities for real humour and pathos in the script. This movie left me with the feeling, not of wonder about the future but that anything interesting connected with these characters happened before film begins.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as emotional as it wanted to be, but still a good watch...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although it does not attain the emotional punch it was attempting, ?K-Pax' still is an enduring and thought provoking film. Kevin Spacey plays Prot, an extra-terrestrial who lands on outer space to report the findings on earth. Deemed a delusional, he lands under the care of Psychiatrist Dr. Mark Powell where our journey begins to uncover whether he really is or is not a being from another planet. While on Earth, Prot affects the beings he surrounds and fills them with hope and glory. This is of course conventional in nature in order for the audience to sympathize with this mysterious and interesting character. And it works, the viewer will sympathize with Prot and the film does a fair job of bringing the viewer into the psychosis of Jeff Bridges' character. If one has followed the career of Jeff Bridges, one knows that no one can play someone as obsessed with the truth as Bridges can (Note: ?Arlington Road', ?Fearless'). Director Iain Softley paints a soothing and enchanting first half of the film as we discover the intelligence of our alien as he encompasses those around him with hope and wonder. The second act of the film is not at all soothing; plot breakthroughs or misdirection occur - depending on how you see it. Bridges' character places Prot under hypnosis and the pieces of the puzzle come together. While these pieces are interpretive and questionable, it is clear that that Softley wants to divide the audience in their view of this whimsical situation. The film is good looking and holds the viewer's attention despite it centrally occurring between our two characters. Yet, while it isn't the best of pictures, it certainly will captivate and hold the curiosity of the viewer for the duration of the film. Based on the Gene Brewer novel, the film contains a mystical score by Edward Shearmur that runs throughout the film that reminds us exactly if we are aware of the topics that are being tackled. Is it about redemption? Hope? Salvation? Furthermore, symbolism has rarely been this apparent as a ray of light is photographed from different angles attempting different interpretations of the truth. All these concepts are observed in this film and no one single solid solution can be deduced with its' interpretive ending. The film's delicate tone and fragile handling will allow for it to be a gentle watch. Do not expect frantic twists of mayhem to ensue. It simply is an entertaining little film that is simply made better by great performances by Jeff Bridges and Kevin Spacey. As the pieces come together in the second hour, so will one's opinion of the film as many will be divided on the outcome of the plot and of the outcome of the film's overall enjoyment.Giancarlo's Rating: **1/2</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You need to buy/rent the Collectors Edition DVD to really have any chance to enjoy this ne'er-do-well film, as the deleted scenes that ended up on the cutting room floor would have made this film a thousand times better. The alternate ending was much better than the one they kept, though still sadly missing the target as this film had such great unrealized potential. The trailers were too vague, the really good plot and storyline had a bad script for an engine; even the title is a horrible miss. Maybe someone will remake this in 25 years and do it right. I would've had more of Jeff Bridges talking into his recorder in a narrative style more often with a better soundtrack and went for the mystery/fantasy side a lot more like Spielberg or Ron Howard would have done and I certainly would have given a better explanation of what happened --- at midnight on a Thursday after a long week, it's hard to stay focused on this film and not feel like key scenes and the ending just passed me by with the feeling of "what the heck just happened here?" Unlike others, I won't spoil the ending, but you or I could have done a much better job with the film editing &amp; writing. This film had great potential and missed tragically; not as bad a miss as "The Talented Mr. Ripley" &amp; "Dead Poets Society" but certainly a tragic miss anyway. The script has big holes in it from the very beginning scene --- it's extremely clear that Spacey wasn't to blame in the opening scene, and why do the cops not believe the wheelchair dude, then ask him his opinion before they leave like they know him well? It's ridiculous. The nuts were not nutty enough nor funny enough to be likeable nor become a part of the story in the tradition of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest", but you see some of the influence of it here. And the acting was not very inspired. This film idea could have been an Oscar contender, instead, it's Oscar Meyer, a wiener instead of a winner. But I still gave it a 6 for its sheer potential and the basic plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>K-Pax is said to be a planet a thousand light years from earth where a fellow called Prot reckons he came from. Prot (Kevin Spacey) has been locked up in a Manhattan psychiatric ward for his troubles.  His psychiatrist Mark (Jeff Bridges) is intrigued by Prot because this patient is so convincing. Prot is claiming that he'll be leaving on a light beam for K-Pax in a few weeks. In the meantime Prot starts to treat and cure his fellow patients.  The patients look and behave like casting extras from One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest and they're certainly convinced by Prot, especially when he tells them that he might take one of them with him back to K-Pax on a moon beam.  Prot, in the best scene in the movie, is taken to a Planetarium where he adroitly sketches the orbits of his double sun star system, much to the amazement of the astronomers, one of whom just happens to be Dr Mark's brother in law. Jeff Bridges starred some years ago in a similarly themed film called Starman, (a far better movie than K-Pax). Bridges then played the alien and this spaceman was in big trouble. He's dying and must get to his spaceship to survive. It's a weapie for a creepie. K-Pax on the other hand has Prot well in control but his psychiatrist undergoing spiritual decay, as I'd imagine would be endemic for most Manhattan shrinks. Starman had a love story grafted onto it and maybe that sort of ploy would have had us care a bit about Prot. We're left instead with a rather supercilious central character, a mob of struggling psychotics and a delusional medico. It doesn't work.One Wild Eyed Fly Out Of Five</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brilliant Movie With A Brilliant Message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kevin Spacey is an alleged mental patient named Prot who claims to be from another planet (K-Pax) and Jeff Bridges is Dr. Mark Powell who tries to diagnose and treat his mental disturbance. Jeff Bridges begins to have daily sessions with Prot in the same way he does with other patients. However, he soon discovers that Prot is a remarkable person with sharp observations and comments about humanity. In addition, Prot demonstrates some other skills (x-ray vision, writing down the co-ordinates of his planet with scientific formulas and communicating with dogs) which pretty much show that he might be from another planet. Jeff Bridges gets confused because he cannot re-concile these improbable facts with his scientific knowledge. He neither can refuse Prot's extraordinary abilities nor the fact that he is from K-Pax. In the meantime, Prot develops unusual relationships with most of the patients in the hospital who, unlike Dr. Markwell, have no difficulty in believing that Prot is from K-Pax. Patients even start a writing contest in the hospital to get beamed to K-Pax with Prot. Dr. Markwell's attention directed to the date which, according to his calculations based upon the date of Prot's alleged arrival on earth, is exactly 5 years from the date which Prot claims he will be beamed to K-Pax. He becomes convinced that something happened on that day which caused Prot to lose his mental health and if he cannot help him before the date on when he will be beamed, he will lose Prot forever. As a last hope to find out about that ordeal, he practises hypnosis to retrieve the memories What I like: K-Pax is a movie full of philosophical messages about humanity and life, most of which are essentially Nietzschean (eternal recurrence, re-valuation of all values, weaknesses of human race). These messages are given quite clearly through the dialogues of Prot with Dr. Powell. It is asserted that we humans are very narrow-minded creatures with one-dimensional perspective on life. We also lost the ability to be amazed by the simple things in life, such as the sight of a bird in the bushes or the joy of a fruit salad. We invented concepts like family and social structure which we accept to be the basis of humanity but we get lost in those concepts because we forgot to be ourselves and lost our connection with the inner-self. The main message, which is the answer to the great puzzle about the true origin of Prot is, equally philosophical. K-Pax is NOT a typical Hollywood movie where everything is spelled out for the audience;. It will make you think. If you really want to know where Prot is originally from you have to think 2 dimensional. What I didn't like: I prefer to interpret the messages communicated by artistic cinematic language, not to receive them directly in the dialogue format as it was the case with Prot's dialogues with Dr. Powell. I also didn't like some scenes, especially the starting scene where Prot gets arrested for trying to help an elderly woman who has been just mugged even though the witnesses, including the victim herself, testify that he had nothing to do with it. This was such a cheap scene. They could have come up with more enjoyable scenes and a better sense of humor especially regarding Prot's unfamiliarity with the planet earth. The screenplay, in my opinion, fails to take full advantage of this situation which could have been used as a basis for many funny / interesting moments. A Tip: Prot's answer to the question, "If you are from K-Pax, then why do you look like a human?" which is, "I look like a human because I am on earth; if I were in K-Pax, I would look like a K-Paxian" is something that the audience should keep in mind until the end for it holds the key to the mystery whether Prot is from K-Pax or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-developed story saves K-PAX from pretension</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Name: Kevin Spacey.Occupation: Actor.Diagnosis: Early stages of `Robin Williams Disease.' (Also known as `Robert Redford Disease.')Symptoms: Will agree to play roles only of characters who are too good for this world. They lack any discernible faults, unless carrying the woes and sorrows of the humanity upon one's shoulders is considered to be a character flaw. Notes: Kevin Spacey is a great actor and was well deserving of the 1999 Oscar for best actor for his role in American Beauty. But it may have gone to his head.What made American Beauty so great was that Spacey's character was decidedly flawed -- a middle class family man going through one Mother of a middle age crisis.His most notable role since then was in the incredibly contrived Pay It Forward. In this movie, he's a teacher with a burn scar that covers half his face, the wound inflicted by a father who set him on fire. Oh, please...(Spacey did play a compelling character, a temperamental salesman, in The Big Kahuna, but beyond a lot of theatrics, absolutely nothing happened in this movie. Paint drying is not an art form).In K-PAX, his latest project to hit the screen, Spacey plays Prot, a man who claims to be an alien from the distant planet K-PAX, thus landing him in a psychiatric ward. His psychiatrist, played by Jeff Bridges, has diagnosed him as delusional, but is also secretly convinced that Prot may really be a being from another planet.Once again, Spacey walks very close to the edge of pretension. More than just a few moments of K-PAX consist of our alien visitor lecturing the good doctor about the shortcomings of us earthlings while not curing all in the ward of their various psychological ailments.It's almost as if Spacey was not satisfied with playing a supporting role to the Christ figure in Pay It Forward and more or less decided to play Christ himself.Fortunately, as close as K-PAX comes to falling down the slippery slope into the pit of suckiness, it never quite teeters over the edge. Based on the book by Gene Brewer of the same name, K-PAX turns out to be a very well developed story augmented by a taught musical score, strong directing -- and some exemplary acting by Spacey.In other words, K-PAX provides good reason to make yet another movie about some guy who may or may not be a creature from outer space and Spacey was a good choice for the main role. Yes, it did occur to me that the way I've approached this review may have been a little pretentious in itself. But we're not talking about me, we're talking about someone else right now, and that someone would be well-advised to keep his ego in check. Best actor is a big award, but when all is said and done, the Oscar is just a trophy (of some guy without any clothes on at that).Soon to make it into the cinemas will be The Shipping News. For this one, Spacey packed on 25 pounds to play a portly `third rate reporter' who returns to his roots in Newfoundland to reclaim his life.After reading the novel of the same name by E. Annie Proulx, which was hilarious, I'll make a point of seeing this movie. And while I'm there, I'll be looking for signs that Spacey has finally come back down to earth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can't connect with any of these characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just came home from seeing "K-Pax". I have to report that I am no longer in love with Kevin Spacey. (I'll bet he's disappointed.) This movie was technically good, and had a certain intellectual appeal in that there were NO memorable special effects, explosions, car chases, or anything of that ilk. In fact, my companions and I were startled to see a 'stunt double for Jeff Bridges' in the credits.The plot was moderately interesting; at least it is the only one of its subclass this year. However, at the end I had some problems reconciling the evidence with either of the proposed interpretations of the truth about Prot. Instead of either interpretation seeming plausible, neither did.I had some peevish complaints. In rural New Mexico a decent house does not become a shack after a mere five years of neglect. Also, I wish film makers would apply local pronunciation of place names unless it's necessary to the plot.My main problem with the movie is that it was essentially cold-blooded. I could not engage with either of the two main characters (and the others were too underdeveloped). Spacey's tendency, as Roger Ebert puts it, "to play the smartest character in each of his movies" has backfired here -- Prot comes off as condescending. He doesn't seem to really like people (perhaps he really DID come to our planet for the produce!) The "high emotion" scenes felt too much like watching acting exercises in a master class.For an example of a movie in which the doctor &amp; delusional patient relationship really worked, I'd recommend renting "Don Juan DeMarco". I remember that movie fondly. This one I won't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ham-handed, vaguely moralizing, middle-of-road Hollywood puffery; unoriginal, unmemorable. Kevin Spacey plays, get this, a cool-detached guy floating above the consciousness of those around him. Jeff Bridges perfectly portrays "the Jeff Bridges character" -- affable, in control, somewhat conflicted, a little boring -- acting in another film of little consequence.Should you accept the role of paying audience member, be sure to stretch and do a few calisthenics beforehand -- you'll be asked to suspend disbelief many, many times. Patients on a mental ward somehow go missing for days, they mysteriously join forces on four floors to riot over the appearance of a computer-generated bird, and a deeply perplexing mystery unfolds with all the cleverness and subtlety of a Scooby-Do episode. If only there was some deep, insightful message of overriding worth that justified all the hokum. Ah well, it's a Jeff Bridges movie after all...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>K-PAX was the first movie I'd seen in a theatre in about 4 months. I really liked Kevin Spacey's work in it, and several of the mental patients gave nice performances (David Patrick Kelly). Bridges was so-so, but good enough for the part.I guess the funny thing about this movie is that while it was emotionally involving (I felt myself tearing up a couple of times), I couldn't tell what the point was. There is a voice-over by Kevin Spacey at the end that I considered completely unnecessary.Basically, the whole thing was good, with well done characters, but lack of direction a-la Pleasantville.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Book to screenplay fairly faithful;interesting remake of MAN FACING SOUTHEAST</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking newlandscapes, but in having new eyes." Marcel ProustI, like Paul Schneider, saw this at an advance screening at CWRU.When I heard a couple weeks earlier that we would be having thisfilm, I looked it up, read the plot excerpt and said "Hey! This is thesame plot line as the original screenplay for the1986 ArgentinianMAN FACING SOUTHEAST!" And I see at least one other commenter noted this. So I mentioned that in the "movierecommendations" for both.K-PAX was adapted from the 1995 book of the same name byGene Brewer. Did Gene ever see MAN FACING SOUTHEAST ? Dunno. Are the plot lines similar? Extremely. Are the storiesdifferent? Well, yes and no. You can't copyright an idea. As Goethesaid "Everything's been thought of before; the trouble is to think of itagain." Just as LIFE AS A HOUSE is a remake of IKURU, it's adifferent story, although the plot lines aren't nearly as similar. The transition from book to screenplay was rather faithful, with theline from ALIEN intact, the comment about produce and the patientpopulation. There was a little feel of Tennessee Williams with onepatient that wasn't in the book - I thought that was a nice literarytouch.***Possible spoilers***There were a couple plot lines altered - the doctor in the book hasbeen married only once, a subplot with a free-lance reporter whoeventually turns up Robert Porter is missing, and prot's departurewas handled better in the film I thought - and the book deals well(as the film could not) with K-paxian spelling and pronunciation(page 6 for the curious).Whether you liked this film or not, it's worth the time to check outMAN FACING SOUTHEAST if only to get a feel for the differentsensitivities (or lack thereof by the comments of some;) of NorthAmerican and South American cinematic art.As to prot's true identity? I liked Willy Calloway's observations,although I may not totally agree with them. What I would add is to think of the significance of the reflectedimages of prot and the doctor merging into each other.You also might be interested in knowing Gene Brewer has just(2001) come out with another book: ON A BEAM OF LIGHT. Thelibrary catalog I looked at had 5 classifications: Psychotherapist &amp;patient fiction; Life on other planets fiction; Multiple personalityfiction; New York fiction; Psychological fiction; Science fiction.If K-PAX does well (and I'm betting it will) I think we may have moreBrewer-inspired films</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three amazing actors with no where to go.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You have to wonder what was so interesting about this project that drew such big talents to it. It wasn't that the movie had no promise, but I think I can say that without the star power that it has, it wouldn't do very well. Kevin Spacey, Jeff Bridges and Alfre Woodard star in this film about a "space-man" and his last days on Earth. The majority of the film takes place in a psychiatric ward in Manhattan. Here, we meet a selection of quirky inmates and a few semi-defunct psychiatrists. The story unfolds as a new patient--Prot from K-Pax (played by Kevin Spacey)--tells his story to a psychiatrist (Jeff Bridges). I would describe more of the plot in detail, but there are several key-points that shouldn't be shared to those of you who haven't seen it yet. So, in respect for the future movie-goer, I'll jump right to a review. The movie was clever and sometimes cute. But, looking at the movie in its entirety, that's about as much as you get. There are no funny feelings in your tummy, or "damn!" moments. All you really get are a series of subdued, mediocre moments. Much of the drama is downplayed, and is only occasionally heightened by an upward swell of the music or a closeup of Spacey's contorting face. However, the movie has many fine qualities which must be explored. The technical aspects--ie, the editing and cinematography--are interesting, and sometimes brilliant. Also, the score marvelously enhances the cryptic yet spacy (no pun intended) atmosphere of the film. Add to that a new "written/produced/performed by" song from Sheryl Crow and you have a nice overall movie-going experience. I would, however, have to ask that you go into this movie with mid-grade expectations. It was enjoyable, but it lacked the "umph" that we've come to expect from talents like this. In addition to this, Alfre Woodard is in a completely thankless role as the head psychiatrist. Although she exudes the same sophisticatd pinache that she would normally, her part is underwritten and largely superlative. It sounds like I'm completely bashing the film, but believe me I'm not. It was enjoyable, and, it would be a great Friday-night-at-the-movies experience. But, if you're expecting something, I don't know, stunning, you may have to settle for high class mediocrity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a great movie about an alien coming to earth but the alien is just like a human being, so they put him in a mental institution, but after some sessions he says things that even his doctor is going to be convinced he is a real alien. Unlike so many movies in this category you see nothing strange and unexplainable, just facts. He has a very strong influence on other patients, he says things to them that make them better, everyone like him, and all the patients believe in him. He says he will bring back just one patient if he/she wants to come.At the end he changes the way the doctor thinks about everything around, although he's not believed him. A very good quote was when prod said: "the earth has enough life to fill 50 planet but they don't use it wisely".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since I would give Gene Brewer's homonym book this movie was based on a 10/10, I rated the movie as high as successful I think the adaptation was, comparing them as much as I could within the word limit.Lovely soundtrack, the way they used light and colour to refer to prot's special vision and light travels was beautiful and most of the people looked and acted just like I thought. Kevin Spacey was terrific ? three for him out of the six stars, one for the music, one for the cinematography and one for the good scenes ? but Bridges with his patronising attitude was so different from the novel's doctor that I didn't mind his name changed. Neither his wife was "wonderfully understanding" as in the book, and seeing the other main female character, Villers even worse made me wonder what kind of experiences the scriptwriter must have had with women.I think the parts true to the novel were fine due to it being excellent, this review is mainly about the changed ones, so further reading is recommended only to those who have already seen the film.SPOILERS!A general problem was the book's very finely tuned ambiguity ruined: in there both theories had equal plausibility, which prevented disappointment over the unanswered ending, unlike it happened in the movie.The patients' behaviours only made sense knowing the novel (for example, the way Howie's tasks worked). The dog's scene went wrong too: she wasn't fear aggressive as in the book, so it made no sense when the guests got worried about her coming, and when Steve said she never liked "anyone" (strangers, he should have said)."Let me tell you what your alternative is. A trip to a place where they'll stick a needle in your ass every morning which may or may not leave you with a stupid grin on your face for the rest of your days" says Mark to prot. The novel's psychiatrist never insulted, belittled and threatened him like that but worse is that this is one, but not the only reference to the 1986 Argentinean movie Man Facing Southeast. In it Rantes, a patient of a mental institute believing he is an alien, is finally given anti-psychotic injections. The first one is given in his bottom then his condition starts to deteriorate, stages include a stupid grin on his face. Shame that in comparison to the book it was based on, K-PAX the movie had parts added or altered to make it similar to MFS (for example, the doctor's family setup: two young children, son he refuses to phone, wife he can't get on with) without giving credit so they ended up in a lawsuit with the author of the novel dragged in.One consolation is that K-PAX is good advertising for it. I only heard about, bought and watched MFS because it was mentioned in these reviews, which is a shame because it's well good (I gave it 9 stars in the review I've just posted about it), as good as the K-PAX novel but better than the movie due to the errors in the latter.The hypnosis scenes went wrong the most. Erroneous (the risk ? abreaction ? is not necessarily related to regression, and is worth to take as anyone hypnotises is supposed to know how to deal with it) and it ruins the book's work to dispel myths about hypnosis. For example, to show that a person in trance can look like and act as in waking state, prot is asked at start to open his eyes. Not in the movie.In the book the doctor informs 56 times about prot's body language and 29 times about of others, sometimes describing the signals as barely perceptive or detective ? and in the movie the physician has to warn him to read prot's body language and prot to announce that he wanted a break?!? And apparently the filmmakers tried to save time wrong way: prot skipped six years when he was asked to move two weeks forward. And how could prot be Robert's protector (after all, his name could as well have been derived from this word) if he breaks down remembering the murder (where originally the little girl was raped as well, why to tame it down?).The camera giving out was ridiculous ? what about showing instead the security guy taking eyes off the screen? And when prot was found in his room within seconds it so ruined the ending. In the novel it greatly added to the mystery of his character that they couldn't find him for hours and he could get in the room of Bess, and it was a lot better way to indicate that he had something to do with her disappearance than the patients pointing it out, which even made a reviewer think that she existed only in their imagination.Some of what I liked:The parts with only music on, and prot looking around, like when he was at the Powells or in the car. The planetarium ? however much different it was I think it's the scene represents the book's atmosphere the best.The novel never reveals what exactly prot says to people that gains trust in minutes, so I was very impressed to see that the movie, though maybe demystifying him a bit, provided some great examples! At times the movie put just as much effort as the book did into small details, for example, when the website address they looked up Robert's report on or the caption underneath his graduation picture was so clear to see.The Robert scenes were amazing ? I'll never forget the one when he washed his hands at the sprinkler crying?In summary I think the good scenes, even being in minority, are good enough to outweigh the bad, making the movie definitely enjoyable if the messed-up parts are disregarded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is Something Wrong With The Last 5 Minutes !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lovely movie for sure. It's more like a mix of (What About Bob) in which the psychiatrist has a patient who just loves life and goes into the doctor's family, and also (Starman) starring (Jeff Bridges) himself where the extraterrestrial alien is more sensitive and human than the humans themselves (They stopped making fantastic movies for the sake of innocent and poetic meanings, as this one, since the 1980s). Furthermore it reminded me of similar movies like (Don Juan DeMarco) or (Holy Man) where a person alleges another character, believing in himself as a better man, as a perfect escape from inner pain.First off, it has a magical direction, with simple message : "live the love, have a dream, overstep your pain, and be alive". Visually the doctor's transforming into another point of view through his patient's thoughts had been done so sweetly with gentle tune and soft images. No wonder since director (Iain Softley) has so sentient eye for such miniature artistic details; he assured it before in (The Wings of the Dove - 1997).The 2 leads give a performance that won't make you settle ever (who was better than the other ?). Sometimes (Ed Shearmur)'s music score was dreamier than the movie itself. I loved the moments of discovering the truths, but the best of all was the journey of that doctor to understanding the greatness of family, love, sex or simply all what he has and forgets its value. Scriptwriter (Charles Leavitt), who 5 years ago wrote also (The Sunchaser - 1996), seems interesting in the character of a doctor from the middle class who has been always influenced profoundly by totally different, originally sick, man.This smart movie's stupidity was in the end of it, leaving us with many unanswered questions. OK, the script added 4 proofs along the way to assure that (Kevin Spacey)'s character is an alien (his disappearing while his claim that he went to Iceland, his ability of defining the plant's move, his confession to the doctor, and the disappearing of Bess), actually this is totally naive as all of that turned out to be pure humbugs since we knew clearly his reality as seriously wounded farmer, a husband and a father who lost his wife and daughter together. So this deliberate confusion I deem it just a lousy commercial trick, the movie itself presented and denied it in the same time ! It failed in making any thrilling moments, and if it was made only to keep you asking later bewilderedly about it as a lasting mystery "like another (Anastasia - 1956)" then it's so artless and weakened the whole thing cheaply. Also, I didn't like the notion of (Spacey)'s character being an alien before his marriage; that was such a desperate attempt to cling to the movie's fanciful side (after destroying it already by the factual facts !). You can deny that easily since the character of the friend in the memories/the genius farmer himself was 17 year old in 1985, and according to the movie's own theory this farmer invented the character of the alien to flee from facing his huge pain after the raping, the killing, and the revenge. It's completely a figment of his imagination that he lived, even in his subconscious, to help him out all the time to disavowal the farmer's life, family and torture.This end bothered me the most, like they didn't know how to finish what they began properly ! It didn't specify the essence of K-Pax for everybody (loving the others, life is holy, the courage in front of death, belonging to love).. I know, this is the viewer's job to do after, but something was unsettled in the lesson itself.Still adorable though, standing with rare, very few, ones during the 2000s like (The Astronaut Farmer - 2006) as ones of the 2000s' most 1980s' movies !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ambiguous plot leaves one with mixed feelings.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>K-Pax was a film I only knew of by way of reputation, none of what I had heard was respectable. Of course, it landed in with the gems of late night cable, and like any decent insomniac does, I decided to watch it, keeping in mind I probably saw an edited version.The essential plot of K-Pax is the story of Prot (pronounced 'Prote'), as either a man of great delusion or an alien of great patience who is sent to a psychiatric institution. Spacey works his usual magic with the role, making Prot likeably bizarre. He makes friends with the other patients in the loony bin, and is polite and responsive to the doctors; remarkably successful in both accounts. He cures a hypochondriac and stuns astronomers without missing a quiet mannered beat behind those dark sunglasses.The problem I had however, lies with how the script tries to portray Prot. At first, the plot seems to assure us in all manners that he is nothing short of a full blown alien (his uncanny knowledge of uncharted regions of the galaxy, his sensitivity to light and so on.) Then it falters, and decides more matter-of-factly that Prot is a human suffering from mental illness. It bounces back and forth this way all the way up to the end.I won't tell you how the movie ends, and I'll leave you up to your own devices to form an opinion. To me, it seemed as if the movie was confused with itself, but it was too simplistic and direct with its presentations of both arguments to really pull off its desired effect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Einstein was a fool? (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie because Spacey just won me over in "The Usual Suspects" (1995). This is clearly not a "stronger" or more dramatic film, but it IS basically a film about hard-core evolution theory. As someone wrote, "the whole alien-in-a-human-body scheme has been played to death", but this film introduces concepts I had not even suspected of.First, Prot indulges on produce from the good shrink's office - peels and all! Crazy, you say? If Prot IS from a superior species, he CLEARLY wants to keep his abducted body in TOP SHAPE. Clean fruit peels are LOADED with anti-bacterial agents - many societies cook and eat banana peels!Next, our self-proclaimed Alien stresses that he has NO family in K-pax. Reproduction for them is an EXCRUCIATING, horrible experience (ALL the "fun" is removed). The institution of MOTHER/FATHERHOOD is nulled by this pain and the children are NOT loved (or spoiled) by their biological parents. In "his" planet, "everyone" is family, and children belong to ALL (and travel a lot!)- Perhaps if this was the case for us our own demographics would begin to fall and "our" children would have superb educations. Then references are made to Jesus Christ and Buddha - and how LITTLE attention THE PLANET has paid to them - How we talk ceaselessly about peace while sharpening our swords anytime someone parks in our spot. Prot exposes this practice as plum stupid."A chair - what a fascinating concept" sneers Prot. This drove me crazy until I noticed that WE are the only species that uses them. How did Prot get here? Here's where Einstein's special relativity theory takes flight (out the window, that is) as Prot "educates" the viewers about "tachion speeds" - 6+ times light speed-. About harnessing the UNREAL power of a light beam, and then digitizing your own matter to "ride" in it. Scientists have toyed with teleportation for a number of years, and believe some day it will arrive. Since matter is just another form of energy, you should be able to transport a Consciousness in a beam of light. It's just a matter of learning to "DIGITIZE" and "undigitize" ourselves, right? I think this last alien wonder can only be achieved SPIRITUALLY. The author states this clearly upon Prot's self-induced departure on a "beam of light" - although "changing" bodies for the trip home. No device of any type was shown or even discussed. And it makes sense - the human spirit(some call it "mind") can suspend objects in thin air and remote-see events. Maybe our evolution is supposed to be not so much physical as spiritual....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting and nicely crafted, but lacking depth.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An interesting film with a good performance from both Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges. Both are excellent actors with charisma galore, but poor Spacey is restricted within the confines of a character with little outward emotion and it almost seems like he walks through it, he's either bored by every minute or enjoying himself, it's difficult to tell.The story is a very good one and provides for a good few twists and turns, keeping the audience guessing throughout the movie, and even at the end. Although there aren't a great number of surprises, just gentle realisations.The premise is that the latest patient for the psychiatrist Dr Mark Powell is proving difficult to diagnose after "appearing" in the middle of a crowded train station. He claims that he's from another planet and just visiting, gathering information for his report to take back with him. Planning to leave in the next few weeks after being on a five year visit. Dr Powell continues his treatment as normal, understanding that he's merely delusional and perhaps under the influence of a second personality. However, slowly things change and he begins to wonder if he really is what he claims.A good enough story I thought, and I enjoyed the gentle turns, but I felt it really only smoothed over the surface of many of the issues it highlighted, and I really do feel that more could have been done to enter the characters and what made them the way they were.Ultimately though it is a good story, enjoyable and the ending gives plenty of satisfaction mixed with a gentle dribble of surprise. It does leave you a little confused and curious at the end, as all good movies should, with questions turning around in your head.I feel that if it weren't for these two major names this script might never have made it. It definitely does leave you feeling that there is a lack of meat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges were not the best choices for this movie. The lead role should have been filled by an unknown actor, not a recent Oscar recipient. An unknown actor would have made it even more mysterious. To some people, this movie experience was about seeing Spacey the person, not the character he was playing. They should have called it K-Spacey. Spacey was just a distraction from the story. And it's hard to accept Bridges in a serious role. He looks like he should be a patient, not a doctor. The mix of patients was pretty interesting, but I doubt a real mental institution is anything like what we saw in the movie. The story was not all that original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"K-PAX" is all about a spaced out Spacey character who eats bananas in the peel, is photophobic, and claims to be from another planet some 1000 light-years away from ours. Hmmm. The film stumbles over plot holes as a workaholic psychiatrist (Bridges) tries to find the source of the Spacey delusion which only seems to become increasingly futile as the film wears on leading us to wonder if this guy is a real space traveler or a fraud. In the end, the film manages to pull itself into something more than a morass of nonsequiturs and contrivances and leave us with a high-minded albeit a trite message and a theory. "K-PAX", which runs a tad long given its wispy story, is a good shoot with nominal entertainment value if you allow your left-brain to look the other way while you suspend disbelief, a sometimes daunting task. The film will probably be most enjoyed by sci-fi junkies, Trekkies, and the like.</fullReview>

I loved this movie for about an hour and a half, but then, BAM!! I was hit with quite possible the single worst ending there may ever be for a movie.

		<shortDescription>Why This Movie Misses Greatness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to like this movie. I really did. Even though I saw "Man Facing Southwest" years ago, I was ready to go back to the same plot again, hoping that an American slant on the "Is he crazy or really an alien?" plot might take the story new places.And once again Hollywood has chickened out on me.Don't blame Kevin Spacey or Jeff Bridges. Both gave top-notch performances, taking their roles as far as humanly possible within the constraints of the script. Spacey in particular was spectacular to watch, and would have deserved at least an Oscar nomination. If the studio hadn't let him down.*MILD SPOILER ALERT*See, this movie cheats. And how it cheats is, it clearly has Prot (Spacey's character) doing things that humans can't do. The ultraviolet vision and the knowledge Prot demonstrates at the planetarium alone would have resulted in Prot being pulled out of the mental hospital and into some kind of government custody. Does anything like that happen? Hell, no. Everybody stares at Prot in amazement - and then in the next scene nobody seems to remember that Prot has done a single thing out of the ordinary. Folks, YOU DON'T INTRODUCE THESE ELEMENTS INTO THIS STORY AND THEN JUST WALK AWAY FROM THEM!But this movie does. Because, you see, the suits in L.A. wanted it both ways. They wanted to hook the science fiction fans, so they left in the clues that Prot was an alien to satisfy that part of the audience. And they didn't want those who laugh at the thought of E.T.s to be upset, so they subsequently undercut essential elements of the plot to satisfy THAT part of the audience.*END OF MILD SPOILER* So this leaves us with a movie that has multiple personalities as severe as some of the patients in the film's mental hospital. And as a result, in the end the movie fails both audiences - and itself.Because if this movie, and the studio that made it, had had the courage to commit to one or the other of this movie's possible endings, then this movie would have automatically been a better movie. Hey, I'm happy for the people who got such a lift out of coming to their own conclusions about who Prot really was. I have no problem with the fact that some people found K-PAX uplifting. But to me this movie chopped it's own legs out from under itself, just to play it safe. And that kind of bugs me.So, you ask yourself, have I learned my lesson? Is it finally time for me to turn my back on Hollywood and American movies?Call me crazy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm baffled by all the positive comments on this film - I can't remember a movie I've loathed as much as K-Pax. This movie is even more despicable, inane and unwatchable than "The Thomas Crowne Affair" remake. I can't say it's as blatantly incompetent as "Battlefield Earth," but it is even more irritating, as there's nothing so bad in K-Pax that it's funny - it's just painfully bad. Slow and ponderous to the point of absurdity, laughably predictable and cliche-packed, incompetently and grossly manipulative, K-Pax's paint-by-numbers script and morbidly flat direction are insults to intelligence and emotional health. Maybe this is the "sci-fi" film for the Pay It Forward crowd, but I've seen more clever, sincere and nuanced After-School Specials. And even if you like Spacey and Bridges (personally, I'm a huge fan), Spacey comes off as smarmy and irritating throughout the picture and Bridges is simply wasted.If you liked "The Thomas Crowne Affair" and "Pay It Forward," then by all means see K-Pax. For everyone else, try something like "The Fisher King" or "Harvey" instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imagine that you are sitting in a dark room illuminated by barely any light. Then imagine that somebody immediately and without warning turns on a bright light. That hurts; That effect is similar to annoying flash photography. Your pupils, having adjusted to the low-light conditions are flooded with light and then must constrict. Another effect is that you get a headache. Then imagine that that same somebody then turns off the light, forcing you to refocus your eyes so he can repeat the process.Watching K-Pax was an experience in the above sort of SLOW mild torture. The typical long scene in K-Pax, repeated at least three times, involved psychiatrist Jeff Bridges talking to patient Kevin Spacey in a dark room. Spacey would be surrounded in shadow, while the room's sole light source always sat behind Bridges. Cut to Spacey, dark. Cut to Bridges, bright. Cut to Spacey, dark. Bridges interrupts, bright. Cut back to Spacey...In a theater, the effect overwhelms your eyes, and not in a good way. Director's cheap lighting tricks distract you from major plot points. For this reason, I suggest that K-Pax might best be seen on television.</fullReview>

If you like Sci-Fi don't go see this movie. It's not Sci-fi, just hyped that way with the previews and trailers.Don't sit in the front of the theater for this movie, the close-ups (and there a lot of them) will make your eyes wished they were closed. Which mine did on several occasions waiting for something to happens. I don't know what the director had in mind with all the close-ups. Unless he just needed to add time to the movie.Don't see this in the theater, use your TV when it comes out in video. Then you can see it on the small screen, and fast forward past the close-ups.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>************SPOILERS AHEAD***********"K-Pax" is not as fascinating as I thought it would be (until the final act), but it left me pondering all sorts of questions. The film is filled with a lot of "talking head" scenes, which gets boring at times, and I kept wishing we could at least see some flashbacks of Prot living on K-Pax as he tells his stories, but when you see the ending it all makes sense. I might even give the film another look, to see if there are any clues I missed. The first two acts contain a little too much scientific mumbo-jumbo, and since science wasn't and isn't my favorite subject, I was a little bored from the jargon. I mostly liked the interactions between Prot and the fellow patients at the mental hospital. Since he's normal, compared to the rest of them, they actually think he'll return to his home planet, K-Pax, and they even come up with an essay contest to decide which person (because only one is allowed) will go with him. They seem to be the only ones who give Prot the respect he deserves, other than Jeff Bridge's character.But the ending was a definite surprise and left me thinking. That's always a good sign. So it's established that Prot is actually Robert Porter, who in 1995 drowned himself after murdering the psycho who raped and murdered his wife. This is when the movie started to reminded me of "Angel Eyes," in which we're faced with a character who has a past he won't reveal, because he wants to start a new life on a clean slate. And someone else mentioned that the scene in which Prot/Robert Porter appeared out of nowhere in Grand Central Station could've just been the homeless man's hallucination. I had a hunch that might've been the case. After all, if Grand Central Station was packed with those many commuters, how come the homeless man was the ONLY one to notice a guy appearing OUT OF NOWHERE? New Yorkers face some weird stuff each and everyday, but I'm sure that would've gotten a bunch of heads turning. So I felt that was a great example of the film's foreshadowing. However, we're still not sure whether or not Prot really did return to his planet. Because if you notice, at the very end of the movie, Robert Porter is a complete vegetable. So I'm thinking maybe Prot was a being from another planet and used his body as a vessel. The ending is never clearly explained, but I think it worked out better that way. It's better to leave it open-ended, and have the audience leave the theater discussing what they feel really happened. "K-Pax" is an uneven, somewhat dragging film, but it's also moving and thought-provoking. As I said, I'll probably give it another look, and who knows? I might like it even better the next time. My score: 7 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>K-Pax (2001): Dir: Iain Softley / Cast: Kevin Spacey, Jeff Bridges, Mary McCormack, Alfre Woodard, David Patrick Kelly: Kevin Spacey plays Prot who claims to be from the planet K-Pax. Title sounds more like a battery charger than a planet. Anyway, Prot is arrested at the airport when a misunderstanding occurs. Jeff Bridges plays a psychiatrist who is bewildered at Prot's unique style of thinking. Prot really believes who he is and at one point Bridges arranges a meeting with his brother-in-law who is into astronomy. Prot overwhelms them with information that he considers common knowledge on K-Pax. Eventually hypnosis is suggested where crucial information surfaces. Interesting idea lacks payoff and renders to absurdity and an ending that leaves loose ends. Directed by Iain Softley who made the much more absorbing The Wings of the Dove. Despite his best efforts, this film cannot master up a serious note and becomes a joke. Spacey with Bridges are fine actors who cannot save this film. Spacey's psycho babble is laughable at best and the overall mystery is never solved. Bridges is also reduced to a standard straight forward role. His patients are seen merely as fillers. Mary McCormack is flat as Bridges's wife. Routine and often frustrating mind screw that uses its subject matter as a ploy to jerk us around. It is very manipulating in that it answers nothing.

A role like this is like ...eating ...soft blue cheese for Kevin Spacey. Yet this is far from being one of his best performances.

		<fullReview>While Kevin Spacey certainly merits the glowing praise for his performance in K-Pax, I don't understand why everyone is also praising Jeff Bridges for his stiff, blundering, cartoon performance in this film. He has two expressions throughout the entire movie, "I don't get it" and "who let one?" Why didn't he stop after "The Dude"? Money, I suppose, though it's upsetting he's still cast in important roles. If Kevin Spacey hadn't been so brilliant, I wouldn't have made it through the movie. Also, "Doctor" Bridges is married to a woman half his age and, although he's some high-up clod at a Manhattan psych ward, he can push aside all other patients to dote on Spacey. Which reminds me, every non-mentally ill person in this movie is just kind of slow, annoying, not able to keep up. Which is not a bad background setting, except that Jeff Bridges keeps over medicating the only people who know what's going on. Anyway, I still recommend this movie, but I also recommend that the Actor's Guild tear up Jeff Bridges' membership card.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While this film is based on an actual novel, I felt confused about the actual ending and I was frustrated by it all. The story is about Prot (played wonderfully by Kevin Spacey) who is an alleged alien from the planet, K-Pax, who mysteriously arrives at Grand Central Station. He is taken to the mental hospital where he encounters skeptical, Dr. Mark Powell (played equally well by Jeff Bridges). Prot tells of his world as a place where the children are raised in communal setting and reproduction is an unpleasant process. For all we know, he is telling the truth or there is something else. The supporting cast features Mary McCormack (Mark's understanding wife, Rachel), Conchata Farrell (played a Nurse), Alfre Woodard (another psychiatrist), Celia Weston (played Mrs. Archer like Blanche Dubois from Streetcar Named Desire). When Prot is planning is return to his planet on the fifth anniversary of his arrival on earth, he can only take one person with him back. The ending is a bit vague. The film's fine but I felt disappointed by the outcome.</fullReview>

He goes further to tell us that inhabitants of K-PAX have known this for a very long time, and that they know, further, that the universe has imploded and exploded many times and will continue to do the same forever. Moreover, the choices and mistakes we make today we will be doomed to make forever. Well, if this was true, then wouldn't that mean that what was happening in the movie (including all the choices made by him &amp; Bridges) were simply the same events that had happened many times already? So, what reason was there for the speech? Further, wouldn't that mean that Spacey had given that speech many many times before in previous universes? And, wouldn't that mean that he would have given the speech in the very first universe? And, wouldn't that mean that it could not have been true the first time he said it, since there had been no universes prior to that? And if he never said it then, wouldn't that mean that, by his own reasoning, he couldn't be saying it now? grade = (1)</fullReview>

While the film certainly had some great moments, it just felt like more was needed to further flesh out the story. Some elements could have been made a little denser, so understanding doesn't become apparent so quickly, but the final product is worth watching.

		<shortDescription>Intriguing but unfulfilling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those purposefully aggravating obtuse films that is self-consciously thought-provoking.People are caught up in debating whether Prot was, or was not, an alien.The point of this film--if there is one--is to get us wrapped up in its unsolvable mysteries: did Prot merely inhabit the body of a man who killed himself and took a mental patient with him on a ride to a remote planet called K-PAX? Or was Prot really an exceptionally brilliant, but strongly delusional man who chose to completely separate himself from reality when his wife and child were brutally murdered? Was the day and time of his scheduled return trip to K-PAX merely an internally-assigned moment in time for Porter to make a permanent catatonic split from his deluded alter ego?There are various explanations of each theory, but in the end - who really cares?Not all good stories have clear beginnings, middles, and endings - in fact, some of the best don't - and this movie will leave you with an entirely unclear sense of its purpose or its ultimate meaning or meanings. It is exactly as thought-provoking in proportion to its lack of clarity. If this kind of purposefully vague storytelling is what interests and fascinates you, then K-PAX is your kind of movie.Personally, I found its games intriguing and sometimes fun, but its lack of conclusions or point were ultimately unsatisfying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>but leaves too much out about the story. I thought K-Pax was OK, but I don't like how the plot was mysterious toward the end with no real explanation of the final couple of scenes. It was like the writer couldn't even decide if Prot was an ET or not.(SPOILERS): Prot knew all that astrophysic stuff,but he turns catatonic in the end? And I didn't like how the story never followed up what happened with those 3 tasks Prot told that guy to do. Did the guy really get cured or not?FINAL VERDICT: It started off like it was going to be good, but then the story went downhill. I just don't like it when a movie ends with no real answer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cliched but just manages to succeed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie -- about a mysterious person who may or may not be an alien -- is a parade of cliches: the saintly alien (e.g., "E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial"), the psychiatric patient having a positive effect on the other patients (e.g., "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"), and, of course, the Psychiatric Breakthrough story ("So THAT'S the deep-seated trauma at the bottom of his problem! -- e.g., "The Prince of Tides," "Good Will Hunting," etc.).The movie is redeemed by the performances. Spacey is fine as Prot, and Jeff Bridges manages to make the cliches of his character (the workaholic who neglects his family) palatable. In addition, the ending remains nicely ambiguous -- the neat solutions may not be solutions at all.Not a great film, but a good time filler if you don't get too put off seeing the same old ground being tilled one more time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>K-Pax is a film I truly wanted to like, and for the mostpart I did. However if I am to be objective in my critique, I must say that I didn't find it particularly satisfying or life-affirming. Sure it has its moments, but those are courtesy of the great performances by Spacey and, to a lesser extent, Bridges (a case of style over content). In terms of subject, it reminded me of One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest and Awakenings, the latter being far superior.I love films that are brave enough to tackle lofty or sensitive issues and challenge our perceptions of reality (Being John Malkovich springs to mind, as do most Woody Allen films). But I can't help feeling that K-Pax tries too hard to deliver that "all important message", resulting in an overworked motif (the light sequences are a bit much) and a mostly transparent plot.The film offers an interesting character study about a troubled patient who forces his therapist to reconsider his priorities in life, reminding him of the importance of family. Though I feel that this patient/doctor role-reversal could have been developed further, perhaps by making Bridges' character more vulnerable with more at stake. As it stands, the parallels between Prot and Powell's lives are too flimsy and there needed to be a stronger affinity between them. The humour and pathos Spacey injects into Prot is the film's only saving grace in my opinion. Bridges' character is relatively bland, but that must be a weakness in the script, as he is a fine actor given the right material. The patients in the hospital are merely caricatures, unlike those in Awakenings, who are fully-fledged characters and an integral part of the story.Kevin Spacey brings a touch of genius to the part of Prot, and at first impressions, his portrayal of an other-worldly being is quite convincing. However as the film progresses, it becomes submerged in moralistic overtones and the acting becomes rather contrived. (As a side note, Haley Joel Osment's turn as a robot child in Speilberg's masterpiece A.I. is one of the most subtle and mesmerizing performances I have ever witnessed).The film's biggest let-down is the ending, which is as absurd as an episode of the X Files. Is he an alien or isn't he? That is the question. But rather than leave the ending ambiguous (in true X Files fashion), it consciously pushes the viewer towards an answer. I half expected to see the silhouette of Spacey riding a bike across the moon!After reading the other user comments, I can appreciate people's mixed feelings. But do yourself a favour: watch this film for its sheer audacity and make up your own mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I watched this movie, the ending really me ticked off. It reminded me of an interview I saw of the musician SEAL. He stated he writes lyrics so they can be interpreted in multiple ways. In other words, he throws together phrases that have nothing to do with each other, and calls it a song. I hate that!! My biggest beef with this movie was the inconclusive ending. Half the scenes in the movie pointed towards one conclusion, and half pointed towards another conclusion, and it appears the director planned this. Is that different? Yes. Do I like it? NO. If the creator of a story doesn't care what the truth of the plot is, then in my opinion it is just a bunch of pointless gibberish.Other than that the movie was fine.

		<fullReview>I like Kevin Spacey and I like movies about aliens, so K-PAX was something I looked forward to. While it was a decent movie, it was essentially a formula film.K-PAX is one of those films with the dual plot/message line going. It draws you in with a plot about something that seemingly can't be true, but just maybe ... Then at the end, it doesn't answer whether the main plot point was true or not, but drives home a more mundane message. In the case of K-PAX, the mundane message was this: whether or not Prot was an alien, remember to spend time with your family and people who are REALLY important, because you only get one shot at it.The movie is stylish, and the music reminiscent of "American Beauty." But in the end, there isn't much new.</fullReview>

And why were we supposed to care about the NewMexico man's family who got killed. We never meet the wife or kid,and we only see the father in a hypnotic state. The whole subplotabout New Mexico and murder is just stupid.One more thing. If Jeff Bridges makes one more movie where he'smarried to a hot woman 20 years younger than him, I'm going topuke. In every movie he's in, he has little kids running around him.For crying out loud, the man's got grandkids older than hisonscreen kids. Not an important point, but it bothers me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is warm and enjoyable movie, especially if you know nothing about psychiatry. The movie takes place in 2001, but the psychiatry is either a decade or more old or hardly likely. Most of the drugs mentioned were replaced by newer ones during the past decade. Most of the patients don't seem to be responding to their medications, but the psychiatrist seems to believe everyone should. Many of the patients are not in-patient types to begin with. How many in-patients have been taken home to a family cook-out? The patient is a severe post traumatic stress disorder case, but instead of having the symptoms of that entity, shows himself as a psychotic Schizophenic, paranoid type and later catatonic type. However, his knowledge of the universe make the audience and the staff wonder. The patient has a knowledge of the solar system superior to the authorities in that field. The patient is a marvelous subject for hypnosis where the technique might really work with one percent. With the hypnotic information the psychiatrist does great detective work and finds out what trauma took place five years earlier. In spite of all its faults, it's still warm and enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"K-PAX" takes a page out of the book of institutional dramas like "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and "Awakenings," but never reaches the heights of these films. It only breaks new ground with the mystery of 'is he or isn't he' from another planet. That's an element that hasn't been introduced into this genre. The point here likely is that it doesn't matter if he is or not. Instead, the film concentrates on is the effect prot has on those around him and what he teaches Dr. Powell. Its focus is on posing questions such as what being 'cured' really means.The problem is that it DOES matter whether prot is from K-PAX or not. The film makes it seem as if it's giving you clues to what the answer is, but in the end, leaves everything up in the stratosphere right where it was. These mysteries, such as how this man has such intimate knowledge of the Lyra system, seem only there to intrigue you and keep you watching. It's like the professor in "Good Will Hunting" who writes the math problem on the chalkboard and challenges his class to solve it, knowing that the equation is above even himself. "K-PAX" is more than happy to present the equation, but you get the feeling that it would be just as amazed as the audience at the solution. Nevertheless, "K-PAX" is an entertaining couple of hours in the theater because of the indisputable views prot offers about planet Earth. But the thrill here is just in the chase, not in the outcome.

Things pointed out that he was, like when he drew the map of his planet in front of the scientists, and many other things. However, why would he comeback to earth from K-pax in order to help a friend?!? He said several times that he didn't care about families, his pics in the book, etc a lot of things made him human. Ok, I'm not going to name everything because it is too long. During the movie I couldn't wait to find out what will be the ending (is he from k-pax or not?). And I was VERY UPSET when it was one of those "make your own conclusion" endings! WHY DO DIRECTORS DO THAT? It is very frustrating and this changed the movie from being great to being awful. You have no idea how cheated I felt, I don't like watching movies with no ending. The whole point of the movie was to find out if he's really from K-pax or not and I would've accepted ANY of those 2 endings, both would've made a little sense. But they ruined it for me when they didn't have a clear ending! 4/10. (if I ignore the ending 8/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A poor, sci-fi remake of "Miracle on 34th Street," marred by lazy formulaic scriptwriting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hey, remember that movie which starred all those people who have unfulfilled, empty lives and then a man institutionalized for claiming to be Santa Claus comes in and magically sets things straight? Sure you do, it's a wonderful 1947 film called "Miracle on 34th Street," and "K-Pax" is essentially a lazy remake of that. In "Miracle" you spend the entire film wondering "Is he Santa or isn't he Santa" and in "K-Pax" you will spend the entire film (if it can sustain your interest) wondering "Is Kevin Spacey an alien or isn't he an alien?".Hey, remember that movie where Jeff Bridges plays a guy whose life is empty and unfulfilled and then he meets this delusional, homeless man who - even though he might be crazy - helps put Jeff Bridges' life back together again? Sure you do, it's called "The Fisher King," and "K-Pax" is an even lazier remake of that, too - with Jeff Bridges playing nearly the same role."K-Pax" is "formula" script writing at its laziest. While the performances overall are credible, what really hurts this film is a script that takes short-cuts from start to finish. Predictability abounds. In films where one already know how everything is going to unfold (like those which are based on true stories, like "The Insider,") the one thing keeps the audience's interest are the motivations of characters, and with "K-Pax" it is unfortunately the characters motivations which are given the heave-ho. With the exception of Kevin Spacey, all the characters are given just enough dialogue to establish why they are acting the way they are, but there's no depth to any of their actions. The slow and predictable unfolding of events is done without any dramatic tension, which only makes the film's climax that much more of a fizzle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting concept, but what was the director thinking?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not saying that the director shouldn't have left the ending as ambiguous as he did. The main problem was that throughout the course of the movie, it seemed that the director himself did not know whether or not K-Pax was real. This opened up too many ideas and led to a film that was, on one hand, provocative and thought-provoking, but also confusing and misleading. I think that the director's ambiguity left out the real answers, which could have backed up either argument. Rather than supporting both sides with substantial and credible evidence, the director chooses to focus on shots of the sun glistening in too many scenes just because it looks cool. I think that if the director stopped having fun with the camera and pursued both sides of the argument, the movie would have had a clearer direction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "K-Pax" Monday night at a screening in Washington D.C. and it was packed. Word of advice, get there early, a lot of people got turned away from this one because they waited till 7 PM to show up, you simply can't do that with screenings.Nonetheless - the movie starts out with a man in a wheelchair at a train station trying to get money using a paper cup and witnesses another person get robbed. Prot (Kevin Spacey) is all by himself in the train station and tries to help out this person that gets robbed only to get arrested by the cops despite the man in the wheelchair telling the cops Prot didn't do anything. Prot ends up in a psychatric hospital where he meets Dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges).Mark has some problems of his own, a son he hasn't seen in years through a previous marriage and his new wife, Rachel (Mary Mara) tries to talk him into visiting his son who is at college. Mark is never home, and when he is home, his mind is on this new patient, Prot. There is even a scene where he wakes up in the middle of the night and runs down to his study to listen to some of his Prot's sessions. Prot tries to explain the best he can that he is from "K-Pax" and gets to take one person back with him. He explains why he is on Earth, which isn't his first time. Mark gets some of his collegues involved and Prot does a good job of explaining what life is like on K-Pax. He makes friends with other patients and overall is a good patient, just a bit strange because he claims he isn't human.In my opinion, the trailers are very misleading on this movie and to me it gave away too much. I thought this was going to be good, but the more I was watching this movie that is 109 minutes long, the more I couldn't get into it. This is very predicable, and the story is so one dimensional. They have very small sub-plots that to me simply didn't fill time, it was just there. I saw this on Monday, Oct 15th in Washington D.C. and the audience laughed at a few parts, but they didn't clap at the end. That isn't a good sign and I will be surprised if this movie makes money after opening weekend. I kept thinking the book this is based on has to be better. 4 out of 10.</fullReview>

That can be seen as underestimating your audience. How irritating when you notice that someone is trying to teach you something by telling an a-b-c morality tale. Why does every second Hollywood movie have to deal with the questions of life and death and everything in between anyway?

Of course, neither ending could explain all the plot elements so I guess it was left up to the audience to decide which parts of the film they wanted to pretend didn't happen. Personally, I would have left out the mumbo-jumbo about regression analysis - the alien thing was much more plausible than the Theodoric of York type of therapy. In any case the filmmakers shouldn't have wimped out, or at least made more of an attempt to make either ending compatible with what was presented.Despite another good performance by Spacey, I wouldn't recommend K-Pax - unless of course, you really like mentally writing your own scripts...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>K-PAX was slow, trite and pathetically BO-ring. While both Spacey (Prot) and Bridges (Dr. Powell) turn in good performances, it doesn't make up for the fact that, after about 20 minutes, you have already seen where the movie is going to end up. Even if the ending is interesting, it's not worth the wait.Prot's character is not endearing, he's condescending and really doesn't teach us anything. Had the writers given him more than one-line responses to Dr. Powell's questions, maybe the movie would have been half as long. For example: Prot throws out one-liners and waits for Bridges to ask him to elaborate. (My husband does this and, let me tell you, it's irritating.) Prot then scoffs at Dr. Powell when he repeats what Prot has said. I don't blame Dr. Powell, he's repeating what Prot said because he's hoping he will continue and make some sense. It's his way of saying, "AND...???".The only funny lines in the movie are in the trailers. They are, therefore, not funny anymore because one has seen them 200 times. Everyone else in the theater was, however, shrieking with laughter every time Prot let lose with another already-seen-in-the-trailer zinger. Have all these people been living under a rock? "Your produce alone was worth the trip." Objectively, that's just not funny anymore.When I saw this movie, people clapped at the end of the movie. So, apparently some people liked it...a lot. It's long and pretty boring, but both Bridges and Spacey are good so I guess you can do worse.

		<fullReview>Here's the pitch -- One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest, with Kevin Spacey doing Nicholson as space alien, imparting new-age "wisdom" to benighted Earthlings.There's a contrived beginning, with Spacey's arrest for no reason, just so he can be admitted to a psycho ward, so Jeff Bridges can observe him. Bridges admits Spacey's no threat to anybody, which begs the question of why he's being detained. Ironically, Bridges, known for his mugging, is the only one in this thing who's NOT mugging. All the others, from Spacey to the bit players, throw stuff and work their faces and talk gibberish. Like Nicholson in Cuckoo's Nest, Spacey turns his ethnically diverse fellow inmates into hyper-conscious flower children: "Bluebird! Bluebird!" Suddenly, they're the congregation in a tent revival. He heals various loonies, mainly through his mere presence or some precious words of wisdom. At one point Spacey announces, "I can only take one person back with me." This is bad news for the audience. Bridges is assigned the role of Close Encounter's Richard Dreyfus who, as he begins to take Spacey seriously, is ostracized by his bratty kids and silly wife. But watch out, Spacey has a thing about water, which makes a scene in family Bridges's backyard. So Bridges's careerist bosses, despite testimonials form eminent scientists that he may truly be an alien, have an excuse to kick Spacey patient upstairs to the psycho ward, so Spacey disappears, until Bridges finds him perched in a tree, which gives Bridges a pretext for putting Spacey though a dreary couch scene so Spacey can showcase his talent for psychodrama.And on and on and on. A director with the finesse of a pair of boxing gloves has turned an intriguing "What if the crazy who thinks he's an alien really is an alien?" premise into a preachy, pedestrian soap opera. All the time and effort, all the wasted production values, all the pointless characters, the relentlessly ethereal soundtrack -- all, because some genius thought it would be clever to make a movie that plays on Kevin's last name. Pointless hubris, like Armand Hammer buying out the soda powder company.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>K-PAXians Are Boring Beings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A man claims to be from a planet called K-PAX while in a mental institution. He did apparently come from a light beam while in a public transit site. Dr. Mark Powell tries to find out the truth. Prot, is the spaceman's name. He is very intelligent and different. Finally, near the end of this film, the truth is learned and the spaceman's true name is Robert Porter. A man that had his family killed by a drifter and then killed the drifter himself. Prot claims that he must leave again, and does disappear at the end. But a man in a comatose state is left behind, Porter. So did Prot use the body of Porter and vacant it? It took almost the entire movie for it and the mystery to be solved. In between, nothing but dialog which tends to go on and on. If Prot is a product of another world, one hopes that other beings like him stay on their planet and just sit and talk with each other.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers.Especially considering the caliber of its lead actors, Jeff Bridges and Kevin Spacey, K-PAX is an embarrassingly bad movie - high-concept, genre-mixing Hollywood at its cynical worst. Here's the pitch: "Hey, let's take the clichéd formula of the split personality psychological thriller and combine it with the benign alien SF visitation movie. We can have this alien, who comes from a civilization so advanced that he regards humans as a curious early-evolutionary species, make numerous light-beam visits to earth for the sole inexplicable purpose of befriending and rescuing a psychologically traumatized cattle-knocker from New Mexico (Spacey) by entering into his body and submitting to the indignities of a mental institution and repeated hypnosis. Meanwhile, we can also have this alien function as a super-philosopher/psychiatrist and - McMurphy-like - cure a host of quirky/lovable mental patients, not to mention his assigned doctor (Bridges) who of course has troubling neuroses of his own. We can also throw in a little Spielberg by having the alien run an essay contest to determine which one of the patients gets to win a free trip back to K-PAX." "Oh, that doesn't sound quite plausible? Well, let's not make it entirely clear that the alien IS an alien. Maybe the cattle-knocker is really a catatonic/idiot savant who somehow while living in a shack and working at the stocks managed to acquire astrophysical knowledge that befuddles the leading experts in the field and is barely revealed by the most advanced Hubble telescope. Whichever. It all ends happily with even the catatonic remnant being pushed in a wheelchair around the city and exhibiting a faint but clearly optimistic smile as his doctor pledges unending devotion to the cause of his cure." Really, this is stupid, stupid film making, insulting to both the actors and the audience. Even the satirically pitched scripts in Robert Altman's The Player (The Graduate II anyone?) sound intelligent by comparison.</fullReview>

When he is off the screen the movie is simply dull, lifeless and stupid. It sets us up for certain expectations and in the third act denies them when it turns into ordinary, boring we-have-seen-this-a-million-times-before.The screenplay is a sham. The editing plodding. I haven't seen such wasted time in at least a week. RIDING IN CARS WITH BOYS had almost as bad editing.Avoid this turkey at all costs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mismanaged Ambiguity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This came close to working for me. Partly that's because our designated internal watcher ? Jeff Bridges ? is so darn effective&gt; He's said he doesn't like these roles, that he would rather be in the story than watching it. But with "Lebowski" and "Fearless" he's become just about Hollywood's best.The setup is one that balances two genres, which means that it balances two universal urges, both with religious expressions avoided here.One is the great story of miraculous, supernatural grace.The other is the larger and more common (in film) of redemption. Both are ordinary, and the narrative novelty here is the ability to play them off against each other. The tension is that they are to some extent contradictory, and it is that tension that has sustained at least Catholic and Fundmentalis Christianity.On the one hand, the only path to redemption is hard work, pain, suffering. On the other, it is a rapturous instant, granted merely by believing ? in most versions it doesn't matter why you believe, only that you do.Is a tension that simmered during that dark ages and forms one of the great templates of Western narrative. Here recast in a direct framework. The possibilities are wonderful. The actor Spacey does understand this horizontal folding. (See him in "Hurlyburly.")And he does well enough to keep us from bolting. But the project is mismanaged. I think the reason why is simple: the studios want hope and in this case hope is on the side of random, ultimate salvation, miracles, lotterywinning. So the ambiguity is screwed, the tension dissipates and the wonder of the watcher is changed from something that matters, to something that simply assures.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

It made other parts of this movie seem to not make sense. Think of the seminar's and the testing only to have that ending. Why have him impress the scholars? Why was the testing ultimately so poor? Your internet hardened blogger could've drawn out the proof one way or another. The time travel hoax which is still on the net provided better answers then this supposed traveler from another planet. Only Kevin Spacey made this movie watchable until the unpalatable ending.Ultimately, a disappointment which is why I gave this movie thumbs down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just didn't get it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie in the theatre and for the first hour or so, I was going along with it but there was a scene that stopped the movie cold for me.There was a throw-away line in the movie about the blue bird of happiness and later on at the mental institution, the patients see a blue jay outside a window. All of the patients start jumping up and down with excitement because the blue bird was outside. IT WAS A FREAKING BLUE BIRD!!! Why are they so excited? I realize that they're crazy but why are the doctors and nurses looking in amazement at the blue bird? How many blue birds are in NYC? A couple of thousand? I just didn't get that scene and it took the wind out of the sails for me, never to recover.I found the movie to be very evasive about the true nature of Kevin Spacey's character. A lot of clues were left around. Some would lead you to believe "Truth A", some would make you think the movie was about "Truth B" and still other clues would make you think it was "Truth C". All of the clues together however were inconsistent and couldn't have pointed to any one of the truths.It was two hours of my life I'll never get back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable but not particularly involving</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is there intelligent life within the mainstream film industry? We assume that there must be but sometimes it seems so hard to tell. K-PAX is the kind of film that reminds you what can be achieved with a little thought when there seems to be little else going on. Even though the closest we get to fireworks is the sight of some firecrackers on the fourth of July (that don't even go off) K-PAX is still strangely compelling.The film revolves around Prot, a man taken into psychiatric care when he appears out of nowhere at a New York railway station and claims he is a man from outer space. After a month of apathetically prescribed medication fails to show him the grim light of day (an ironic treatment since he was brought in as a drug-addicted delusional) he is handed over to psychiatrist Jeff Bridges who tries to convince him that he is as human as you or I, but as the sessions go on the good doctor starts to have some doubts.From the moment he appears on screen Kevin Spacey seems like something out of this world. Despite his appearance being merely a pair of sunglasses away from the dreary loser in the Shipping News, Spacey is full-on charisma mode and the camera can't help lapping it up. His body language, down to the look in often shielded eyes, and tone of his voice are note perfect and confirm the genius behind the man whose choices since American Beauty seem questionable at best.Whilst K-PAX bears superficial similarities to Brian Singer's seminal crime flick The Usual Suspects (we spend most of the film seeing Spacey spinning tales in an office) a far closer match is Don Juan DeMarco, where Johnny Depp's claim to be the world's greatest lover (which I'm sure many women easily accepted) stirs life into Marlon Brando's cynical psychoanalyst. As seems traditional Jeff Bridges brilliant doctor cannot sort his own family troubles (is this the Hollywood producers Faustian bargain for the piles of fees they poor in the LA analyst trade? That they will always be portrayed as hypocrites who ignore their wives). Mary McCormack brings great depth to the domestic scenes, with a performance whose knowingness spares us being bored with yet another cliched back story whilst perfectly illustrating every nuance of family life. Also refreshing is that Bridges remains restrained and we have no histrionics or snot-nosed tearful speeches of regret, only emotional ties straining at the dilemmas facing him.Where the film starts to falter is in the closing third when it starts paying serious attention to the whole is he/isn't he an alien finale. Whilst the ending itself is perfectly satisfactory, the build-up seems like cerebral chess played for pride rather a defining question of life and spirit. Perhaps this is where the performances are a little too calculated and methodical, all smooth smiles and no rough edges for the audience to latch on to. The viewer also starts to miss the laconic all-knowing cool Prot when we have him blubbing in hypnosis therapy, we lack enough role-models today, can't we have one who is happy deep down?The visual style of the film makes much play on the concept that Prot travelled on a beam of light to get to Earth and in the process sets a new record for the number of lens flares caught on camera (wasn't there a time when that was considered bad camerawork and not hideously cool? What next, having boom mikes in shot as a hip post-ironic film-literate touch?). However more than anything the films lingering visuals of daily life and nature around us give a feeling of being on the outside looking in at life, and reminding us of all the wonderful joys we miss when we lose our childlike wonder of the world.K-PAX stands as more than a demonstration of method acting mechanics but somehow less than a truly heartfelt film. Maybe the production got too caught up in Jeff Bridges easy going coolness, or maybe showing emotion is something they are not so good at doing on the planet K-PAX.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plan 10 From Outer Space. Rating: 1/10.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: SPOILERSOK. Plot number one. A guy who works in a slaughter-house returns home to find that his wife and daughter have just been murdered by a drifter. The murderer's still on the premises so the distraught slaughter-house man strangles him. Then he walks out the door and jumps in a nearby river, never to be seen again.Oh wow; a fun narrative if ever there was -- but wait: just like buses, here comes plot number two. . .It's a couple of decades later, and NYPD take a crime witness into custody because he's wearing sunglasses and says he's from another planet. As around a quarter of everyone in New York wears sunglasses and is from another planet, it's not clear why this particular individual is singled out. Nor can the script trouble itself to explain why, when such people are usually dropped off in the most convenient doorway, the City instead decides to devote a half million dollarsworth of medical care to him.Ah, but! This is no ordinary alien. This is Kevin Spaceman. And the psychiatrist in charge of his case is no ordinary specialist, but Jeff ('Starman') Bridges. Not surprisingly then, a relationship quickly develops between the two, forged by dialog that seeks to surpass 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest' but can't quite make it to the standard of 'Home Alone 3'.Still. No matter that, as the script asserts, neither Buddha nor Christ knew what they were on about - huh? - this movie knows where it's headed, because not only does Spaceman eat an unskinned banana in close-up and Dolby Surround Sound, he goes on to describe the orbital dynamics of a planetary system so far removed from our galaxy that only the world's finest astronomers have any idea of its existence.And as he manages this feat by a complex series of mathematical formulae based on misrepresentations of the letters 'e' and 'm', well. That's it. Kevin Spaceman is either (a) definitely from the planet K-Pax or (b) a scientific genius the like of which has not been seen since Einstein. Hold the bananas. Give the guy the Nobel Prize instead.Starman Bridges, however, isn't convinced. . . and so journeys to New Mexico where by An Amazing Stroke of Fortune he gets taken by the local Sheriff to the abandoned and utterly unchanged home of a slaughterhouse worker whose wife and daughter were killed by a drifter, said drifter later being murdered by said slaughterhouse worker.By another Amazing Stroke of Fortune, Bridges suddenly develops a psychic ability greater than anything anyone else has ever possessed, including visitors from K-Pax, and so is able to 'see' Kevin Spaceman coming home after a hard day killing cows and finding that home is now just like his workplace. God. It's dreadful.Bridges rushes back to New York, where Kevin Spaceman's now doing a Jack Nicholson and showing his fellow mental patients that there's more to life than they thought, notably The Bluebird of Happiness, which is sitting on a tree outside their window.Anything, you feel, could happen now: Glenn Miller might land, or even Judy herself come back down from the far side of the rainbow.But instead, Kevin announces it's time for him to go back to planet K-Pax. Will he? Won't he?Naw. He merely becomes a catatonic wheelchair user, doomed to spend his days wearing impenetrable sunglasses and an enigmatic smile.Loyal to the end, Starman Bridges spends his time pushing Spaceman around New York, oblivious to the fortune that could be made from his case notes about a seriously traumatised New Mexican slaughterhouse worker who taught himself, er, astrophysics -- and went on to become The Cleverest Astronomer In The World.And that's it. No wonder so many reviewers here opted out of "analyzing" it. There's nothing to analyze.And no point in asking too many questions about it either, because Britain's FilmFour had a hand in it, and that's always as good a warning as you can get for the existence of pompous junk masquerading as entertainment.(Though of course, you do start to wonder at what stage in their respective careers Kevin Spaceman and Starman Bridges were lobotomised, because had they been of their usual sound mind even a cursory glance at the script would've confirmed how epically stupid `K-Pax' truly is.)And yet the movie does have some passing value, for to sit through it is to be reminded of just how brilliant, by comparison, was 'Plan 9 From Outer Space', where despite an absence of budget and even a leading man, Ed Wood managed to contrive something with greater logic, sharper narrative, and arguably better acting.VERDICT: 1/10 - though its pretensions are ludicrous and its contempt for an audience's intelligence risible, `K Pax' nevertheless earns a point for showing `Plan 9 From Outer Space' to be a genuine masterpiece.Come back Ed Wood. All is forgiven.</fullReview>

If you ask me what is the most effective thing in this film of course I say that you can see lots of insane people and you can pray your God for your health.(: You can see how difficult this illness.

		<shortDescription>k-pax</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From British director Iain Softley (The Wings of the Dove), this is an interesting science-fiction fantasy drama. Basically a man (Kevin Spacey) pretty much suddenly appears from sunlight at an airport, calling himself Prot, and claiming to be from a planet called K-PAX. It is this claim that takes him to the mental hospital, and spending a lot of time with Dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges) to crack his "delusional" state. Taking Prot to scientific research facilities, hypnosis and basic chat, Mark tries to find out more about Prot's past life, K-PAX, and anything leading to a possible life "on Earth". As the film progresses Mark begins to believe all of these things that Prot is trying to prove (almost), and Prot says that soon enough he will choose 'one' to go with him to this beautiful (according to him) world. When he does pick his companion, there is a flash of light, and all that is left of Prot is his body without the soul, he is pretty much dumbed. Also starring Mary McCormack as Rachel Powell, Alfre Woodard as Dr. Claudia Villars, David Patrick Kelly as Howie, Saul Williams as Ernie, Peter Gerety as Sal and Celia Weston as Doris Archer. I can agree that it is too much of a touchy-feely film, but Spacey and Bridges are a good reason to see it. Kevin Spacey was number 4 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Okay!</fullReview>

What about the scene with the dog? What about the trip to go up North? How did he escape the hospital, How did he return?

		<fullReview>This is a weird flick. It's very intelligent in spots, and then just as you let your "intelligence assault" defenses down it clobbers you with either smarmy new-age religious views or thinly-veiled preaching about eating meat. I don't want to imply that this movie is terrible, it isn't, the performances are excellent and I did enjoy myself on the main. But if you're looking for another American Beauty, a smart, darkly funny flick that takes your intelligence seriously, you're probably going to be disappointed. I expected that because it was a Spacey flick and because it was a dialog flick. Maybe that was unrealistic of me.This movie takes place in a psych ward. Since I went to school for that (don't ask me why), I am a bit crippled by knowing too much about it, and just squirming at the way it's misrepresented for dramatic effect in this flick.Nobody, not even the stereotyped characters, turn in melodramatic performances, and I'm very glad for that. There's oone line that made me wince though, one where a tech was observing Spacey's vital signs and was talking to Bridges via an earpiece. "MY GOD MAN, BRING HIM OUT OF IT!" This is in reference to ordinary hypnosis, and in this movie "regression" is talked about in hushed tones like it's some big deal or some powerful tool, rather than something akin to phrenology. The line is delivered like Scotty talking from Engineering up to Kirk during a battle. I think that this particular example pretty well sums up what's wrong with the movie. If that would make you squirm, you're going to squirm quite a bit, just because the writer was either ignorant or counting on you being ignorant: it didn't have to be this way. Quite honestly the less you know the better off you are. That is the opposite of what an "intelligent movie" should be, and since this movie is almost pure dialog, it needs to be more intelligent than it is, frankly.The other thing is the script writer's thinly veiled ideological agenda. You're going to be clubbed over the head with anti-meat preaching. It's the typical delivery for zealots: they can't argue their position rationally, so they set up some more "highly evolved" personality that you're supposed to look up to to deliver the ideology from on high. Kinda like a Jack Chick tract only for the far-left instead of the far-right. It's smarmy, it's irritating, and frankly it's insulting. Capital punishment gets the same treatment. The writer doesn't like it, so you can be sure that the highly evolved denizens of the Universe know it to be the dumbest thing going. No discussion of why will be offered, of course. Spacey actually delivers a line about how nobody listens to Budda and Jesus, because they were against killing. The thing I find funniest about that is that I personally am agnostic, but I was raised in a Protestant church, and I seem to remember that Jesus guy saying something about selling your garments to buy a sword. And about dividing families two from three, and about not mistaking that he comes in peace, but that he comes bearing a sword. I'm digressing here but the basic fact is that either the writer of the book or the screenplay is just another post-modernist pseudointellectual who wants to take his personal ideology and elevate it artificially, and feed it to you. And if you're a thinking person, I don't think you're going to like that any more than I did.If you go in steeled for that, you'll probably like the flick okay. I gave it a six. If they'd left out the painfully transparent agenda I'd have given it an eight or even a nine.</fullReview>

OK, maybe to help a few people, but why would he if he comes from a planet with no concept of family?The movie was weak right from the start: no real cop(s) would have arrested Prot and sent him to a mental hospital. At one point Prot is sitting up in a tree: was there any reason for this except to make him look rebellious or cool? The hypnosis part left me confused me for about 15 minutes until I figured out the ridiculous and contrived plot twist that was unfolding. There was also an implied parallel between the alien (Prot) and the Jeff Bridges character....weak!!!The mental patients in the movie were unrealistic and their portrayal was insulting to anybody who has a basic knowledge of mental illness.This movie is bland. If you saw the TV commercial already, feel good that you saw every witty line in the movie and don't waste your money at the cinema (rent it with several friends if your still curious 3 months from now). Kevin Spacey was pretty dull. I had to tap my friend every few minutes throughout the movie to keep her awake.The whole premise of the movie had no basis. Surely an alien (if he is one) would have better things to do after such a long journey to Earth. This movie was designed by Hollywood to appeal to basic human desire to 'feel good'. I feel that they aimed a bit too low on the IQ scale this time, however.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie to be long and slow moving. Was Prot really an alien? Or was he a tragic split personality who's alternate personality took over completely when the real world became too much for the already weak first personality to handle? The only redeeming value of this movie was the interesting discussion afterwards to decide which was the case. However sitting through this long film, and wondering when it would finally end, was not worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film doesn't know what it wants to be. Is it about Prot (Spacey's character) or is it about the psychiatrist and his coming to terms with his own domestic and professional life? Is it about psychiatric treatment? Is it about the possibility of life on other planets? The ending completely falls flat, as if the writer did not know where to go. How would the Spacey character, a man from the rural backwoods of New Mexico, who apparently (this is not made clear) works in a meat packing plant for a living, come to be able to speak so eloquently and so knowledgeably about life and the cosmos? And why would he travel to New York? Totally unbelievable. A boring, irritating mess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting at times but totally muddled at others ? falling into sentiment when all else fails (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A man arrives at a train station but claims to have no ticket and have arrived from outer space. Naturally the police bundle him off to someone who cares, which in this case is the care of psychiatrist Mark Powell and his staff. At first it seems a clear cut case for Powell to solve with the only matter being how long it will take for the man calling himself Prot to come out of it. However some things cannot be easily explained and somehow parts of his story makes sense. With the deadline for Prot's return to the planet K-PAX approaching, Powell tries to get to the bottom of this man, unsure of what will happen when the deadline hits.The vaguely interesting premise drew me to this film and I did hope that it would be engaging as such. The opening sort of sums up the spirit of the film in the way it isn't clear whether Prot came in the light or just seen in the light. This was necessary for the mystery element of the story but sadly the film tries to have its cake and eat it ? keeping the mystery throughout while also winking at the audience to tell them whatever it is they want to hear. This does mean that the audience will all mostly get something they want but that nobody will get everything. So sci-fi interests will be served by Prot proving complex gravitational forces while others will be touched by the life messages delivered. This just about works until at some points it needs to clear up a bit and generally at these points the film tends to lapse into sentimentality and vagueness. It is annoying when it does so and it can be seen all through the film right up to Prot's slight smirk in the last shot.The cast do try reasonably hard despite this material. Spacey is a bit too wooden and he doesn't really help the film deliver this sense of mystery and mental complexity ? from his performance he seems sure that he is an alien, end of story. With this one-note performance he does what the film deserves but doesn't make it better (which he can do to a film). Bridges reverses his Starman role and does well enough. He delivers mixed feelings and is more interesting as a result. The starry support is impressive but generally they don't have a lot to do even if the presence of McCormack, Woodard and others is good. Fans of the Wire will welcome Gerety but lament Peters not being given more as he is a very good actor.Overall then a so-so film. It has enough to be of interest to a good range of viewers but it doesn't do that well with it and floats into vagueness or sentimentality regularly. Any actual movement in one direction is delivered with a wink to the audience to keep the mystery but this is tiresome after a while. Worth a look I suppose but not as good as the heavyweight cast would suggest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>we watched a DVD of this movie which had been recommended by a friend. Altho the mental hospital patients were certainly "idealized" the movie was fairly enjoyable up until the denouement, starting with the hypnosis sessions. Prot and Robert Porter were one and the same and this is my first real disillusionment with the film. Robert Porter was 31! and wonderful an actor as Kevin Spacey is, he is certainly not 31. As other viewers have said Prot was a disassociated "friend" of Roberts. Remember under hypnosis he said he just was there when Robert needed him?. Probably the first time at Roberts fathers funeral. At this point in the hypnosis Robert/Prot was speaking in a very little boys voice. so even if Roberts father had taught him about astronomy how much realistically could he have taught when Robert was 3 or 4? O.k. another really big flaw. Even if all the stuff about K Pax was out of left field Robert/Prot was an individual of great intellectual abilities, so why even at the age of 17 would he have had to have a job as a "whacker" (I think that's what they called it) in a cow killing factory? Here's a really petty, but to me, a very annoying (and unnecessary fault) when the Doctor and the sheriff visit Robert's abandoned house where the murders took place; the house looked like it had been unlived in for 105 years, not just 5! An even more egregious and really cheating element was the scene in the Museum of Natural histories' observatory when Prot was drawing the rotation of the suns around K pax and the scientists then plugged in the coordinates. An honest movie maker would be intelligent and brave enough to have a straight forward explanation for his characters. So as Robert/Prot was acceptably intelligent and loving and traumatized, tossing in that observatory scene, his missing 3 days from the hospital (was he really up that tree the whole time) and Bess' absence later are really asking too much of any observant audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Without Spacey, this would be direct-to-video junk (4/10)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening is so creepy, I was soured on the rest of the movie. I get the impression that this story was written backwards from the premise that a guy that claims to be an alien will change the life of a shrink. Since the harmless little goofball doesn't want (or seem to need) help, then why would he keep seeing the shrink. Well, we'll just lock him up . ..In the opening scene, Spacey (playing Prot, as we discover his name later) just appears in the middle of a New York City commuter rail terminal. He is a bystander when a little old lady gets her purse snatched. When the police question him, he calmly explains that he is from another planet. So far so good. But then THE POLICE ARREST HIM, CONFINE HIM FOR THREE WEEKS, AND SHOOT HIM FULL OF THORAZINE. Holy Cow! This kind of treatment of the harmlessly goofy has not even been seen in the wildest fantasies of Mayor Giuliani. Used as a throw away plot device, this kind of action is just creepy.We then meet Bridges (Dr. Powell) the shrink. Jeff must have had something in his contract that said something like he refused to portray an overworked, underpaid social worker. So instead, we see an obsessive, wealthy shrink that the City of New York has somehow forced to see this loveable goofball that they locked up in the scene before. So we get to see Bridges in a crisp shirt and tie in a spacious high-rise office that has, for some reason, something that looks like a pharmaceutical lab in the middle of it. I guess this is supposed to look "serious" and "scientific", but I fully expected one of the little geeks in white lab coats to come running around the corner with a smoking beaker full of blue stuff that the shrink could use to cure every psychotic in the world.The middle of the movie is pleasant enough, but there is not much to it. So we get to see a very long sequence where Spacey is riding in a cab. Some wonderful electronic trance music is scored and we get to see some beautiful shots of lemons falling out of boxes, but it was all just beautiful filler.Finally, I won't give the ending, but suffice it to say, the writer either has to decide that Prot is an alien or he is a human. The writer did not have the guts to follow through with the choice made throughout the last half of the movie and waffles at the end. Sigh. A fitting ending to not much of a movie.</fullReview>

Jeff Bridges goes through yet another frantic slow-motion run at the film's climactic moment (thankfully he doesn't emit any strange squeaking sounds or gasps this time). Even the filming style and the visuals struck me as very poor, and I thank my lucky stars this was a rental and not an (increasingly expensive) wasted trip to the theater.

It has a few clever lines in it, and a few scenes designed to provide a little momentary surprise, but they never go anywhere and seem like cheap tricks to try to keep interest. This is a movie in search of an identity, with little consistency. Very few clues were offered for the central plot of the movie, 'is he an alien or not'. And of course the ones offered are contradictory. I admit the possibility that maybe I just didn't understand the movie, but it seems to me right now that it's a movie comprised of seemingly disconnected events.

		<fullReview>I could not believe how uninvolving, uninspired and miscast this film was. I had high hopes going in because I am big fans of both Bridges and Spacey. And once again, Bridges does yeoman like work in a jumbled screenplay, trying his hardest with what he's given (Blown Away, Arlingon Road, The Contender, etc.) Spacey is one of America's greatest actors. Ive had the pleasure of seeing him live onstage in two different productions and his work in Usual Suspects and American beauty and L.A. Confidental are fine portraits of incredibly complex people. But here he seems lost - he plays just one note, with his head tilted to one side, a slightly bemused look and a wry smile. (There's also a lame plot point that makes him cover his eyes with dark sunglasses most of the movie.) But whenever Hollywood tries to make mental illness look like this interesting, magical possibility - is he really a space alien or just nuts??? - they usually drop the ball (see Used People or Dream Team - just kidding, don't - they are horrid). In fact, only King Of Hearts and Cuckoo's Nest have successfully used the arena of the mentally ill to pull off their stories. If you have seen the trailer for this movie (the trailer works) then you have seen every clever, funny bit in the film - everything else is expected and simple and boring, so by the numbers that it makes you wish the whole movie was sent into outer space, never to return.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the worst movie I've seen all year, even more disappointing because of the good reviews it's gotten. It is a series of obvious cliches, one piled inexorably on top of the other. Awakenings, Patch Adams, Cuckoo's Nest, and particularly The Fisher King have all presented this material before, not always more adeptly, but a fantasy movie depends on originality to succeed. When the plot themes are all tired, it becomes a soap, which knows that its unsophisticated audience will look past the fifty-third evil twin in order to get its daily jolt of tinkly-piano'd emotional thrill.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A laughable reincarnation of E.T. flying over the "Donnie Darko" s nest.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>- This film really made me laughed. Because you can't take it to seriously. From the 1st scene in the NY station, the story looks so little plausible. An investigation about the identity of a guy called Prot will lead us to a supposedly thought-provoking quest. Please understand me, this film might appeal to you, it really did not get to me. If you have not seen the film, I suggest you do not read my comment, and if you have, then share my very subjective opinion.- Dr. Powell, a psychiatrist, tries to cure an enigmatic mental patient called Prot claiming to be an alien who will soon be heading to his planet K-PAX. Is he what he claims to be (possible considering his unexplained super-intelligent abilities) or is he just a damaged person living out a dissociative delusion (possible too because of psychological reasons).Despite troubling elements, the psychiatrist favors the second solution especially after he uncovers a man of similar description named Robert Porter who suffered a trauma five years earlier, the same day that Prot is claiming to be arrived on earth. But the patients of the hospital love Prot and seem to recover thanks to him. The investigation about the real identity of his patient will also help the workaholic psychiatrist redress his own failures in his family.- How will you reconcile these 2 contradictory views : Alien or suffering from delusion ? Guess the answer : we are left asking after a resourceful ending.- As Dr. Powell struggles with his own sense of reality, we are also asked to question ourself how this unconvincing drama will lift up our spiritual and reconsider our social beliefs. I am still asking too. The biggest outrage of this pretentious film is to make you think that you must have missed something big because you find the story so murky. - The film failed to move me because I cannot believe any situations, some moments were so predictable (don't tell me you did not guess that Mark Powell would not meet his son at the end) and performances are just clichés (especially people at the hospital and the wonky hypnosis sessions), the acting is both contrived and "already seen" and the luminescent cinematography doesn't make up for the clumsy script. My biggest disappointment however lies in the fact that the film wants to have its finger in more than one pie : an underlying criticism of curing mental illness and an apology for better social human contacts but it fails to give any valid answers. The film is even very prejudiced against mental ill people sometimes insinuating that mental illness is just a result of social ills. The film aims at being manipulative like "A beautiful mind" but it seems as if I could never bite (why should I care for the guy in New Mexico ?). The end becomes submerged in suggested moralistic overtones. The supposedly ambiguous ending come after so many evidences for both interpretations that you are bound to believe that Hollywood wanted to make a cross of Donnie darko + Pay it forward +"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" + E.T. + a few other ones- I love films that tackle sensitive issues that challenge our perceptions of reality : If you want to see more convincing dramas of this type : Please see "Donnie Darko" or even " With a Friend Like Harry..." . Far far better to my mind..Oh yes I have forgotten something very important : Besides, the film is a real bore to watch. - TO SUM UP : A PARADE OF BADLY USED MANIPULATIVE GIMMICKS AIMING AT TURNING THE VIEWER INTO AN INSANE ALIEN (3 out of 10)</fullReview>

Too bad the makers of this film chose to lie to us and change the movie in a way that altered the plot . In the trailer Prot is asked what his name really sounds like . Prot then offers a very deep and inhuman collection of sounds that could not come from a human . From this I was led to believe that Prot was in fact an alien .When I saw the movie at a local theater I was shocked to discover that this scene was conspicuously missing . Despite his astronomical knowledge the certainty of his heritage is back in question .Don't lie to us . We hate that . If he talks like an alien then show us .And another thing . The people that are in mental institutions are not wacky or quirky .They certainly are not anything like the inhabitants of this facility that Prot visits . What they experience is unspeakably horrifying . To create the illusion that mental illness makes you amusing and comical is a sin that should land you in a real mental institution for a few months . Maybe then you'd realize that their plight is one of worst things that can befall a human mind . It's not an amusing escapade that some bluebird or cute maxim will solve . You should be ashamed of yourselves .There are dozens of other reasons why this movie is vacuous pap . But my spaceship is ready . Good day to you .</fullReview>

Good start!Though there is a little more to it than what I just mentioned, that was pretty much the whole movie. And the ending is highly predictable: **SPOILER** In the end he leaves and everyone finds out something about themselves and life in general. Really!?I was really hoping the movie would take me somewhere I hadn't been before. (And I'm not just talking about planet K-PAX) But if the movie had some type of twist or event that intrigues the audience. Too many movies just simply end and then the characters all reflect on what's really important in their lives. Contact was great; I never thought that she'd actually go to another world. But in this movie, it just ends.....I guess you could say this was one of those movies where more could have been done. I'm not saying make it as unpredictable as A.I.

		<fullReview>Don't be fooled by all of the positive reviews surrounding K-Pax. It's a trick. Sure, watching Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges spar with each other is probably worth the price of admission, but the story is not.Spacey plays Prot, a mental patient that knows things he shouldn't know about space, life, and, of course, love. Bridges plays a director of a mental institution who is trying to crack Prot's cool exterior. Is he really an alien, or is his just a very convincing delusional? The movie has fun playing with the notion and leaves the ending open enough for you to come to your own conclusions.However, the route K-Pax takes from Point A to Point B is wholly stupid and insulting. Particularly scenes involving the other mental patients. This movie depicts them meerly as eccentrics who need love. Not real people with serious problems. This cutesy portrail is what is most insulting about K-Pax.Also, the insipid dialouge. During a scene where Bridges has Spacey under hypnosis, other scientists monitoring Spacey shriek "Look at his heart rate, man! You've got to bring him back!" when Spacey begins to resist violently to a line of questioning. Please.K-Pax is nothing but simple popcorn entertainment. If you end up walking away with some profound understanding of life that you didn't have before you went in, then you need to visit the real world a little more often.</fullReview>

But the story gradually becomes a drama, rather sentimental, and with the nth advice about how we're supposed to live our lives.No doubt about it, the presence of Spacey and Jeff Bridges is the strong point of "K-Pax": they didn't make the best work of their careers, but it's always a pleasure to watch them.In short: a script full of stupidities that's expected to be something transcendental and serious, but the truth is that turns out to be too long and has too many ups and downs.PS: By the way, which movie did they stole the soundtrack from? *My rate: 4'5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the most notable thing about this movie was the fact that Samir from office Space played a neurologist of some kind. I was amazed at Samir's knowledge of the human brain and it's tendencies, especialy among mental patients. Samir must have gone to Med school after getting fired from Innotech. This just makes me wonder more what Michael Bolton is up to these days. Did he go to med school with Samir? perhaps law school? We all know that Peter from Office Space decided to travel back in time and fight in WW2, a poor choice compared to Samir, especially considering that Peter is fighting along the lines of super P-bomb Ross from Friends. Anyway, another thing about the shotty mental hospital was that The Big Lebowski played the psychiatrist. Where was goodman? So you have Samir, a former computer nerd and Dude from Lebowski handeling the sick minds of the mentally ill in NYC? Crazy, just crazy. What's next, LaVorgna from 7th heaven as chief cardiologist. Spacey was good, although it was way too obvious that he was indeed an alien. They should have left some guesswork at the end. It was like they tried to do that but just failed. Perhaps they left some people guessing, but if you have even an ounce of common sense or Hollywood knowledge you know Spacey was from K-PAX. I heard that they initially planned on using Richard Simmons and calling the movie GAY-PAX, but decided against it because it tested as too gay with preliminary survey groups. I'd see K-PAX just because of Samir. The man really got his life in order after leaving Innotech and you gotta hand it to the guy. My only beef with the movie was that there was no flashy breakdance scene like Samir pulled in Office Space.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An insulting waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While most movies in their attempt to depict psychiatric treatment are mostly inaccurate, K-Pax breaks every rule from its very first scene. In this fantasy New York, people need not demonstrate dangerous behavior to be committed to long term inpatient psychiatric care, and while in this care they have ample access to letter openers, shoelaces, glassware, and scores of other self-harm tools. These units also believe in hypnosis as a legitimate therapeutic intervention, and clinicians discuss their personal lives with patients and even introduce them to family members.Unfortunately, the center of the movie is the so-called mystery of Prot's identity. At times each answer seems so obvious, but then the movie completely changes its mind and the audience is asked to believe the completely opposite explanation. Rather than being ambiguous, the plot ineptly lurches from idea to idea, with little rationale to link them. A few people might find this intriguing, but mostly it becomes more and more tiresome.The movie was made with a loving eye, and the cinematography is lovely and expertly done. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the acting. Jeff Bridges has two expressions: "befuddlement" and "intense concentration." Kevin Spacey acquits himself without too much embarrassment. The rest of the characters are ciphers, with one or two distinguishing traits which must substitute for personalities.I suppose this movie has a "message" -- something about living every day to the fullest, and loving one's family -- but, honestly, it has been done better in a Lifesavers ad. Watch that, and spend your free two hours with your family doing anything but watching this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>bad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie will appeal to those who are very dense and need to be told about the misguided path of humanity. This movie will appeal to nihilists who get simple pleasure when the superficial world is clued in to obvious concepts, though the concepts are lessons in 7th-grade-stoner skepticism towards humanity. This movie is dumb. Suspension of disbelief was about nil for me and the mental patients are ridiculous caricatures. Kevin Spacey's character is sarcastic and spiteful of those who don't ingest his every statement as fact, yet he claims to be from a place where no crime is ever committed. Clearly the roots of sarcasm and ill-will have the same origin though they are but degrees of meanness. This movie is way too preachy. I can't believe the critical acclaim it got. Even the IMDb staff gave this kudos, despite the fact that it's Hollywood drivel. To imagine that a truly great film like Hurly Burly got lower reviews... -'I wish I was like you,easily amused....'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MORALLY IRRESPONSIBLE!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the acting is great and the premise is fascinating, the film-makers are morally irresponsible by contending that the right cure for mental illness is simply a matter of picking yourself up by your own bootstraps (e.g., Prot's explanation to the doctor regarding mental illness and the nature of the three tasks). I am not aware that anyone has recovered from OC by looking for a bluebird! This film is highly prejudiced against people who suffer from mental illness by attempting to affirm that old, worn-out joke "it's all in your head" and thereby asserting that mental illness is simply a personality flaw. The film-makers need to abandon their Victorian mindset or, even better, do the mentally ill a big favor and stop writing about things they don't understand and obviously didn't bother to research. The cinematic value of this film (which I believe is very high) is offset by its barbaric misconceptions. It's also highly derivative of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975), perpetuating its 26 year-old stereotypes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where is it written that in order to make an intelligent film, you have to disguise it as a piece of schmaltz? K-PAX, however, takes that principle and puts it in reverse. It's a schmaltzy film disguised as utter brilliance. It fails so badly at both, it makes one long for the intelligent aliens of The Day the Earth Stood Still and ET.Kevin Spacey has never been an actor to appear on screen as one just doing a role to collect a paycheck. That's fine, early in your career. Here, he is so boring as a mental patient who claims to be from another planet (or is that the other way around?). At least he doesn't claim to be of higher intelligence to his other aliens. Jeff Bridges gets another opportunity to show his acting chops, but he is given very little to do. He is an Academy Award Nominee instead of a Winner for a reason. This role will do nothing to further his career nor his stature.the story is so paint by numbers. Setting the film in a mental ward doesn't do it any favors, either. The supporting cast doesn't belong in this movie, but they could make their own and it would be one thousand times better than this. Quirky supporting characters are a dime a dozen, but these were more interesting than the leads. Oh, wait. We saw them before in other movies. Never mind.K-PAX is designed to get those who fester into the theater and feel some kind of wonder. The wonder felt here is when is it going to be over? </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Ask Why</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whenever I see Kevin Spacey do a movie, I usually get anxious because of how great of an actor he is. But, watching him in the movie K-PAX made me think of how much he seemed like an adult version of Haley Joel Osment in A.I., with Jeff Bridges, I thought that he (Jeff) seemed liked Kevin Costner in Field of Dreams because he was searching for answers about the planet K-PAX.Kevin Spacey plays an alien who comes to earth in a dirty form and is brought to a mental institution. He is studied by a doctor played by Jeff Bridges who starts out as a person who is just interested in the home of the alien and later on after knowing the alien a lot better, becomes more of a sensitive person. The alien promises that sometime in July when he returns to K-PAX, that he will bring an earthling with him. So he spends time deciding.Movies like this come at least 10-20 times a year and at least half entertain an audience. With K-PAX, an audience will just fall asleep or see the movie only once and end there. I know that when I saw it, I was expecting a typical Kevin Spacey movie rather than what the director had put on film for us. A good example of a movie that is just like this is Cocoon because: Alien arrives, has a good time, and says its goodbyes and everyone becomes sad including the audience. So, I would not recommend K-PAX to anyone who is reading this review.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe how many people on the IMDB gave this movie a good review! Are they that starved for a slightly thoughtful movie that they confused this cliched piece of trash for a good movie? Not only was this movie completely unoriginal and predictable, it was also poorly written and boring (I watched it on a plane and frankely, looking out the window was more interesting than watching it). All the characters (especially the people in the mental facility) seem like they belong on a sitcom. Just plain awful. 1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that this movie was going to be about aliens. I love all the movies related with Aliens, but this was just a stupid and boring film about some mad guy that pretends to be an alien, and about some morons that believe that he is actually an alien...This stupid premise sounds like something made for a comedy, but this movie takes this stupid plot way too seriously, and that's why this film sucks.Don't be fooled by the premise of this film: This movie is not about aliens, or anything related, it is only a boring and typical melodrama without anything interesting about it.If you want to see a good movie about aliens, see "Avatar", which is a much better film than this boring waste of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Look, in these depressing times, I can understand why some people would look to some escapist fun as the perfect antidote. In fact, I would like that myself, but this movie isn't it. There is no comedy here ,unless you count eating the entire banana funny. It was funny in the commercial, but that's it. Nothing happens for the first hour, PERIOD. Then finally, in the last 30 minutes they try to cram in a drama about what traumitized the Spacey character, but it's too little too late.Go see Spy Games instead, or rent E.T. for a heartwarming alien flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Sad...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The concept of the film was intriguing enough to convince me to watch it, but it turned out to be awful. I found it neither profound nor breathtaking or anything except disappointing, and here's why: First of all, it isn't mysterious at all: Kevin Spacey is actually the alien he says he is. If he isn't were did the other person go? Second of all, all that discussion is only a thin veil for some very arrogant Darwinists to propagandize the audience. After spewing some ridiculous evolutionary junk, Spacey's line is something to the effect of, "Everyone knows that; it's common knowledge." As if anyone who believes differently is just small and stupid. I shouldn't be surprised though. Darwinists seem to spend more time teaching people that Creationists are idiots than they do proving their beliefs. As a Creationist myself, I can still enjoy it if a Sci-Fi movie can present their beliefs in a more open-minded and tolerant way, but K-Pax has no tolerance. (I think the film Contact did a much better job of this, even though the religious people they depicted were fanatics. Sad to say such people probably would act the same, once again giving us true Christians a bad name.) If you are looking for a deep, intelligent, and intellectually honest Sci-Fi film, watch just about anything else. Even "Killer Klowns From Outer Space" is better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am still fuming over the time I wasted watching this movie. The movie has some mildly funny moments - and I stress *moments* - but is achingly slow, patronizing, insultingly predictable, and has a plot that is fundamentally flawed. The more I think about this movie, the more irritating it becomes. Do yourself a favor and watch something else.</fullReview>
