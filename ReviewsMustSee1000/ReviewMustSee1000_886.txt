		<shortDescription>Altman's lost dream sonata</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have spent a grown lifetime seeking this 1972 Altman dreamscape, and lost all hope when a friend reported that the director told a Q-and-A audience that Columbia had mistakenly destroyed the negative. A specialty store in Santa Monica somehow found a video copy, and it was worth fifteen years' wait. Suggestive of the tinkling, misted-over fugue states of QUINTET and THREE WOMEN, IMAGES riffs lyrically off Polanski's REPULSION. Where Polanski's film is pitched somewhere between sixties horror and the dry joke-telling of Bunuel, Altman's version is lush, druglike, sensuously baroque. Susannah York plays a children's writer in a remote Irish cottage who seems to be spending too much time indoors. (Were the movie not lost in obscurity, you might think her an antecedent for Jack Torrance and Barton Fink.) As she copes with the would-be-regular-guy puttering of her schmucky husband (Rene Auberjonois, in a role rightly intended for Michael Murphy), two other loathsome men flit into her life--the husband's buddy, an Irish lecher played by Hugh Millais, and a seemingly dead ex-lover, played by Marcel Bozzufi. As these men appear to bleed into one another in York's mind, so do they soon start bleeding into the cottage's Persian rugs.IMAGES defines Altman as the freest and most fearless of all American moviemakers. Most critics only stand behind Altman's we-are-the-people movies--his community mosaics. But he clearly is as passionate about mapping inner worlds as outer ones, and these Expressionist chamber pieces are his most feckless works. The movie is also a reminder of what Altman lost when he stopped hiring Vilmos Zsigmond to shoot his movies. Almost no one on the planet has such an intuitively graceful and expressive shooting style, but Zsigmond's stunning work here--among his finest--reveals that it's a long walk downstairs from Zsigmond to the likes of Jean Lapine. And note should be made of the work of the youngish composer who wrote the elegant, sinewy, restrained score--a decidedly non-bombastic, anti-symphonic fellow whom we now know as John Williams.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant, Chilling, Lost Treasure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Under the assumption that Altman was creatively peaking between the years 1970 and 1975, (I realize this is debatable) I sought out every film that was made during that period. Surprisingly, I could not locate the brilliant, chilling lost treasure that is the film "Images" it seemed to have simply vanished into history. Although Susannah York deservedly earned best actress at Cannes for her performance, and it was sandwiched between "The Long Goodbye" and "Mccabe and Mrs. Miller" this film, like "3 women" and "California Split", remain mysteries. Luckily, "Images" was released on DVD this past September. I immediately bought it without a second thought. I am very thankful that I did.Images is one of those gems that make you appreciate cinema, directors and the creative process in general, because of the exploritive potential within the medium. Dredging up the inner fears and archetypes of the subconscious and weaving together what comes to the surface synergistically is Altmans vision in this film. Sadly, lately, film is about loud bangs and shiny things and very few adroitly capture the lost art of character development. "Images" seems to be one of those films that could only have taken place in the early seventies. During the era of psychedelic drugs, the film indubitably feels as though it is on some kind of mind altering substance. It is completely trippy and unnerving. Logic seems to have flown out the window from the onset of the story. I won't give anything away, because you need to go into this film knowing nothing, or little to nothing about it, and just enjoy the ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Altman Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most compelling films I've seen in a long time. I wasn't sure if I was in the mood for a serious "psychological thriller" but this movie held my rapt attention until the very end. A brilliant example of just how talented Robert Altman is as a filmmaker. While most people pigeonhole him as "that guy who makes the movies with the large ensemble casts and lots of overlapping dialogue", this movie finds him working with a cast of six, and most of the action takes place within the heroine's head. Beautiful (of course) photography by Vilmos Zsigmond is just the icing on the cake. Don't miss this forgotten treasure by an American master.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an art film that experiments with dreamlike imagery. Many viewers might turn it off in frustration within twenty minutes,but I couldn't take my eyes off it. Altman's film plays with the idea of showing us the mind of Cathryn as a display to observe. We get twists upon twists and it's done in such a labyrinthine maze. We have no foundation to stand on,her mind just keeps feeding us hallucinations. I was compelled throughout the whole film taking every frame into my mind. It is one of the strangest,most fascinating portraits of the mind that I have ever seen. It just never stops delivering puzzling images and the film takes no shape depending instead on surreal happenings. This is Altman's artifice..he simply provides twists to keep us wondering what will happen next. As characters come and go,we are left wondering what will pop into her mind next.My favorite Altman film..a mesmerizing masterpiece of the disturbed mind and what can fluctuate from it. *****/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Idiosyncratic masterpiece, even for Altman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Early one morning about two months ago, I watched IMAGES for the first time; it's still a movie memory that haunts me. The empty house I was in seemed to grow more and more cavernous as I took in this unforgettable story of a woman whose guilt and grief are driving her further into a stark inner world of madness. Yes, there are similarities to Polanski's REPULSION and even to Antonioni's BLOW-UP (in shot composition); but that is not to say it lacks a feel all its own. Altman shows his typical good judgment as a filmmaker, employing Vilmos Zsigmond as cinematographer, shooting in Panavision with rich, saturated colors oozing through each frame. He was also wise to get John Williams to compose an even-then atypically noisy score, for which the film garnered (wrongly) its only Oscar nomination. How Susannah York escaped at least a nomination as the film's star and co-writer is beyond me; her performance is one of the greatest ever committed to film. She truly seems confused, horrified, and at her wit's end. Her screams will pierce your soul. I can say more, but I will leave it at this: IMAGES is Robert Altman's neglected masterwork, a film that will scar your mind, if you have the strong countenance to endure it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>IMAGES (Robert Altman, 1972) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An arty horror movie is the last thing one expects from Robert Altman - although, apparently, he had already tried it out with his earlier, little-seen THAT COLD DAY IN THE PARK (1969). The writer/director (itself an unusual combination for Altman, but it shows how strongly he felt about the project) himself does not think of it as such and, in any case, reviews at the time were decidedly mixed.Even if he was "inspired" by Ingmar Bergman's PERSONA (1966), the film actually feels closer plot-wise to Roman Polanski's REPULSION (1965). Originally intended to be shot in Milan with Sophia Loren, the film definitely benefits from its picturesque Irish locations and Susannah York's fragile performance (which eventually earned her the Best Actress Award at Cannes) as a schizophrenic; she, too, was unusually committed and actually allowed a story for kids she had written - called "In Search Of Unicorns" - to be incorporated into the narrative!The film features only five major characters and, interestingly, these are named after each of the actors themselves: so Susannah York plays Cathryn just as Cathryn Harrison (Rex's daughter, a very natural performer who later featured in another strange film - Louis Malle's BLACK MOON [1975]) plays Susannah; Marcel Bozzuffi's character is named Rene', Rene' Auberjonois is Hugh and Hugh Millais is Marcel! Of course, all this fits perfectly well with the film's theme and the characters' penchant to exchange 'faces' with each other in the mind of the disturbed protagonist; actually, this concept is pretty frightening because the lead character at one point decides to get rid of her 'ghosts' - but, not having a complete grasp on reality, one is never sure whether the victims are mere figments of her imagination or else real people! Also essential to establishing the film's unique mood is Vilmos Zsigmond's stylish cinematography and John Williams' stark yet evocative score (interspersed with eerie sounds provided by Stomu Yamash'ta, a Japanese sound designer); even though his work here is galaxies away from Williams' renowned anthemic scores for the likes of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, he still managed to earn an Oscar nomination for it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Altman manages to weave an exceptional psychological tale about a schizophrenic (Susannah York) and the visions (which may or may not be real) which plague and haunt her. York gives an outstanding performance. Film was precocious in 1972 and remains one of the best psychological thrillers ever. The scenery is gorgeous, and York's full nude scenes are also appealing eye candy.***1/2 out of ****MPAA: Rated R for some graphic violence, and for nudity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant and disturbing journey inside one woman's mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Images" is another great movie from the master of the living paintings, Robert Altman. It is a brilliant, scary, beautiful, and very disturbing journey inside one woman's mind that was leaving her as the movie progressed. What we saw was not a ghost story but a very real descent to the world of nightmares and monsters that would not stop torturing the struggling and guilty mind for a second. Susannah York as Cathryn, a young, beautiful writer who tries to finish a children's book in a remote country home is simply breathtaking. She carries the movie (which only has five characters) almost by herself and being present in every scene, she is equally sympathetic and frightening. In his interview on DVD, Altman mentioned that he had started making the movie in Milan with Sophia Lauren. As much as I admire Lauren, I don't see anyone other than York playing Cathryn. While watching her, I kept thinking of her Alice in Pollack's They Shoot Horses, Don't They? (1969). Alice, one of the participants and victims of a killing dance marathon, loses her mind by the end of the movie and the scene where she breaks down mentally, was heartbreaking. Altman himself reminded me of the witches from Shakespeare's Macbeth that would throw all kinds of ingredients in their cauldron. The director mentioned how he would add the new details to the script as the real life situations changed: York was writing the children's book about Unicorns at the time - we can hear the long parts of her book in the background. I am not too crazy about the book but the idea seems to be brilliant. York had informed Altman that she could not make the movie because she was pregnant but Altman just decided to add her pregnancy to the script. There is some dry humor in the movie - all five characters have the first names of the actors who played them: Susannah played Cathryn and young Cathryn Harrison plays a girl named Susannah, Rene Auberjonois, Marcel Bozzuffi, and Hugh Millais played three men in Cathryn's life - Hugh, the husband, Rene - the neighbor, and Marcel, her dead lover (who was quite alive for a dead man, at least in her memory). John Williams wrote an absolutely unforgettable score for the film (it is not a melody, rather some strange, persistent, scary, and disturbing sounds - very experimental at the time, it is still quite unusual). As for its visual site - the film that was made during one wet November in Ireland is brilliantly dark and hypnotizingly beautiful. I am jealous of everyone who was able to see it in all its glory on the big screen at the theater - it would be impossible to forget. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Composite Images</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Altman's generally thought of as a weak visualist, his films messy, shapeless and dialogue driven. This is not quite true. And even if it were, there has always been another side to Altman; films like "3 Women" and "Images" single him out as a strong surrealist, adept and spooky imagery and menacing atmosphere. Indeed, "Images" sometimes seems like it was ghost directed by Roman Polanski or Luis Bunuel.The plot? Cathryn and her husband Hugh spend a few days in a spooky country house. She suffers from delusional disorder, "images of past lovers" spontaneously popping into her head. Like Altman's "3 Women", there are hints of temporal displacement, characters merging and occupying the same spaces or conversing with little girls who may or may not be their own younger selves.Is Cathryn crazy? Are supernatural forces at work? Is her mind being consumed by guilt? Why not all three? Cathryn seems to have had an adulterous affair with a French man called Rene. He died in a plane crash but returns as an "image" to haunt her. Meanwhile, Cathryn's infidelity is personified as Marcel, a large brute of a man who constantly tries to force himself upon her. Meanwhile Marcel's wife, an unseen character who we know had affairs, has divorced him, but not before having a young child, a girl who is herself the splitting image of Cathryn.Continuing with the theme of images, Cathryn's husband is a photographer whilst she is an author. The film's soundtrack often consists of Cathryn narrating one of her books, the audience forced to conjure up images to the words she reads.So what are we to make of this? Cathryn and her husband are image-makers. Cathryn, because of her overactive imagination, imagines that her husband is having an affair. These thoughts, fuelled by her own past infidelities, attack her as "images". In order to restore her sanity, Cathryn thus murders her "image" of Rene and her "image" of Marcel. Finally cured, she drives to her husband before encountering an "image" of herself on the road. The implication is that Cathryn must now destroy her "image", confronting the paranoid source of these monsters. And so Cathryn pushes her own "image" off a cliff. With this symbolic suicide, she is now free. But we then learn that the final "image" was not a self-image at all. It was her husband whom Cathryn encountered and murdered on the road. And so the film ends with a reversal of the classic Hitchcock shower scene. Cathryn faces a deadly "image" of herself; she is the monster, her delusions fragments of her own warped persona.Altman hints at this by naming his 5 characters after the actors who play them. They're not only "images", but "composite images". Marcel Bozzuffi plays "Rene", but "Rene" is the name of actor Rene Auberjonois who plays "Hugh", "Hugh" being the first name of Hugh Millais, the actor who plays "Marcel". Similarly, Susannah York plays "Cathryn", whilst the actress Cathryn Harrison plays a "Susannah".8/10 ? Eerily similar to "3 Women", this is essentially an art house thriller. The film seems to have inspired the end of Scorsese's "Taxi Driver", in which Travis Bickle famously sees himself in his car's rear view mirror. Altman's female psycho does this as well, complete with that familiar little audio zing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy and spell-binding Altman classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yet another film by Robert Altman that sadly languishes in obscurity, which should be a classic. It is a unique film and unlike anything Altman had done. Susannah York is excellent as Cathryn, a writer of children's novels who begins to suffer the worst form of psychosis possible. After going away with her husband Hugh (Rene Auberjonois)to her secluded country home in Ireland for the weekend, Cathyrn's hallucinations worsen. The film is a fascinating character study about her complete descent into madness as her own reality become warped with her delusional fantasy world. The cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond is dreamy and hypnotic with a score by John Williams that is haunting and atmospheric. The film makes many unexpected twists and turns that it would be unthinkable for me to give away. A lost classic that is worth seeking out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Altman's most satisfyingly challenging films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of 70's films and movies like Robert Altman's "Images" are a good reason why. This thoughtful and sometimes jarringly astute look into one woman's bout of schizophrenia is an actress's tour-de-force and a cornucopia of delights for the viewer. The always watchable Susannah York is the driving force behind this dream-like film that is not a narrative so much as a puzzle. From the film's opening shots, the audience is asked to participate in piecing together just what is going on with this young author who finds herself confronted with her real or imaginary past. Discovering what the images that assault her (and us) actually signify make for one of the best psychological thrillers since Polanski's "Repulsion." Unlike the films of today, "Images" forces you to watch, listen and seek the answers for yourself. A tip: 'You' and "Hugh" are sometimes interchangeable. Robert Altman is the best! Will someone PLEASE put "3 Women " out on DVD!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robert Altman's Subdued Movie About Insanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's difficult to explain exactly what makes Robert Altman's Images so enticing. I've never enjoyed his style or the few movies I've watched by him. But this 1972 obscure movie fascinates me exactly because it looks nothing like a Robert Altman movie. It's more of a cross between Ingmar Bergman (Persona) and Roman Polanski (Repulsion), and shows that Altman could have been a completely different filmmaker if he had wanted.Susannah York plays Cathryn, an author of children's books who starts having hallucinations and erotic fantasies involving past lovers, including a dead one. Finding her troubled, her husband (played by Rene Auberjonois) takes her to Green Cove, an idyllic mansion in a beautiful valley. But rather than easing her mind, this desolate place, full of painful memories for ever, only stimulates her deteriorating imagination.There's not much more to the movie besides this, which is why I'm amazed at how fascinating and gripping it is. If the slow, painful mental collapse of a woman fascinates you, you should watch this disturbing movie. For all its simplicity, it's quite complex and unsettling in a mature way.Marcel Bozzuffi, Hugh Millais and the young Cathryn Harrison (who'd be in an even stranger movie three years later: Black Moon) give very good supporting performances.Complementing the movie is also John William's creepy, eerie, slightly dissonant score, the unsettling sounds created by Stomu Yamashta, and the cinematography of Vilmos Zsigmond. It's a cliché to complain about what Oscars a movie should have been nominated for, but for me, more than John Williams, it's Zsigmond who deserved a nomination for his camera work here. The way he captures shadows, the way he shoots nature, showing it mysterious and menacing and at the same beautiful; the way it moves inside a room or across a landscape, contributes to what makes this movie exceptional.This is a masterpiece that deserves more recognition, and for lovers of weird, unusual cinema, it's obligatory watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated, creepy film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the 90s, audiences have been treated to a variety of "mind blowing" thrillers, films that make people sit up in their chairs and say, "what the hell is going on?" We've had JACOB'S LADDER, DONNIE DARKO, MULHOLLAND DRIVE... The subgenre culminated in the profoundly weird LOST HIGHWAY and the profoundly lucrative THE SIXTH SENSE. Now, as audiences wade through pale imitations like THE MACHINIST and THE NUMBER 23, it's good to go back to the roots of this strange breed of movie. Those roots would be IMAGES.IMAGES was a superflop upon release, and it's not hard to see why. With a bleak, dreary atmosphere, characters impossible to trust, and slow moody pacing, Altman wasn't trying to make the feel-good hit of the summer. Or even a film with stable logic-- every time a "rule" appears explaining what's going on, it's broken.Is Cathryn going crazy? Is her husband and his friends playing tricks on her? Is she being visited by spirits? Are figures and scenes from an alternate universe crossing over into this one? Or is something sinister disturbing the flow of cause-and-effect reality? IMAGES poses all these questions, yet answers none of them. There are no "twists", no silly contrivances, no deus ex machina moments to save the day and explain everything. No. This is straight up cinematic insanity, something even the noblest of mind-bending flicks fail to achieve (with the exception of LOST HIGHWAY).In the end, the audience is invited, by means of provocative images, to make sense of the film themselves. This is no easy task, which explains the godawful reviews bestowed at Cannes and in the American press. Over time, with a little help from David Lynch, audiences have gotten savvier at decoding nightmares of logic, and IMAGES has found its acclaim in an era where "Twin Peaks", "X-Files" and "Lost" make must-see TV, unthinkable decades ago.The acting is superb. The cinematography is perfect, capturing an ultra-creepy visual mood that contemporary filmmakers (such as Gore Verbinski with THE RING) aspire to, but fall short. John Williams' (!) score is a major asset, with sound effects of all types punctuating the mood like an impressionist painting.Depsite being clunky in parts, IMAGES is must-see film to appreciate the depth of Robert Altman, or complete your knowledge of mind-blowers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Challenging and compelling film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many film viewers consider Robert Altman as a director that allows his actors to improvise and then shoot around the loose ends and in most cases they would probably be right but this film is easily his most disciplined effort and the actors accomplished their job by sticking to the complex script. Story is about a woman named Cathryn (Susannah York) who is having a difficult time establishing what is reality and what isn't. Her husband Hugh (Rene Auberjonois) takes her to their home in the countryside of Ireland but she keeps encountering her former boyfriend Rene (Marcel Bozzuffi) who died three years ago and at times Hugh catches her speaking to herself.*****SPOILER ALERT*****One day Hugh brings home their close friend Marcel (Hugh Millais) and his daughter Susannah (Cathryn Harrison) and Cathryn starts to fantasize and/or hallucinate about the sexual triangle between her and the three males in her psyche. Finally Cathryn decides to rid herself of these images by killing them but she isn't sure which of these people are real or not.Altman fans frequently point to this film as his most polished piece of work and they may be right as not only is this technically superior but the actors are restricted to a very challenging script. This is a film that still has many unanswered questions when it ends and there are so many pieces of the puzzle left unexplained. Several clues are scattered throughout the film such as the jigsaw puzzle, the chimes, the dog, both homes, the camera, the mirrors, and probably many more. The cinematography is by the great Vilmos Zsigmond and he does two things splendidly and the first is capturing the beautiful and open countryside of Ireland. Secondly, he also shows that even in the vast landscape Cathryn feels claustrophobic and it's expertly shot with perfect composition. Susannah York gives arguably her finest performance and I've always been one of her biggest fans and I urge everyone to view her in "The Shout". While some compare this to Catherine Deneuve's performance in "Repulsion" I think it's very different and one cannot notice how energetic and aware York is in this film while Deneuve wandered around looking totally confused and even dreamlike. You can see York battling to win her senses back but it seems to be a lost cause and when the film ends it appears that she may have made a fatal mistake. Altman has also changed everyone's name around from actor to character and when you look at the credits notice how everyone's first name is flip-flopped. I wonder if this is a clue to the story or is it just Altman's wicked sense of humor? I definitely think that the young girl Susannah is a piece of the puzzle and it can't be just a coincidence that she looks exactly like Cathryn. Also, the story that Cathryn narrates during certain parts of the film is a real children's story that was written by York herself. Some viewers may find this to be totally baffling but for others that can enjoy an intelligent and challenging film they should definitely check out this well made psychological mystery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The mirror crack'd</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Altman's little-seen psychological thriller, "Images," takes on the plot of a woman working on a children's book. One night, she receives a series of mysterious phone calls from a woman who tells her that her husband is cheating on her. After the probability of this is dismissed, she retreats to a country farmhouse with her husband to work, where she is visited by a series of people from her past, as the line between reality and fantasy is continually blurred.Perhaps less thick with dream fog than "3 Women" but ten times more unnerving, "Images" is a film that truly hasn't gotten the audience it deserves. It's two parts art film and two parts psychological horror, while Altman toes the line the entire way through. Taking cues from Ingmar Bergman as well as Polanski, it's an incredibly bizarre film, especially when taken as a cohesive piece; but the real strength of it lies in the effective cinematography and the successive sequences that could almost stand as monumental short films all on their own. Slick cinematography amplifies the reality (or unreality) of the film, with characters changing bodies between shots, and Cathryn's husband walking through a swinging door only to return as her dead ex-lover. It's precisely this jarring technique that really make this work as a horror film and elicit true moments of shock and fear; we don't know what to expect from one moment to the next, just as Cathryn doesn't. It's a film of doubling, identity, and hallucination? Cathryn sits at the bottom of a waterfall writing, while the camera pans down river to Cathryn sitting on the edge of a bluff, watching herself write. Which Cathryn is the "real" Cathryn? Who is Cathryn? Is her ex- lover dead? Why have her husband's friend and his doppelgänger daughter come to visit? It's the these questions that haunt the audience throughout, and remain with you after the shocking final scene. Many have referred to "Images" as a portrait, even Altman himself, and I can think of no more accurate description. In many ways, it is a series of portraits; shards of a broken mirror that are haphazardly put back together. It's one of the most haunting and obscure films of the '70s, brimming with atmosphere, lush cinematography, and truly effective recreations of the schizophrenic mind. Susannah York's performance as Cathryn is the icing on the cake here, full of vulnerability and incognizant power. Fans of bleak psychological films will be particularly rewarded here, as well as admirers of Bergman and Altman alike. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating and Disturbing, Images Keeps You Guessing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Altman's engrossing drama Images stands alone in his vast collection of directorial achievements. Though he directed other intense dramas, this opus of unsettling psychological intrigue is about as far as one can get from his more familiar fare of offbeat comedies populated by equally offbeat characters. In a landmark performance that garnered her a best actress award at Cannes, Susannah York portrays Catherine, a troubled soul who desperately tries to escape her innate demons and memories of past relationships. Increasingly, reality and fantasy start to blur as Catherine develops a coping mechanism she thinks will solve her mental dilemmas. Unfortunately, there's an inherent danger in her method's madness. Images was beautifully filmed in Ireland by master cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond, and veteran composer John Williams provided the score. Altman protégé Rene Auberjonois effectively portrays Catherine's somewhat clueless but good-natured husband.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not really familiar with Robert Altman - I liked Gosford Park, but that's it. However, the plot summary intrigued me enough to check this long lost film.Yes, like all the other reviews say, there are obvious parallels with "Persona" and "Repulsion". It's the kind of movie that messes with your mind, and I love movies like this. I would like to add that the eerie, bizarre atmosphere of this movie reminded me of David Lynch.We see the movie through the eyes of a schizophrenic woman, and just thinking that someone in real life can go through this gives me shivers. It's also what I like to call a "hallucinogenic" movie, in which the dreamy scenery, the incredible camera work and the twisted dialogue play as if you were on a psychedelic substance.Susannah York gives a strong performance, and the beautiful Cathryn Harrison also make this movie worth viewing.If you like surreal movies, with a haunting atmosphere or psychological subjects, do yourself a favor and dig this good arty flick up. Others should not bother.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film does not represent what Altman is well-known for - community mosaic or documentary style films such as "MASH", "Nashville", and "A Prairie Home Companion". Instead, Altman extended what he tried in "That Cold Day In the Park (1969)" depicting the inner world of a psychopathic woman, but his approach here is more complex. In fact, the fragmented style of film is quite appropriate to portrait the shuttered mind of heroine.The use of sound and the double somewhat reminded me of "Meshes of the Afternoon (1943)" by Maya Deren. However, the visual style of this file is distinctively of seventies - beautifully shot by Vilmos Zsigmond. A mesmerizing film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I'm not going to be able to finish this puzzle...there are too many pieces missing."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Altman wrote and directed--and misfired--with this psychological thriller about a wealthy female schizophrenic. Susannah York, an interesting actress (though not so interesting as to make this artistic jumble take hold), plays the future author of a children's book about unicorns who is upset one night by repeat calls informing her that her husband is having an affair; she begins imaging other lovers in her husband's place, splintering herself off from reality. Gorgeous cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond, working the wintry landscapes of Dublin, Ireland with a painter's finesse, adorns the picture with prestige; however, enlightenment into our heroine does not follow. This is a rich person's prism, a slick fantasy of ghosts and musical chairs, the kind of which only seem to affect the well-heeled and bored. With two homes to vacillate between (and no pressing engagements), York's character begins to seem stultified rather than schizophrenic, and the scenario is underpopulated and lax. John Williams received an Oscar nomination for his percussive score, but nerves can hardly be jangled when the script is stuck in such a plushy muddle. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Awkward Attempt By Altman to Tackle the Psychological Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Altman applies the same widescreen canvas he had previously used to capture the chaotic communities of a Korean War MASH unit and a primitive Pacific Northwest mining town to the quieter but no less chaotic internal workings of a troubled woman's psyche in this unsettling and uneven psychological thriller.Susannah York plays Cathryn, wife of a distracted husband (Rene Auberjonois), whose affairs with two men (one a family friend) and her inability to have children become obsessive memories that haunt her and drive her over the brink of insanity during a stay at a quiet country home (the country is never identified, though the movie was filmed in Ireland). She begins the film as a wounded and hunted animal, jumping at every sound and image she hears or sees. One of her past lovers appears as a ghost, the other arrives at the country home with his daughter and gropes Cathryn when her husband's back is turned. The two lovers are vaguely threatening and abusive; her husband is dismissive and treats her like a child. Cathryn realizes that she can take control and kill off her unpleasant memories -- but at the same time she loses the ability to distinguish between reality and her own feverish imaginings.On a first viewing, "Images" is absorbing and oddly fascinating, but it doesn't hold up well. For one, Cathryn isn't a compelling character, and that dooms the project from the start, since there's barely a scene in the film that doesn't revolve around her. She begins the film unhinged and really has nowhere to go from there except more unhinged. We don't learn much about her, and her illness isn't placed in any context. Susannah York delivers a shrill performance, all screeches and irrational outbursts; the male characters all come across as asses. Altman seems to be trying his hand at a feminist text, but he goes about it in the clichéd way that male artists too often address "female" issues. I think he's making some point about the way movies objectify women, turning them into "images" for the consumption of male viewers. After all, Cathryn is little more than something for the men in the film to enjoy, and cameras figure prominently in the film's mise-en-scene (Cathryn's husband is an amateur photographer). At one point, she fires one of her husband's guns (that universal symbol of male sexual power) at the ghost of her dead lover, and finds that she has instead destroyed her husband's camera. Nice try Altman, but awfully heavy handed if you ask me.I'm a champion of Robert Altman's films, and he's never failed to fascinate me with any of his experiments, but such is the nature of experimenting that some are going to succeed more than others. "Images" came on the heels of a marvelous trio of films ("MASH," "Brewster McCloud" and "McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller") with which Altman announced his arrival as an important figure in American cinema, and he would follow it with four more ("The Long Goodbye," "Thieves Like Us," "California Split" and "Nashville") that would reinforce that claim, but "Images" itself is a weak link in the chain.The stars of "Images" are the mesmerizing production design and the sterling cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond.Grade: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Altman's lost state of mind. This movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Altman doing a psychological horror film. Hmm, okay, seemed interesting. After all, the creator of "MASH" and "The Player" was talented and courageous enough to helm a film of almost every genre available, with limited resources and presenting his own method of cinema: free of rules, realistic, artistic and almost always fascinating despite the lack of audience for the majority of his works. Drama, comedy, sci-fi, musical, thriller, film-noir...you name it: he made it all. Unfortunetaly "Images" isn't the kind of film where I can say I was enthralled or deeply invested. It was too much on and off, with wonderful sequences put together with prolonged dreary moments that managed to obscure its qualities. The final scene comes and you wondered how simplistic and off-putting most of the film were. Susannah York plays Cathyrn, a children's book author in need of peace and quiet to finish her latest work, and those solitude moments will be find at a country home along with her husband (Rene Auberjonois). Well, not really. As the days move, she sees strange visions that disturb her peace and sanity, or the least of that she still has. From strange phone calls telling her husband is having an affair to appearances from a ghostly former lover (the always effective Marcel Bozzuffi); strange noises and occurrences; and the odd behavior of a neighbor/friend of the family (Hugh Millais) who happens to be a former lover of Catheryn and who still feels a deep attraction to her, so peculiar and intrusive to the point of the man seducing her while the clueless husband is on the room next to them. Are those visions and scenarios real or imagined? And what are they're meaning to the woman? Sane or going crazy? We go to movies like this to find out how it all gets together. The problem with "Images" is that, after years of watching horror films or even psychological thrillers one gets easily fed up in seeing clichés after clichés. I was remind of the brilliant "Repulsion". Some parts brought me minor memories from Louis Malle's surrealistic tale "Black Moon" - it gets even more coincidental that Cathryn Harrison (she plays Millais' daughter and Catheryn's only ally) stars on both Malle and Altman films. The visual, the concept, the presentation...it all feels made before - but you can argue that "Black Moon" in that case was the copy film because it got released later, but the order when you watch is how it affects the experience or the enjoyment. Sure, it's edgy, filled with suspense and shock, Vilmos Szigmond's careful cinematography and John Williams' appropriate (though not memorable) score are first-rate. It thrills. However, I always think that a horror film can only succeed if the drama is good. Otherwise, you're just wanting for everyone to die or get killed because there's not enough room to make you invested in their story, in their problems. It must have a great dramatic element, with some life relevance or slightly believable. "Images" almost got there. It's easy to say that Altman was portraying a bigger-than-life idea of what schizophrenia might be with the duality of real vs. imagination, and the consequences it leads when those clash at each other with just one person having to deal with both sides, not knowing how to act or cope with their current reality. That's great drama. It only gets wronged and confused due to a mumbled presentation, that doesn't satisfy neither fully convince, and the whole children book narrated by York (her own real creations) were awfully distracting. The movie feels more concerned in terrifying than giving us a relatable story - and a movie has to be both. It helps a lot. The whole time I kept wondering how low in self-esteem Cathryn must have been to get involved with three misogynist, self-absorbed jerks. Instead of pouring the odd horrific elements from time to time, Altman should have insisted in developing little by little, just like he does in the menacing phone-call scene (that was genius!) than evolves but the drama keeps on real throughout. It was too bizarre seeing the ghost coming and going, then one face changing to another. If schizophrenia goes like that, and in such a hurry and state, then I guess the movie succeed in its portrayal. Another touch of genius from Altman is with the characters/actors names traded: Susannah plays Cathryn, Cathryn plays Susannah, Rene plays Hugh, Hugh plays Marcel and Marcel plays Rene. I'd like to be on this film set and see how communications worked between them - must have been hilarious specially if there's method actors involved. The performances? So and so, nothing so brilliant and York only got Best Actress in Cannes due to lack of good competition. Final verdict: a few years from now and I might rewatch it and find more rewarding qualities. As of now, it goes as one of Altman's most disappointing efforts but far from worst. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>York's performance, the locale and Williams' score .....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dear Robert Altman, Images was a relentlessly eerie and occasionally scary film about the mental disintegration of a woman. I liked the atmosphere that you conjured up with the help of the beautiful Irish countryside and John Williams' unusual but ultimately melodic background score. I decided to watch the film because of Susannah York whom I found adorable in The Silent Partner. Images is not the sort of film I would normally watch. I was not enamored by it. It is a psychological horror film that can be compared to Bergman's Persona or Polanski's Repulsion. I would not recommend it to fans of regular horror films. It is quite dumbfounding on occasions - like when Susannah York's character stares at a car arriving at the countryside mansion from atop a hill. And the woman who steps out of the car is well ..... herself. The film continues with the newly arrived York entering the house and going about things. The men (two of whom could be York's hallucinations) in the film are all lecherous and I was thinking that maybe the film might have a feminist message. That York's character might have become damaged by the men in her life. York is sexy as a woman who is in denial about her own sickness and conveys the feeling of disarray perfectly. I am not sure what it all means. But it was engaging because of York's performance, the locale and Williams' score. Best Regards, Pimpin. (6/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a trend-setting thriller as a sound testament that Robert Altman is a virtuoso all-rounder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shot in Ireland with only two major locations and a micro cast of six, Robert Altman's IMAGES is a visually innovative, narratively intriguing and thematically cohesive probe into a woman's slow descending into schizophrenia, with a phenomenal leading performance from Susannah York (crowned BEST ACTRESS in Cannes), which also revealingly exhibits Altman's protean sleight of hand.York plays a minted woman Cathryn, a children's author who is currently writing a new book named IN SEARCH OF UNICORNS, which is in fact written by York and Altman applies its text extensively in the diegesis, notably in paralleled with reality, to emphasize on Cathryn's aberrant mind composed with her own imagination. After disturbed by a ostensible series of prank calls and the startling illusions of her dead French lover Rene (Bozzuffi), Cathryn and her husband Hugh (Auberjonois) retreat to her country house where she grew up, a bucolic haven with mountains, cascades and a herd of sheep. There they also reunite with their common friend Marcel (Millais), who is also Cathryn's old-flame, and his teenage daughter Susannah (Harrison), yes, the first names of the five main characters are coined according to the real names of their co-stars. But illusions are tailing her, she sees a double of herself and soon will be embroiled into the complicated sex entanglement with all three men, obviously Rene is dead, Hugh is real, and Marcel seems to be real too, but what about his aggressive intention to get intimate with her, is that also real?Determined to get rid of the bedeviling hallucinations, Cathryn executes "corrective killings" to regain the grasp of her senses and secure her marriage, after two apparently successful clearance, it seems that she is back on the right track to normality, but a fatal third action will prove everything has gone awry, a chilling ending reveals that schizophrenia has completely seized her psyche.Shot by the late maestro Vilmos Zsigmond, IMAGES exhibits his nimbleness of lurking his camera within a confined space, and the surreal segments are fantastically otherworldly, namely, the sex scenes rotates among Cathryn with her three different mates are aesthetically uncanny, and strategises crystal chimes as an indelible cue to provoke Cathryn's delusional condition. John William's eerie score portentously captures Cathryn's emotional upheaval and the mysterious atmosphere, and earned him an Oscar nomination (after all, the movie is not entirely snubbed by the Academy).Susannah York, occupies almost every single scene of the movie, stoutly calls forth the most daring performance of her lifetime, perpetually tormented by apparitions and descending into her own segregated universe with no one to turn to, she feistily fights a losing battle all by herself, it is a helluva display of bravura to behold, where the final revelation in her shower scene is so powerful that it is evocative of her terrific Oscar-nominated turn in Sydney Pollack's THEY SHOOT HORSES, DON'T THEY? (1969).Overall, IMAGES can be read as a think piece against the overlooked symptoms of mental illness, and a trend-setting thriller as a sound testament that Robert Altman is a virtuoso all-rounder, and left us so many cinematic legacies to hold in esteem!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very rarely do I find a film that becomes more fascinating each time I watch it. Robert Altman's Images is a masterpiece, a truly unique and experimental work of art. It's hard to put into words the experience of watching this film. It has a strange, mesmerizing quality and leads the viewer into a state of confusion as one falls into Cathryn's inner world. Altman's clever direction creates an undercurrent of fear that leaves one unsettled throughout. The jarring score is both unnerving and at times, beautiful. So many different elements combine to create powerful visuals that leave a lasting impression. The use of light, the location shots of Ireland, nude tones in sharp contrast with harsh, autumnal scenery. Recurrent themes such as wind chimes and the integration of Susannah York's children's story heighten the allure of this mysterious film. It's a mystery, a puzzle, unlike any other film and leaves the viewer under its spell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Imperfect, but fascinating, complex early Altman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a a film I'll definitely watch again. I have the feeling it could feel even stronger on repeated viewings. A character study of a schizophrenic from inside her subjective point of view, so the whole story is told by an unreliable narrator. Some fascinating moments, and good tense twists as we (and she) wonder what's real. The film isn't wildly stylized, so the line between hallucination and reality is truly, effectively blurry. On the other hand a lot of the style feels awkwardly dated, and some story elements feel manipulative and not easy to believe. For example, she's very obviously a potentially dangerously disturbed woman, but her husband seems to barely take that in. Even if he's the supercilious prig that Rene Abougenois plays him as, his complete ignoring of her state feels like a cheat. And some twists just feel like they were 'a cool idea' at the time, but not rooted in deeper character or story elements. A little like Nic Roeg, but not at his very best. All that said, certainly a must see for any Altman fans - it's not quite like anything else he ever did - although '3 Women' could be seen in some ways as a more mature follow up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a great psychological thriller by Robert Altman. The plot is about a schizophrenic woman that struggles against herself to kill "images" in her mind of things and people she doesn't want to remember. She's a writer and she does books for kids but in the story she imagined, about an enchanted forest and the search for Unicorn, she has the main role... It's a story that only exists in her mind but has terrible consequences in real life...This movie is quite surrealistic and the dementia of the main character takes us into a weird, confusing and upsetting story. It's not easy to follow due to its complexity but I think the movie has a linear plot. The happenings succeed in a linear chronology in spite of the schizophrenic and surrealist ambiance this story has.The cinematography is quite good, with a nice camera work (shots/plans) and the shot of beautiful images (the landscapes for instance). The musical score is also good with some creepy and frightening string sounds.I score it 8/10 for the weird and surrealistic story and also the beautiful cinematography.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Images is a fascinating, and at times, disturbing opus about a woman's struggle with mental illness. It is certainly one of Altman's most unique and haunting films, and one that almost demands to be seen more than once because of its many nuances. Susannah York, an actress who rarely, if ever, turns in anything but an accomplished performance, is at the height of her abilities in the lead role. Taking the psychological journey with her is a roller coaster ride of bizarre sights and sounds that will challenge even the most savvy of film viewers. What's more, it is beautifully photographed in Ireland by veteran cinematographer Vilmos Sigmond. Good luck trying to catch it, however, because it's not on video and, to my knowledge, is never exhibited.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Either mind-bending or mind-boggling. Take your pick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And my pick is the latter. "Images" seems like an experiment in opaque "art" cinema that Robert Altman just wanted to get out of his system relatively early in his career; so he throws in just about every bizarre shot and incident he can think of, without much regard for internal coherency or logic. The puzzle IN the film gets completed, but the puzzle OF the film never does. The film is similar to the following year's "Don't Look Now"; in both cases you have to sit through a lot of rambling pretentiousness to get to an admittedly memorable shock ending. Susannah York's performance is excellent, but that book she reads aloud from (and apparently wrote herself) should be enough to send any kid or adult to the nearest madhouse! ** out of 4.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Psychological English Fog</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An audacious title for a film? But ultimately a playful rather than presumptuous outing. Well, as "playful" as a trickster god can be with one of his subjects, or as a filmmaker can be with the fragile psyche of his subject.The "images" in the film often settle on glass objects, several times focusing the frame on a camera's lens to make the symbol as transparent as can be. We are reminded that how we see things, the medium we look through, is crucial. Thus how the main character, Catherine, here views the world is shown to be unreliable.The suspense of the film mounted strongly for me in the first half, it avoids being a mere whodunnit in favor of whodonewhat, if anyone did anything. Susannah York I thought was excellent as the jittery lead, and having her cast as a children's fantasy writer was a nice touch. Somehow that made her seem more susceptible to madness and a break from reality. Her psychosis seems to have a sexual link, if that pushes your buttons.Reading in bits of her fantasy over the film might bother folks (those who hate any sort of narration), but here the fact that the narration has nothing to do with what is on screen again underscores that sort of madness. We all have been doing one thing while thinking of another, but by and large the doing part is dominant. Here the dubbed in narration makes it feel like the thinking is eclipsing the doing.The male characters all have a seventies stiffness, especially Rene Auberjonois who seemed like he was taken from a cassette on how to talk like and be a successful US businessman. Not sure if that bugged me as much as trying to place him as the younger version of the shape-shifting Constable Odo. Allegedly Altman wanted Sophia Loren once in the female role, but I think York was the better choice, as her sultriness unwraps itself more surprisingly. Sophia's genie would be hard to keep in the bottle.Overall a pleasant surprise to me, the video quality of my rental from Netflix was not as splotchy as others' copies, but the idea of this being a good rainy day watch, I'll second. The first half was an 8, the second a 6...so...7/10 Thurston Hunger</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating account of one woman's descent into psychotic delusional world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a true film oddity. There are only five principals and it is rather dark, albeit fascinating. Basically it details a weekend in the life of a young British woman who is slowly descending into a world of psychosis, illusion, hallucination and schizophrenia. Although all the patterns suggest childhood sexual abuse as the traumatic cause of her condition, this is never explored. Cathryn has an annoying husband, a friend of the family who has had an affair with her behind her husband's back, and a dead former lover who visits her as a ghost. We see the delusional world through her eyes, with each abusive, boring or controlling man alternately taking over the bodily presence of another until she begins a determined spree to reject and symbolically "kill" her oppressors. The world of reality/illusion blurs constantly during this intriguing film and Ms. York is at her very best (she won the Cannes Best Actress Award for her performance here). Another highlight is the score which earned John Williams an Oscar nom but which is more the work of Stomo Yamashta whose Japanese percussive instrument work is reminiscent of Kabuki Theatre music. One of Robert Altman's first films, it deserves to be seen by a wider audience and certainly by anyone entering or in the field of psychiatry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misperceived pieces in images, sounds and puzzles of a life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very fortunate to see this film in a good 35mm scope print at the Cleveland Cinematheque as part of an Altman program of 14 films from the '70's. The print is indeed rare; when Altman was being interviewed he expressed surprise a print had been obtained, remarking if the showing had not been the same evening as the Golden Globes, he might have come to see it! As it turned out, while IMAGES was playing in Cleveland, he was receiving a Golden Globe for best director for GOSFORD PARK.If you want to go into this film relatively cold, you might best stop reading here. You can read the next three paragraphs before getting to any real spoilers.The title says it all - if you can't perceive images correctly, you're not going to survive very long, physically, emotionally or psychologically. A lesser additional title of *sounds* would fit also. Altman became interested in recording techniques at a young age. I would think he had a fair amount of input into the recording, even though John Williams is listed for original music and conducting and Stomu Yamashta for percussive instruments.At opening varied camera lenses are seen in the flat , along with a number of mirrors. Doubling &amp; trebling of images occurs throughout the film and the setup is there at the first. Although you tend to trust your eyes early on, you wonder about Cathryn's ears as there are phone sequences when she appears to know the person on the other and then have no idea who they are, and another bit where the person on the other end seems to suddenly not know Cathryn's voice. Let's just say something is obviously awry rather than get into any attempt at diagnosis. It is, however, interesting when she hears the voice at the other end say that if people don't want to be disturbed, they take the phone off the hook. Cathryn takes that to heart, and when her husband returns he finds not one, but *all* of the extensions off the hook.A recurring image is the rear-view mirror ornament - something like a glass windchime with organically as opposed to mechanically shaped glass parts. I wonder how many sets of wide angle and telephoto lenses Zsigmond had as his disposal, for just with this one motif, the windchime is 1) sometimes in focus along with everything else in the field 2) sometimes out of focus with other objects in focus 3) in focus with other objects fuzzy. Telephoto lenses are used effectively from the point that Cathryn is dropped off by her husband at the top of the hill. Before she walks down, she sees another woman at the house and the camera zooms down to see that is it her. This doubling, or splitting, happens a number of times.Another image doubling occurs when the child Susannah gazes into the window of a car where Cathryn is sitting and you see Susannah's reflection effectively merge with Cathryn's face on the other side. It might be well to note here that the given names of the two women actors are switched for their character names (Susannah York = Cathryn; Cathryn Harrison Susannah). There are an odd # of men in the cast, but each of their names is also shifted.As to how and why she "kills" 4 people (if she does), one of them already dead (if you thought THE UNUSUAL SUSPECTS had an unreliable narrator, Susannah York has done Kevin Spacey one better!) well, it's not hard to say *how*, it's just that you need corraboration from some other source before you can let yourself believe what you're seeing. As for the *why* - as Renoir said "Everyone has his reasons." Cathryn is not unaware of her problem, either, as her questions to Susannah about other's locations indicates. But awareness cannot solve the problem. She may perceive one character talking but then in a moment, it's not that character, but another. The dialogue has some interesting double entendre also. Cathryn's husband has been trying to shoot some game birds on the property without much success. He and his friend (Susannah's father) go out to shoot together and on returning Cathryn's husband tells her his friend "doesn't have any luck with birds." If you're aware of the slang meaning of "bird" in British/Irish usage it's ironic that his friend seems to be having quite a bit of luck with a "bird" in the house. Another time one of the men calls the other an "old crotch" as in "crotchety" and in context the comment takes a marked sexual meaning.There is a jigsaw puzzle that Cathryn is working on and Susannah offers to help when she arrives. Cathryn's technique is to put the borders together first, because then it's much easier to get the rest right. Susannah eschews the easy way and wants the challenge. This may be an allusion to Cathryn's difficulty with borders - sexual abuse can often be a component of Borderline Personality Disorder - whether this is in her past we can only surmise. Partway through the film Susannah says the picture can't be finished - pieces are missing. Cathryn returns momentarily with a small box in which, we find at the end of the film, were all the missing pieces of the puzzle. Not so neatly found are all the missing pieces in a life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Altman isn't a director that you would usually associate with the horror genre - but that was what made this film all the more intriguing for yours truly. However, while Altman takes obvious influence from Roman Polanski's Repulsion - an idea good enough to spawn a good horror film and ambiguous enough to be given a different slant to the original - Altman's film really didn't do much for me. The plot concerns Cathryn; a housewife who visits a 'weekend cottage' with her husband. However, while at this tranquil location; she begins seeing various apparitions, and proceeds to kill them off one by one. The film slots into the 'slow burn horror' niche, and while this sort of film can often produce good results, this one doesn't generate a great deal of interest and as intrigue is key to the plot, it all falls down. The film deserves some plaudits for the fact that it's all of a very high quality; Altman's direction is generally strong and he gets good performances out of his cast, but this doesn't count for much when the film moves at a snail's pace. Images tends to get good ratings across the board, so perhaps I've missed something and my criticism is misplaced - but I doubt it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Out of Her Head and No Where to Go</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Altman created the greatest film about madness ever made. It is called "M*A*S*H," and it is MUCH better a "head study" than this rather pretentious swill. Actually, "swill" is too harsh; "Images" is better than that. It boast fine performances, eerie sound effects and lots of atmosphere. It's just not very interesting. Like Jack Nicholson's doomed character in "The Shining," Susannah York's character is just too far gone in the beginning for either her or the movie to develop. This lack of development eventually becomes tedious, which undermines what could have been a shock ending. Wanta see something better along the same lines? Try "Mulholland Drive," which manages to be both compelling AND suspenseful.I give "Images" a "6," and remind Altman he STILL hasn't made a better movie than "M*A*S*H".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Foul Images</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Against the backdrop of the beautiful Irish landscape, a writer confronts the demons in her head. Nestled between two of Altman's masterpieces, "McCabe and Mrs. Miller" in 1971 and "The Long Goodbye" in 1973, is this pretentious nonsense from 1972. This is a common trend with Altman, whose films veer from the sublime to the ridiculous. In this, as in "Three Women," Altman seems to be doing a bad Ingmar Bergman impersonation. The script (by Altman and York) and direction are both indulgent and tedious, not to mention the annoying story that York is working on that we are subjected to passages from; the weird score does not help.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best film about looniness that I've ever seen. I quite enjoyed this when first released and was happy to find that it was just as riveting on tv a couple decades later. Susannah York is as gorgeous as ever. ('Sorry to creep out you kids.) All excellent films seem to have slow spots, and I'd say the section about York's ex drags a bit, but that just let me get some more popcorn. I'm no big Altman fan but I sure was happy to see a film that made me think for a change (which is something that I sorely needed at college.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DVD Release is long overdue!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie around October 1997 on the German TV Channel ZDF, and it was so great! First of all, the wonderful cinematography, the excellent acting, music etc. The psychological potential of the script is so high it will really make you wonder for days. A DVD release of this masterpiece is long overdue, in my opinion!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has anybody even heard of this gem?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like so often with Robert Altman's movies, his films are either quite bad or terrific (not counting the mid-90s onwards, when everything he touched was crap). "Images" is one of his best movies.There is much to recommend here. First of all, the eeriness Altman creates shames 99% of all horror films - and this isn't even a proper horror film, but more like a drama with a strong "Twilight Zone" touch to it. No time is wasted here; from very early on strange things happen. It's a psychological horror/drama that will keep you guessing -until the decidedly UNhappy ending.I have no idea why this movie is both hard to come by and totally forgotten. Instead, whenever Altman's name is mentioned, we hear how great "The Player" is supposed to be. That movie is mediocre. Forget "The Player" and that moron Tim Robbins; instead, check out "Images", "3 Women", "Vincent &amp; Theo", and of course "M*A*S*H*", to see Altman at his best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant, Haunting, and a film you do not forget......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all Altman film's, Images has had the most influence on my life. I have never forgotten how I felt when this film ended the first time I saw it in 1972. It may have been the time in my life, getting into grad school, falling into an unrequited love affair with a fellow student, Nixon winning the presidential election by a land slide, all of these events caused a great deal of stress in my life. Seeing this film, with its bizarre and convoluted protagonist slipping ever deeper into her mania, created a kind of "perfect storm" of weird mental anguish for me. Not that my issues culminated into anywhere near the problems that poor Susannah York must face in her headlong descent into insanity. Images, with the murders that do or do not happen, the shockingly beautiful location on the English coast, the disturbing and compelling sound track and Altman's unique skills as a director, combine to give the viewer a spellbinding cinematic experience. See this film. It certainly, in my opinion, ranks with Mash, Three women and the Player as my top most favorite of Altman's. To this very day I cannot see a glass wind chime without this film coming to mind. A 10++ on my film scale..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Important Rediscovery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am continuing to fill in my Altman gaps. Images is another striking, important, neglected film, although about as different as you could imagine from my other recent Altman rediscovery, A Perfect Couple. One of the ways in which it is different is subtle. A Perfect Couple is a "sport," both within film history and within Altman's oeuvre. Its closest filmic relations, and they are not even that close, are with other Altman films; but essentially, it is out there on its own, a glorious oddity, of uncertain parentage and with no progeny.Images, despite its obscurity and persistent non-availability, is situated quite differently: it is connected in a dozen ways to other films and film-makers; it has obvious parents and children; it is deeply embedded in both film history and its particular cinematic moment.Images focuses intensely on the mental breakdown of an upper middle class woman played by Susannah York, and takes place largely at a remote country house in a magnificent landscape (it was shot in Ireland). Psychological thrillers and psychological art films were something of a rage in the Sixties and Seventies. Altman has admitted explicitly that Bergman's Persona was his starting-point and is in "the DNA" of Images. Patrick McGilligan in his Altman biography Jumping Off the Cliff states that:"Altman has said that, with Images, he wanted to make a Joseph Losey- type film. Losey was one of those few film directors, like Huston and Welles, whom Altman would admit to admiring."Losey, a great and singularly under-rated director, is worthy of Altman's admiration, and Images indeed bears the Losey stamp. It also has a good deal of Polanski in it (Repulsion, Rosemary's Baby; there are also strong affinities with The Tenant, which postdates Images).A line can be drawn from Images, backward or forward, to almost any film that depicts mental instability largely from a mentally unstable protagonist's point of view (Barton Fink and A Beautiful Mind, to cite two wildly different examples).McGilligan also positions the film in a quartet of Altman projects having to do with unstable women: That Cold Day in the Park; Images; Three Women; Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean.Another affinity is with other highly polished, stylized, sharply and precisely visualized and auralized films: Losey fits there, so does Nicolas Roeg, and I was strongly reminded of Fassbinder's Chinese Roulette. Images, like Chinese Roulette, uses plenty of glittering glass, mirror, and crystal imagery. The cinematography of the justly celebrated Vilmos Zsigmond is eye-popping, both in the tricky-to-film interiors and the hypnotic landscape exteriors.Images also shares its DNA (love that phrase of Altman's!) with, and perhaps even exerted a direct influence upon, Peter Weir's Picnic at Hanging Rock, made just a few years later. Images might very well have played theatrically in Australia; a number of Altman films seem to have had better distribution abroad than in the United States.Altman never made a visually and dramatically tighter film than this; his famed looseness is nowhere in evidence. With a cast of only six and the isolated setting, Images does play like one of Bergman's famously tight chamber films; it's reminiscent not just of Persona in that respect, but also of Through a Glass Darkly, Winter Light, and others.The actual title on the film's title-frame is "Robert Altman's Images," which is a gambit reminiscent of Fellini and is as acutely self-reflexive a title as any film-maker has ever dared. "Robert Altman's Images," indeed! That's a signature card for his entire work.In an interview on the Images DVD, Altman reiterates his frequently-made point that all his films are installments in an ongoing vision and that assessments of the installments as being higher or lower in quality don't matter much to him: if you're interested in the vision, you're interested in the vision, right? I think we should take Altman seriously on this: it is a challenge to us to re-frame our way of experiencing films. This is not to say that there are no differences of quality between films or that those assessments don't matter in some ways; it is to say that, once a director has shown their artistic distinction and their ability to control their projects without major compromise, everything they do is interesting and of value because it expresses their vision.Look at most of the directors mentioned in this post: Losey, Polanski, Bergman, Fassbinder, Coen, Fellini, Roeg, Huston, Welles, Weir (we'll leave Ron Howard out of it) -- all of them have tremendous artistic distinction, all control their projects to a very large extent (certain exceptions involving studio interference easily noted), and I would therefore advance the thesis that none of them ever made a "bad" film. We need everything they have done.This business of charting an artist's work strictly in terms of peaks and valleys is pop journalism, not serious criticism. Pauline Kael set the tone for discussion of Altman in her early reviews, which went up and down like a ping-pong ball; loved MASH, hated Brewster McCloud, loved McCabe and Mrs. Miller, hated Images (and at that point she said that since she had discerned a definite alternating hit/miss pattern, she couldn't wait for his next film). She continued on in that opinioneering way throughout his career. Kael wrote much that was interesting on Altman, but I would submit that as his biggest champion, she nonetheless misunderstood the actual pattern of his work pretty completely. Pauline Kael didn't care about Robert Altman's vision; she cared whether she liked the movie. That's a serious flaw in a critic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a minor work in Altman's cannon, but as minor works go they're rarely this intoxicating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Something like Images could only really come around in the 70s, which also explains how amazing it turned out. This is not any kind of 'commercial' picture, or whatever could possibly ever be for Altman (to put it another way, it is not Popeye). Images plunges the viewer as far as possible as a cinematic expression can into the mind-set of a schizophrenic. Or is she schizophrenic? We're never given quite the exact diagnosis, but at the same time I kept thinking "Ron Howard, take note this is *really* how it's done". Altman's protagonist is never exactly 'clear-headed', and so in the same sense neither is the audience, which is fascinating and challenging as a work of disorientating storytelling.This isn't to say that, occasionally, Altman gives in to some pretensions the likes of which I could only really see happening from a now "period piece" of the early 70s inspired by the likes of Women's Lib and Bergman's Persona and Repulsion (not to mention children's books). But for the most part Altman films this character piece as fluidly and with a level of concentration not any much more or less than his classics like Long Goodbye or Nashville or the Player. At the same time he uses such spot-on timing with the camera movements and zooms and pans and seamless edits in service of Susannah York's inner being, as opposed to just taking down a kaleidescope-vision or ensemble.Indeed that's one of the more interesting things about Images, is its lack of an ensemble; there's only about four or five actors in the whole movie, mostly with York and her husband out in a secluded house in the countryside visited only by a friend (who's also her lover) and his daughter... and as well 'visited' by an old ex Frenchman who was also probably her lover, at some time before he died. This is part of the intoxication of Images, how we're so bewildered by what may be there or what is, or how York's character's reactions to those around her only send off minor alarms and buzzes (by the end one wonders if her husband ever did find her crazy or not). This includes a series of murders which sometimes aren't real (i.e. gunshot, camera), and sometimes possibly are.And yet I don't want to make it too easy to give Altman all the credit; on the contrary without York and composer John Williams (as well as the sound-man on the film, I forget his name) it wouldn't be nearly as successful an experiment. York is so compelling as a being very fragile and hysterical and yet somehow sympathetic that it's a kind of little treasure of a performance that, sadly, was lost for many years before the film came back on DVD. And Williams, known always for stuff like Star Wars and Superman, marks a really compelling edge here with a lot of strange bits of string selections, stuff that could be conventionally suspenseful if it went a little longer or a little thicker in some sections, but as it stands is a fine counterpoint to Altman's direction. Altogether the daring script and direction (daring inasmuch as trying to film a subjective point of view with rarely a deviation or movement to comfortability), the acting and the music, combine to make a sublime, if slightly imperfect, work of 70s film art. 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's well-made but I cannot imagine that many folks would want to see this...I know I didn't.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Susanna York plays a woman who you realize very early on is a schizophrenic. What is surprising is that although she's completely out of her mind and actively hallucinates, her dopey husband (Rene Auberjonois) seems VERY slow to realize and accept this. But, as you see and hear the world through her perspective, it's obvious she's lost much of her contact with the real world. Her life is full of paranoia, delusions and hallucinations.There is a very small group of people who would enjoy this film or Roman Polanski's "Repulsion" (which is also about a woman undergoing a psychotic break). The two films are very similar but have almost no commercial appeal at all and are the sorts of film intellectual and film snobs would adore--but most folks would find terribly tedious. Even with my mental health background (having been a therapist and having taught psychology), I found the film dull and soon lost interest. I can respect what these folks did but that doesn't mean I have to like it or recommend it.</fullReview>
